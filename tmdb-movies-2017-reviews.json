{"author":"John Chard","content":"The Last Cut Is The Deepest!\r\n\r\nDid we need another X-Men movie? In fact did we need another Wolverine movie? Well the result is there for all to see, with Logan not only showing itself to be undoubtedly the best Wolverine venture by far, but arguably the best X-Men picture as well. If, as expected (and surely to god it's hoped so), this is the last we see of the grumpy metal clawed superhero, then what a fitting and triumphant bow out it is.\r\n\r\nJames Mangold, the director, has managed to create an adult superhero movie without it really being a superhero pic, for he has created a film noir Western that happens to be about a superhero. Mangold's love of noir and Westerns bursts from the screen, which for those who follow those wonderful stands of cinema, will come as no surprise having seen with notice his Copland and 3:10 To Yuma redux. There's a perpetual grimness to the narrative that belies the quite often stunning surrounding locales, heavy themes such as men out of time - with destinies written (cue a deft comic book movie within a comic book chunk of metaphysics) - surrogates, mental illness, human ignorance, and on it goes, the narrative strong on intelligence as much as it is in wrought emotion. Western fans will also be buoyed by the part that the 1953 classic Western Shane has to play in things, considerably so as its importance narratively, orally and visually is mightily strong.\r\n\r\nLogan's Run!\r\n\r\nAh yes, well being \"adult\" is all well and good, but is Logan thrilling? Do we get pumped up Wolverine action, blood brains, splatter and mucho muscle flexing and pained roars of anger? Oh yes! Action from the off is never far away, and wonderfully staged and choreographed it is. Lots of memorable set-pieces, while also some cleverly constructed sequences such as Xavier's mind seizures hold court and enthral. Yet the kicker with all that is we are clued in to the emotional baggage that the side-burn sporting protag carries with him. With each fight we sense the bigger picture, even as we watch in awe the emergence of Laura (ironic film noir name right there as it happens) - and her part in this very \"human\" story - the thrills and spills are propelled by a meaningful but battered heart.\r\n\r\nTech credits are superb. Acting honours go to Jackman, who after giving 17 years of his life to the character, gives it his all and this multi faceted performance, in a perfect world, deserves Oscar recognition. Patrick Stewart, also, is immense, playing the nonagenarian Charles Xavier with such class, gracefulness and storming emotion that one can only admire. Film debutante Dafne Keen as Laura is utterly engrossing, quite a debut indeed, whilst Stephen Merchant as albino mutant tracker Caliban is effective to the point we hanker for more. Although the villains fronted by Boyd Holbrook (rote henchman leader) and Richard E. Grant (smarmy scientist git) just about pass muster, there's nothing to damage the piece. Cinematography (John Mathieson) is \"A\" grade, the filters set on neo-noir, with the splendid film noir black and white version a fillip for the heart of noir lovers. All that is left is for the sound mix to boom and the director to steer with heart, brain and soul, without doubt both come up trumps.\r\n\r\nOne of 2017s best films, a genre splicer that ticks all the boxes of great film making. 10\/10","id":"5985a90c92514143810200ed","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5985a90c92514143810200ed","movie_id":263115}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A farewell and a welcome!**\r\n\r\nA perfect farewell to the only mutant who had solo films in 'X-Men' franchise. I never understood 'X-Men', I thought it was the worst superhero film series I've ever seen. But 'Wolverine' was the only reason I watched them all and particular, Hugh Jackman. There won't be Logan now onwards, though a set of new generation welcomed in this film, while saying goodbye to the old guys. So now what happens in the future of this franchise is a very suspense. Yet Logan had been the precious gem in the crown of 'X-Men', that mean it won't be the same anymore.\r\n\r\nAfter many years passed in the future, the last survivours of mutants hiding their identity and living among the humans. Logan and two others were attacked by the armed men when he decided to help a child mutant. Running away from them and looking for a place where they can be safe prioritised in the narration. More dramatised film in the franchise, but there are enough actions those who desire for that.\r\n\r\nIt's an emotional time for the hardcore fans of Logan\/Hugh Jachman. One final great performance by him and the little kid was also good. A well shot film, with minimum graphics and more realistic stunt sequences. Well, not all were real, too strong fights, too bloody, despite having a child actor in it. Yeah, it is a good film, I liked it, but not a masterpiece as you might have heard of. But anyway, it is a must see for the 'Wolverine' fans.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"596794dd92514132e1003e64","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/596794dd92514132e1003e64","movie_id":263115}

{"author":"Movie Queen41","content":"There may be some fine performances in this movie, but I honestly think the critics overrated this latest entry in the X-Men saga. The performances of Wolverine and Prof. X by Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are extraordinary. They create a believable and loving father-son bond between their characters, with Logan caring for the ninety year old leader of the X-Men after a horrible event occurs at the Xavier school the year before. Stephen Merchant takes over the role of Caliban from T\u00f3mas Lemarquis, who played the character in X-Men Apocalypse, and transforms him into an ally to Logan and Charlies. Merchant is quite good in the role. But what really dragged down the movie is its nihilism. The other X-Men are completely missing from the film and mutants have been wiped out almost completely. A sense of doom and hopelessness looms over the film. This movie completely upends the warm and hopeful epilogue of Days of Future Past, where the X-Men were restored to life and glory and mutants weren't extinct after all. Death seems to stalk Logan and Charles wherever they go. There is also a conspicuous lack of significant female characters in this movie, too. The only female of note is Laura\/ X-23, and she spends most of the film mute. There is also a complete lack of any strong or memorable villains. No one ever reaches the level of greatness like other X-Men villains such as Magneto or William Stryker. So, despite some good performances, this film is a bit overrated and also a little too bleak and depressing for my taste.","id":"58c34453925141239c000e72","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c34453925141239c000e72","movie_id":263115}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I believe that I am about to disagree with quite a few people now. You see, I did not like this movie.\r\n\r\nNot that this came as much of a surprise to me. What I got was pretty much what I expected. From a technical point of view the movie is quite well done. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are doing good jobs as always. The action scenes are good. The cinematography is not at all bad. If you are into tragic drama and do not mind the super hero twist of the movie then this is a movie for you. The technical qualities is why this movie gets any stars at all from me. If I would judge it by story only then it would have gotten zero, null, nada, nicths, rien, ingenting.\r\n\r\nFor me it was depressing, boring and not at all fun to watch. The only reason I watched it is because I, as a X-Men fan, simply had to watch it as well as having it in my collection but I would have been happier it this movie had never been made.\r\n\r\nWolverine is more or less an unpleasant drinking bum clad in filthy ragged clothes. Professor X is half insane and apparently dangerous to himself and the people around him. We get absolutely no explanation as to how this sad state of affairs.\r\n\r\nThe entire movie is dark in spirit with the X-Men all but died out and Wolverine and Professor X just waiting to die. Then in comes this female child who later turns out to be a female version of Wolverine. She pretty much lacks any form of charisma and she and Wolverine spends almost the entire time in a state of conflict, much due to Wolverine who seems to think everyone should go fuck themselves so that he can continue to self destruct.\r\n\r\nThe bad guys are the usual evil corporation doing experiments on X-Men, genetics etc. Supposedly they were behind the almost extermination of X-Men but of course they keep their own little army of \u201cenhanced\u201d humans that doggedly harasses Wolverine & Co. There are some nice action sequences but there is really no good overall boss. No one with enough Charisma to take the role of the main adversary unless you count X-24 who only took part in a few parts of the movie.\r\n\r\nBy the way, why the fuck do Wolverine, Laura as well as X-24 have to grunt like horny monkeys when they fight?\r\n\r\nThe story is rather predictable with no major surprises, little depth and low on logic. A typical Hollywood drama. Not really anything to write home about.\r\n\r\nThe movie is just so depressing from start to finish. As a last farewell to Wolverine and Professor X it is almost insulting. I know a lot of people seem to like it but I cannot understand why. At least not if you are a X-Men fan.","id":"5971f2c5c3a3684bfc007502","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5971f2c5c3a3684bfc007502","movie_id":263115}
{"author":"tmdb16528852","content":"One of the best and most mature Marvel movies to date.\r\n\r\nThe first half of this movie is a huge delight and a huge thrill. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are so entertaining to watch as characters they've known for 17 years. They've taken their characters a step further here in a script that allows them to explore themselves emotionally more than ever before. This movie is strictly part-drama. Yes, that's right. Finally, a Marvel superhero movie you can confidently stamp the drama genre tag on.\r\n\r\nThe effects, stunts and gore are really quite shocking. You can really feel the weight of each character's immense power, and more importantly, the struggles that come along with them. This further fleshes out each character.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts to lose the enjoyability of its ensemble halfway through, and what happens after is what you might expect from a typical X-Men film. Action, sci-fi and more action\/sci-fi. The villains are as interesting as they can be I suppose. They lack much development but are there to fuel the real story. Anyway, I can't say much else without spoiling the plot. I'll just say that I wish the movie would have taken a different direction.","id":"58e21cbb925141281900a93d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58e21cbb925141281900a93d","movie_id":263115}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Once he'd failed, can he be second time keep an eye on it.**\r\n\r\nAn intended emotional drama. You could see it from the very first scene itself. But the story had no innovation, just the characters and all the events surrounding them differently written. This is not a bad film, though not everybody would say they enjoyed it, so am I. I have seen many similar films with better appealing melodrama than this. I love tearjerker film, simply this was not my cup of tea. That is where I lost, despite prepared to have a great time watching it.\r\n\r\nApart from that, it was very slow and get even slower when tale progresses. Nearly two hours long and overall drags a bit with plain events. Luckily, there were a few course changing scenes that kept the film alive for me. Too matured storytelling with less background score and more sorrowful atmosphere. That means, it's a grownup's film with realistic narration, but build on a fictional concept and a fantasy theme. One thing you must understand that it is not a romance film.\r\n\r\nThe story of an insurance agent who recently widowed. He's assigned to review a patient who met with an accident, is now in coma. Like he's the chosen one, her spirit is visible only for his eyes. After the initial differences, they develop a certain bond as they meet every day. But after some time, the things complicate once the time comes to move on in the world. So what happens to them and other things are told in the remaining.\r\n\r\nThe actors were decent. I am only familiar with the actress and she was good. The actors looked okay. Almost 90 per cent of the story between their roles. Those extra characters really brightened the narration occasionally. Sometimes meaningful and inspiring. Like I said, this is a good film for families, but not for everybody. One of the major reasons was the conclusion. It was kind of expected, but also immoral act. Otherwise, I guess, I would have liked it better.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"596793119251413175003d47","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/596793119251413175003d47","movie_id":446138}

Was it you can shortcut your way to your dreams if you lie, cheat, and steal (as that was exactly what she did)? It wasn't about the pressures of class division (as a review I read states), as no one treated her as any differently regardless of her social status and any division she felt was just in her head. Her anxiety against her parents, the school, and the upper class of her school turned out to be non-issues, and when she got to where or what she wants, she just finds that the grass never gets greener for her once she was on the other side. In fact, she just becomes resented by those she abandons to get there and ultimately ends up longing for the side she left. \r\n\r\nIf anything the movie was saying that those who are rich aren't as unexclusive as those without think, and they are just like everyone else. Just as the main protagonist was rebelling against her life to gain acceptance, so were the kids of the rich in that they are also just seeking acceptance. That doing anything to get your dreams won't lead to satisfaction as life on the other side isn't any better, you just end up hurting others by getting there that way, and in hindsight blinded you from what you already had. \r\n\r\nI guess the movie had something to say after all.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Not dull, nor was it very entertaining.","id":"5a24615ac3a3680b9a0d882a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a24615ac3a3680b9a0d882a","movie_id":391713}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_A fascinating political allegory_**\r\n\r\n_Our emotional memory from our past trauma, the biggest of which was the Holocaust followed by our survival wars, this memory is stronger than any current reality and logic. I am not justifying our behaviour. I am diagnosing it._\r\n\r\n- Samuel Maoz; \"_Foxtrot_ is an allegory for Israeli society, trapped by its traumatic past\" (Kate Taylor); _The Globe and Mail_ (March 14, 2018)\r\n\r\nPart satirical allegory, part surrealist indictment, _Foxtrot_ finds writer\/director Samuel Maoz working with similar themes as he did in _Lebanon_ (2009); the ridiculous nature of war, the desensitisation of youth during wartime, the futility and meaninglessness of giving one's life in the service of one's country. However, whereas _Lebanon_ was set during the 1982 Lebanon War, and shot entirely from inside a Centurion tank, _Foxtrot_ is set in the present day, and expands Moaz's thematic concerns to take in the grief and anguish of those who have lost children to military service. Much like _Lebanon_, _Foxtrot_ is an intensely political film, and much like _Lebanon_, _Foxtrot_ has met with controversy and condemnation in Maoz's native Israel. Whereas _Lebanon_ was accused of attempting to dissuade young men from joining the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), _Foxtrot_ has been attacked for slandering the moral character of the IDF. A meditative and contemplative piece, heavy on metaphors, for the most part, the film hinges on non-action and passivity - the characters don't so much drive events, as events happen to them. Indeed, this is another of the film's themes - our inability to control fate (or, depending on your outlook, random chance). As with _Lebanon_, Maoz displays extraordinary technical proficiency and control of the medium, with the film as aesthetically impressive as it is politically divisive. A savage condemnation of both a national psyche and a military mindset that trades on the most binary of them-versus-us dichotomies and consciously strives to blur the line between personal honour and political ideology, _Foxtrot_ is not always an easy watch, and it's rarely what you would call \"entertaining\", but it's undeniably a brilliantly made and deeply passionate film.\r\n\r\nDivided into three distinct sections, the film begins with Michael (a superb Lior Ashkenazi) and Dafna Feldman (an equally superb Sarah Adler) receiving word that their son Jonathan, a conscript in the IDF, has been killed \"_in the line of duty_\". Dafna collapses, and has to be given a tranquiliser, whilst Michael goes into a kind of semi-catatonic state, barely registering what the casualty notification officers are telling him (apparently, he needs to drink a glass of water every hour; something they tell him about 15 times, even setting a reminder in his phone). As he slowly regains his faculties, however, he begins to ask questions - how was Jonathan killed, where was he stationed, is there a body - none of which are met with a straight answer. As Michael becomes more and more frustrated (a scene in which he takes his anger out on the family dog is very tough to watch, even though the violence is all suggested via sound effects rather than depicted on screen), the soldiers leave (reminding him to stay hydrated). Several hours later, another group of soldiers arrive to tell the Feldmans that their son is, in fact, still alive; a Jonathan Feldman was killed, but it was a different Jonathan Feldman. This news sends Michael off the deep-end, raging at anyone and everyone, and demanding that the IDF allow Jonathan to return home. The film then jumps several days back to a forlorn desert checkpoint on Israel's northern border (codename Foxtrot) manned by a group of unnamed wet-behind-the-ears soldiers, and Jonathan Feldman himself (Yonaton Shiray). The most action the group see is raising the barrier to let a camel amble through (in what appears to be a daily occurrence), and checking the IDs of the few Palestinians who are travelling the route. Indeed, the soldiers are more interested in the fact that the shipping container in which they sleep is slowly sinking into the sand than in anything military-related. However, when a mistake whilst checking the IDs of a group of Palestinians leads to tragedy, Jonathan comes to learn just how ruthlessly political the IDF can be. Without spoiling anything, the third section, which is kind of an extended coda, then returns to Michael and Dafna's apartment, six months after the opening scenes.\r\n\r\n_Foxtrot_ was inspired by an incident in Maoz's own life; 20 years ago, when his daughter was running late for school, Maoz refused to give her money for a taxi, forcing her to take a bus. Shortly thereafter, he saw on the news that the bus on which his daughter was travelling had been bombed, with no survivors. It was only several hours later that he learned she had missed the bus and was perfectly fine, but for those few hours, he thought she was dead. In Israel, the film was denounced by Minister of Culture and Sport Miri Regev, without her actually seeing it. Accusing it of being\r\n\r\n> _the result of self-flagellation and cooperation with the anti-Israel narrative,_\r\n\r\nRegev was furious that it had been made with Israel Film Fund money, vowing to change the rules of the Fund to exclude \"anti-Israeli films\". When it went on to win 10 Ophir Awards (Israel's equivalent of the Academy Awards), including Best Film, Best Director, and Best Actor, Regev was not invited to the ceremony. In response to her criticisms, Maoz stated,\r\n\r\n> _if I criticise the place I live, I do it because I worry. I do it because I want to protect it. I do it from love._\r\n\r\nRegev later argued that it was\r\n\r\n> _outrageous that Israeli artists contribute to the incitement of the young generation against the most moral army in the world by spreading lies in the form of art._\r\n\r\nSo what got Regev so hot under the collar? In _Foxtrot_, Maoz constructs an allegory through which he deconstructs Israeli national myths and self-aggrandising narratives. Interrogating what he sees as a culture of denial born from a reluctance to deal with the morality and sustainability of being an occupying force, the film gets a lot of mileage out of the metaphor of the foxtrot - a dance where no matter where you go, if you follow the steps correctly, you end up back at the starting position. Applied to Israel, or indeed, any nation, Maoz is suggesting that without taking great care, countries will repeat the errors of the past, ending up exactly where they once were. The film depicts three generations of Feldmans (Michael's mother (Karin Ugowski), a Holocaust survivor now suffering from dementia, Michael himself, and Jonathan) dancing the foxtrot (literally in Michael and his mother's cases), either unwilling or unable to face up to the country's violent and traumatic past. Tied to this is the metaphor of the sinking container, with one of the soldiers stating, \"_we'll end up sinking completely_\" - the world is off-kilter, and getting worse every day. Speaking to _The Globe and Mail_, Maoz explains,\r\n\r\n> Foxtrot _deals with the open wound or bleeding soul of Israeli society. We dance the foxtrot; each generation tries to dance it differently but we all end up at the same starting point,_\r\n\r\nwhilst he tells the _LA Times_,\r\n\r\n> _I won't be naive and say there is no social or political statement in my film. But it's more broad than specific. I don't have an interest in a realistic film about a roadblock. The roadblock is a microcosm of a society - any society - that has its perception distorted by a past trauma._\r\n\r\nIn a more concrete sense, in two scenes at Foxtrot, the film examines the casual sadism, unspoken racism, and braggadocious machoism that can arise from serving in the armed forces of a country perpetually at war. In the first (arguably the best scene in the film), the soldiers make a Palestinian couple stand in the pouring rain whilst their antiquated computer checks the couple's IDs. Obviously dressed for a formal night (he is in a tuxedo, she in an elegant dress), by the time the soldiers clear them to pass, their clothes are destroyed, as is her hair, and her makeup is ruined, with the soldiers even making her empty the contents of her purse onto the ground. The scene is brilliantly staged, agonisingly realistic, and takes place in real-time, with Maoz concentrating on the couple looking at one another across the roof of the car, conveying agonised helplessness, compromised innocence, understandable belligerency, and, most saliently, abject humiliation. It's a masterclass in dialogue-free storytelling, and deeply political storytelling at that. In the second scene, the soldiers act with violent impunity against a car of young Palestinians, although the act of violence itself arises from a mistake (to say much else would be a spoiler). Maoz also offers pointed criticism in a scene in the first section, when an indifferent and misogynistic officer from the military rabbinate (Itamar Rothschild) arrives to go over the funeral arrangements, condescendingly telling Michael, \"_a little smile can help you cope_\".\r\n\r\nAesthetically, as with _Lebanon_, _Foxtrot_ is fascinatingly staged. For starters, Maoz shoots each of the three sections differently, but in ways tightly tied to their thematic focus; the first is highly restrictive, trapping us in the confined ideological headspace of the Feldmans, with the intense emotionality constantly threatening to boil over; the vast wide-open vistas of the second part contrast sharply with the confinement of the first, with the entire section threaded through with surrealism and even a hint of magic realism; the third section is darker than the others (in a literal sense), with a stark visual design that emphasises only those elements that are important to the scene. A recurring composition in the first section is an overhead shot looking directly down on Michael, creating a (false) sense of omniscience. This is contrasted with the way Maoz often shoots Michael in tight close-ups, remaining on his face even when other characters are speaking. The Feldman apartment itself is extremely angular, and although it's very spacious, cinematographer Giora Bejach shoots it in such a way as to appear oppressively box-like (the fact that there is tempered glass on the doors, obscuring what's on the other side, is an important element in this). Boxes are emphasised throughout the film; the floor pattern of the Feldman living room, the container in which the soldiers at Foxtrot sleep, the dance moves of the foxtrot itself. The impression given is that the characters are fundamentally trapped - in a practical sense by the boxes with which they've surrounded themselves, and in a more metaphorical sense by the nation's psyche. Jonathan Ritzel's sound design is also notable, full of deafening sounds that seem to come out of nowhere (the buzzer for the Feldman's apartment, doors slamming etc). Especially impressive is how intimately Maoz weaves together form and content, allowing the latter to generate the former in a way most filmmakers could never dream of emulating. To give an example, in the production notes, Maoz states,\r\n\r\n> _the film has a shot where you see a screen of a laptop with a notice of mourning and next to it a bowl with oranges. This frame is the story of my country in four words \u2013 oranges and dead soldiers._\r\n\r\n_Foxtrot_ certainly won't be for everyone. Some will take issue with the pacing (which, it has to be said, is extremely languid), some with the allegorical nature of the story, some with the film's politics. For everyone else, however, this is a brilliantly realised family tragedy, dealing with the randomness of pain and loss in a country refusing to recognise its past. Maoz tells a personal story, but he also exposes the nature of a country whose moral crisis is no less severe than the crisis in which the Feldmans find themselves. Critiquing the practice of sending soldiers to die for absolutely nothing, as well as the xenophobic mindset that has crept into the zeitgeist, Maoz has been accused of making an \"_anti-Israel narrative_.\" On the contrary, he is pleading with his country to change its ways, or it will repeat the errors of history; this is the act of a man who loves his country deeply, but who can see its flaws. In one of the most devastatingly heartbreaking lines I've heard in a long time, Dafna muses, \"_I remember thinking that I was going to be happy_.\" Maoz is suggesting so too did the Israeli people.","id":"5d42318a95c0af0018d7c950","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d42318a95c0af0018d7c950","movie_id":444431}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Their historic discovery was not celebratable.**\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned many times before, now is the trend of the space exploration in films. So there were many films like this one, but not all of them are received well. It was a decent flick, if you consider from the real world aspect, but definitely a very nice entertainer. Very tense plot, especially in the second half till the final scene.\r\n\r\nThis is a minimal cast film and the entire story takes place in an Internation Space Station in the Earth orbit with a lab facility.

From the Swedish director of 'Easy Money' fame. There were lots of speculations about its connection with other films. But nothing was confirmed by the filmmakers.

And they don't use remote controlled robot-arms but simple rubber gloves. The life-form, of course, instinctively knows how to use tools and how to penetrate rubber.\r\n\r\nIt then flees through a CO\u2082 nozzle (after an empty! flamethrower still had its pilot flame on and triggered the fire alarm) and doesn't end up in some tank but no, somehow gets into the rest of the space station. And this was only possible, because the computer to close the nozzles is a 1950s pocket calculator and you have to close them one by one by entering a 20-digit ID for each one or so it seems.\r\n\r\nThe story is driven by people knowingly opening hatches that should've been kept closed. Or not talking to each other, like telling the others that the creature is currently nibbling at one's leg.\r\n\r\nAnother highlight is the creature, finally trapped outside the station, finding its way back in THROUGH THE EFFING THRUSTERS. Why they seem to be connected to the inside of the space station is beyond me.\r\n\r\nSame applies to 2 guys venting all air from a (sealed) module, but a 3rd guy opening the hatch from a pressurised area to said module without any indication the module was without pressure. (And, of course, he didn't know anything about the creature being trapped there, because he threw away his comm device the moment it had a bit of reception issues earlier.)\r\n\r\nThe whole movie is so wrong, I almost had to laugh. Especially, when the last survivors escape in 2 separate escape pods and the one which should reach Earth gets hit by debris and flies into outer space and the other one, *trying* to get away from Earth is kept from doing that by the creature who suddenly seemed to have acquired knowledge about steering NASA issue escape pods and is keeping the human from altering the course.\r\n\r\nThe torture ends with some Asian fishermen simply opening the hatch of the space capsule that just landed in front of them.

The ending has and will infuriate many, but personally I liked it, very much from The Twilight Zone dimension, to which it lifts the piece just above averageville.\r\n\r\nNot recommended with any conviction, especially to sci-fi fans stung by serious science defects and logic holes, while casual sci-fiers would be better off with the brilliance of Alien or something more fun packed and unpretentious like Leviathan (1989).

And whilst I think that's an oversimplification, unjustly ignoring such strong screenplays as _The Last Temptation of Christ_ (1988) and _Bringing Out the Dead_ (1999), and very unjustly ignoring such superb directorial work as _Affliction_ (1997) and _Auto Focus_ (2002), there can be little doubt that First Reformed is easily his best film of the last fifteen years or so. Which wouldn't be hard when you consider films like _The Canyons_ (2013), _Dying of the Light_ (2014), and _Dog Eat Dog_ (2016).\r\n\r\nThe film tells a deceptively simple story - Reverend Ernst Toller (Ethan Hawke) is the parish priest of a small congregation in the Snowbridge suburb of New York. A former military chaplain, Toller is struggling with the death of his son, Joseph, who he encouraged to enlist, and who was killed several months into his first tour in Iraq. As a result, Toller's marriage fell apart, with his wife blaming him for Joseph's death. As the film begins, Toller's spiritual crisis is already well under way. He's drinking too much, doesn't show much interest in his official duties, doesn't seem bothered that his congregation has dwindled to about ten people, and has taken to recording his thoughts in a journal which he plans to keep for one year, and then destroy. After Sunday mass, Toller is approached by Mary (Amanda Seyfried), one of his parishioners, who is worried about her husband, Michael (Philip Ettinger). A radical environmentalist who has just been released from prison in Canada, Michael has developed extreme nihilistic views, and wants Mary to abort their unborn child because he doesn't think anyone has the right to bring a child into a dying world. Although initially reluctant to get involved, Mary persuades Toller to counsel Michael. Meanwhile, the 250th anniversary of the First Reformed church from which Toller works is fast approaching, with a huge service to be attended by both the governor and mayor.\r\n\r\nThe above plot summary takes up roughly the first twenty minutes or so of the film, almost up to the end of the first act. At that point, it looks as if the narrative is heading in the direction of following Toller as he sets about changing Michael's extreme worldview. But that's not where it goes at all, instead focusing almost exclusively on the disintegration of Toller's faith, and the development of his own nihilistic outlook. Along the way, it introduces us to three main supporting characters \u2013 Reverend Joel Jeffers (Cedric Antonio Kyles) of Abundant Life, the megachurch that owns First Reformed, and who gave Toller his job; Esther (Victoria Hill), choirmaster at First Reformed, who had a brief sexual relationship with Toller after his marriage ended; and Edward Balq (Michael Gaston), an industrialist whose company is regarded as one of the worst polluters on the planet. As Toller wrestles with his conscience, he comes into conflict with all three in various ways. At the same time, Mary remains virtually the only remnant of hope in his life, as they continue to grow close.\r\n\r\nThe most striking thing to me about _First Reformed_ is that it is brilliantly shot in Academy ratio (1.37:1), and as a result, everything is boxed in, suggesting little room for movement, with very little empty space in the frame. Coupled with this, Schrader is remarkably consistent in composing perfectly symmetrical shots (the opening scene is a good example). Together, the small frame and the symmetrical compositions give one the impression of looking at a confessional, with the priest on one side and the confessor on the other. As Toller's journal entries occur throughout the film in the form of voiceover, this aesthetic replication of a confessional is enhanced even further - although Toller is not the priest hearing the confession, he is the one confessing.\r\n\r\nIn line with this, _First Reformed_ is not an easy film to watch. It's central themes are suffering, loss of faith, nihilism, and environmental catastrophe, and the way the film is shot, with the added intimacy of the journal, make it seems as if the audience is suffering right alongside Toller; we're drawn completely into his world, and even his mind, in a way very few films achieve. Schrader allows the content to brilliantly dictate the form, with the two becoming so intertwined as to be virtually indistinguishable from one another - a concept most filmmakers don't seem to even understand, let alone have the ability to accomplish. Interestingly this is the second film in the last twelve months to use Academy ratio for explicit narrative reasons, the other being David Lowery's superb _A Ghost Story_ (2017).\r\n\r\nOf course, Schrader is as cine-literate as they come, and doesn't make films in isolation (for example, there are at least three explicit visual references to _Taxi Driver_), and looking at First Reformed in relation to his career would require a full article-length study to itself. However, the film in his _oeuvre_ of which I was most reminded was, strangely enough, _Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist_ (2005), which is not especially good, but which does share many of the same narrative beats and thematic concerns - a lost priest whose experiences of the darker side of humanity has led to him questioning his faith; a crisis of conscience; a righteous cause to which he totally gives himself over; an indifferent God watching everything unfold; an unimaginable sacrifice; hope offered in the form of an innocent. _First Reformed_ is a lot better, and a lot more morally complex, but there's certainly a thematic consistency.\r\n\r\nHowever, that is not to say _First Reformed_ is perfect. There are parts where it is extraordinarily clunky. For example, there's the wake where a group of environmentalists start singing an awful cappella version of Neil Young's activist song, \"Who's Gonna Stand up?\", or the scene where Mary and Toller take (figurative) flight through the power of holding hands (in a scene that reminded me of Joel Coen's _The Big Lebowski_ (1998) far more than I would imagine was intended, and got quite a few laughs at the screening I attended).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, although I've seen many reviews talking about how thought-provoking the environmentalist side of the story is, for me it never really coalesced into anything inherently coherent. Obviously, Toller is a man ready to fall apart when the movie begins, and Michael's concerns about the future of the planet serve as the catalyst for that. However, rather than the film presenting this as nothing more than the backdrop against which Toller's crisis takes place, and thus purposely rendering it unimportant in and of itself, Schrader seems to be trying to genuinely shoehorn in a call-to-action. Which is fairly out of place. And, to be honest, the photograph of the emaciated polar bear is far more disturbing and resonant than any of the facts and figures the film occasionally tosses out.\r\n\r\nI'm also not 100% convinced the black comedy worked. There aren't that many instances of it, but when they come, they are so black as to be easily missed. Probably the best example is when Toller is showing a group of children around First Reformed, and telling them how it was a stop on the Underground Railroad, showing them a secret basement in which the runaway slaves would hide. However, instead of simply giving them a quick history lesson, he ends up staring into the basement and giving a graphic description of what it must have been like hiding in the dark, scared and tired, with no room to move. There's a few moments like this, but I didn't think they really sat well with the ultra-realism on display elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut they're minor faults, and all things considered, this is a high-quality film. Will it be in contention come awards season? Possibly. Schrader has always had a fraught relationship with the Academy (hard to believe he's never even been nominated for an Oscar), but this is the kind of serious subject matter that voters usually lap up. I certainly wouldn't be surprised to see Hawke get some acting nods, possibly Seyfried too. Irrespective of that (and we all know the amount of Oscar nominations a film gets has very little to do with its quality), this is a strong film made by a skilled artist about a subject matter for which he clearly feels deeply.","id":"5cc26113c3a368776c8e7121","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cc26113c3a368776c8e7121","movie_id":458737}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Snitches get stitches!**\r\n\r\nThe first feature film for a television director. He did not get the best cast, but best among the second string. Charlie Day's first lead I'm seeing. I mean not like, among other big stars he used to do the roles. Yes, there are like Ice Cube in the film, but the whole narration was presented from the Charlie's viewpoint. This story needed strong voice, but he had none. You may get annoyed for that, but that's the first fun side of the tale. Charlie Day versus Ice Cube! This kind of combination is not new, but decently used to tell the story. I like Cube in comedies than the serious roles.\r\n\r\nWell, it's not about the story, it's just a one day event. The final day of the school and a tough day for all. Because some of the staffs were fired from the job, the students' misconduct peaked, it's totally a messy day. The English teacher, Campbell, gets into a fight for going against his co-staff. So the day goes on as the countdown begins for their most anticipated fight at the final bell of the school. The preparation for that and all other craziness take place before the finale.\r\n\r\nWhen the film started, it was like any other B movie, very familiar atmosphere and predictable.

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_A meditation on mortality_**\r\n\r\n>_The movie is written for and in every way inspired by Harry Dean Stanton. The stories in the film are stories from his life and it is definitely an \"inspired by\" movie. The story of_ Lucky _is not the story of Harry Dean Stanton but Lucky's stories are Harry Dean Stanton's stories. That is how the material was built and when we started to put it together, that is where my focus was - to make sure that the story of_ Lucky _was clear and focused through the material._\r\n\r\n- John Carroll Lynch; \"Inspired by a Legend: John Carroll Lynch on _Lucky_\" (Peter Sobczynski); _RogerEbert.com_ (September 25, 2017)\r\n\r\n_Lucky_ is the directorial debut of prolific actor John Carroll Lynch, who has worked with everyone from John Woo (in _Face\/Off_) to David Fincher (in _Zodiac_) to Martin Scorsese (in _Shutter Island_), and appeared in recurring roles on TV shows as varied as _The Drew Carey Show_, _Carniv\u00e0le_, and _American Horror Story_. However, more noteworthy than this is that Lucky features the last performance from the legendary Harry Dean Stanton, who was 90 at the time of shooting (Michael Oblowitz's as-yet-unreleased _Frank and Ava_ was shot prior to _Lucky_), and who died on September 15, 2017, two weeks prior to the film's US release. Written specifically for Stanton by Logan Sparks (one of his closest friends) and Drago Sumonja, the film is a meditation on mortality, and is as much about Stanton himself as it is the eponymous character he's playing. Beginning like a quirky comedy full of strange characters with gentle eccentricities (imagine a David Lynch film softened by John Waters), the film later morphs into a more serious meditation on how a nonagenarian atheist with no family faces up to the fact that death is not that far away. Moving entirely at its own measured pace, the film manages to explore a plethora of themes along the way; mortality, routine, impermanence, friendship, love, loss, regret, hope. Laidback and tender, graceful and sedate, _Lucky_ works primarily by way of presenting individual vignettes that very much add up to more than the sum of their parts.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the story of Lucky (Harry Dean Stanton), a 90-year-old living in an unnamed backwater town on the edge of an Arizonan desert. An atheist who doesn't believe in an afterlife or the soul, never married, and with no children, he is happy to explain to people that he's alone, but he is not lonely (borrowing a line from Michael Mann's _Heat_). Living his life by way of a rigid routine, Lucky's day begins with yoga exercises, followed by a walk to the local diner, where he chats with owner Joe (Barry Shabaka Henley) and waitress Loretta (Yvonne Huff), and completes the crossword in the paper. Visiting the local shop run by Bibi (Bertila Damas), he buys a pack of cigarettes, and then returns home to spend a few hours watching game shows. At night, he heads to a bar owned by Elaine (Beth Grant) and her husband Paulie (James Darren), where he trades stories with his best friend, Howard (David Lynch; yes, _that_ David Lynch), and barman Vincent (Hugo Armstrong). However, when he falls for no apparent reason one morning, the local doctor, Christian Kneedler (Ed Begley, Jr.), tries to explain that at his age, the body simply starts to break down. On the other hand, Kneedler is unable to find anything seriously wrong with him, despite his nicotine addiction, pointing out that trying to get him off cigarettes would probably do him more harm than good. Meanwhile, he continues with his routine, albeit more aware that he doesn't have a huge amount of time left. Over the next few days, he attends Bibi's son's birthday party, encounters life-insurance man Bobby Lawrence (Ron Livingston), who he feels is exploiting Howard, and trades stories from the Battle of Okinawa with former marine Fred (Tom Skerritt).\r\n\r\nAnd that's about it. That's the plot (if you can even call it that), and it should be obvious that this is a character-driven film, where the vagaries of a well-laid plot simply don't factor into things. That this is the case is signalled in the slow and methodical opening sequence, which depicts Lucky ambling past boarded-up and dust covered shops, as the hot sun beats down. This is an especially well-handled example of form and content mirroring one another, as the lethargic pace playing out on screen (no one ever seems to be in a rush) correlates with the lethargic pace of the editing rhythm (Lynch allows the scenes, and the characters, plenty of room to breathe, unburdened with trying to race to the next pivotal plot-point).\r\n\r\nThis sequence also works to set up the style and tone which the film will adopt for the remainder of its runtime. Rather than a standard cause-and-effect narrative, _Lucky_ is instead built upon a series of small, usually idiosyncratic, moments, often with only the barest amount of connective tissue between them. Neither does Lucky, nor any of the other characters have what you would call a significant character arc. He doesn't encounter something which forces him to go on a metaphorical\/spiritual journey, arriving at some kind of universal truth which softens his gruff exterior. Instead, he's essentially the same man when the film ends as he was when it began, which is, of course, the entire point.\r\n\r\nAlso in the opening sequence, prior to seeing Lucky wandering around town, the film features a series of shots of the barren desert, with a tortoise slowly ambling into view. The film then cuts to Lucky waking up. This could have been a trite metaphor, but in actual fact, this tortoise becomes a plot-point later on; his name is President Roosevelt, and he belongs to Howard. However, he recently escaped from Howard's yard, sending the man into an emotional meltdown, as Roosevelt is his oldest friend. The missing tortoise is one of the few strands which occurs over multiple scenes, and is central to the way the film defines Howard's character, whilst Lucky's incredulity that Howard could be so upset over a tortoise affords him the opportunity for some nihilistic philosophising.\r\n\r\nIndeed, in relation to philosophy\/theology, Lucky's atheism is an important component of his character; he doesn't believe in God, an afterlife, or the soul, arguing instead that we only get one life, the corporeal one, and when we die, that's it, we turn to dust, and we're gone forever. However, as Lucky starts to become more and more conscious of the imminence of death, his darkly existentialist outlook starts to look less like a grumpy old man's innocent ramblings, and more like something which could genuinely make his last few years miserable. In relation to this, when Lucky goes to see Kneedling, the doctor stresses the fact that he is both blessed and cursed to have gotten as old as he has \u2013 blessed in the sense that very few people make it this far, cursed because physically, Lucky's body is beginning to fail him.\r\n\r\nOne of the major themes in the film is routine; Lucky's day is rigidly mapped out, to the point that if someone is sitting in his favourite diner seat, it throws him off and puts him in a bad mood. In this sense, repetition is a major part of both Lucky's life, and the film's structure (for example, we see him walking his route around town on four different occasions). Another important theme is impermanence, which ties into Lucky's rejection of a never-ending life after death. For example, when he visits a pet shop, he doesn't know what a \"_forever home_\" is, and even when it's explained to him, he still seems to be somewhat confused. Tied to this, the issue of mortality is brought up time and again, seen most clearly in Howard's dealings with Bobby, preparing for his own inevitable death. Indeed, it's worth pointing out that the five yoga exercises Lucky performs each morning are the Five Rites of Rejuvenation, so although he knows this life won't last forever, so too is he doing what he can to prolong it as much as possible. With this in mind, after he falls, the film shifts gears, changing from a pseudo-comic examination of a curmudgeonly old man into a subtle analysis of the inescapability of death and the transitory nature of existence.\r\n\r\nThe film also deals with the importance of small anecdotes and seemingly minor personal connections \u2013 scenes which aren't especially dramatic, but which tell us a huge amount about the characters. Working together, the acting, the expressive faces, the seemingly insignificant dialogue, the importance of routine, the crumbling town, the desert, all serve to create the whole, which conveys far more than any one aspect of the film could. However, this is not to say that individual scenes don't work, or are disposable. For example, several scenes contain achingly beautiful anecdotes; Lucky's story of accidentally killing a mockingbird as a child; Howard's narration of what he imagines President Roosevelt's birth must have been like; and, in a scene obviously paying homage to a very similar scene in David Lynch's _The Straight Story_ (1999), Lucky and Fred swap heart-breaking stories of their time in the war (just like Lucky, Stanton was a cook on board the USS LST-970, which participated in the Battle of Okinawa). The film also contains one of the best lines I've heard in a long time \u2013 as Paulie is talking about how he used to be a bum worth nothing, but everything changed after he met Beth, he explains, \"_I'm still nothing, but now I have everything. Isn't that something?_\"\r\n\r\nIf I was to find fault, there would be a couple of things worth criticising. Although the film avoids mawkish sentimentality for almost its entire runtime, it does become a little maudlin towards the end. Additionally, by its very nature, the narrative is very episodic, which creates a slight impression of disconnection. For the most part, the tone and design of the film also work to keep the audience at arm's length, preventing us from becoming too emotionally involved with Lucky himself, something which I'm not entirely sure served the film, or the character, very well.\r\n\r\nHowever, these are relatively minor flaws in an otherwise excellent film, and in the end, this is a fitting swan song for an actor of Stanton's calibre. And how many people can say they've appeared in their own filmic obituary?","id":"5ceda0a09251416cbeb96036","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ceda0a09251416cbeb96036","movie_id":407449}

But on her return home, she finds her mother missing and must strike out on her own, meeting up with a group of boys whose families have also gone missing or been killed.

Now in possession of a gangster\u2019s phone and being tracked by the gang\u2019s leader, the group must run for their lives, all while Estrella continues to see fantastical images and encounters with the dead.\r\n\r\nComparing this film to \u201cPan\u2019s Labyrinth\u201d or even \u201cThe Monkey\u2019s Paw\u201d is not unfair, both in terms of how the story is told and the general theme, that of escaping into fantasy to distance oneself from the horrors of the world, and of being careful what you wish for. The imagery is not quite as fantastical as \u201cPan\u2019s Labyrinth\u201d and is actually more akin to that of a modern horror film than a fantasy epic.\r\n\r\nThe acting is decently done, especially for a movie that focuses primarily on the children. You can feel an enormous uncertainty expressed by these kids, which matches the feeling of children being cast out into the world on their own with no idea where to go or what to do.

Mainly because of the woman oriented theme. People were desperate to see the solo woman superhero. Today, we have the great visual effects technology, that anything can be possible to bring on to the screen. And actress like Gal Gadot, even better it gets. Yes, it was a wonderful film. A simple storyline, but a well made film.\r\n\r\nThe Amazonians who are cut off from the rest of the world, is preparing for the battle if Ares returns. All these years nothing has happened, but one day a fighter pilot crash on the cost of their island. Then the princess embark a journey back with him to find, and end the Ares threat forever. But she only ends up in the WWII, and what happens in the following sequence are the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nWho would have done a better job than Patty Jenkins. She nailed it, and so set to direct the sequel too. Even the supporting cast was good. DC's visuals always high standards and so this one. Action sequences too amazing. There's lots of changes in the character, as well as in everything. Firstly a nice superhero costume. And connections like Diana's father, the island, all pretty nicely written out. The DC universe just got extended. I can't wait to see 'Justice League'.\r\n\r\n**8\/10**","id":"5a1ec3880e0a264cc807f241","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a1ec3880e0a264cc807f241","movie_id":297762}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Wonder Woman and Captain Steve Trevor seek to end WW1***\r\n\r\nNear the end of WW1, an American spy (Chris Pine) is chased by Germans to the hidden island of Amazonian women created by Zeus to protect mankind. The princess of the island (Gal Gadot) leaves with the captain to help end the Great War and destroy Ares forever.\r\n\r\n\"Wonder Woman\" (2017) combines the Wonder Woman TV series (1975-1979) with elements of \u201cAll Quiet on the Western Front\u201d (1979), \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981), \u201cThe Dirty Dozen\u201d (1967), \u201cCaptain America: The First Avenger\u201d (2011) and \u201cMan of Steel\u201d (2013). It\u2019s a well done modern superhero flick and superior to both \u201cThe First Avenger\u201d and \u201cMan of Steel.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe opening paradisal island sequence is good without overstaying its welcome.

The entire midsection is great, but the last act, to be expected, comes down to two super-beings pounding each other. But at least the creators tried to add a weighty moral.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 21 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B","id":"5cc1fbb7c3a36809ab850931","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cc1fbb7c3a36809ab850931","movie_id":297762}
{"author":"in_the_crease","content":"**DC Hits A...Bunt. But compared to the strikeouts, a bunt seems impressive.**\r\n\r\nWonder Woman had some things working for it--things other comic book movies have faltered on. But it had a lot of things not working for it too. The result is an average median between what works and what doesn't. While the film is spectacular within the struggling DCEU, as a stand alone film it's mediocre at best. \r\n\r\nDiana's origin story--how she came to be and how she came to be a super hero was refreshing. It showcased the world of the Amazon warriors. It was unique in the often cookie-cutter super hero origin stories. Patty Jenkins did a good job of framing it, but I think the character's origin story dating back to the comics has always been unique in comparison to other super heroes.\r\n\r\nThe result is that the first third or so of the movie is satisfying--despite dull performances from Gal Gadot and Chris Pine (who had zero chemistry as a couple). But once we leave the confines of the island and enter the real world, the movie becomes hit or miss. WWI (that's right, WWI now, not WWII. The reason for the change in setting is never apparent) London is portrayed in a way that is almost a distraction. Yes, the world isn't white washed; diversity is a thing--a wonderful thing at that. But DC's version of Captain America's Howling Commandos consist of an Arab and an American Indian. Diversity for diversity's sake becomes distracting--especially when paired with a low-rent Simon Pegg whose soul function is being a deadly sniper who never fires his weapon (that's helpful on a top-secret mission behind enemy lines). \r\n\r\nIt's almost as if the movie telegraphs all of these unnecessary plot hiccups to remind you that this is a super hero film, and no matter how much the mortal humans fail, it will all be okay because the super hero will save the day. \r\n\r\nThe dialogue can be clich\u00e9d at times, and the final theme of the movie--one of love conquering all and the acknowledgement that, overall, mankind is good, is laughable in it's amateur preachiness. \r\n\r\nBut what the film lacks in substance and script, it makes up for in the visuals. I found the action sequences to be great fun. Heavily stylized \"Matrix-style\" fight scenes seem right at home in a film about super hero Gods. The freeze frames worked too--as fight sequences froze in over-the-top super hero poses that harkened back to the source material's comic book roots.\r\n\r\nThe final confrontation between Wonder Woman and Ares--while dragging on a little long--was well done, being one of the few super hero movie climaxes that delivered. \r\n\r\nWhile aspects of the movie were so similar (Hell! Identical!) to Captain America: The First Avenger, I actually felt embarrassed for the filmmakers, I did come away thinking this was the movie Captain America should have been. It succeeded in places where Captain America failed miserably. \r\n\r\nThe movie is entertainment--pure, fun, pop-corn-gobbling entertainment. In that realm, it succeeds and succeeds well. But as a piece of cinematic art, it falls flat on its face with too many plot holes, script inconsistencies, clich\u00e9s and mediocre acting. Wonder Woman will be an important movie for both the DCEU and the summer of 2017. But it lacks the magic and staying power of Nolan and Donner's contributions to DC comics' films.","id":"59358fc692514174a1000015","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59358fc692514174a1000015","movie_id":297762}
{"author":"Movie Queen41","content":"**The First Great DCEU Film**\r\n\r\nThis film is the origin story of Diana Prince\/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), who was first introduced in Batman v. Superman last year. She is born and trained on Themyscira, the hidden island where the powerful warrior women known as the Amazons live. One day, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), an American World War I spy, crashes off the coast of Themyscira and is rescued by Diana and the two team up to take down Ares, the God of War, and the Germans, who are developing a very deadly form of mustard gas. There are fantastic action sequences in this film, especially by Gal Gadot. It's amazing to see her single-handedly storm the German front, inspiring the Allies to fight with her. Gadot takes over from the legendary Linda Carter and makes the role her own. She has great chemistry with Pine. They are complete equals in this film. It's refreshing to see the female lead in a superhero film not be the love interest. The only negative part of the film are the lackluster villains. Hopefully, Wonder Woman will have more formidable foes in future films.","id":"593476aec3a3685a2402386d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/593476aec3a3685a2402386d","movie_id":297762}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I quite enjoyed this movie. When I learned that Zack Snyder had his fingers in it I got a worried since he recently wrote such atrocities as Batman vs Superman and sure enough the story is a really the weakest part of the movie. A typical nonsensical, unintelligent, Hollywood story\/script were you are better off putting your brain in idle when watching it.\n\nHowever it makes up for this with cool special effects and, surprisingly, quite enjoyable characters. This is definitely a movie that you watch for the sake of the special effects. Well, if you are a male teenager you might also be watching it to drool over Gal Gadot of course (I have to admit that she is hot).\n\nThere is not too much to say about the plot. Our Amazon hot chick discovers that there is a war going on and goes out to stop it. Since she has been overly protected by her guardian she is amazingly clueless about life outside of her little island. Especially aspects involving men. Something which creates some funny moments as well as some embarrassingly silly ones. This, Diana\u2019s gradual evolution where she not only is learning about life but also discovers her considerable powers, is one of the enjoyable aspects of the movie though. It is of course also one of the dummer aspects of the movie. How the f\u2026 could the Amazon Queen race Diana to be so ignorant about everything?\n\nAnother not so enjoyable part of the movie is the ludicrous scenes where the britts are trying to obtain peace at all costs as well as the stereotypical portrayal of Ludendorff as some megalomaniacal, half crazy war-mongerer. This was just dumb. I guess Zac Snyder just picked the name out of some history book without bothering to read up on the character. Typical lack of intelligence and respect, a la Hollywood, for anything outside of their, very limited, sphere of knowledge.\nWell, at least Danny Huston did a pretty decent job of the shitty role he was given. So did most of the rest of actors. I definitely liked Gal Gadot as Super Woman but then, although I am not a teenager, I am still a male so maybe I am biased when it comes to her?\n\nI definitely liked the special effects. The showdown at the end was great as far as I am concerned and the rest not bad either. They could have been even better though if it would not have been so obvious that the Germans where mostly incompetent extras waiting for Wonder Woman to show off her gymnastics and slow motion abilities. Come on, even superhero special effects should make some pretense of being \u201crealistic\u201d superhero special effects.\n\nThe movie is definitely aimed at the young adult segment. Unfortunately it do not seem to know what it is aiming for. Sometimes it is almost adult, sometimes it is late teen and sometimes just so bloody TV-show silly that you\u2019re wondering if it is aiming for even pre-teens.\n\nAnyway, regardless of its faults I did enjoy my 2+ hour spent on this movie. Enough to give it a 4 out of 5 rating","id":"59fb1990c3a3681adf00e576","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59fb1990c3a3681adf00e576","movie_id":297762}

{"author":"David","content":"If you were to go through my movie collection, you would find an eclectic mix of films. One of the most prevalent in the mix of genres & sub-genres, I have many that are post apocalyptic\/futuristic dystopian world films. Its the kind of film I love exploring, as its a look at not only our possible future, but a look at ourselves now, and where we are heading should we continue down certain paths.\r\n\r\nIn the tradition of some of the great films like the classics Blade Runner, and Total Recall, to more modern tales like Equilibrium, and Children of Men comes What Happened to Monday.\r\n\r\nSet in a future where food resources are drastically low due to overpopulation, a sinister organization responsible for implementing a one-child policy by taking all subsequent sibling to be cryogenically frozen until such a time when resources are enough to cover everyone.\r\n\r\nTerrence Settman (Dafoe) finds himself in a rather precarious position with the birth of sextuplets, granddaughters, whose mother dies during labour. Naming them after each day of the week, he makes the dangerous decision of taking them all in to his care, raising them in secret, and taking all necessary precautions to ensure that they live in secret.\r\n\r\nWhen the girls have grown to an age where he feels comfortable, and confident that they are aware of the dangers of the outside world, and the consequences of anything that could mean the secret being uncovered, he allows each girl to go out on the day after which they were named, ie; Monday on Monday, Tuesday on Tuesday, and so on, and so forth. The girls each live their day outside as one Karen Settman.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with any group of children, the girls exhibit an array of personality traits from shy and demure to outgoing and rebellious, with the rebel of the seven causing a uncomfortable, and lasting, consequence for the other six siblings when she goes out on a day that she was not designated to do so, and suffers a painful injury.\r\n\r\nFast forward some 30 years we find that the girls have grown to adulthood successfully in secret, and while inside they exhibit their own personalities, do their own thing, and keep their own interests, they work very well together maintaining the life of Karen Settman out in the world. This is largely down to nightly debriefings from the one who went out that day, so that the others are aware of their role to maintain their cover.\r\n\r\nThis all works perfectly until Monday doesn't come home from work, leaving her sisters extremely worried about what could have happened to her, and Tuesday going blind to what is waiting for her outside, with no knowledge of the previous days happenings. It is now up to Tuesday and her sisters to figure out what happened to Monday.\r\n\r\nThe thing I love most about this film is it's concept, its what I love about the genre in general, as a dystopian future story can lend itself to anything that can cause a dystopia to happen, over population causing implementation of restricted breeding, or emotions being banned so that people don't fight, and cause war.\r\n\r\nI also love the performances of Noomi, and Clara in the two stages of the girls' lives, the seven nuanced personalities demanded such range from both to capture the essence of the seven sisters, but also the prime character of Karen.\r\n\r\nWhat also impressed me about this film, is the way in which the seven different characters were juxtaposed in the scenes they were together in. In no way was this done cheaply, or nasty, and definitely did not come off cheesy.","id":"5e3fd7453dd1260018533a7c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e3fd7453dd1260018533a7c","movie_id":406990}

To me, that could maybe be used to describe only the third movie. The first one is promising and has a certain \"child-like-wonder\" appeal. But neither of them are truly **good**. The second _Transformers_ is meaningless garbage.\r\n\r\nBut when _Age of Extinction_ was released in 2014, the franchise hit new, abysmal lows. Watching _Transformers_ wasn't just a chore, it wasn't just boring, it was excruciating. It was so bad I felt nauseous. I was aggravated to the point of brimming with feelings of genuine anger. They say that if a film makes you feel something, that is a victory in itself. Be it sadness, excitement, intrigue, joy, hope, nostalgia, hysteria, love, fear, warmth - whatever - I tend to agree with that statement. What I felt in _Age of Extinction_ was not a victory. It was a failure. A Guinness Book of World Records level failure.\r\n\r\n_Transformers: The Last Knight_, is at least that bad again.\r\n\r\nArguably worse.\r\n\r\nI guess it didn't dedicate an entire character to being a justification for paedophilia, so it has that up on its predecessor.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u00bd - So bad it\u2019s offensive.

Especially after the abysmal fourth installment. To my great surprise I found it to be much less crappy than I expected.\n\nI honestly do not understand why so many people seems to think this is one of the worst movies ever. The critics sure, especially the ones at Rotten Tomatoes, but I do not really care about those self proclaimed \"critics\". Ordinary viewers is another matter. \n\nI mean, this is a transformers movie and it is directed by Michael Bay. That pretty much defines the movie from the start so what the heck did all those people complaining actually expect? That Michael Bay should suddenly care about things like script and stuff or anything else except big robots, special effects and explosions?\n\nPersonally I quite enjoyed this movie. Well, enjoyed in the context of watching a Transformers movie that is. I enjoyed the special effects, the robots, even the lousy jokes.\n\nI did enjoy the tie in to the Pendragon myth and I thought the somewhat bizarre Sir Edmund Burton and his even more bizarre robot butler was great fun.\n\nI laughed outright when I saw the World War 1 tank transformer. I was expecting the submarine transformer to actually transform though.\n\nMaybe all those detractors of this movie are missing the bimbo with two and a half brain cells (yes I am being generous now) that used to be the lead female character in the Transformers movies but personally I quite liked that the leads in this movie was much more mature and actually showed some evidence of intelligence.\n\nThe story? Well, for a Transformers movie it is quite good. In any other context it would be somewhat...lacking. It did screw quite a bit with the Transformers timeline established in the first movies though. Oh, and for some nitpicking, the maximum operating altitude of those airplanes they used is 21 000 feet, not 12 000 feet.\n\nBottom line, I had great fun when watching this movie.

But what I'm trying to get across is that this is not the problem, but rather that the male characters believe that the way she looks authorises them to treat her as though she is to be used and then disposed of like a worthless piece of rubbish. The male gaze in film often implies that women are to blame for acts of sexual violence committed against them,_ _which is deeply problematic. Through each male character, I wanted to show the different abusive behaviours that, to a large extent, have become normalised in today's society._\r\n\r\n- Coralie Fargeat; \"Exclusive Interview with _Revenge_ Director Coralie Fargeat\"; _Bird's Eye View_ (December 5, 2018)\r\n\r\n\r\nJen (a superb Matilda Lutz) and her married lover Richard (Kevin Janssens) are enjoying a romantic weekend in his isolated house in the desert. However, shortly after they arrive, Richard's friends, Stan (Vincent Colombe), Dimitri (Guillaume Bouch\u00e8de), and Roberto (Jean-Louis Tribes) show up unannounced, urging Richard to join them on a hunting trip. As tension mounts in the house, Stan rapes Jen, but when she says she is going to go to the police, and to alert Richard's wife of his affair, the men attack her and leave her for dead. However, unbeknownst to them, she survives the assault, and has set on revenge.\r\n\r\nVery much in the vein of films such as Sam Peckingpah's _Strawdogs_ (1971) and Meir Zarchi's _I Spit On Your Grave_ (1978), _Revenge_ is an insanely gory rape-revenge thriller. In her feature debut, writer\/director Coralie Fargeat displays an astonishing visual panache as she reappropriates this exploitative sub-genre for the post #MeToo era. From the expansive Ford-esque vistas of the desert to the claustrophobic and labyrinthine finale, her visual language is as dexterous and thematically justified as one would expect from a master stylist such as Michael Mann. The film is very much about the dangers and darker implications of the male gaze, and the way Fargeat's constantly moving camera lingers on actress Matilda Lutz's half-naked body is deeply unsettling, challenging the audience to look at her in the same way the male characters do, before turning this notion on its head in the second half of the film. If you can ignore the plot contrivances, and stomach the gore, you will find a socially relevant film that is as auspicious a debut as you're likely to see all year.","id":"5cb2f12b9251412fad270004","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cb2f12b9251412fad270004","movie_id":467938}

{"author":"in_the_crease","content":"**Missed Opportunity**\r\n(Review is spoilerish)\r\n\r\nComing on the heels of last summer's surprise success _The Shallows_, comes this summer's laughable attempt to portray shark behavior. While shark movies since _Jaws_ have been scientifically inaccurate, you have to throw a movie like _Jaws_ a bone because, well, it's _Jaws_. It was a wonderfully made film, released at a time when we knew little to nothing about the nature of great white sharks. After 30 years of documentaries and Shark Week, the cinematic shark is still a mindless villain whose soul reason for existing is to move the plot forward, and eat it when it cannot.\r\n\r\nI'd like to say what _47 Meters Down_ lacks in accuracy it makes up for in plot, suspense, and characters. But that's just not true. The script seemed to be a first draft, full of plot holes and non-existent characterization. It was a typical tell-not-show movie, where characters, through dialogue, literally explained themselves to the audience, rather than establish themselves through action.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with a pretentious and symbolic shot of a spilled drink to mimic blood in the water, I guess, in case, you didn't know this was a shark movie? We narrow our focus to two American sisters vacationing in Mexico. Later in the movie, when the script necessitates it, the younger sister, Kate, is portrayed as athletic, heroic, courageous, and endowed with other noble attributes. We learn this not through 20 minutes of established characterization, but through the older sister, Lisa, lamenting about how she is the shy, boring one, while Kate is more adventurous and outgoing. \r\n\r\nInstead, the first 20 minutes of the film establishes Kate as nothing more than a party girl--making out with strange men, doing tequila shooters, dancing on the beach. We find out that Kate is kind of awesome, but only because Lisa, virtually, says to the audience, \"My sister is awesome.\" But in the 20 minutes of exposition we get on the sisters, all we really have to work with is what amounts to a music video--quick shots of drinking and dancing.\r\n\r\nLisa's characterization--while presented in the amateur way of awkward dialogue (Hey, \"sis\"--in case you didn't get that they were sisters--I'm here because of this terrible thing that's going on with my boyfriend, and that's my motivation for the next 90 minutes)--is at least presented to us. However, in tripe ripped from the most unromantic and unfunny of romantic comedies, Lisa's every action--including, apparently, kissing another man--is to impress some guy back in the States who has already left her. You know, because a woman's self worth and sense of identity is tied directly to a man (insert eye roll here).\r\n\r\nNow the movie becomes a movie. The sisters head out to sea to go shark diving, encountering a captain who goes back and forth between paternally concerned and grossly negligent, and a mate who is, for all intents a purposes, a total dick for reasons never explained.\r\n\r\nAfter we've established that Lisa has never dove (dived?) before, and that Captain Taylor is perfectly fine with that (the equivalent of taking someone who's never driven before and entrust them with a semi on our highways), and that shark cage and winch system is faulty--essentially telegraphing everything that is going to go wrong--the girls get in the water, see some sharks swimming around and then, plummet to the bottom, 47 meters down.\r\n\r\nThe film becomes both engaging and obnoxious at this point. The sharks are out there, lurking in the darkness, popping up for scares here and there to jolt the audience. At that point it becomes like a monster movie--a haunted house type movie, with our two protagonists trapped in a metaphorical basement. That's all well and dandy, as are the scenes of pure suffocating terror. There's an almost psychological horror element in some scenes, with Lisa so disoriented in the darkness, she doesn't know which way to swim to reach safety. \r\n\r\nHowever, the situational suspense wears thin quickly. Rather than using atmospheric suspense, the filmmakers relied on suspense through situations where everything goes wrong. Constantly. Putting on another tank of air takes 20 minutes. I was never sitting there saying, \"Oh my God, how are they going to get out of this situation!?\" I was going, \"Oh my God, how long is the director going to milk this scene for!?\" I wasn't in suspense; I was frustrated. \r\n\r\nFinally, we have an ending that could have--should have--saved the whole movie. It's hard to go into specifics without giving away MAJOR SPOILERS to a kind M. Night Shamaylanesque \"twist ending\" so you may want to stop reading now, though I intend to be as vague as possible.\r\n\r\nOkay, what works with the ending...\r\n\r\nIt provides a nice twist that I didn't see coming. I thought it was very clever.\r\n\r\nWhat didn't work? Well, unless you have some familiarity with diving at certain depths, it might seem as if it's coming out of left field. I understood what was happening, so I understood the ending. But for the uninformed, it might be confusing--and that confusion would ruin the impact. There simply wasn't proper information given to the audience to decipher the ending for themselves unless they familiar with things such as the so-called \"rapture-of-the-deep.\"\r\n\r\nBut where the ending really shot itself in the foot was the denouement that follows and ties everything up in a nice, safe, Hollywood ending. Basically, if the movie had ended two minutes sooner, with the camera slowing pulling back from a girl trapped in a shark cage, the rest of the movie's sins could have been over looked.\r\n\r\nOne of the drawbacks though is the same that plagued Blair Witch Project: The ending _is_ the movie. But the first 80 minutes are not strong enough to get you to the final ten more than once or twice. I'll probably never see this film again. Despite that, I didn't despise it. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that it was the worst $11 I've ever spent or that I want the last two hours of my life back. It accomplished what it set out to do in the most shallowest of terms, and I'm good.\r\n\r\nDespite it's many flaws, I was pleased with Mandy Moore's performance as Lisa. She seemed to be the only actor who was consistent in relying--through action, dialogue, demeanor and tone--exactly who her character was. Also, the film stayed away from the gratuitous T&A shots that plagued similar films like last year's _The Shallows_ (was Bake Lively's butt never _not_ in frame?) 2005's _Into the Blue_ that seemed to focus more on Paul Walker's abs and Jessica Alba's curves than the actual plot itself, and 1977's _The Deep_, best known for two hours of Jacqueline Bissett in a wet t-shirt.","id":"594abb3b925141314b001867","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/594abb3b925141314b001867","movie_id":403119}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"RELEASED IN 2017 and written & directed by Taylor Sheridan, \"Wind River\" chronicles events at the remote Wind River Indian Reservation where a curiously barefooted young Native woman is found dead in the wilderness; a Fish & Wildlife tracker (Jeremy Renner) and an FBI agent (Elizabeth Olsen) team-up to solve the mystery. Graham Greene plays the Reservation police chief, Gil Birmingham appears as the victim\u2019s grieving father and Jon Bernthal & James Jordan are on hand as security guards at a drill site. There are several others.  \r\n\r\nThe film is based on hundreds of actual stories similar to it. The issue of assault against Native women on Reservations, many mysteriously disappearing, has existed since the inception of the Reservation system, but in the past 15-20 years it has exploded and yet gets no attention, which was the motivation for the film. In ages past the tribes (e.g. Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho) would migrate out of the area during the unrelenting winters, but the Reservation system basically forces the tribespeople to permanently stay where people weren\u2019t meant to live year round (or so it is argued).\r\n\r\nThis is a straight-forward crime drama\/murder mystery\/thriller taking place completely in wintery conditions in the remote modern American West. The story starts kind of dull, but interest slowly builds until everything eventually explodes in the second half. If you like stories where the clues slowly lead to the culprit\/culprits you\u2019ll probably like this movie. Renner is a quality taciturn Westerner and likable Olsen with her cutie face & figure is strong on the female front.

{"author":"write2topcat","content":"I love this film for many reasons. It's not an overly complicated film. But it is well done. The setting is a Native American Reservation in Wyoming. The land is starkly beautiful.  Winter here is harsh and unforgiving. I love the outdoors, and I love the tough, isolated, lifestyle of those living far from civilization, so I enjoyed this film from the start.  The cast is very good, the acting also.  I don't need a lot of surprise twists and a shocking ending in a detective story in order to enjoy a film, so it doesn't bother me at all that this one doesn't have that.  The things which make this film different make it more enjoyable to me. \r\n\r\nI am frankly tired of the 'action\/mystery' movies and the familiar formulas and techniques they employ: the rapid shift of camera perspectives used to simulate fighting action,  the 70's reminiscent, 'fast n furious' car stunt segments with their blaring music, etc.   Pharmaceutical companies, oil companies, preachers,  and social conservatives are so frequently employed as villains in such films that it's beyond boring now. This film is different.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIt tells a story about the brutal death of an Indian girl, and her missing boyfriend. We see the actions of a few dedicated, over worked, law officers trying to solve the crime and bring the perpetrator to justice, and a civilian tracker contracted to help them. It pushes no hidden or thinly veiled agenda.  \r\nIt's just a story, set in the modern west,  about human nature, crime, and justice.","id":"5ab3ec549251417af600bbdb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ab3ec549251417af600bbdb","movie_id":395834}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The man who'd lost everything, is set to redefine his life.**\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'The Skeleton Key', I can see his style of filmmaking as I'd watched these two films of him. That makes him a stylish filmmaker of his own style. This kind of story narration is not for everyone. But surely there are people for it. This is not a very good film, but simply a good film.\r\n\r\nIt revolved around a character who is kind of an anti-social. He has lost everything one by one in his life and now his close buddy who moved far away and then his father who has just died. So he decides to find his ex wife, and with that he comes to know some long hidden secret. Going after it, his life forever changes which is what covered in the remaining film.\r\n\r\nIt was Woody Harrelson's show. But I quite liked Laura Dern as well. It was a long time after seeing her in this kind of absorbing role, yeah, except recently from 'Wild'. And there was Judy Greer, who was not bad either.

{"author":"tomiscool","content":"There's a lot to cover here. Bruce Parry's latest foray into tribal exploration goes further than the usual appeals to civilisation's lost sense of unity with the world. Don't get me wrong, it's there, making up the titular theme (Tawai literally translates to a relationship with nature), and categorising, for the first half or so, the film's primary message. But thereafter Parry takes an interesting turn, focusing on the psychological and sociological aspects of certain tribes in Borneo and the Amazon. Parry's thesis is that after the invention of agriculture sometime in the neolithic, and the subsequent abandonment of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle, human psychology, specifically the way we perceive and relate to the world around us, changed forever. Parry uses these nomadic tribes, still employing the hunter-gatherer way of life, as case studies to back up his claim. He also consults with experts in tribal sociology and neuroscience who posit corroborating ideas. And a third angle is seen through the lens of eastern philosophy, mindfulness and the illusion of self. Parry draws parallels between all three sections seemingly building a strong argument for a \"better way of life\": a right-hemisphere dominated (we in the west predominantly use the left), purely egalitarian, selfless existence. But with closer inspection the foundations appear weak: anecdotal accounts from tribes people are just exactly that; sociological structures are analysed and commended without any considerations for how they'd work in populations over 30; and the neuroscience (which I'm obviously not qualified to comment on) comes from one professional, which even by his own proclamation appears to be a fringe theory. And as far as my limited understanding goes, eastern philosophy has commanded authority only in 'spiritual' wisdom (philosophy of mind etc.) over the centuries, whereas the west is far superior scientifically, politically and ethically, build upon the ideas of the enlightenment. The film's lack of acknowledgement of this asymmetry worries me, even going as far as to portray the east as the superior. But the fact still stands, by every conceivable metric of human well being\u2014life expectancy, child mortality, literacy etc.\u2014living in the west is the best in the world. Nuggets of wisdom found in eastern tradition, buried beneath their many layers of sectarian mysticism, should be respected for what they are. And lessons about our relationship with the world from people living directly off it should too. But a loss of perspective can turn small lessons into large errors, mistaking a voice from the forest for a call back to it. \r\n\r\nI like plumbing.","id":"59d4de80c3a3684528017b27","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59d4de80c3a3684528017b27","movie_id":479495}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**It was not a table of honour!**\r\n\r\nI thought it was some B movie. Expecting anything from it is like a total waste. But that was not the case. I was surprised how simple it was, yet very entertaining. Not all the small films like this would do the same magic. Everything in the was like I already seen in other films, even though I enjoyed it thoroughly.\r\n\r\nIt was a one-day event tale and in the backdrop of a wedding. In that, the film focused on one particular table, the table number 19 on the outskirt the dining hall. They all came from different background and never met before. They learn about each other, and their personal issues open up during the cerebration. Apart from that, they mess up a few things and later try to fix it, that all comes into play before it reaches the end.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'Rocket Science', which came a decade ago, also starred by Anna Kendrick. I think he is a fine director, at least in small comedies with the good quality screenplay. So he should be doing more feature films than the television series. I was impressed by Kendrick. Her choices of films might not be the greatest, but she's almost there and very soon going to give a career best for sure. The remaining cast was funnily good.\r\n\r\nI think this film deserves a sequel. Because the film characters are very distinctive and has left behind a lot about them which need to be revealed. Sequel or prequel, it does not matter, but I'll be surely looking for one. Look at its cost, just $5 million. Big production houses can give away such tiny amount without expecting any returns.\r\n\r\nYou might see it rated low everywhere, but for me, it is a good comedy. One of the best small budget films. Yeah, the end was very clich\u00e9d, but acceptable for such film. I would definitely suggest it for those who won't anticipate in films they watch.

Still I watched this, largely due to the involvement of several favorite actors and the script having been written by the Duplass brothers.\r\n\r\nI found it almost instantly both funny and moving, and the longer I watched, the more confused I became as to why most critics had been lukewarm or downright dismissive of it. I figured it had to be mostly due to the genre blend of comedy and more dramatic issues, and that probably most of the criticism had been along the usual lines of \"can't make up it's mind', etc. But even so, that didn't add up to a meager 40% rating, with such a clever script and great acting.\r\n\r\nWhen the credits rolled, I knew instantly why: A happy ending...\r\n\r\nIt all mostly works out in the end for the oddball protagonists. Critics in general can't stand it. If a movie has had a degree of realism and\/or several dark or borderline dark-ish issues brought up along the way, critics tend to go ******* unless it all ends in misery, or largely unresolved, or at the very least in ambiguity. God forbid you walk away from such a movie actually feeling good; that equals 'cheesy' in most reviewers book. Was it realistic that most of the people involved got a happy, somewhat romantic ending? Of course not, but though the movie tackles several 'real' issues within the comedy, I found the ending perfectly fitting with the tone of it. Critics often use the word 'predictable' about anything that has a hint of romantic comedy in it, but I'd say, there are few things as predictable as movie critics in general.\r\n\r\nIf you want to read what I consider a spot on review for this, check out Empire Magazine, who went against the stream and gave it 4 out of 5 stars.","id":"5937b760c3a36827cf00225f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5937b760c3a36827cf00225f","movie_id":353569}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Fast + Eight = Fate**\r\n\r\nWe all miss Paul Walker here, but the franchise has grown bigger with more new casts from a couple of previous installments and with this, still counting. Yes, it marks the arrival of Jason Stathom as hinted at the end of the previous part, as well as Charlize Theron in the negative role. And guest appearance of veteran actors. This is where the bald guys rule. One of the most unique franchise.\r\n\r\nThis is the costliest film in the series, but did not earn as much as 'Fast 7' did. At least it stands second out of the eight. Now the billion dollar club becoming normal. The best thing about this series is, the race days are over. It's now more a cop-thief kind of cat- mouse action-adventure game that moves all around the globe. It opened in Cuba with a small race, which is what it's known for, but soon falls back to the manhunt.\r\n\r\nYep, Toretto abandons his family and disappears. Soon he'll be found on the wrong side of the battle between the security\/secret agency and the international criminal gang. Now it is the clash within the family that involves outsiders too. A new recruit, Deckard Shaw joins the team, alongside Scott Eastwood as Little Nobody. Finding what they're up to and striking them to avert their plans are followed in the remaining film.\r\n\r\nThe original films had awesome automobile stunts, but what was missing is the fist fight, which came to life with more masculinely since Dwayne Johnson's entry. Now add Stathan as well to it. I hope he stays in the series, rather just for one film as a guest appearance. The regular cast was good as always. The story had a small twist, but mostly predictable. A good film compared to a few earlier films, otherwise a decent watch. Now its time to wait for Fast 9 or is it called Fine!\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59976a9e925141403a0020e3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59976a9e925141403a0020e3","movie_id":337339}

Yes, they also praised the Adam Sandler's performance, which saw a series stumble in the recent years. Besides, I believed in this director. The film also had Ben Stiller and Dustin Hoffman. All the fine actors with a fine filmmaker, this is one of the best dramas of the year. Not a family drama, though. And it is about almost a dysfunctional family. This kind of themes is always so fun to watch, and So I had a decent time with it.\r\n\r\nJust a week away for their father's artwork show, the two step-brothers and a sister had arrived. They have come individually, then one of them learns about news of selling the property and soon protests. Then the other brother's lunch date with his father does not go as planned. Later an unexpected emergency brings them all to unity. Following that, how the story ends are told in the rest of the running time.\r\n\r\nDefinitely a good film, but not that awesome kind. Only the cast makes it so precious, and everything else are almost seen in other similar flicks. Sandler has been doing some good roles recently, but this one was even better. It's just a different kind of comedy which still suits him. Nothing to say about Stiller and the rest of the cast. They all as good as each other.

{"author":"jessetaylor","content":"_The Florida Project_ is a beautiful film about people and life and survival. Sean Baker has shown us the underbelly of American culture that we normally don't get to see; these people aren't known and are the outcasts of society. Much like Andrea Arnold's masterpiece from last year, _American Honey_, this film brings to light many issues that are insanely topical in the current American political climate such as classism and racism.\r\n\r\nGorgeously shot on 35mm, this film is a feast for the eyes. It uses every colour in the crayon box from the gloriously purple exterior to the dilapidated Magic Kingdom motel to the impossibly bright oranges, reds, and greens of the local shops where the kids venture every day. While plasticky and candy-like during the day scenes, the film is even more stunning at sundown - the dusty, sun-drenched shots here are sublime.\r\n\r\nEveryone has been abuzz about Willem Dafoe's performance in this. He's absolutely charming and is the glue that holds these dejected people's lives together in this film. He's the father figure to all of them and he does the absolute most with his character. The breakthrough star of this film, however, is 7-year-old Brooklynn Prince. She's an absolute superstar. During the Q&A at the North American premiere she wore a baby blue princess gown and simultaneously waved like Queen Elizabeth II and blew kisses at the audience as they gave her a standing ovation. Child performers lately have been better and better - remember how good Jacob Tremblay was in _Room_? Just you wait for Prince to wow you in this. She has a scene at the very end of the movie that requires her to break down and cry and it tore my heart out.","id":"59bb35e7c3a3680f0b004361","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59bb35e7c3a3680f0b004361","movie_id":394117}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The story of a Mountain Goat!**\r\n\r\nThis was like a combination of 'Captain Fantastic' and 'Infinitely Polar Bear'. But only a messed up tale than them. It was based on the book of the same name which originally a true story. A fascinating one. Inspiring, as well as heartbreaking story. But a wonderful film for families to watch. Because it focused on the family's unity in the difficult times. Told from a kid's perspective as she was growing up having suffered from basic facilities, along with her siblings.\r\n\r\nA family with a below poverty level, frequently moving from town to town, making a home in the remote places has one dream that they want to build their own glass castle, particularly for the kids. One of sibling who is close to her father, realises what's going on in the family and tries to find a solution to it. So it takes years to accomplish, and those years were narrated for us with so much fun and emotions.\r\n\r\nI love this kind of tales, When I came to know it that it was a memoir based, I loved it even more. True stories always reach my heart. This was just like I wanted. Enjoyed every bit of it, especially performances were top notch. One of the highlights was Ella Anderson. Find of the film, despite she has done other decent roles prior to it. Brie's not a great actress, but her choice of films always was the best, hence her part too was good in this.\r\n\r\nSecond feature film for the director, as well as with Brie. He was good though. Not to say anything about Harrelson, one of the under-rated actors of our generation. He should get the Oscar nominee for this role, but that's very unlikely I think. Naomi too has given a memorable performance with the rest of the cast. Forget the runtime, it was so fast and the always to points. Definitely one of the best of the year that must not be missed.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"5a771c20c3a3686b5101f682","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a771c20c3a3686b5101f682","movie_id":336000}

They and an attractive archaeologist (Annabelle Wallis) fly Ahmanet's sarcophagus to Britain when all hell breaks loose. Russell Crowe is also on hand. \r\n\r\n\"The Mummy\" (2017) is the reboot of The Mummy trilogy of 1999-2008 and the first official film in Universal\u2019s Dark Universe franchise, which reimagines & updates the classic universal monsters.  The producers flirted with the idea of \"Dracula Untold\" (2014) being part of the Dark Universe, and the epilogue of that movie set in the modern world suggested this, but the idea was dropped. While \u201cThe Mummy\u201d garnered $410 million worldwide, it was considered a disappointment and critics generally lambasted it.\r\n\r\nI found the modern setting a nice change of environment compared to the late 1920s-40s of the previous trilogy; it prevented it from being the same-old-same-old. I also didn't mind the various locations outside of ancient Egypt, e.g. northern Iraq and England; even Hammer's version from 1959 started in Egypt, but quickly moved to England. I also favored the switch to a female mummy and that the slightly convoluted story kept you guessing. So the flick gets points for NOT being one-dimensional and hackneyed. \r\n\r\nI enjoyed it for the most part, although it coulda been more compelling in the latter portions. It has the same spirit of high adventure of the 1999 movie mixed with gothic horror (including creepy zombies) and a bit o\u2019 comedy, but not too much. While the curious inclusion of Dr. Jekyll (Crowe) smacked of pushing the new franchise, it didn\u2019t ruin the viewing experience.

And then there's the beautiful cast. It was so perfect casting, each and everyone did their parts awesomely. So tell me who would bash such rare gem. Then the answer is like usual the film critics.\r\n\r\nAubrey Plaza is not a mainstream actress, but her films still make a stir. I enjoyed all her recent films and here's the another unique one. The third time she teamed up with the director, another decent comedy it was. Loosely based on the book, but it only spoofed. It tells the story of a convent of nuns somewhere in a lonely place. A new gardener joins them and the following events revealed as the thing that gets ugly and nasty. Many dark secrets unfold before it all ends.\r\n\r\nI suggest it to you if you are bored with regular comedies. It was not powerful or a tale with full of twists and turns, but watching it once surely works well. It was a film filled with adult comedies. So not suitable for all ages.

{"author":"Gimly","content":"Jackie Chan just keeps fuckin' bringing it doesn't he?\r\n\r\nThe serious tone of _The Foreigner_ fits him well, but the role he plays seems oddly shoehorned in. I understand that the movie is in actual fact based on a novel called _The Chinaman_, which I assume unfolds more or less as the film does. But the Troubles-themed Political Drama makes up most of the runtime in _The Foreigner_, and the Action\/Revenge Thriller element seems almost like at some point in pre-production the crew went \"Holy shit, did you know we can put Jackie Chan in this? Quickly! Write him a role!\". Although I'm sure that it's not the case, that is how it feels, and while the Action\/Revenge Thriller element is the best part of the movie, its failure to mesh with the piece at large does bring it all down a bit.\r\n\r\nStill a worthwhile watch if you're a fan of the Chan.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._","id":"5a4609309251417403068011","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a4609309251417403068011","movie_id":379149}

{"author":"jessetaylor","content":"My immediate response as soon as this finished was \"MASTERPIECE.\" Lanthimos is back to _Dogtooth_-level craziness with this film and I couldn't be happier. _The Lobster_ was a favourite of mine in 2016, but something about this one's hopelessness drew me in more - odd, I know. Lanthimos' films have characters stuck in dead end situations where they are able to make a choice, but the results of the options are bad and worse. It's a dour story and the film is relentlessly unsettling, but this is what I've come to expect and want out of this Greek maestro.\r\n\r\nSacred Deer is a suburban Greek tragedy that draws inspiration from Euripides\u2019 _Iphigenia in Aulis_ - a character even mentions this title in a key scene - and it plays out both as you'd imagine and with great shock and originality. Lanthimos and his writing partner Efthymis Filippou may just be my favourite writing team working today - they haven't let me down yet.\r\n\r\nThe cast is spectacular here with Nicole Kidman and Colin Farrell in top form bringing the odd words of Lanthimos and Filippou to life - albeit a very, very strange life. Farrell, having worked with Lanthimos on The Lobster, had nothing but high praise for the director during tonight's Q&A after the screening of the film. He even said they were planning another project to work on together. He's slowly becoming a muse and their relationship is turning into a DiCaprio-Scorsese type partnership (except I look forward to these way, way more).\r\n\r\nThe audience I was in had a hard time with this film - there was audible shock and disgust during the film and the applause as it ended was slight. I think people were genuinely scandalized by this one and that makes me like it even more. Keep shocking audiences, Lanthimos, you Greek bastard. I'll be in line every single time!","id":"59bb359ac3a3680ef0004b79","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59bb359ac3a3680ef0004b79","movie_id":399057}

The low-budget filmmaking is akin to \u201cStraight into Darkness\u201d (2004), but more straightforward and less surrealistic, although this one isn\u2019t as good. It\u2019s akin to a more dramatic \u201cWhen Trumpets Fade\u201d (1998) dubbed in English (from the original French), but made on a much lower budget and less compelling story-wise.\r\n\r\nArmchair critics lambaste the movie mainly because of the English dubbing that doesn\u2019t match the lips with some lines not dubbed at all wherein you\u2019ll see lips move, but no sound. If you can ignore this issue, \u201cThe Frozen Front\u201d is effective in showing what it was like for the tough soldiers who took the forests outside the village in January, 1945. The acting is surprisingly convincing despite what critics claim and the English speaking fits the characters despite the dubbing not matching the lips.\r\n\r\nThe challenges and horrors of war in a winter wilderness setting are chronicled: The cold, the sparse sustenance, living in foxholes, sudden violence, horrific wounds, buddies dying, ramshackle medical care, despair, perseverance, chaplains, brother vs. brother and hope for victory. \r\n\r\nThe writer\/director confidently takes his time in telling his commemorative tale, which I can\u2019t help respect. This is a movie solely about men fighting in the wintery woods during WW2, which might be too one-dimensional for many viewers, not to mention overlong by about an hour. Then there\u2019s the problematic dubbing. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 22 minutes, and was presumably shot in France (it was definitely shot in mainland Europe, but I can\u2019t find specific data).\r\n\r\nGRADE: C","id":"5ddc29484f58010012f7283c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ddc29484f58010012f7283c","movie_id":452739}

It was a well made film, based on the real, about the WWII. Actually, it all begins prior like in the 1939. The happy couple who was running one of the most notable zoo in all of Europe, in the Poland capital, suddenly started to lose the animals for nazi air raids. The remains were taken away when the city, the nation was invaded. Soon the empty enclosure becomes hideout for the Jeweish. But it is not an easy task, the consequences are serious. How the rest of the story folds out was a little emotional.\r\n\r\nThe best performance by Jessica Chastain continues. She's choosing the nice films and roles. I had expected a big name pairing up with her, but the Belgian actor was good in a small part. Like any WWII film, a heart-wrenching story. Everything was told from the zookeeper's perspective, particularly the wife.\r\n\r\nThe story also takes us outside the enclosure, with a series of glimpses of horror visuals that we had seen in other films. So it limits to what these people did, that's to shelter the Jewish community. Another WWII film from another perspective that one should see it. I've heard that some are saying it was not honest. All the true stories are not exact depictions of truth, but somewhat close, lets us know the facts.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Bend me, shape me, anyway you want me!\r\n\r\nGuillermo del Toro directs and co-writes with Vanessa Taylor what would turn out to be the Best Picture Academy Award Winner for 2017. A much loved film that's not without dissention in certain quarters, it's a picture that warrants dissention but it should be noted that just because someone doesn't like it, that doesn't make it a bad film. I'm certainly in the camp that finds it over praised, even annoyingly disappointing, whilst appreciating many of the facets within its production.\r\n\r\nStory in simple terms is a Beauty and the Beast like fable where Sally Hawkins' mute cleaning lady Elisa Esposito falls in love with a captured Amphibian Man. Amphibian Man is known by the government types as The Asset, and as the Cold War rises and 60s paranoia takes a hold, the American big wigs want to vivisect the special species to learn from it. Elisa, after courting \"The Asset\", enlists the help of close friends and plots to free the creature from its captivity in the underground medical bunker labyrinth place.\r\n\r\nNow as simple as that sounds, there is more to it than that, del Toro and Taylor whilst enveloping the pic in a fantasy realm feel, ensure messages are thrust hard at the viewers. Be it the racial disharmony, the quest for different walks of life finding love with each other, the cry for humans to stop being bad and killing things because they don't understand them, torture is evil and etc etc. It's all right there in your face and we get it. So plot maybe simple but for sure there's a lot being said in the narrative.\r\n\r\nYet as great as it looks, and it's superbly acted by Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer, it just to me loses its way come the mid-point, getting daft and even getting a little icky into the bargain. I have no problem with improbabilities and outrageous contrivances here, this is del Toro painting one of his fantastical worlds - only on Earth in the early 60s! But the pay off is poor, hinging on a twist that's not only ridiculous, but insulting as well because otherwise the pic would be very troubling indeed. No art deco eye orgasms or vibrant characterisations can compensate for a film that runs out of steam.\r\n\r\nThat said, I was glad to have watched it, there's even a possibility I could return to it in the future - this is very good film making. But it's not a great film by any stretch of the imagination and not for the first time in the Academy's long history, many are baffled by their choice of Best Picture winner. 6\/10","id":"5c201a0d9251411abcbfdf68","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c201a0d9251411abcbfdf68","movie_id":399055}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**What's your favourite thing about Earth?**\r\n\r\nYou might ask that question for yourself while\/after watching this film. This is not a great film, but surely different and enjoyable. This kind of storyline can be acceptable for the todays space ambition by the humans they have to accomplish. A couple of decades ago, it was called a fiction, still it is, but quite close to realistically possible.\r\n\r\nSo we had seen many films based on human connection with the red planet, Mars, but this one was a little different. It is romance theme, though not like east meets west. It is Mars meets Earth. The story of a boy from Mars and the girl from Earth. That's how it ends, but not that how it was initiated. It was the boy who searched for his connection with the Earth, and doing that, all the usual things happen, like some people come after him, like running and chasing.\r\n\r\nWell made film. It was not a complicated screenplay, but the twist was unexpected at the end yet I did not think it was strong. Explained everything with details, as well as intentionally added some of scenes to cover up later parts when the narration takes the unexpected route. Best cast for sure.\r\n\r\nBritt Robertson played the role ten years younger than her she is. But it does not matter, she still looks like a teenager. And Asa Butterfield was quite good too. The only usual thing about the film was the road adventure, though it did not take the usual route. Nothing was like you have already seen them. That's where it hand upper hand. The end was good, yet I felt it softened to bring a certain type of ending than a relevant one. Because it is a PG13 film and they wanted the conclusion that satisfy their target audience.

{"author":"panic jr8","content":"Oh gosh. Where do I even start. This film sucks. \r\n\r\nNow before I begin to tear this film into shreds, let me give you some background. I was excited for this movie. I love Tom Cruise. I love Sofia Boutella. I love Russell Crowe. I love the Universal Monsters. \r\n\r\nLets just say I was disappointed.\r\n\r\nThis film has some of the worst tonal problems in a film ever. An inconsistent tone is my biggest pet peeve. Sometimes it's scary. Sometimes it's a huge action blockbuster. Sometimes it's trying to be like Brendan Frasier's \"The Mummy.\" It doesn't know what it is.\r\n\r\nThe female lead (who's name I can't remember) is incredibly bland. Not her acting, she's actually quite good. It's the writing is what makes her bad. \r\n\r\nJake Johnson's character is one of the most annoying characters in a movie ever. And I mean that. I hated almost every scene he was in.\r\n\r\nThe few high notes: Sofia Boutella kills it. Russell Crowe is delightfully campy. Tom Cruise gives another solid performance despite his character being super unlikable.\r\n\r\nAlex Kurtzman is what hurts this film. The direction is quite bland. Kurtzman is a bad screenwriter and a just as bad director.\r\n\r\nThis film is a mess. Tonal problems and bland writing. Some fun action scenes and performances can't keep this film from being a boring trainwreck.\r\n\r\n1.3\/5.0","id":"59488c3dc3a36816f604c63b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59488c3dc3a36816f604c63b","movie_id":282035}

{"author":"Svumpukkel85","content":"Well acted effort from the main characters, and a fine script for this biography film. \r\n\r\nWhen you have PTSD you are stuck in time. And the feeling of being stuck and unable to escape the situation, is accurately described in the  psychological struggle of the veterans.\r\n\r\nTrauma rips you out of your safe reality, where you have grown up with dreams, goals, and appreciation of the small good things in life. Every one of these things has been destroyed in a blink of an eye for these soldiers. \r\nNow their life is put in a pause-mode, where they relieve the trauma feeling over and over and over again. And it eats them away, until they realize they has to deal with it.\r\n\r\nThe fight is not direct as in war, but they now have to fight for their sanity in a society that stigmatizes PTSD. \r\nTheir commanding officer belittles PTSD and the soldiers that had committed suicide. The healthcare is scarce or completely absent. And the bureaucracy makes it almost impossible to get help. This happens all the while their mental health is deteriorating and their family life is falling apart...\r\nNo wonder a lot of veterans give into suicide!\r\n\r\nTrauma is grim, horrifying and leaves you more scattered than ever. It is a state of confusion, helplessness and horror. \r\n\r\nMost people will experience trauma and PTSD during their lives, not just veterans. But many, comfort themselves with the thought that it wont happen to them. The effect of trauma is very difficult to understand, and therefore difficult to treat.  Therefore it is of utter importance that films like these are still being made, and stories like these is told, until we get better to understand, treat and comfort everyone that experience trauma.

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Honest, raw, and respectful_**\r\n\r\n> _I never really had a choice to be a cowboy. It was just in my blood. It was the way my family lived; grew up on horses my whole life. I would ride a horse all by myself when I was about a year-and-a-half. I don't really know anything else. I wouldn't have it any other way._\r\n\r\n- Brady Jandreau; \"Interview: Rodeo cowboy Brady Jandreau talks life before and after The Rider\" (Sari Cohen); _Axs.com_ (August 31, 2018)\r\n\r\nPartly an elegy for a dissipating way of life, partly an examination of the self-destructive components of contemporary masculinity, and partly a deconstruction of the iconography of the American frontier, _The Rider_ is the second film from Chinese-American writer\/director Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, and is intimately tied to her debut, _Songs My Brothers Taught Me_ (2015). Set in the same location in South Dakota, featuring the same _milieu_, and covering some of the same thematic ground, _The Rider_ also owes a more practical debt to _Songs_. When she was researching that film, Zhao met rodeo rider Brady Jandreau, who taught her how to ride a horse. Promising him she would cast him in one of her subsequent films, Zhao soon learned that Jandreau had sustained a serious cranial injury in a rodeo accident, and been told by doctors that he must give up the only way of life he had ever known, as another blow to the head could kill him. Inspired by his story, Zhao wrote _The Rider_, a loosely fictionalised version of Jandreau's experiences, in which she cast entirely non-professional actors, including the real Jandreau, his father, sister, and several of his friends, all playing versions of themselves. The result is a semi-fictional docudrama, and one of the finest films of the year.\r\n\r\nSet on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau) lives just above the poverty line with his father Wayne (Tim Jandreau) and his sister Lilly (Lilly Jandreau), who suffers from autism. Several months previously, Brady suffered a near-fatal head injury after falling from a bronco, which has left him with a huge scar on the side of his head, and ongoing neurological damage causing severe seizures in his right hand. Warned by doctors that if he attempts to ride again, a single innocuous fall could kill him, Brady finds his very sense of self challenged as he attempts to function in a society where every man lives by the maxim of \"_ride or die_\". No longer the rugged cowboy he believed himself to be, Brady takes a job stacking shelves in a local supermarket. However, feeling his life has become deeply unfulfilling, Brady begins to find the call of the rodeo increasingly difficult to ignore.\r\n\r\n_The Rider_ is most definitely not a plot-driven film. Consisting almost entirely of a series of vignettes showing Brady going about his day, rather than a well-thought-out cause-and-effect narrative, Zhao also shuns traditional character arcs, and expressive, writerly dialogue. However, this is not a criticism; rather, the form perfectly mirrors the content. Humanistic without resorting to mawkish sentimentality, empathetic without employing cheap emotional manipulation, and honest without rushing to judgement, although the film certainly does critique Brady's desire to ride again, so too does it respect the fact that this is the only thing which has ever given his life meaning. Zhao's superbly balanced screenplay is both tactful and subtle, graceful and understated, exhibiting a rare emotional probity that goes hand-in-hand with its expertly realised naturalistic style.\r\n\r\nIn depicting Brady's struggle with his new life, Zhao is able to simultaneously romanticize and demythologise the role of the cowboy in the contemporary United States. As the story progresses, the film comes more and more to express a sense of disillusionment with the lifestyle of Brady and his friends, with their \"damn the torpedoes\" attitude becoming increasingly exposed as bravado. Part of this is the theme of the rodeo itself. So eloquently panegyrised in the early parts of the film, the rodeo is also presented as leading to physical ruin and mental anguish. Indeed, one of the film's primary motifs is that of injuries sustained whilst riding. The men who espouse this lifestyle say things such as, \"_Cowboy up. Grit your teeth. Be a man_\", (spoken by Wayne), \"_rub some dirt in it_\" (advice offered on how to recover from injury), \"_ride through the pain_\", and, \"_head and ribs, all the same to a cowboy_\". Brady's friends also point out that if they can't ride, they'll have little option but to \"_become farmers_\", a road none wish to take.\r\n\r\nIn relation to this, it's extremely telling that literally every male Brady meets, from young boys to elderly men, all express their desire that he start riding again, although many of them know why he stopped. On the other hand, one of the few female characters tells him pointedly, \"_problem with you boys, you don't like to get your pride hurt_\". However, unlike most of his friends, who urge him to shake off the injury, Brady is self-aware enough to admit, \"_you know you'll get hurt, but you don't ever think you'll get hurt like that_\". But although he is able to admit that, by contrast, he is he unable to shake his love of riding, especially the romanticised nature of such, telling Lilly towards the end of the film, \"_God gives each of us a purpose. For a horse, it's to run across the prairie. For a cowboy, it's to ride_\". Brady and his friends are personifications of the ruggedness of the American West, and the film uses them to facilitate a deconstruction of the notions of contemporary masculinity which they represent.\r\n\r\nThat Brady is indeed a cowboy, and sees himself as such, is emphasised several times. For example, the film makes us aware that Pine Ridge was once the frontier, but is now a dying backwater, where everybody who can leave has already left. This is also where the theme of respect comes in \u2013 the self-destructive nature of the life Brady and friends live is more than simply an adrenaline addiction. Rather it offers them the validation which they are unable to find anywhere else. Yes, they see themselves as modern day-cowboys, in an age where cowboys serve no function \u2013 their clothes are classic movie cowboy (stetson, plaid shirt, dirty jeans, cowboy boots, bolo ties), and many of them (including Brady) even wear six-shooters. But this is the only life they have known, and whilst the film leaves the audience in little doubt that this lifestyle can lead to ruin, so too does it ensure the viewer knows that Zhao has the deepest respect for these guys, depicting, as it does, the kind of desperation and limited choices that leave a young man with only one route, a route which often overrides any common sense he may have.\r\n\r\nAn important distinction to be made here is that, yes, the film is about masculinity, but it is not about \"toxic masculinity\". Never once does it feel like Zhao is looking down on or satirising Brady and his friends. Rather, she's criticising the situation in which they find themselves; forced to live a life of bluster and posturing. But Zhao makes sure the audience understands at all times the honour and tradition to which they subscribe.\r\n\r\nThe most telling example of this is Lane (Lane Scott). As with the real-life Brady, Lane was a celebrated rodeo with a reputation for riding broncos no one else would touch. The embodiment of machismo, with a devil-may-care attitude, we see Lane at the height of his popularity via YouTube videos, adored by the women in the audience and envied by the men. However, as in the film, the real Lane is now almost completely paralysed, capable of communicating only by signing with his left hand, and living permanently in a care facility. The only difference between the real-life Lane and his fictional counterpart is that in reality, he was paralysed in a car crash, whereas in the film it was via riding. This differentiation is telling as it speaks to Zhao's thematic intent. However, as with the other riders, Lane is presented with a great deal of reverence, and never does it feel like the film is saying, \"look at what the rodeo did to this guy; he must be a total idiot.\"\r\n\r\nIn a sense, whilst the film partially recalls John Huston's _The Misfits_ (1961), its real thematic precursor is Darren Aronofsky's _The Wrestler_ (2008), an examination of male pride working against common sense, of professional dedication, of machoism gone awry. As with _The Wrestler_, the story of _The Rider_ is archetypal. _The Wrestler_ was about wrestling, but it could have been about any sport, and _The Rider_ is even more universal. Yes, it too could have been about any sport, but it could also have been about any environ in which a young male tries to balance the dangers of what he does with the possibility of some kind of reward (whether financial or spiritual) at the end of it all \u2013 a young bank robber up against a tough and determined cop (to quote Michael Mann's _Heat_ (1995), \"_risk versus reward_\"); a young boxer hoping he can make a better life for himself with just a couple more fights; a drug dealer hoping to stay off the radar of the drug lord he's crossed; a town where all the men work in the mines, or in a steel mill, or on a rig, and a young man joins the workforce despite knowing the risks involved.\r\n\r\nLooking at things aesthetically, the film opens with a shot of a horse during a storm, followed by loud thunder. The immediate impression is one of almost elemental forces \u2013 two extremes of nature coming together. This is immediately contrasted with Brady waking up and heading into his dingy bathroom to pluck off the staples holding the bandage on his still raw head wound. Thus, in just two shots, Zhao sets up the entire theme of the film \u2013 poetic rhetoric and romantic myths are all very well and good, but day to day mundanity can so often get in the way.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, the centrepiece of the film, and probably the most beautiful sequence, is when Brady decides the only opportunity of which he can avail to allow him to stay around horses without risking his life is to break in young broncos. The single-take shot where he breaks in an \"untrainable\" horse is searingly beautiful in its simplicity and elegance. The lack of edits gives it an unmanipulated emotional sense, whilst also meaning there can be no cheating \u2013 we're really watching Brady Jandreau break in a stubborn horse. The gentle approach he employs, the constant reassurances to the animal, the way he holds the rope, how he gets the horse used to someone on its back without actually getting all the up, his grace and intuition, his confidence; the totality is, simply put, achingly perfect. What we are seeing obviously comes from a deep natural inclination in the real-life Brady. You can't teach this kind of brilliance, no matter what the discipline is. Indeed, his gentle approach itself is completely at variance with such scenes in other westerns, where we're usually shown someone breaking in a horse by forcing it to respect them, and that in itself speaks as much to Zhao's theme as anything else. It's this sense of docudrama\/realism\/naturalism, whatever you want to call it, that really makes _The Rider_ stand out.\r\n\r\nIndeed, even the supporting characters, most of whom feature in only a few scenes, are well-rounded and nuanced. Take Wayne, for example. Yes, he's not much of a father, beaten down by loss and regret, he drinks too much and gambles money the family don't have. But he clearly loves both Brady and Lilly, he obviously deeply misses his wife and is unsure how to live without her (just as Brady is unsure how to live without the rodeo), and he understands Brady's passion but is also supportive of whatever it is his son ultimately decides to do. In a lesser film, he would be the token villain, unable to fathom why his son behaves the way he does, until a huge blow-off emotional moment at the end when father and son are forced to see one another in a different light. _The Rider_ has no time for such scenes, and is all the better for it.\r\n\r\nIf I had one criticism, it would be that the film runs out of momentum a little in the third quarter, although it picks up again in the last 20 minutes or so. However, aside from that, I literally cannot find a bad thing to say about this film.\r\n\r\nBleak but beautiful, honest, but deeply respectful, realistic but profoundly poetic, Zhao's depiction of a dying culture, a dying breed, a dying way of life \u2013 the adrenaline-junkie bronco riders, America's modern cowboys \u2013 is easily one of the finest films of the year. And how ironic is it that one of the best examinations of American masculinity that you're likely to see in a long time is written and directed by a woman? And a woman born in China to boot. That's sure to irritate the misogynists\/xenophobes no end!","id":"5ceb20730e0a266683ce123d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ceb20730e0a266683ce123d","movie_id":453278}

Instead it opts for an outright uncomfortable tone. The world is real, boringly so, and it is only the characters who seem unbelievable.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The first in the Universal studio's 'Dark Universe'!**\r\n\r\nIf you see the history, the reboots usually fails. It has to be at least half a century old to reboot like 'King Kong'. So the technology advantage would play a major role. It was less than the 20 years, the last 'The Mummy' film had released and pretty impressed everybody with modern visual effects. Even today's young generation getting used to that when it was played on the television. Comparing this to that, there's nothing much other than more perfection in graphics and additional digital 3D. In my opinion, they should have waited another decade.\r\n\r\nIt was exactly reversed version of the 1999 film. I mean the character designs. Like female mummy coming to life and targeting a man for the ultimate power possession. Two US army men in Iraq found a hidden tomb like structure from the Egyptian era beneath the sand. The recovered ancient coffin shipped to England, but the plane crash down. Since then, an unknown force begins to hunt down one of that two army men. Fighting against it, followed by how the story ends comes in the later parts.\r\n\r\nWhen I first heard about the reboot, I said oh no! Hearing about Tom Cruise's involvement, it became double no! Actually, he was good in the film, but the film was unnecessary at this generation. Even though it did good at the box office, it was considered a decent run. But the studio has a bigger plan, that you would know if you watch the film, that they had already developed a plot for at least two more films with enough characters to carry on that long. If needed, it would add more in the latter. I feel that's a bad idea right now. Watching it one time is not bad, but no special at all.\r\n\r\n_5.5\/10_","id":"59fe1fe2c3a3686853025553","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59fe1fe2c3a3686853025553","movie_id":282035}

Cate Blanchett as the villainess Hela, the Goddess of Death, is a far better villain that TDW's lame Malekith. Kat Dennings' annoying Darcy and Natalie Portman's bland Jane are not missed at all.

Jeff Goldblum is hilarious as Grandmaster, who runs the gladiator fights on the planet Sakaar. But the real pleasure of the movie is watching the love-hate brother relationship between Thor and his adoptive brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The relationship between the two men was the only redeeming feature of TDW, and it's great to see it expanded in this movie.

You would think that with so many \"Mummy\" films of the past already on the market this new lease of life would be giving us, well, something new to gorge on, but what we actually get is a painfully familiar.\r\n\r\nFrom a summer blockbuster audience pleaser point of view it has the requisite effects work, it's loud, rambunctious and has Cruise and Crowe for star wattage, but Cruise is going through the motions, Crowe is laughably miscast (with a later dreadful accent issue to compound the misery), while the rest of the cast play second fiddle to the over egged effects work.\r\n\r\nIt's neither dark enough as a head bothering thinker or witty enough to tickle the funny bone, in fact it at times is very dull. There's also the worrying attempts at crossing over into further creature feature ventures, a big reveal for a main character is sloppily handled, whilst the finale lands as flat as a pancake.\r\n\r\nThere's some nice touches, the \"Mummy\" design is sharp (love those eyes), a plane crash is exhilarating and the film's stand out sequence, and the tomb\/prison design is neat, but after that you start to scratch around for positives, which in itself tells a story. At least it looks and sounds great in HD, the colours and sub-woofer shakes a treat for the senses.\r\n\r\nIt's all well and good people asking for it not to be judged by other Mummy films, but the creators here make that inevitable. Lifting the plot from one of the 1940's films, and even stealing a scene from the Stephen Sommers school of Mummy film making.

But did not focused on the actual war. A fictional drama that followed an injured soldier who sheltered in a girls school was looked after well by the stayed back teachers and students. While he was recovering, fallen in love with one of the women. But everybody else too had a little crush on him since he's the one man around. That causes a bump, following a twist in the tale, all comes to halt.\r\n\r\nA simple and nice drama. Best picks for the roles. But Kristen Dunst did not sync-in with the rest of the girls. Nice clothings too, a perfect recreation of the mid 19th century. I enjoyed it, good for watching at once, but I bet those who watched both the version would go for the old one. Especially for Clint Eastwood. Though Colin Ferrell was not bad in this.

On the weekends, watching it with a bunch of friends on the streaming platform or television would do better.\r\n\r\nThe story was much better than I anticipated. It was about the parents who lost their daughter's college scholarship, now wants an alternative solution, so they decide to go illegal. I mean gamble and then they make one, a gambling house. The consequence of it haunts them and what happens later is the film's end.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay writer's directional debut. The cast was just good.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The baby on a mission!**\r\n\r\nIf you ask anybody from the pre 90s, they would say their love for animated feature started with 'Toy Story'. But mine was DreamWorks' 'Antz'. So this production house might not be as good as Disney or Pixar, but still a better one than the rest of those who are in the same business, except Sony who comes equal. I wanted this film to be good, yeah, it is a box office hit, but not critically. The regular animated film goer accepted it. And I think as well, it is entertaining, so much fun in parts, if not the entire film.\r\n\r\nThe story of a boy whose happy life being an only child has taken away from his newborn little brother. Then one day he discovers the baby could speak and came to the house with a bigger plan. Knowing what it is and joining hands with him to tackle is what the remaining narration covers. Quite fun film. Animation, story and all the adventures were good. The voice-over was great. Alec Baldwin was awesome, but it's fair to praise the technicians, the animators.\r\n\r\nAt first, I thought some of the jokes were rude, if the film is for families, particularly for the kids. But when I watched the rest of the film, it did not look going anymore worse. A simple story and predictable, but it was enjoyable, that makes you forget yourself for a while. Despite the mixed response in acceptance, I've heard the sequel is on, in a couple of years. I think it is a good decision, even the storyline, how it ended encourages that. It's not going to be your favourite animated film, but surely not to be missed if you love animation.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"598ca739c3a3686b6e000ab3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/598ca739c3a3686b6e000ab3","movie_id":295693}

Basically, that's very common platform where 80 per cent of the films borrow from. The scenes looked very ordinary, like there's nothing much to explore. The jokes were weaker, the characters were uninteresting in most of the parts. I would say they did not utilise them rightly. The good thing is, it is a watchable film, but the majority won't like it.

Will any of them make it out alive? \r\n\r\nThis is basically a meshing of \u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d (1999) and \u201cOgre\u201d (2008), but without the tongue-in-cheekiness of the latter. There\u2019s also a little bit of \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d (1973\/2006).

The second half deviates from the book and people complain about it, but it\u2019s superior to the lame black metal cult of the book IMHO and you can\u2019t beat one potent sequence that smacks of hell-on-earth.

Like Kashyap\u2019s impressive gangster epic The Gangs of Wasseypur, this is gritty, grubby film-making. The dialogue is robustly filthy, the violence unflinching and the music loaded with innuendo. And while the fight sequences lack polish, the plot points are pounded home with fists, feet and iron bars.\r\n\r\n\r\nShravan (Vineet Kumar Singh) is the true hero of this film. His is a tremendous performance, not least because of his staggeringly authentic physicality. Singh looks the part, from the way his t-shirt sleeve cuts into his biceps like tightly tied twine to the agility with which he skips in the ring, and his arduous workouts immediately put glossier Hindi film heroes in their place. He makes Shravan real, when he's throwing punches as well as when he's vulnerable.\r\n\r\n\r\nRavi Kishan blew me away with his role as a sincere Dalit coach, one who grew up idolising Pele, wasn't allowed to box, but is an athlete and sits bolt upright, even when being insulted.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow about the film's villain, Bhagwan - the coach named God - but Jimmy Shergill, bloodshot eyes and menacing rage, is incredible.

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"The _Lego_ film franchise had a nice run in its first two outings. The phenomenal response to 2014\u2019s _The Lego Movie_ and, earlier this year, the popular emergence of _The Lego Batman Movie_ proved profitable and entertaining for the gimmicky concept that inexplicably captured the imaginations of youngsters and oldsters alike. The appeal for the yellowish block toy figures was undeniably infectious at the box office\u2019 while leaving one wondering what was next in line for the _Lego_-mania to explore in terms of a creative nod.\r\n\r\nWell, the third time around for this animated film franchise does not necessarily invite any charm for the toy-making product that found its welcomed footing in 2011 from its Danish originators. Hence, **The Lego Ninjago Movie** is the current rain on the treasured parade of the first two installments because this flaccid fantasy shows signs of an inspired treat that has gone tepid. Clearly, **Ninjago** is the bottom rung of the laughter ladder despite its occasional invitation of free-spirited gags.\r\n\r\nIt is a crying shame that **Ninjago** struggles with its irreverent approach because the whole affair feels synthetically forced in throwaway goofiness. One would think that a third sequel to a catchy _Lego_ landscape would not peter out after just a trilogy of films. There is no excuse for **Ninjago** to wallow in breezy mediocrity when it boasts three directors, an army of collaborative writers and a host of who\u2019s who in terms of the top-notch vocal performers that commit to this flimsy fantasy. Indeed, the majority of kiddies will probably eat this latest project up without reservation. However, some of these tykes may still wonder why the spark for these young kung fu plastic protagonists may lack the frivolous flavor as experienced in the aforementioned _Lego_ predecessors. This suggestion might be simply straight-forward and logical: skip the sluggish humor of **Ninjago\u2019s** exhaustive display of tired antics and revisit the original blueprint\u2013the TV series _Lego Ninjago: Masters Of Spinjitsu_. \r\n\r\nThe premise behind Ninjago involves a band of high schoolers whose secret identities as ninjas are sacred. The fighting force consists of the following young heroes: Lloyd aka The Green Ninja (Dave Franco), Cole (Fred Arisen), Kai (Michael Pena), Zane (Zach Woods), Jay (Kumail Nanjiani) and Nya (Abbi Jacobson). Specifically, Lloyd is at the center of major angst given that his father is the notorious Lord Garmadon (Justin Theroux). Apparently, the villainous Lord Garmadon has a corruptible urge to terrorize the city of Ninjago\u2026something that does not sit well with the skillful young ninjas. Naturally, there is an understandable estrangement between the heroic and conscientious son Lloyd and his devil-dealing Daddy Dearest Garmadon. Yeah\u2026this is ripped from the _Star Wars _playbook with the intentional Luke Skywalker\/Darth Vader dynamic in full circle. Of course, this is a heavy torment for Lloyd because he has to carry this overwhelming secret that his deplorable old man is the team\u2019s chief nemesis.\r\n\r\nPredictably, Lloyd and his butt-kicking buddies follow their instincts as they are the only real deal in town that can confront the wicked warlord and his minions. Lord Garmadon will stop it at nothing to torture the souls of Ninjago which, incidentally, is a city made up of\u2026you guessed it\u2026Lego blocks.

Still, the fruitless film does nothing to ignite anything distinctive or fresh besides its pandering pulse to push Lego merchandise as a commercialism crossover of sorts. Sure, the previous two editions had the same agenda but at least there was a pretense of a constructed story of impish ideas, off-the-cuff smirking and inventive heartiness that fueled the _Lego_ lunacy as engineered by the Phil Lord\/Chris Miller oiled production machine. Sadly,** Ninjago** goes through the disjointed motions with slapdish action, lazy jokes but eye-popping set pieces that hopefully will encourage the tykes to purchase Lego toys in droves for the upcoming holiday sales.\r\n\r\nHonorable mention goes to Theroux\u2019 dastardly take on the devious demon Garmadon, one of the few saving graces for the grown-ups to embrace in this wacky wasteland of yellow-faced toy pegs that failed to hit any tangy targets in its questionable brand of joyous absurdity. Plus, it is a momentary thrill to see martial arts icon Jackie Chan, both in real flesh and animation, doing double duty as both a wise old guide Master Wu using his wisdom to guide the courageous youthful ninjas on their quest for righteousness as well as garrulous shopkeeper spinning ancient tales.\r\n\r\nOne is not quite sure where the true forum for **The Lego Ninjago Movie** should be promoted\u2026on the straight-to-video shelves or merely being trapped in a cluttered toy box with other forgettable action figures.\r\n\r\n**The Lego Ninjago Movie** (2017)\r\n\r\ncast:  Jackie Chan, Olivia Munn, Justin Theroux, Dave Franco, Fred Armisen, Abbi Jacobson, Michael Pena, Kumail Nanjiani and Zach Woods\r\n\r\nWarner Bros.

{"author":"gregbutler1","content":"by THOMAS BLAKE on 8 JANUARY, 2016\r\nin FILM, FOLK MUSIC REVIEWS\r\n\r\nViv Stanshall, Syd Barrett, Kevin Ayers, Robyn Hitchcock, Frank Sidebottom, Richard Dawson \u2013 England has always done a good line in wilfully obscure or idiosyncratic songwriters, so much so that the term \u2018English eccentric\u2019 has become something of an unutterable music critic clich\u00e9. When everyone from Ray Davies to PJ Harvey to Screaming Lord Sutch gets lumped under the same banner it might just indicate lazy music writers, or it might mean that there really is something in the ale that nurtures these outsider talents and endears them to the listener.\r\n\r\nOne such talent is David Thomas Broughton. Broughton hails from Otley in Yorkshire, an eccentric place in it own right (it is home to five active Morris dancing sides, which is impressive for a town of fewer than 14,000 inhabitants). He has lived in both North and South Korea, where he somehow managed to indulge his passion for ornithology. He plays loop pedal and a guitar, and sings. In the last ten years he has released upwards of half a dozen albums, as well as a couple of EPs, despite having little or no interest in the music business.\r\n\r\nJust your average reclusive folky type, you might think. But you\u2019d be wrong. For one thing, he is far from reclusive. A frequent live performer, his shows can be confrontational, intimate or bizarre. And, as a new film sets out to prove, there is nothing average about Broughton\u2019s approach to composition or performance.\r\n\r\nThere is a clip less than three minutes into Greg Butler\u2019s documentary, The Ambiguity of David Thomas Broughton, in which we are shown a heavily industrialised landscape, presumably Korean, hazed by pollutants, grim and unlovely. The scene cuts to footage of a pageant of unicyclists and people dressed as eggs. Over it all swoons music of beautiful, looped ambience, sounding almost like the cry of a gull, but coaxed into soft lapidary forms. These few seconds are Broughton in microcosm: delirious and exalted, obdurately ugly and superbly surreal. For the next hour Butler\u2019s film teases out these convergent strands to form a portrait of Broughton the creation and Broughton the human. What it finds is a shy, angry, self-mythologising presence. A melancholic comic. A singer of fragile folk songs and a destroyer of those very same songs.\r\n\r\nTalking heads abound. We get anecdotal insights into Broughton\u2019s home life from various family members. Fellow musicians and artists, collaborators and friends (including Shearwater\u2019s Jonathan Meiburg), give their opinions. In this way it is a fairly straightforward music documentary. But it is the subject rather than the form that the real interest lies, and here the subject comes across as an entirely unique person.\r\n\r\nThe most entertaining tales involve Broughton\u2019s onstage antics. At one gig he includes amongst his vast array of anti-musical instruments a personal attack alarm, switching it on and hurling it into the crowd, only to have it pelted back at him by an angry punter who can\u2019t hear the songs. Unsurprisingly, given the uncompromising nature of his shows, Broughton has developed some effective methods of dealing with hecklers, as is shown in some excellent festival footage.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a heartening amount of the film focuses on the live performances. This is where we see Broughton at his most ambiguous and contradictory, his most inexplicable and wonderful. His remarkable voice \u2013 imagine, if you can, a cross between Alfred Deller and Antony Hegarty, tempered with the bluff Yorkshire tones of early Jarvis Cocker \u2013 seems to be his primary instrument, backed with some innovative acoustic guitar. But then that loop pedal kicks in, and with it, seemingly, all the junk and ephemera of Broughton\u2019s life. Found sounds, found objects. Pathos sabotaged by bathos. Dadaist interruptions and surrealist non-sequiturs. Live shows become glorious messes. One of the most important and intriguing aspects of Broughton\u2019s work \u2013 and something that is explored in welcome depth by Butler and the film\u2019s contributors \u2013 is the idea of self-sabotage. There always seem to be two Broughtons at work: one creating effortlessly beautiful pieces of art and the other scrawling over these creations with iconoclastic (but supremely imaginative) vigour. This ambiguity runs right through his personality, so much so that nobody seems to know where the often crazed and sometimes angry persona ends and the real, shy, thoughtful Broughton begins.\r\n\r\nThe Ambiguity of David Thomas Broughton is an unshowy film. This is no bad thing \u2013 it creates a space that is filled with Broughton\u2019s complex personality and equally complex talent. It also serves as a valuable introduction to this most under-appreciated and fame-shy of artists. And, aptly, it ends with some excellent archive footage from the End of the Road festival which includes a serenade to a discarded sausage.","id":"5697e785c3a3687608000449","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5697e785c3a3687608000449","movie_id":377490}

Scheduled for a prime awards-season release on December 22 (shortly thereafter changed to November 24), and with a number of heavyweight producers (Timur Bekmambetov, Basil Iwanyk, Harvey Weinstein) and executive producers (Martin Scorsese, Bob Weinstein, Steven Zaillian), the film was to be distributed by The Weinstein Company, with Harvey in particular known for his ruthlessly efficient Oscar campaigns. He was overseeing the assemblage of the final cut in October when he was accused of sexual assault and rape by numerous women, and when he abandoned the project, the November release was shelved. Little more was heard of the film until October 2018, when Lantern Entertainment (which had acquired The Weinstein Company's assets) and 13 Films brokered a deal to co-distribute the film internationally in July 2019. Then, in April of this year, 101 Studios announced they would handle a limited release in North America in October, whilst director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon (_Me and Earl and the Dying Girl_) revealed he had re-edited the film, adding five additional scenes but trimming the overall run time by 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nSo is it worth the wait? Well, it's competently acted, reasonably entertaining, and moderately informative, but...it definitely won't be involved in the 2020 Oscars. It's certainly not as bad as a lot of critics (most of them reviewing the TIFF cut) have made out, but there's no denying that Gomez-Rejon over-directs the whole thing. If you listen to Paul Haggis's commentary track on _Crash_ (2004), he tells a story about a scene which was filmed to begin with an elaborate camera move via a crane transitioning into a dolly shot. In the final film, however, all of that is gone, and Haggis explains that he realised during the edit that the camera moves were unjustified, doing little but drawing attention to themselves. A _lot_ of _The Current War_'s aesthetic draws attention to itself, primarily because Gomez-Rejon's elaborate direction is so out of sync with Michael Mitnick's by-the-numbers script \u2013 like a screenplay intended for Michael Bay ended up being directed by Michael Mann. Although make no mistake, Gomez-Rejon is no Mann.\r\n\r\nTelling the story of the \"war of the currents\", the film opens in New Jersey in 1880 as the pioneer of the long-lasting electric light bulb, Thomas Edison (Benedict Cumberbatch proving once and for all that he can't do an American accent), stages a typically grandiose demonstration of the power of large-scale low-voltage direct current (DC). When Edison next illuminates five square blocks of Manhattan, George Westinghouse (an uncharacteristically non-psychotic Michael Shannon), best known as the inventor of the railway air brake, begins to consider that the way of the future is not in gas, as he previously believed, but in electricity. However, he sees flaws in DC, and so favours high-voltage alternating current (AC), using transformers to step down the voltage. Edison's is the safer of the two systems, but so too is it more expensive, with a limited range compared to AC. To highlight this very point, Westinghouse illuminates Great Barrington, Massachusetts from over a mile away. He invites Edison to discuss a partnership, but Edison, who believes Westinghouse has stolen his ideas, snubs him, and the rest of the film takes place over the next 13 years as the two men come into direct conflict with one another in the \"race to light America\". As Edison begins to lose ground to Westinghouse, he takes the decision to grossly overstate the danger of AC, whilst also surreptitiously attempting to convince the city of New York to use AC in its proposed first \"electric chair\" execution, thus tainting Westinghouse's brand. The rivalry culminates in 1893 as each attempt to secure the contract for the World's Columbian Exposition (aka the Chicago World's Fair). Along the way we meet such people as Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla (an underused Nicholas Hoult); Edison's loyal to a fault assistant Samuel Insull (Tom Holland); Westinghouse's chief electrical engineer Franklin Pope (Stanley Townsend); Edison's wife Mary (Tuppence Middleton); Westinghouse's wife Marguerite (Katherine Waterston); Edison's main financial backer J.P Morgan (Matthew Macfadyen); and the first man to be executed via electrocution, William Kemmler (Conor MacNeill).\r\n\r\nOriginally conceived as a stage musical by Mitnick, thematically, a great deal of _The Current War_'s concerns remain unstated; yes, it's obviously about the war of the currents, but there's more to it than that. Edison and Westinghouse are presented as opposite examples of the nature of success in an American free-market prospering during a period of immense technological innovation. Whilst Edison is driven by legacy and fame, Westinghouse simply wishes to improve people's lives and is unconcerned with celebrity. Important here is Tesla, who is essentially a foil for the two leads, as the film details his inability to remain under Edison's employment, stating his desire to \"detach power from profit\", a concept utterly alien to Edison, for whom power _is_ profit.\r\n\r\nEdison is depicted as aware of and addicted to his celebrity, a visionary enamoured of his own genius, convinced that he and he alone has the mental capacity to achieve success. He's also portrayed as a poor husband and father, and a lousy boss, who demands that his employees' dedication match his own. On the other hand, the more stable, less flamboyant Westinghouse is devoted to his wife, values his collaborators, has no interest in fame, and doesn't even see Edison as competition, believing that they should be working together. Indeed, the film goes so far as to suggest that Edison knew Westinghouse's system was the superior of the two but stubbornly refused to yield, ultimately employing baseless fear as a weapon.\r\n\r\nThe most immediately notable aspect of _The Current War_, however, is its aesthetic, specifically Gomez-Rejon's direction and the photography by Chung Chung-hoon (_Oldeuboi_; _Ahgassi_; _It: Chapter One_). Watching the film, I was reminded somewhat of Adrian Martin's 1992 article, \"_Mise-en-sc\u00e8ne_ is dead, or the expressive, the excessive, the technical and the stylish\", in which he divides _mise-en-sc\u00e8ne_ into three broad categories: classical (\"_in which there is a definite stylistic restraint at work_\"), expressive (\"_general strategies of colour coding, camera viewpoint, sound design and so on enhance or reinforce the general \"feel\" or meaning of the subject matter_\"), and mannerist (\"_performs out of its own trajectories, no longer working unobtrusively at the behest of the fiction_\"). Whilst I would posit that _The Current War_ lands somewhere between the expressive and mannerist styles, it definitely lies closer to the \"all style, no substance\" paradigm of mannerist _mise-en-sc\u00e8ne_, rather than the synergy between form and content found in the work of most expressive filmmakers (one of Martin's examples of which is the aforementioned Michael Mann). \r\n\r\nSome of Gomez-Rejon's aesthetic choices are definitely justified, arising directly from the content and serving a clear thematic purpose, but a lot of the aesthetic design is in service of nothing but itself. An early example of a justified decision is when the camera pans up from Edison's New Jersey demonstration and quickly travels to Westinghouse's Pittsburgh home in what is made to appear a single shot (the unconvincing CGI is beside the point). The effect is to connect the two men, not just in terms of geography, but, more importantly, ideology. Another shot in this scene, shooting directly down on Edison's elaborate circular light demonstration, also works well, serving to instantly show us his ambition and theatricality, plus the effectiveness of the demonstration itself. Once we reach Pittsburgh, a lengthy single-take shot introduces us to Westinghouse as he weaves his way through a throng of guests at a ball, with virtually everyone trying to catch his attention. This immediately establishes him as a man of influence and considerable reach, but one who abhors the spotlight. In a later scene, Gomez-Rejon shoots Edison and his family in a train carriage, but using a very wide fisheye lens. With Edison on one seat and his wife and two children facing him, the wide lens distorts the space between them unnaturally, mirroring the important theme of Edison neglecting and moving away from his family in pursuit of his goals.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some of the choices are extremely hard to rationalise. That this should be important is attested by Thomas Elsaesser and Warren Buckland in their 2002 book, _Studying Contemporary American Film: A Guide to Movie Analysis_. During their analysis of Martin's tryptic division, they say of the mannerist style, \"_style is autonomous, for it is not linked to function, but draws attention to itself. In other words, style is not motivated or justified by the subject matter, but is its own justification_\". This is an apt a description of large portions of _The Current War_ as you're going to find. For example, there are more Dutch angles than I've seen in a film since Oliver Stone's _Natural Born Killers_ (1994), but unlike Stone's usage, when and how Gomez-Rejon deploys them is more often than not arbitrary. He also uses split-screen on occasion, and at one point, he even splits the screen into three. Again though, the reason why he employs such a technique is unclear (compare it with something like Darren Aronofsky's _Requiem for a Dream_ (2000), where every use of split-screen is wholly justified by the narrative). This ripped me out of the film, as I constantly found myself asking, \"_I wonder why he did that_\", rather than paying attention to the content. Ironically enough, whilst the idea was obviously to cover up for the script's inadequacies via aggressive aesthetic energy, the fact that so few of Gomez-Rejon's techniques are justified actually draws our attention to that script, as no amount of directorial gymnastics can cover the structural and pacing problems.\r\n\r\nThe handling of the characters is also problematic. Cumberbatch, for example, plays Edison as virtually identical to his portrait of Alan Turing in Morten Tyldum's _The Imitation Game_ (2014); a brilliant, driven, uncompromising innovator who's as difficult to relate to in terms of humanity as he is easy to admire for mental acumen. Elsewhere, the film has a habit of downplaying the supporting characters. For example, neither Mary Edison nor Marguerite Westinghouse are developed beyond \"supportive wife\", whilst Insull gets just one decent scene, which comes so late as to be fairly meaningless. The worst example of this is, however, is the depiction of Tesla, who is very much an afterthought, so under-developed that one wonders if it would have been better to leave him out altogether. This tendency is also found in a postscript which credits Edison, and Edison alone, with the development of the Kinetoscope (one of the first motion picture cameras), without so much as a mention of Louis Le Prince or William Kennedy Dickson. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, as serious as these problems are, I rather enjoyed _The Current War_. Granted, that may be because I've always been drawn more to expressive _mise-en-sc\u00e8ne_, preferring _auteur_s who aren't afraid to employ an aesthetic signature, as opposed to those who are happy to disappear behind the work, _\u00e1 la_ someone like Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott, or Ron Howard. It was never going to be the kind of Oscar contender that was obviously intended, but the behind-the-scenes turmoil and the critical mauling are not necessarily indicative of an inherently bad film. Sure, the script is very weak in places, and Gomez-Rejon employs every camera trick known to man, more often than not without knowing why. But for all that, it kept me interested, and although I'd never argue it's an especially well-realised historical drama, I did, for the most part, enjoy it.","id":"5d8d5a9e5b370d00298c93e5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d8d5a9e5b370d00298c93e5","movie_id":418879}

The thing is, I was having way too much fun to care. \r\n\r\nFrom the comic-book text overlays to the major twists and turns to the child-engineering-prodigy trope to the humor-gore, I really, thoroughly enjoyed this movie. \r\n\r\nThe tone started off as a comedy\/coming-of-age story, but when it decided to delve into horror, it really delved into horror. It kept some of the comedic and coming-of-age elements, but from the first instance of horror on, it was without a doubt a horror movie, just a dang fun one.\r\n\r\nI'd imagine this is a rather polarizing film. Either people will love some of the wackiness, or they'll feel it gets in the way of what The Babysitter could be. From some people, there will be eye-rolling and snickering, and from others, there will be belly laughs and big smiles. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend checking it out, but don't go in expecting a serious movie, or you'll be rather disappointed.","id":"5da254212efe4e0012ef6ca3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5da254212efe4e0012ef6ca3","movie_id":419479}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Well, there are a couple of things that one can praise **The Bye Bye Man** for in an attempt to give this incredibly unoriginal teen screen horror showcase some flimsy credit. For starters, **The Bye Bye Man** continues the tradition of being another unforgettable goosebump saga to become meager fodder in the cinematic dumping ground of the new year movie season in January where a majority of flaccid frightening farces go on to linger in obscurity. Secondly, one must admit that the film\u2019s title is somewhat catchy-sounding (okay, most of you may dismiss it as \u201cdumb\u201d). Otherwise, waving off the dullness of **The Bye Bye Man** is the only satisfaction that warrants one\u2019s indifference to this piece of faceless slasher sludge.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, **The Bye Bye Man** is a collaborative effort by the husband-wife team of screenwriter Jonathan Penner and director Stacy Title. Title, a veteran of a few anemic scare tactic features that include 2007\u2019s _Snoop Dogg\u2019s Hood of Horror_ and 1999\u2019s _Let the Devil Wear Black_, shows little imagination here as the direction is woefully stillborn and contributes to the cheaply-made quality of this breathless boofest. Penner, mostly known to American television audiences as a three-time contestant on the long-running reality TV series _Survivor_ (2000-present) as well as a one-time Academy Award nominee, delivers a spotty and mundane script that does not even begin to challenge his intentions on presenting a macabre presentation looking to tackle the meaty psychology of what makes the misguided motivations of man so intriguing. Basically, **The Bye Bye Man** is banal and has no true backbone on which to ride this amateurish thrill-ride to the formulaic gates of gore.\r\n\r\nIn confusing fashion, the film\u2019s opening features a shotgun-wielding man mowing down random folks in cold blood. During his carnage he repeatedly warns his unsuspecting prey (or more so convincing himself as a personal reminder) to \u201cDon\u2019t think of it, don\u2019t say it!\u201d. This repetitive phrase is uttered over and over but it does not stop this mad man from committing his heinous crimes back in the late 1960\u2019s in woodsy Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nThe story skips to modern-day Wisconsin where the setting involves some college kids rejecting their dorms for off-campus living in a decrepit house not far from their university. Sweethearts Elliott and Sasha (Douglas Smith and Cressida Bonas) and athletic buddy John (Lucien Laviscourt) take up residence in the deteriorating place and it does not take long before Elliott discovers the scribbling message \u201cDon\u2019t think it, don\u2019t say it!\u201d on wooden furniture not to mention the creepy cretin whose words he reads with curiosity\u2013The Bye Bye Man. Conveniently, a fourth friend joins in the mix in goth chick Kim (Jenna Kennell) whose expertise in the occult helps bring about what amounts to be the strange haunting of the titular troublemaker outed courtesy of Kim\u2019s impromptu seance.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the inquisitive Elliott wants to research the backstory of The Bye Bye Man and ends up turning to a source that was terrorized by the crazed character\u2013a journalist that luckily survived the confrontation with the murderous misfit in the 60\u2019s. Also, the journalist provides the scoop for Elliott as he explains the eerie legend behind what drives The Bye Bye Man\u2019s sadistic impulses. As long as one does not mention his name or think about him then the curse of his maniacal manner can be eradicated. In other words, refraining from having The Bye Bye Man\u2019s name on your lips can allow you to survive another day but should you defy his wishes then you are toast. Plain and simple. Are you shaking in your boots yet, gang?\r\n\r\nSadly, **The Bye Bye Man** is nothing more than a convoluted creeper that does not have much execution behind its gimmicky, shadowy mask. This hackneyed horror dud wants to build some kind of off-kilter mythology and tries to give the ole college try in soul-searching the warped motivations for thirsty mass murdering mayhem. Unfortunately, this junk-minded jolt session is transparent in thrills while harboring the same old sketchy CGI special effects and tossing around disposable characterizations that we actually do not mind **The Bye Bye Man** terminating just to supply the unintentional chuckles. This lifeless nail-biter is as original as finding plasma bags at your local blood drive. Cinema spouses Title and Penner concoct a feeble frightfest that never resonates beyond the film\u2019s idiotic need to reinforce the caustic catchphrase \u201cDon\u2019t think it, don\u2019t say it!\u201d as if this brings some sort of shady sheen to this dreadfully generic affair.\r\n\r\nThe mystery concerning The Bye Bye Man\u2019s ominous slaughtering certainly does not match the mystery concerning why veteran Academy Award-winning actress Faye Duaway is on board as the widow of the killing name-phobic nemesis as her character cannot explain the troubling proceedings of her ex. Hey, if Dunaway can survive the campy cult classic _Mommie Dearest_ from many moons ago then she can certainly survive the wretched **The Bye Bye Man**.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"In view of the reviews this movie has received I was not expecting much. Being a Sci-Fi\/Fantasy\/Horror fan I had to watch it regardless of what people said about it of course.\nI have to say that I do not understand why so many seem to claim it is utter crap. Sure, it is not a great movie but it is not really bad either. \n\nIt is not just a remake of the original The Mummy movies which I think is actually good. That concept is becoming a bit deja vue after all.\n\nTo me the worst part of the movie was Tom Cruise. Total lack of charisma. He really do not succeed in his role. He is mostly wondering about being meh and just reacts to the various situations he is thrown into.\n\nRussell Crowe is a lot better as Doctor Jekyll. I quite like Doctor Jekyll being thrown into the mix by the way. I think his role worked quite well and was well played.\n\nBeing a mummy movie there are of course a lot of supernatural stuff, curses, monsters and action. In general I think it was reasonably well done. The special effects were enjoyable and the mummy herself, Sofia Boutella, was not bad at all.\n\nOn the whole the movie and the story held a lot of promise but in the end the overall performance failed to really impress. There were plenty of good things but they were just not put to good work. I think the movie would have fared a lot better with a more charismatic lead in it and perhaps a bit better script for him.\n\nBottom line, I did enjoy the movie. As I wrote it is not really bad but it could have been quite a bit better. The good parts were sometimes really good but in between it felt like everyone went to lunch and let the janitors have a go at movie making.","id":"59f2febb925141229100c9c7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59f2febb925141229100c9c7","movie_id":282035}

{"author":"a_southern_horror_fan","content":"Datis presents horror fans with a traditional, almost 'Mystery Inc.' concept filled with standard stereotypes, creepy setting and nice body count. Told with slapstick and satirical humor, the film is a fun treat. It is English subtitled  (just in case you prefer your international films voice-over). The characters are well developed and charismatic creatures one expects to see in this type of horror movie, but they work and they are entertaining.\r\n\r\nThe special effects could have been a bit harder and more graphic-\"Saturday Morning Mystery\" done this sort of thing a bit better. I'm American I want a more visceral and gory experience in my kill shots. Still even for the more subtle choices taken to create the horror elements, \"The Mansion\" is still fun to watch. \r\n\r\nOverall the movie is a nice watch. It is effective in giving a creepy, horror throwback experience. The funny is funny and the horror is classic. It is a bit grosser than it is scary,  a total New French Extremist fan film.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Into the vast space, the man's first exploration!**\r\n\r\nFrom the Irish editor turned documentary filmmaker will take you on an interstellar journey. I am not talking about the scripted feature films with plenty of pleasant visuals. This is real. The real life human effort to see and learn about the universe. It was the first of its kind attempted, and so far only attempt. The film reveals many secrets that you might have not heard before in any space documentaries you have seen. What's special about it is the releasing on the 40th anniversary since the launch of the rockets.\r\n\r\nWell, there are real footages. But not exactly the real ones. Originally they are stills. The spacecraft took a series of picture, those received pictures were put together and formed into the video clips. Or you could say they ran it fast, so it looked like a video. Black and white to colourised, they have done a pretty nice work on that. Though there were many CGI works too for our better understanding what's going on. Like when the spacecraft travelling in the space, you can't send another one to keep picturing it from a pretty close distance like in the filmmaking what a cameraman does with the actors. That's how you would see the voyager's journey here.\r\n\r\nLike any documentaries, this too was a series of interview based film. That would never change for this genre. There were no Brian Cox or Neil DeGrasse Tyson to narrate the space story. But Carl Sagan himself was present with his 80s, 90s press conference footages that are given regarding the latest Voyager's breakthrough. And many people who worked on the project given some precious information and their experience being one of the first to witness the historical pictures. It is a must to observe their expressions, the story that came straight from the source, stunningly.\r\n\r\nThe year was 1977. The man was already been on the Moon. The next attempt should have been the Mars. But that's another NASA story. They wanted beyond that, to see the actual universe. The technology was pretty good, though nothing like the present generation. But the great feast is, it was nearly half a century old attempt with outdated technology, yet round the year, every day, hour, minute, never it have ever had taken a rest. Travelling at the speed of 10 miles per second, it took 35 years to get out of out solar system bubble.\r\n\r\n> \u275dIt's a pretty small spacecraft, and it's a pretty big universe.\u275e\r\n\r\nEach phase of the Voyager's journey was breathtaking. It targeted the last four planets of our solar system. Started off with big brother, Jupiter. It was just a passing by and having a close look at the gas giant. Also spied at all of its moons. Then the Saturn, the guy with an icy ring. I really learnt lots about them. Particularly being first visual evidence of such phenomena.\r\n\r\nThen came the surprise. I never knew Uranus, as well as Neptune has rings. Being a space geek, I disappointed myself there. Then they said, this guy is not a photogenic. Yep, he was not. He was too plain. But its moons were another surprise. Like the scared villains from the western films. Particularly, Miranda. Maybe my favourite moon from all of our solar system for being so different. Especially it reminded me 'The Little Prince'. Going to the final guy, Neptune, everybody got emotional, for it is being the final stop.\r\n\r\nThat was the last of our solar system. But I anticipated something about Pluto, the dwarf guy. These all happened like less than 20 years, but what came after was only an empty space within our solar system. Like it took next 15 years to exit the bandwidth of our sun. But what I guess is that there would have been some planets beyond Pluto in the ancient time, which some time later had escaped from the Sun's gravity to become the rogue planets. Because they were too far from the Sun and those empty spaces would not have been there without any reason. Is not it?\r\n\r\nThe man is not on board, but his creation reached farthest. Now travelling between the stars, nobody knows what comes next. But the Voyager still in touch with the Earth with low signal. I have known about this project since my teenage. But till now I never knew there were two Voyagers. That took me by a surprise. I have known about the on board music, map, human anatomical structure et cetera. It is obviously to make contact with other intelligence in the universe.\r\n\r\nThe Voyagers will travel thousands of years into deep space. From all, nobody knows or can predict the result of such unique space project the human has ever conducted. I think there's a possible that this documentary would feature in the upcoming Oscars. I'll be definitely happy for that. It is about the NASA's achievements. The Americans would be proud of it. But the world has too. After all, we're all the human's of the Earth. A must see documentary film by everyone.\r\n\r\n_10\/10_","id":"59fe246592514146e802303a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59fe246592514146e802303a","movie_id":436305}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Once upon a time two sworn enemies teamed up!**\r\n\r\nMaybe the critics are right, but like usual, I don't have to agree with them. This is a nice film, not a great film as a few people lauding. It is entertaining. All the stunts were good, comedies were good enough, but the basic plot itself a cliche. Yes, anybody aged 20+ would surely have seen many similar storied films. It's just in another time with another cast and crew. They had promoted it so well. So the result was incredible. But in reality JUST one time watchable film with not expecting serious laughs.\r\n\r\nInitially I thought it could be this year's 'The Nice Guys', and they are about to repeat the same magic of Crowe and Gosling duo. But it was different. Too hard hitting, just what Tarantino fans would like to have. Besides, their guy, Samuel L. Jackson is here. Both the leads were good. That does not mean they have saved the film. That's an assumption of fanboys. Luck could be another factor!\r\n\r\nIt was about a hitman in capture decides to give an important testimony in the International Criminal Court against a powerful man. So now the bad guys are after him in his every move from England to Holland. A demoted bodyguard takes the job to safely get him to his destination. Their journey begins where they are going to encounter a series of obstacles and they finally make it where a major twist comes in before the end.\r\n\r\nAs I said, this is no special, except the way they have presented on the screen makes the difference. But again, not all films are lucky in that criteria as this one. It is like one in a 20-25 films. So if your objective is timepass, then this will do just fine. There could be a sequel, probably prequel seems a nice idea. But I'm not sure whether I want it or not. I'll just be happy if they do!\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5a772555c3a36859cf044a1a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a772555c3a36859cf044a1a","movie_id":390043}

Sadly he isn't that smart, and not enough people love his music, only a group of dedicated elderly fans, so in a desperate act out of what seems like altruism he starts what is essentially a ponzi scheme to help get his musicians paid more and build his empire.\r\n\r\nJack Black is solid, so if you like his schtick or Polka music you may enjoy this, but outside of that it seems like the actors think this film is a comedy when nothing really funny is said or done.  The film ambles along, recreating the events, but it misses any kind of heart or soul that would have been found in the real people.\r\n\r\nThe biggest disappointment was Jason Schwartzman, the usually solid comedy actor was completely coasting.  And what a total waste of JB Smoove.  Jenny Slate seemed the most committed to her role outside of Jack Black, but even she couldn't hold this film together.\r\n\r\nAll in all the film reminded me of another Jack Black film based on true events called Bernie, but Bernie was superior in every way.","id":"5a5d5de70e0a267f61001ced","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a5d5de70e0a267f61001ced","movie_id":419472}

{"author":"CRCulver","content":"In Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki's 2016 film <i>Toivon tuolla puelella<\/i> (\"The Other Side of Hope\"), the Finnish auteur continues a theme he explored in <i>Le Havre<\/i> from five years earlier: refugees fleeing to Europe and forced to survive when heartless officials and some locals are against them. While that earlier film was shot in the comparatively exotic setting of the eponymous French port, <i>Toivon tuolla puelella<\/i> returns to Kaurism\u00e4ki's familiar stomping grounds of downtown Helsinki.\r\n\r\nThe film consists of two converging plotlines. In one, the aging salesman Wikstr\u00f6m (Sakari Kuosmanen, a longtime member of Kaurism\u00e4ki's acting stable) leaves his wife, wins a lot of money in a poker game, and decides to open a restaurant. In the other, the Syrian refugee Khaled (Sherwan Haji) arrives in Helsinki after fleeing war-torn Aleppo and wandering across half of Europe, but he is worried about his sister that he got separated with along the way. Wikstr\u00f6m and Khaled eventually meet and become friends -- or the closest thing to friends that Kaurism\u00e4ki's exaggeratedly cold and morose Finns can get to each other. Before that, however, the Wikstr\u00f6m plotline serves to inject some humour, albeit of an extremely deadpan sort, into a film that, though Khaled, explores the depressing lives of refugees who are shuffled from one center to another and forced to wait for their cases to be processed.\r\n\r\nFor three decades now, Kaurism\u00e4ki has made all his films to a very distinctive template that virtually never varies. Its characters speak a minimum of dialogue to each other and show little expression on their faces. The sets are drab in colour and deliberately anachronistic, with gadgets, vehicles or clothes from the 1950s alongside computers and mobile phones from our time. At some point, a band will appear on stage playing oldies rock, blues, or Finnish tangos as the characters look on.\r\n\r\n<i>Toivon tuolla puelella<\/i> doesn't stray from that template either. Still, the script has enough fresh moments to it that it will feel worthwhile evento  longtime Kaurism\u00e4ki films who have sat through this template many times before. Some of the humorous bits are laugh-out-loud funny, but overall this does feel like a darker film than most of the director's work. It is ultimately a choked, restrained cry of rage at the way that refugees are treated, by a Nordic society that prides itself on fairness, equality and charity. While Kaurism\u00e4ki is roughly on the left politically, several of his films have attacked the Finnish welfare state for its opaque bureaucracy and its reduction of human beings to mere papers in a government file. This film continues that critique by depicting the refugees, who come from many countries but manage to band together to lend each other help, as the sort of neighborly solidarity that Kaurism\u00e4ki prefers to faceless bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nI personally wouldn't find this the best introduction to Kaurism\u00e4ki. His earlier film <i>Mies vailla menneisytt\u00e4<\/i> (\"The Man Without a Past\") depicted with more meat on its bone a down-on-his-luck man lost among bureaucracy, while the \u00fcber-idiosyncratic romantic comedy <i>Varoja paratiisissa<\/i> (\"Shadows in Paradise\") is one of Kaurism\u00e4ki's best achievements in deadpan humour. Still, <i>Toivon tuolla puelella<\/i> seems to tell a story universal enough to pull on everyone's heartstrings and is worth seeing.","id":"5b7df3f70e0a2615c500854c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b7df3f70e0a2615c500854c","movie_id":429199}

That said, I didn't feel super connected or cared enough about any of the others. I thought they were just fine. It's a fairly decent story and I'm glad I watch The Taker beforehand even though it didn't effect the plot too much. Two things that threw me off about the film (besides technical stuff) was that it A just dropped you in and you felt lost for the first couple minutes and B that it was set in the modern day. My second issue has more to do with costumes feeling bit and out of place (as well as looking annoyingly clean) given the time. That and when scenes were shot in the city or anywhere the showed anything modern I was confused if it was meant to be that way or not.

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Somehow Hollywood continues to search for different outlets in conveying young love at the box office. Sure, the goal is always the same in terms of tapping into the youth market by promoting yet another transparent teen weepie but this time among the planetary stars. Hey, youngsters need catering at the movie theaters as well, right? However, one is not so convinced that the Young Adults (YA) genre is convincingly elevated by a flimsy frontier sci-fi romancer among the Clearasil crowd. Hence, **The Space Between Us** fits the bill as a scattershot and schmaltzy pimple-faced love story that has all the emotional stability of moon dust in front of a heavy duty oscillating fan.\r\n\r\nWriter-director Peter Chelsom (\u201cFunny Bones\u201d, \u201cSerendipity\u201d) and fellow screenwriters Allan Loeb and Tinker Lindsay delve into the conventional cliches of a lame star-crossed lovers theme that wreaks of saccharine-coated simplicity wrapped in scientific triteness. The awkward mixture of lightweight sci-fi drama, pandering gooey-eyed overtures toward teenage girls still nostalgically embracing their _Twilight_ fixation and space-age elements as filler exploration makes for a paper-cutter potency that creates unwanted space between us or any other species watching this cosmic claptrap. Give Chelsom some credit\u2013at least his young protagonists are not another incarnation of obligatory hairy werewolves or fanged vampires, right?\r\n\r\nThe adolescent pen pals in **The Space Between Us** are truly from different worlds although this does not stop these particular kids from bonding deeply. Advanced academic in sixteen-year old Gardner Elliot (Asa Butterfield) is having a time of his life in corresponding with the edgy Tulsa (Britt Robertson) in the chat rooms. Whereas Gardner is a whiz in robotics and comes from prestigious stock (his late mother was a pioneering astronaut) his object of affection Tulsa is a motorcycle-loving wild child that had bounced around in the foster care system. The glaring differences between the unlikely young couple is that the scientifically gifted Gardner is located on Mars and Tulsa is a gritty gal living on Earth in the state of Colorado. Geez\u2026talking about long distant relationships, huh?\r\n\r\nPoor Gardner has always entertained the thought of traveling to Earth\u2013the home planet of his deceased explorer mother who died giving birth to him during her mission to colonize Mars. So now there is more of an incentive for Gardner to yearn for visiting Earth now that his curiosity and fascination with Tulsa has heightened. At this point all Martian Gardner has going for him socially is his guardian\/\u201dsecond\u201d mother in astronaut\/scientist Kendra Wyndham (Carla Gugino) and his robotic pal he built to provide him companionship. The cruel reality for Gardner not being able to take a trip to Earth has something to do with his sensitive Martian-bred bodily functioning not being able to withstand the atmospheric gravity settings on our planet (huh\u2026is he not half Earthling?). All Gardner wants to do is come to terms with connecting to the planet Earth and finding some self-discovery about himself and self-fulfillment with his Colorado-based crush in the leather-clad Tulsa.\r\n\r\nOf course the film figures out\u2013in convoluted fashion no doubt\u2013how to place the inquisitive Gardner on earth-related soil through the far-fetched means of a billionaire Nathaniel Shepherd (Gary Oldman) funding the experimentation and expedition of the Red Planet-raised tyke whose dream of reaching the planet that houses his unknown father and his precious Tulsa. Soon, the inevitability of Gardner meeting up with his dreamgirl comes true as the teenage twosome take off and find liberation in each other\u2019s company as the authorities are hot on their trail. Look out Romeo and Juliet\u2026you have a cheesy carbon copy coupling seeking to steal your familiar thunder.\r\n\r\n**The Space Between Us** produces more sappy substance than a row of Vermont trees. The fish-out-of-water routine that Butterfield\u2019s Gardner undergoes when reaching Earth is mechanically clumsy and predictable. Butterfield does what he can to portray Gardner as an alien just not from another planet but from his own skin and this notion is philosophically ambitious to pull off for an interstellar teen tearjerker that has all the complexity of a sofa cushion. Robertson\u2019s Tulsa is the typical rebellious chick but her and Butterfield\u2019s Gardner become tiresome as they engage in manufactured chase scenes, teen-angst lovey-dovey lameness and the dragged-out space travel drivel that beleaguers this simplistic sci-fi yarn.\r\n\r\nThe results in **The Space Between Us** is alarming more than charming because once the payoff is realized where Gardner and Tulsa draw energy from each other\u2019s worldly vibes as they cuddle in zero gravity one will be left wondering where the next asteroid is coming to act as the needed wrecking ball to obliterate this toothless sci-fi saga aimed at the indiscriminate teen targets.\r\n\r\n**The Space Between Us (2017)**\r\n\r\nSTX Entertainment\r\n\r\n2 hrs.\r\n\r\nSTARRING: Asa Butterfield, Brit Robertson, Gary Oldman, Gina Gugino, Janet Montgomery, Trey Tucker, Scott Takeda, Adande \u201cSwoozie\u201d Thorne, Sarah Minnich\r\n\r\nDIRECTED BY: Peter Chelsom\r\n\r\nWRITTEN BY: Peter Chelsom, Tinker Lindsay Allan Loeb\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGENRE: Action & Adventure\/Science Fiction\/Fantasy & Romance\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2017","id":"58a3d253c3a368396b002bb2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58a3d253c3a368396b002bb2","movie_id":365942}

{"author":"tmdb23156637","content":"Finally got the chance to see this via Amazon.\n\nDogtooth and The Lobster (from the same Greek director, who I must admit has a keen sense of storytelling) did not impress me at all. Very interesting ideas; atrocious presentations. Dogtooth was indecipherable and The Lobster is cruel, ugly, and not humorous in any fashion (I've no idea why it's billed as a black comedy.)\n\nHowever, this latest film is entertaining to me despite it's grim and inky-black nature (based on the ancient Greek play, which is where the title is loosely derived from.) Perhaps it's a bit more straight-forward despite its cryptic nature, a bit more involved in some form of reality we can recognize and less inference as to what the hey is really happening. But I sure watched it w\/ more interest than The Lobster (I've no interest in the director's film prior to that one.)\n\nA successful heart surgeon (w\/ a past history of alcoholism, sober for some time at present) is shown to have an uneasy alliance w\/ the teenaged son of a patient who died on the operating table. It's clear the boy has some hold over this surgeon, who seems eager to please him but his heart's not into it (no pun intended.)\n\nThe boy's true intentions are revealed as events move forward; the surgeon's wife and two children (a few years apart, both intelligent in their own ways) are placed in grave danger as well as dear old Dad, and to reveal just how would spoil it for first-time viewers.\n\nThe camera-work here is impeccable, as are the jarring soundscapes, found-sounds, and industrial noise which makes for harrowing listening. The actor playing Martin, the teenaged oddball w\/ a shared secret, is riveting to watch in a well-suited role. \n\nSacred Deer isn't so much a horror-film as a drama w\/ strong elements of dream-like reality, awkward young romance, and assorted chills and cold calculated sex-scenes involving \"playing dead\" and \"the other.\"\n\nMy biggest complaints would be as before w\/ this director's work: everyone speaks their lines as if hearing them through an ear-piece to parrot back, which makes the cast seem rather stilted and robotic. This director favors a weird tangent of \"Mamet-speak.\"\n\nThe ending is about what you'd expect, following the matter-of-fact discussions which precede it. Up until that point Sacred Deer does a pretty good job keeping us wondering what will happen next, where will things lead, what is that kid's gift and whereupon was it bestowed; unfortunately the outcome isn't as entrancing or unexpected as I'd hoped.\n\nBut overall worth my time to watch. Considering how disappointed I was by the previous films by the director I'd watched (great reviews, all of which confounded and puzzled me) this film was much less of a bore and a chore to watch. A pleasant, unpleasant surprise indeed.","id":"5a3dbaa0c3a3680ba60070b6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a3dbaa0c3a3680ba60070b6","movie_id":399057}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**All important movies start with a black screen...**\r\n\r\nAs the new millennium began, alongside the LEGO films born, but it all started with the song, the breakthrough song 'Everything is Awesome' a couple of years ago. Since then, we all thought LEGO was a new format in 3D animation like Anime in 2D Animation. So I was expecting very eagerly what could be the second LEGO film. When they had announced it was going to be 'Batman', many 'Batman' fans were elated. So here we are.\r\n\r\nIt took a longer time than expected to hit the screen. I'd lost hope in this, because all the sweet memories of the firs LEGO film were fading away from me. So I could not say or think anything about it. That's all changed once I watched it. While watching it, everything was restored like waking up after I was knocked down with a big blow to the head. That reminded how badly I missed it. One of the best animations. It can't be compared to the normal animation. It is more like a jerky type, similar to stop-motion, but done in softwares.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it was not about the animation. It was the story and dialogues. The best Batman film was a very serious film, but this one was so fun. For all ages, a non stop entertainment guaranteed. The surprise was all the villains coming together in one place. When the Batman ignores his arch-rival, the Joker, he is set to redefine his position to fight the Batman. His comeback endangers the whole Gotham city. Then the black clad, the Batman, with the support of his sidekicks, fights to save the city from devastating. The remaining is how it all ends.\r\n\r\nThe voice-over artists were awesome, but first, my praise goes to the screen and dialogue writers. As I said, nothing was great in animation, especially if you had seen the previous LEGO film. All one can see is LEGOS everywhere, the world, the city, the characters made of LEGOS and then even the explosives and other special effects are kind of LEGO brick style visual. But top to bottom a very enjoyable film. An animation that should not be missed. Probably it could contest in the upcoming Oscars. Now all my eyes are towards 'Ninjago'.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**If forgiving is that easily convincible, then welcome to the crime world!**\r\n\r\nA novel based film. A religious themed film. It has a message, BUT could be a bad message for today's world. Because how the event was dealt with the story only encourages the crime, in reality. Wise people can say philosophically, morally, but not means every words practically applicable. The common people would get affected more. Other than that, I have no grudge on anything. If it has been just a fantasy and an entertaining film, excluding that Christian thing, I would have liked it better.\r\n\r\nIt was more like another 'What Dreams May Come', but less visual spectacular. On the other hand, there was an uneasiness in the development of what happened in the early stage of the story. They did not go for the detail, from the crime perspective, hence that mysterious event holds the key which we don't know exactly what happened to judge anything out of the film. So that part reminds 'The Lovely Bones'.\r\n\r\nThe story of a father whose little girl mysteriously disappeared on a camping trip.

I do not mind over the top special effects and I do not demand 100% realism, at least not in a movie like this, but the effects in this one is just so unbelievable and unintelligent that it really spoils the fun. Take submarines that outrun speeding cars\u2026while acting as ice breakers at the same time. How the hell did they get the submarine from being propped up in dry dock into the water in less than an hour? Also, this guy seems to think that you can just turn on a nuclear sub from being moth balled to ready to go with the turn of a switch as well. The movie is loaded with stunts like this. Stunts that are so ludicrous that it hurts to think that anyone can be stupid enough to dream that kind of crap up. Maybe the guy thought he was writing the script for a comedy or something.\r\n\r\nIt is a bit of a shame since the story itself is not at all bad. I have to went my frustration about another gripe I have here though. The movie blurb is not only misleading but it is blatantly false. The \u201cmysterious woman\u201d do NOT \u201cseduce\u201d Dom into anything. Said woman has a much more sinister plan. To me this was very good indeed.

Because her dedication was awesome. But sad to see it got wasted, I mean not being awards' favourite flick. She said it was a very personal film for her. But I thing for me as well for the same reason of hers.\r\n\r\nA good title, a good poster. Everybody performed well, besides Collins. I know still majority would love it or already loved it, but there are a few like me not that satisfied. Though I won't say it is completely a bad film. That does not stop me from suggesting it to others. Forget the guys like me, as the days to come, I hope it gets its due.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I must confess that I did have higher hopes for this movie. I\u2019m not sure what the script writers was up to when writing it but they really seem to have a very low opinion of the audience\u2019s intelligence. Either that or it was written for a very young audience.\r\n\r\nThere were parts of the movie that was quite fun to watch but on the whole it was pretty much a mess. It is a shame because it had quite a bit of promise. The core of the plot was not too bad although I really wish that Hollywood writers would stay away from plots involving computer gadgetry. Their knowledge in that area simply stinks. Thus the gadget that the entire movie was spun around was simply stupid.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately another core plot element was the crooked CIA (or whatever department it was supposed to be) boss that of course had to do some senseless backstabbing just to prolong the movie. Tiresome, overused and boring. I know, I know with fucktards like Comey I guess one could say that it would not be too far from the truth but it is still tiresome, overused and boring.\r\n\r\nSince I am on a rant anyway let\u2019s go on to the various stunts and special effects. It is a long time since I watched a movie where the stunts were so obviously and totally overdone and unrealistic. I mean, they were unrealistic to the point where I started to wander if it was a slapstick comedy I was watching.\r\n\r\nAll of this really dragged down the movie \u2026 a lot!\r\n\r\nOn the good side. I did like many of the wacky characters. It is a shame that many of their wacky moments were less of a comic relief due to the above mentioned silliness but instead felt like the more serious moments in the movie.\r\n\r\nVin Diesel, well I watched this movie because I am a Vin Diesel fan so of course I liked him. He is his usual badass and kick ass self. He is also surrounded by a bunch of badass (and wacky as I mentioned before) characters. I quite liked the ensemble. The guy who seems to collect crashes is rather silly but fun in a strange way. I did like the gun girl a lot.\r\n\r\nHowever, apart from quite a few fun and\/or cool scenes the movie as a whole did not cut it. In my opinion it was ruined by a substandard script devoid of any form of intelligence. I would go as far as to say that the writers were incompetent pure and simple. I was almost giving it three stars because there was many parts I liked but in the end \u2026 no, there is no way I could justify more than two stars for this mess.\r\n\r\nReally a shame. I would have liked to see more xXx movies but after this one I\u2019m not sure anyone will bet money on that.","id":"593e693e92514105e202e8ba","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/593e693e92514105e202e8ba","movie_id":47971}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A new franchise is on making!**\r\n\r\nI was very happy when I heard about a sequel is on the development of Vin Diesel's one of the career early films. I was a teenager, and I remember celebrating it in the theatre with my friends. But, like the T2, it was too late for a sequel. Most of other franchises are going for spin-offs in the similar case. Anyway, it was good to see the original character back in the action. Although not liked changing the title logo. The original is evergreen.\r\n\r\nWell, the story continued as the same gap between the first and this film. I thought the original concept was like solo action hero kind, but in here, it became a multi-starrer. Like most of the similar themed action film series, it tried to add variety of characters, including clich\u00e9s like computer hackers and a boss to handle those rogue guys. But there were too many Triple Xes.\r\n\r\nThe story was okay. It only wanted to make a comeback, like a re- introduction of everything. I liked the diversity in the film characters. The casting was from around the world, picking the best team like Donnie Yen from HK, Tony Jaa from Thailand. But I did not understand why Donnie was speaking in Mandarin, instead of Cantonese.\r\n\r\nFrom all I did not like Deepika. Yes, she's the real Indian beauty, but not a good actor, especially for actions, she's unsuitable. I would have preferred Priyanka in here. They two should have switched the films between this and 'Baywatch'. Jaa, I did think he had in him his witty character display. He was a completely different person in this. The rest of the guys were too not bad at all, particularly that stunt guy was awesome.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the action sequences, not some, many were totally impossible. Surely not the really performed stunts they were. Simply a special effects, and it was too much to take on. Because they were not realistically appealing to accept. Those include, non-snow mountain skiing, ocean wave bike surfing, you add it. The good news is, it was okay for watching once, but I'm anticipating the next part to be a game changer in the franchise.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"59ac9c00c3a3682c0a03819a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59ac9c00c3a3682c0a03819a","movie_id":47971}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Words cannot express how incredibly overwrought, insipid, hyperactive and foolishly exaggerated the third entry into the action-packed _XXX_ film franchise is in the nonsensical and numbing operative spectacle **XXX: Return of Xander Cage**. Monosyllabic muscle-bound action star Vin Diesel revisits the rollicking and roguish skin of athletic spy\/sports enthusiast Xander Cage in yet another splashy yet sophomoric throbbing thrill-ride that only diehard Diesel fanboys will swallow with unapologetic fervor.\r\n\r\nWhen in doubt Diesel knows where his bread is buttered in terms of his secured box office appeal. The pumped-up performer has initiated the hoopla with a couple of popular action flicks in the past only to leave them briefly before deciding to return front and center. Diesel has done this tactic with the inexplicably desired _The Fast and the Furious_ movie series as well as the aforementioned _XXX_ offerings (actor\/singers Tyrese Gibson and Ice Cube inherited the big screen honors in replacing the absent Diesel in these energized ditties respectively). Now Diesel is called into service once again to capitalize on the extreme spy genre while satisfying those thrill-seekers whose thirst for the James Bond and Jason Bourne action-grabbers may be perceived as relentlessly mild as the acrobatic antics of the hip Bald Bold One looks to overshadow his competitors in daunting dumbness.\r\n\r\nBottom line: who the heck was cramming for the ridiculous return of the attention-getting Xander Cage other than the motivated machismo of star\/co-producer Diesel strutting his all-too-familiar slick shtick in an empty-minded vanity project that is jumpier than a kangaroo with the hiccups? There is nothing like playing to the convoluted escapism and exploiting the loyal demographics that continue to get a charge out of Diesel\u2019s boisterous brand from the _Fast and Furious_ enterprise that still sizzles for some and fizzles for others. Nevertheless, this espionage eyesore features Diesel\u2019s Cage at his best\u2026and that is not saying much. He is as smooth as ice soothing your ailing tonsils. Check. He is a chick magnet to the highest degree. Check again. He can turn his biceps and brawn into an invaluable weapon for the safety of his country and comrades. Double check and then some. Overall, we get it\u2026Xander Cage is a badass without boundaries and daredevil Diesel and his on-screen cohorts wants to reinforce such titillating tripe. Go figure.\r\n\r\nGranted that **XXX: Return of Xander Cage\u2019s** sole purpose is to play into the pulsating popcorn pleasure of its audience while expecting one not to take the excitable escapades too seriously. Still, the tired formula for this particular genre in general (not to mention a Vin Diesel-starring vehicle) feels utterly uninspired and recycled despite the ambitious showcasing of active triggers that include high-wire skiing through the woods, dirt bike surfing, daring skateboarding prowess while clinging to the side of a moving bus and oh yeah\u2026a lot of colorful butt-kicking tactics to boot. The highly stylized lifestyle of the free-wheeling Cage is by-the-numbers hedonism\u2013cause havoc, conquer the lovely ladies hormonal for his suave affections and come off looking cool this side of 70\u2019s knockoff bad motherf&%$# private eye John Shaft in taking care of business. Great spy work if you can conjure it up for indiscriminate action junkies wanting to engage in this souped-up silliness without rhyme or reason.\r\n\r\nFor those not quite familiar with the Xander Cage \u201cmythology\u201d he was an extreme sports talent that had been recruited by NSA head honcho Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) to utilize his competitive skills and abilities undercover. Now Cage is back in the saddle as he horses around on yet another challenging assignment that finds him butting heads with a trio of baddies in Deepika Padukone\u2019s Serena, Donnie Yen\u2019s Xiang and Tony Jaa\u2019s Talon\u2013a threatening threesome experimenting with dangerously rigging outer space satellites or something to that trivial effect. Of course the crafty Cage\u2013beyond wily and reckless\u2013is often reigned in by the likes of his superiors including Agent Jane Marke (Oscar and Emmy nominated Australian actress Toni Collette needlessly toiling away in this toothless contraption of a spy thriller).\r\n\r\nDirector D.J. Caruso (2016\u2019s \u201cThe Disappointments Room\u201d) merely goes through the motions with this disjointed spy caper that flexes its moronic muscles without offering much else to the preposterous proceedings. The displayed dialogue in a Lucky Charms cereal commercial has more credibility than the words leaving the lips of the featured players in this woefully generic actioner. Diesel, who has shown some promise as an actor in previous critical fare from yesteryear such as 2000\u2019s _Boiler Room_ and 2006\u2019s _Find Me Guilty_ has since played it safe and relied on the frivolous \u201csure thing\u201d with the repetitive Furious installments and other fluffy movie projects that had diminished his potential in Hollywood beyond the brainless blow-em-up cinema that he finds automatic comfort in churning out as a cinematic safety net.\r\n\r\nAlthough they say that a single \u201cX\u201d usually marks the spot it takes triple X\u2019s to disprove this theory when welcoming back the chaotic coolness that is Diesel\u2019s detached dude in cocky-minded Xander Cage\u2013the sensationalized showboat that should have left his debuted one-dimensional adventurous tendencies back in 2002.\r\n\r\n**XXX: Return of Xander Cage** (2017)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** (2017)","id":"5886aeabc3a368371e000748","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5886aeabc3a368371e000748","movie_id":47971}

My intrigue was entirely based on the poster and the tagline and the fact it was touted as a sci-fi, action, adventure. Zero promotion and even Letterboxd doesn't have many details to go on, however I found this wallowing in the depths of Amazon Prime.\r\nHere are my stream of conscious thoughts as I watched....\r\n\r\n- Main guy is appalling. Appalling. I cannot believe he has been in other movies. I could start acting tomorrow if this is the acceptable standard these days.\r\n- Nauseating camera work. Not shaky cam, not handheld, something far worse.\r\n- Jumps into a doomsday\/conspiracy\/I'm-not-too-sure-what plot with absolutely no explanation, progression or development.\r\n- Jumps from scene to scene inexplicably. Missing out whole scenes of development.\r\n- Director's mates found some shockingly bad police uniforms and decided to join in.\r\n- I wonder how much Seth Gilliam got paid for the 3 minutes he shows up for.\r\n- Black woman going \"mm-hmm\".\r\n- No transitions of any kind.\r\n- No lighting of any kind.\r\n- No sound effects of any kind. At one point a character shoots a policeman in a government building. It needs to be seen to be believed but what stood out was the gunshot that sounded like a cap gun.\r\n- No set design of any kind.\r\n- The main character's shoes are two or three sizes too big, his hair changes length, style AND colour with each passing scene. Never seen a film where the time between shoots was clear as day.\r\n- Time travel plot now! When did this happen?!\r\n- Main character tries to sneak into police station by asking for a fictional police officer at front desk. Two scenes later he is miraculously walking through the police station with no explanation.\r\n- Misrepresents mental illness to offensive levels\r\n- Characters just appear!\r\n- Looks and feels just like a Michael Scarn movie... I miss the Office\r\n- Slow mo pigeons\r\n- Every single contextual element was either cut or not filmed at all. Shit just... happens. No explanation. No transition.\r\n- I'm gonna go out on a limb and say the director did every single job outside of the acting on this piece of shit\r\n- The first shot is a top-down view of Manhattan. And I think the budget was blown right there. The rest of this is outstandingly bad.\r\n\r\nI would love to say there was a good film in here somewhere struggling to find it's way out, but there isn't. None of it makes sense and is compounded by Chris Riggi's APPALLING acting. Eyebrows jumping all over the place, zero consistency in look or behaviour. It felt like a practical joke.\r\nBy far the worst film I have ever seen. Makes the Room seem like a masterpiece.\r\nLike a bad improv class were given a camera and a one-sentence idea to play with.\r\nUtterly shocking.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Buying this movie was of course pretty much a request from my kids although I have to confess that I, as a Science Fiction geek, was at least a tiny bit interested in seeing what they had managed to cook together on a big budget. For the record I find the television show absolutely awful. Therefore I am quite surprised that I found the movie to be not exactly good but at least watchable.\r\n\r\nMake no mistake, it is indeed a silly and simple plot, teenage wet dream, stupid and illogical kind of story that you would expect. However, it was actually mildly fun to watch. Most of my enjoyment came from the special effects and action sequences of course. The dialog and behavior of the teenage heroes were as stereotyped and generally awful as one would expect.\r\n\r\nThis of course means that the first half of the movie is less interesting than the second half when the action picks up. Actually, although there are some fun moments during \u201ctraining\u201d, I felt this entire idea of them not being able to use their powers before they had gotten into the right \u201cmental state\u201d to prove that they were actually Power Rangers was just a rubbish one.\r\n\r\nOnce things started to pick up speed it became more interesting. The different means of transport of the Power Rangers was absolutely silly but still great fun to watch.\r\n\r\nWell, I really do not have that much more to say. The last parts of the movie was one big special effects feast with a few comic elements in it, most of them rather \u2026 teenage. Fun to watch for a science fiction geek like me.\r\n\r\nSo, the verdict? Was it a fun movie to watch? Yeah, it was pretty okay. Was it a good movie? Well, that is probably stretching it.","id":"592e812492514130d2009735","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/592e812492514130d2009735","movie_id":305470}

Unfortunately a mysterious slayer, who uses various yard tools to do his gruesome work, puts the kibosh on the proceedings.\r\n\r\n\u201cPool Party Massacre\u201d (2017) is a micro-budget Indie that only cost around $7000 and it\u2019s amazing that a fairly entertaining slasher can be made for that low amount. To keep the costs down, the writer\/director shot it at his impressive abode in the suburbs of Las Vegas. \r\n\r\nThe acting of the no-name actors isn\u2019t bad considering what they got paid, as long as you don\u2019t mind campiness and the fact that their characters are all unlikable, except one. Their lines are delivered in a rat-a-tat-tat manner, as if they were reading from a teleprompter, yet I was impressed with the work that was put into the wordy script even though the characters are disagreeable which, let\u2019s face it, was intentional.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the writer\/director satirizes the slasher formula and includes all the main staples.

For many reason, the film worked for me.  The cast is brilliant - from Michael Shannon playing against character to the always enjoyable Judy Greer to the gruff but funny Ian McShane, I had a blast with the cast.  The plot is a another plus for me.  It's just quirky enough to keep me entertained throughout.  The bits about the furries, the bigfoot sightings, and the \"unique\" townspeople are all interesting touches.  I've read several complaints about the lack of real comedy and, while I can agree to a point, there are enough moments that made me at least smile that I didn't need to laugh out loud to find the comedy enjoyable.  Overall, I had a good time with Pottersville and have no problems rating it higher than most others.\r\n\r\nMy biggest complaint with Pottersville and the thing that keeps me from rating it higher is Tom Lennon.  A little Lennon goes a long way.  He's given way, way too much screentime.

I am not a 'Power Rangers' fan, but I was looking forward to it. Expected to be a decent, not this low. The major issue with the film was the story. What the heck! All the superhero films have this same platform. That's really boring. Even that's how the real 'Power Rangers' is, does not matter, it should have been re-wrote completely. Just like they had updated the costumes from cloths to metal armours.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the actors are not to be blamed. Those young guys did good. Direction, not bad too. The graphic, nothing new or that impressive. If we observe closely all the CGI shot, they do not look fine, especially if you know all this stuff like an animator or something. The villain was weak. But the entire film was like just an introduction. They had held up everything till the last quarters to bring all together and make a massive stand off between the good and the bad.\r\n\r\nMaybe it could work for kids. Those who liked Marvel and DC superhero films would only find it a trash. The best thing about the film is, it is watchable, despite everything are familiar and predictable. I'm not in favour of a sequel, but surely they will make one. And that's result would decide the franchise's future, which I think has a slim chance against those superhero films that already bagged the large sum of fans to its pocket. As I said, the remaining one are children, who are upcoming generation. So if the filmmakers target them, even the adults would sit quiet and watch without whining.\r\n\r\n_4\/10_","id":"59ec94ebc3a368752f002e19","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59ec94ebc3a368752f002e19","movie_id":305470}

{"author":"The Movie Waffler","content":"Should you decide to visit your local cinema to take in a showing of Phantom Thread, Paul Thomas Anderson's latest offbeat character study, you might want to make a bit more effort with your wardrobe than you're accustomed to for such outings. After spending 130 minutes totally immersed in the world of 1950s high fashion, I felt like an utter rube walking out of the cinema in my jeans and hoody combo.\r\n\r\nPhantom Thread is as immersive as cinema gets. From its opening sequence, which takes us inside the House of Woodcock, a London fashion house run in quietly tyrannical fashion by renowned dressmaker Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day Lewis), Anderson's film dismisses any thoughts we might have of our own world of 2018. As we witness Reynolds go about his daily grooming routine it becomes clear we're watching a movie about a perfectionist, one made by a perfectionist, and starring a perfectionist in what is reputedly his final acting role.\r\n\r\nSet in his ways like a tree set in concrete, Reynolds knows what he likes, and he likes what he knows. As such, his relationships with the many admiring members of the opposite sex (the film is set at a time when no man was more attractive than one who made things; and if those things happened to make women feel beautiful, like Reynolds' gowns, all the better) rarely get past the following morning's breakfast, where idle chit chat and toast buttering irritate him to a laughably over the top degree.\r\n\r\nIt's during breakfast away from home, in a small country caf\u00e9, that Reynolds meets Alma (Vicky Krieps), a pretty Eastern European waitress who is won over by his flirtatious charm and accepts his invitation for a dinner date. The relationship blooms quickly and Reynolds invites her into his home, teaching her the ways of his trade.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't take long for Alma's ways to begin annoying the fiercely independent and somewhat narcissistic Reynolds, and her presence begins to disrupt his work - she's become an anti-muse! Reynolds' assumption that she will follow the other women in his past and leave quietly once exposed to his spoilt brat boorishness couldn't be more wrong however. Alma is determined to make the relationship work, even if she has to take extreme measures.\r\n\r\nRead the rest of Eric Hillis's review at http:\/\/www.themoviewaffler.com\/2018\/01\/new-release-review-phantom-thread.html","id":"5a8432a70e0a2652ab00a5ca","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a8432a70e0a2652ab00a5ca","movie_id":400617}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Indie flick starts shaky with contrived teen attitudes, but improves and is moving***\r\n\r\nA single woman (Madelyn Deutch) moves in with her aunt in Paris, Tennessee, to teach history at the local school where her students are so problematic she\u2019s tempted to quit. The class is forced to meet at a KOA office due to flooding problems at the school wherein Ms. Hoog decides to send the kids on treasure hunts to learn about local history. But this stirs the ire of the biddies on the school board. Linc Hand is on hand as her potential beau.      \r\n\r\n\u201cPainted Horses\u201d (2017) is one of those super low-budget movies by indie filmmakers who want to take advantage of their beloved local region, like \u201cThe Legend of Tillamook's Gold\u201d (2006) and \u201cFalcon Song\u201d (2014). The production quality of these flicks isn\u2019t quite up to the standards of TV movies, which doesn\u2019t mean they have no worth. You just have to be braced for a movie of this caliber.\r\n\r\nThese indies usually run anywhere from $50,000-$150,000, give or take, depending on how much was spent on cast, lodging, catering, travel and so forth. \"Another Kind\" (2013) was made for $120,000 and is a superb example of how a professional-class film can be made for this kind of micro-budget. Even spare-change flicks, like \"A Bothered Conscience,\" which only cost $2300, can be effective if the filmmaker & crew are talented enough and make use of their resources efficiently.\r\n\r\nSo how does \"Painted Horses\" stack up? The classroom scenes in the first half hour are weak and seriously tempted me to tune out. The kids with attitudes lay it on too thick and come off contrived and unconvincing. Yet \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d (1985) had the same problem and it was a blockbuster, so this can be forgiven. Thankfully, the movie improves in the second half as the teacher gets to know the students and they turn out to be human beings. A little bit o\u2019 \u201cDead Poets Society\u201d (1989) is naturally included in the mix.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s no problem with the main actors, that is, Deutch, Hand, Deana Carter (Aunt Nora) and Tommy Cresswell (the principal); they all heartily rise to the challenge and give it their best.

But we made the film as an act of love for this stolen, forgotten child. The child never had the experience of love, so we thought a love story would be the key to enter this story. Also, you can't change the destiny of the boy, but maybe the ghost of the boy could change the life of the main character, so for us, it was the only way possible to tell the story, from the point of the main character, the girl in love with him._\r\n\r\n- Antonio Piazza; \"How _Sicilian Ghost Story_'s directors are transforming Italian cinema\" (Jack Rear); _Verdict_ (August 1, 2018)\r\n\r\n_Sicilian Ghost Story_ is cinema as art, in the purest sense of the term. Extraordinary aesthetic beauty and not a small amount of technical virtuosity contain a narrative that is emotionally devastating, but also paradoxically uplifting. It's hard to believe this is only co-writers\/co-directors Antonio Piazza and Fabio Grassadonia's second film.\r\n\r\nAs the lights came up at the screening I attended, I sat in a kind of stupefied silence, staring at the credits rolling on the screen, too flummoxed to really move. This is something that has only happened to me a handful of times, when the (call it what you wish) artistic potency, aesthetic splendour, emotional catharsis has overwhelmed me, and I've turned into a gibbering idiot. To cite some recent(ish) examples: Michael Mann's _Heat_ (1995), Terrence Malick's _The Thin Red Line_ (1998), Darren Aronofsky's _Requiem for a Dream_ (2000), Stephen Daldry's _The Hours_ (2002), Malick's _The Tree of Life_ (2011), Micha\u00ebl R. Roskam's _Rundskop_ (2011), and Benh Zeitlin's _Beasts of the Southern Wild_. _Sicilian Ghost Story_ now joins that venerable list.\r\n\r\nOn an unconscious level, I was trying to process the wave of emotions sweeping over me, trying to qualify and characterise what I was feeling, and by so during, drag it from the unconscious into consciousness. There, I'd have a better chance of understanding why the film had had such a profound effect on me, why it had burrowed under my skin so completely. Then, suddenly, I realised I was employing completely the wrong interpretative strategy; I was trying to analyse the film on an ontological level which, for the most part, it doesn't exist. I was looking at it from an intellectual point of view, when the film operates almost wholly on an emotional plane. And with that realisation came another; to fully engage with the film critically, one must allow oneself to become emotionally involved rather than remain intellectually detached (a reverse _Verfremdungseffekt_, if you will). And there's a very specific content-driven reason why the film operates on the emotional rather than the intellectual level, which we'll look at in a moment, and which speaks to just how accomplished a piece of work this is.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 1993, _Sicilian Ghost Story_ tells the story of Luna (an extraordinary debut performance by Julia Jedlikowska, who carries the entire film) and Giuseppe (Gaetano Fernandez), two thirteen-year-olds living in Palermo, on the Italian island of Sicily. Both come from difficult domestic situations, and are slowly awakening to the fact that they seem to be falling in love. Giuseppe is the son of a Cosa Nostra hitman who has recently turned state's witness in prison, whilst every aspect of Luna's home life is controlled by her domineering mother (Sabine Timoteo), although she has a good relationship with her diminutive father (Vincenzo Amato). Luna is also very close with classmate Loredana (Corinne Musallari), who lives nearby, and with whom she communicates at night via Morse code. Everything is relatively normal in their lives until Giuseppe disappears. Deeply upset, Luna is incredulous at the community's lack of reaction \u2013 nobody seems to either care or want to do anything to try to find Giuseppe, indeed most people won't even acknowledge anything has happened at all. With this in mind, Luna determines to find him herself, quickly realising that the two share a kind of psychic connection, upon which she must rely if she is ever to see him again.\r\n\r\nThe film is adapted from Marco Mancassola's short-story \"Un cavaliere bianco\" [\"A White Knight\"] in his 2011 book, _Non saremo confusi per sempre_ [_We Won't Be Confused Forever_]. The book gives a fantasy-based fictional account of, and links together, five real-life Italian cases \u2013 Vittorio Emanuele's murder of Dirk Hamer in 1978 (\"Un principe azzurro\"); Alfredo Rampi's death after falling down a well in 1981 (\"Un bambino al centro della terra\"); Eluana Englaro's seventeen-year coma after a car crash, from 1992 to 2009 (\"Una bella addormentata\"); the kidnapping, torture, and murder of eleven-year-old Giuseppe Di Matteo in 1996 (\"Un cavaliere bianco\"); and, Federico Aldrovandi's death in 2005 after being beaten by four policemen (\"Un ragazzo fantasma\").\r\n\r\nGiuseppe Di Matteo was the son of Santino Di Matteo (known as Mezzanasca), a hitman for the Cosa Nostra. In 1992, Mezzanasca took part in the murder of Giovanni Falcone, a judge working to break the power of the Mafia in Sicily. The following year, he was arrested, and soon turned _pentito_, i.e. he became an informer. In retaliation, the Mafia kidnapped his eleven-year-old son, Giuseppe. The plan was to use Giuseppe to silence Mezzanasca, torturing him, and sending pictures to his father demanding that he recant his testimony. However, Mezzanasca refused to cooperate, and continued to work with the police. After 779 days of imprisonment, Giuseppe was strangled to death on the orders of Mezzanasca's former colleague, Giovanni Brusca, and his body subsequently dissolved in a vat of acid so as to prevent it being discovered and examined for evidence, also forcing the family to stage a funeral without a body, a practice known as _lupara bianca_. As in the film, Mancassola uses the real-life events as the starting-point for an otherworldly, fantastical narrative which follows Luna's increasingly non-corporeal attempts to find Giuseppe.\r\n\r\nWhen the film opened Semaine de la Critique at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival (the first Italian film to do so), it received a ten-minute standing ovation, and has already won a slew of awards \u2013 the 2016 Sundance Institute\/Mahindra Global Film Award; Best Adapted Screenplay at the 2017 David di Donatello Awards (also nominated for Best Song, Best Cinematography, and the David Giovani Award); Best Cinematography and Best Set Design at the 2017 Nastri d'argento (also nominated for Best Film and Best Directors); Best Screenplay at the 2017 Athens International Film Festival; Best Film and Best Actress at the 2017 Magna Grecia Awards; Best Cinematography at the 2017 Valletta Film Festival; the ARCA CinemaGiovani Award at the 2017 Fiuggi Film Festival; the Ischia Movie Award at the 2017 Ischia Global Film & Music Fest; Prix Special du public at the 2017 Cin\u00e9Alma Festival; the Audience Award at the 2018 Saas-Fee Filmfest; and Best Cinematography at the 2018 Ciak d'oro.\r\n\r\nIn short, the film is creating a lot of waves.\r\n\r\nThe murder of Giuseppe was the culmination of a wave of Mafia violence in Sicily throughout the 80s and into the 90s. Pizza and Grassadonia were themselves so disturbed by the case that they left Sicily altogether. Many years later, they became interested in telling Giuseppe's story. However, as the real-life events offered no catharsis or redemption, no justice, and ended with a child being dissolved in acid, they were unsure how best to approach the material. It was only after they read \"Un cavaliere bianco\" that they decided to turn the case into a dark fable, and focus not on Giuseppe (the ghost of the title), but on the fictional Luna.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, _Sicilian Ghost Story_ is a fantasy-based love story first, and a fact-based tale of violence and murder second. Indeed, it could just as legitimately be called _Sicilian Love Story_. Poetic and magical in equal measure, although it spends a great deal of time within Luna's imagination\/unconscious, it remains grounded in the Cosa Nostra-dominated Sicilian culture of the early 90s (imagine Neil Jordan's _The Company of Wolves_ (1984) directed by Martin Scorsese). Because of this duality, although the film tells an undeniably dark story, Pizza and Grassadonia were able to craft a paradoxically uplifting _d\u00e9nouement_.\r\n\r\nThe duality also works on the level at which the audience receives the film - the focus on Luna's unconscious, on her dreams, on her psychic link with Giuseppe, provides a buffer for the audience, softening the impact of the real-life Giuseppe's horrific death whilst still respecting the events, albeit from within the frame of a fantasy-based narrative. Speaking to Charles Tesson during Semaine de la Critique at Cannes, Piazza and Grassadonia state,\r\n\r\n> _the only way to [tell the story] was for us to create a collision between a level of reality and a level of fantasy. On the level of reality, a dark fable. On the level of fantasy, a romantic fable._\r\n\r\nThis may seem distasteful to some, as the film posits that love is able to transcend violence, and, ultimately, give freedom to the soul, but the directors state,\r\n\r\n> _at the end, another reality is revealed, one which surpasses dreams and nightmares, a reality in which ghosts reveal their true nature, their very solid and indestructible reality as souls._\r\n\r\nObviously, this aspect of the story has no correlation with the horrific real-life events. However, Pizza and Grassadonia argue that they are essentially resurrecting the real Giuseppe, insofar as the story is not especially well known, even in Sicily itself \u2013 for example, all of the young cast are from Sicily, but none of them knew anything about Giuseppe. Speaking to verdict.co.uk, they argue that the film's narrative allows them to approach the facts of the case in a unique way; as Luna is\r\n\r\n> _using a fantasy, her imagination, and dreams at night, to reimagine reality. A revolution against the facts, the way they are told. Sometimes facts become written in stone and become something that you have to destroy. Fantasy, for us, is a political act._\r\n\r\nIn terms of the content, as I have already mentioned, the film exists on an emotional level rather than an intellectual one, and the audience will get the most from it if they allow themselves to engage with it on that same emotional level. Piazza and Grassadonia liken this to _Romeo and Juliet_, a dark, violent story in which children die horrible deaths, but which works because Shakespeare's verse allows readers an emotional distance from the events of the (not especially well-structured) plot; if one analyses the play on a purely intellectual level, it makes little sense. However, on an emotional level, it works perfectly. _Sicilian Ghost Story_ operates in a similar way \u2013 the emotional is far more important than the intellectual. This is all tied into how Piazza and Grassadonia wanted to honour the real Giuseppe, but rather than presenting a fact-based intellectual film, they instead made an emotion-based fairy-tale. That the film operates on this emotional level is tied into its very DNA.\r\n\r\nAs to my experience, I became aware I was watching something extraordinary in the opening scene. Inside a cave, the camera travels over dark rocks. A weak light emanates from the mouth of the cave, and reflects off the droplets of water on the rocks. As the camera moves, and the screen fills with a black background permeated by soft white spots, one could be looking at an expansive star field rather than being confined inside a cave, a shot which recalls the scene on the driving range in Michael Mann's _The Insider_ (1999), which has a similarly disorientating effect (although used by the director for a very different end).\r\n\r\nAs the film continued, it became increasingly obvious to me that the form and content are so intrinsically bound together, that it's difficult to tell which is generating which. For example, the music (which is non-diegetic, and therefore form) bleeds into the foley (which is diegetic, and therefore content). But does the foley give rise to the music or does the music give rise to the foley?\r\n\r\nThe filmmakers also employ a litany of techniques to link, contrast, and compare various scenes. Animal imagery appears throughout; an owl in the opening shot is seen multiple times over the course of the rest of the film, and also highlighted are butterflies, a stout, a dog, spiders, and, especially, horses. There's even a reference to Pan (although, thankfully, no mention of having sex with goats or pederasty). On a more technical level, Pizza and Grassadonia's visual trickery is exceptionally accomplished, and they employ it perfectly, always justified by the content; fisheye lenses, Dutch angles, asymmetrical framing, chiaroscuro lighting, soft focus, forced perspective, etc.\r\n\r\nAs I was musing on what I would talk about in this review, I realised that most of the reasons I loved the film so much will be the exact same reasons that a lot of people hate it \u2013 the narrative ambiguity, the only-ever-hinted-at possibility of something ethereal living in the forest, the slightly confusing achronological structure, the camera trickery, the slow pacing, the bleak morality, the non-diegetic light sources, the naturalistic acting, the symbolism and visual metaphors, the use of a real-life murder as the subject for an oneiric romance dealing with first love, the (at times) oppressive music, the tacit disregard for genre, the two scenes where the narrative progression simply stops completely and there are two four-or-five-minute sequences that don't advance the plot in any way, but which are achingly beautiful, and central to the film's overriding theme \u2013 that love can transcend all.\r\n\r\nIf I was being forced to criticise, I suppose, the way the narrative folds back on itself without really alerting the audience that it's a flashback can be a little disorientating, but this is hardly a criticism, as disorientation is obviously the point, as the film attempts to place the audience in the same confused headspace as Giuseppe. It also starts a little slow and doesn't instantly pull you in. But that's it. I wouldn't say a single negative word about anything else.\r\n\r\nThis is cinema as art. Point of fact, it's nothing less than a masterpiece.","id":"5cdb70f3c3a3683d17c02b34","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cdb70f3c3a3683d17c02b34","movie_id":453347}
{"author":"SgtKowalski","content":"**The Guardians: how to make a \"Russian X-Men\" flick for $7 million.**\r\n\r\nIn our world the sum of $7 million was last adequate for a blockbuster about 40 years ago. Obviously, the Russian team bet on using smaller resources to maximum gain. Not unlike the current Russian president's geopolitics, cough. The result is more than solid\u2014for a direct-to-DVD level superhero flick, that is.\r\n\r\n**The women:** gorgeous in a way which only Eastern European women can ever be\u2014combining the Scandinavian Valkyrie component with the finer feminine Slavic beauty. In short\u2014the next Trump-type can do worse than dip into the beauty pool of The Guardians.\r\n\r\n**The men**: dreamy types, blond and dark, muscular and lithe\u2014for all tastes.\r\n\r\n**The acting quality:** imagine the supporting cast of any generic direct-to-DVD film with Steven Segal, but worse by about 25%.\r\n\r\n**The action sequences:** world class.\r\n\r\n**The special effects:** more or less on par with the special effects from the first X-Men film from the year 2000, which back then cost $75 million to make. Apparently a decade and a half later technology has progressed enough to enable the plucky Russian team to achieve the same effects of\u2026the effects\u2026for a minuscule fraction of the cost.\r\n\r\n**The plot:** Soviet super-soldier experiments decades ago led to a bunch of amnesiac, un-aging men and women scattered around the country, who are gathered once more in order to stop the baddie who is wreaking havoc on New York, *sorry*, I meant Moscow. The baddie in question is like an uglier Bane, but with an approximation of the powers of Magneto.\r\n\r\n**The end result:** can it compete with the Marvel or DC films of today? Absolutely not. Is it good entertainment when measured by direct-to-DVD or TV film (or modern computer game) standards? Sure\r\n\r\n**Conclusion:** back in the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s Italian directors like Sergio Leone and Dario Argento proved that even if you have no budget and no actors and no coherent plot, you can still create world-class, even legendary cinema through sheer class.\r\n\r\nThe Guardians has no class whatsoever, but is a perfectly OK derivative adventure with superheroes and things going bang, and in an \"exotic\" setting at that. Maybe this is just the start of something cheap and beautiful?\r\n\r\nIf Russia becomes a world center for cheap knock-offs of Hollywood films, I for one would be happy with this development and would watch these films, because with smaller budgets and therefore less oversight by focus-group obsessed bean counters, interesting stuff may start to develop within the generic story skeletons, as once was the case with Italian films.","id":"58fa0831925141587300b509","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58fa0831925141587300b509","movie_id":354556}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Not just another superhero film!**\r\n\r\nIt was more like a counterpart of the first 'Captain America' film. Because both the films set in the same background, which is the Cold War. But the Cold War was merely a reason to initiate what the film needed for its story. So as we roughly guessing the plot, there's something goes wrong in the secret experiment and then there emerges the superheroes and the supervillains.\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw such scale grand Russian film was 'The Inhabited Island' and decided never watch such Russian flicks. I might be wrong, because my knowledge about the Russian films is less, but there could be a lot better films that I haven't seen. Anyway, I put all my faith on it, despite very low ratings and heavily criticised it on the internet. I must say that, it was a decent film, neither a breathtaking nor a worst film (of the year).\r\n\r\nYep, there's lots of clich\u00e9, because you have seen them all in high standard Hollywood films. But since it is not a Hollywood, comparing them is unfair. A little appreciation needed for its effort. Except borrowing the concept should be questioned here. Because that's made its lack of originality. And one more exception is that science is everywhere the same, which is a big excuse for that.\r\n\r\nThe graphics were almost flawless. The characters are unique, but adapted from the same blueprint how every superhero film take off. So what went wrong with it is the big question, despite everything's carefully and nicely done. And the answer is the screenplay. Any superhero films majorly depends on the best designed action sequences and the stunt choreography with respective superpowers of the superheroes at its best.\r\n\r\n> \u275dDeath for us is not a problem, we've lived long enough.\u275e\r\n\r\nI liked the costumes, which aren't too fancy or simple, and the superpowers, but I don't think they were used that in the best way possible. And have you ever seen a 90 or less minute superhero film. That's another drawback. Because shortening the runtime does not speed up the narration. In this film, there were no space given for the character developments, like to make them, those heroes sit somewhere and have some lazy takes, which surely opens their deep thought, including personal events of the past and all. What I saw was, they came, they saw the villain and they fought him.\r\n\r\nWell, at first attempt, it should not succeed, otherwise the film ends there. That's how all the superheroes rise back from the initial stumble. Only after upgrading with modern scientific weapons and gadgets to boost their superpowers, they now can match the bad guy. Those were the properly done things from the film. But not everybody will be happy for it as it is another clich\u00e9d segment. So what, that's same even if it is a Hollywood or European film.\r\n\r\nThen what makes the film watchable is the production standards, that very much comparable with the big cost films around the world. Those criticised it was wrongly accused as saying it has the cheap CGI visuals, but that's definitely not true. Then the most successful film in the history of Indian cinema, 'Bahubali' would lead such worst visual effects list. If you watch this film, you would know that or you would bring your own perception. But the plot holes, surely there are many, if you are focused enough to identify them.\r\n\r\nAfter all, if you give your interest to watch the film, then there won't be any time to go after such errors. Thus, it is the thing what all the film critics usually do. Madness is some film fanatics joined them. So never mind all the negatives about the film. Don't think I'm defending it. Just know how I rated it, an average. My idea is to expose it not a very bad film as it was labelled. That does not mean it is a fantastic film either. A 50-50 chance film, which can be still watchable, and once you did, the outcome of the watch could be anything. So after seeing all the confusing ratings and reviews, it must be hard for you whether to go for it or not. Suppose if you ask me, I say choose wisely, and if you did, have low expectations.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"596796139251413462003ddf","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/596796139251413462003ddf","movie_id":354556}

A sequel to the 2004 film Super Size Me, it explores the ways in which the fast food industry has rebranded itself as healthier since his original film through the process of Spurlock working to open his own fast food restaurant, thus exposing some of the ways in which that rebranding is more perception than reality.  -Wikipedia\r\n\r\nSince Spurlock's long-overdue indictment of the fast food industry in 2004, healthy menu options have become a popular trend, buoyed by clever marketing buzzwords such as organic, artisan, and all-natural. But does any of this really translate to improved alternatives for consumers? In his signature style, Spurlock creates his own fast-food chain from the ground up; he rents space at a chicken farm, conceives a menu, and hires a savvy marketing team to craft a brand that will appeal to health-minded customers. Recognizing how simple it is to follow the FDA's absurdly vague guidelines for applying terms like \"free-range\" to the food you serve, he opens Holy Chicken!, a restaurant peddling convenience fare under the guise of being better for you.

There was plenty of singing and dancing, obviously, which was good for the most part. But it wasn't as good as the other films. Probably my biggest complaint would be about Fat Amy and her dad. Now, John Lithgow is a great actor in my opinion, but as an Australian, I was a big taken aback when he was cast as an Australian. His Aussie accent was hit and miss and after the movie all I was thinking was the possible Australian actors that could've been cast in his place. John Jarratt comes to mind (joke). Also, why do people keep casting Ruby Rose. No offence, but she just can't act. And she did an American accent in this so that was a bit weird as well.

Initially, it annoyed me to see the Sandler with the same old accent. But seeing the some of the scenes, it actually made sense. I especially thought it should have been a serious drama, but then it would haven't worked out with the kind of characters it had. Particularly the Kevin James.\r\n\r\nIt is a 90s tale about a Hollywood manager. Narrated as a flashback as the film stars recall his legacy. His latest find, a young woman with a golden voice, is an upcoming sensation. He always stood for her in all the good and bad situations. But time comes he to back off and focus on his other clients. The remaining is about his job, how it shapes are told. I have heard that it was loosely based on Sandler's own manager. I also liked cameos, particularly Rikishi! A long film. But I liked it at the end. It is an okay film.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The face of three generations of Indian cricket.**\r\n\r\nThe Indian film market isn't made for documentary films. If there's an exception, that has to be not just cricket, but Sachin Tendulkar. I know you know that India is a vast cultural diverse country. Hundreds of language, ethnic, religion, caste, in so many ways, so many people split over the things. But one thing that unites north, south, northeast is the cricket. The '83 World Cup might have been the new beginning, but Sachin was the X factor for the Indian cricket to see a revolution. The sports body saw an opportunity and rebranded themselves with his presence. Because of him, the Indians started to watch cricket, learn cricket. Hence the cricket became a religion and Sachin's a god.\r\n\r\nThis is the second biographical-sport film about Indian cricket I'm seeing after 'M.S. Dhoni: An Untold Story'. I liked that it wasn't a feature film. Feature films are commercialised, skips parts, alters storyline and characters. Not to forget that there will be boring music tracks if it is an Indian film. Besides, to see the actors in the shoes of real life achievers, not that good as I always say, why did that guy won the Oscar, who just depicted the one who struggled and achieved in the real cruel world. So hats off to the filmmakers for bringing this up in the best way possible.\r\n\r\nYou could call it a prequel to that Dhoni film. Not just because both the films are about cricket or Indian cricket, but they both ran parallel. In a way they are connected. Except, focused on the different person, and this one had a head start like a decade earlier. Most of the achievers in the sports had began with an unexpected gift at their very young age that steered them to choose an apt career. It could be anything. A badminton racquet or a chessboard or a pair of shoes. For Tendulkar, it was a cricket bat from his big sister. He was a naughty boy till he got that bat. With his brother's support, he took the sport seriously and then everything has changed for him for the next 27 years of his life.\r\n\r\nAt the age eleven, he first took the bat. Five years later, he was the youngest player to represent his nation. That too was against the arch-rival in their home turf. I don't remember all those, because I was just a baby then. But 6 years later, I joined the fan club of one billion. I'm not a Tendulkar fan, though I always respected him alongside a few other gentlemen like him, Dravid and Dhoni. They're not just the players with good conducts, but rewrote the history. Besides, Nobody needs to be a Tendulkar fan to enjoy his batting. There were many legends before him and after him, but he'd found his own unique place that will be remembered for decades, centuries.\r\n\r\n> \u275dIndia played themselves into a situation that was not uncommon in those days. If Tendulkar out, India is out.\u275e\r\n\r\nBeing young would have been his advantage, but after getting a captaincy, he had struggled. If you're a 70s, 80s kid grown up in the 90s, then you would know the exact reason. In the late 90s, the match fixing event broke out. I remember my first ever World Cup, the '99 in England. But a sad event surfaced in his life. Even I got emotional while watching that part in this film. Those videos I watched 18 years ago and watching the same clips in this film with a backstory, tell me who won't melt down. A true hero. But the film wasn't just highlighting his achievements, focused on his life journey through the cricket he loved. So you could see everything he'd seen his own eyes, like what his teammates achieved too and he was part of it.\r\n\r\nThe narration was hopping between the World Cups like the checkpoints. How his cricketing life, as well as personal life shaped every four years were interesting to see. Because he'd started his career at a young age, he saw many teammates come and go. The generation after generation for three, the sport too saw the revolution alongside. During his final days, it was the T20 era. The fearless cricket age. Seeing lots of ups and downs, he'd marked his presence to inspire the future Indian cricketers. Even the Dhoni, Kohli and many legends of todays world cricketers have said that they've got inspiration from him.\r\n\r\nThey've recreated the his boyhood life with the actors. Only in the initial stage to have a perfect start. Because I guess they didn't have video clips for those sections. Tendulkar was born in an average Indian middle class family. But once his cricketing life began, and getting a popular, at least in the Mumbai region was the turning point. Especially after that dream run-fest with Vinod Kambli.\r\n\r\nWhere's the Sudhir Chaudhary? Anybody who is familiar with Indian cricket knows that guy. Yeah, he was there for a few seconds, but I anticipated a small brief or mention about him. My experience was good, though listening all the dialogues, even the real clips in Tamil translation looked a bit strange, but nothing wrong.\r\n\r\nThey'd skipped the IPL part, just like Dhoni's film to make it a united national product. But one of the best parts of that league was, his batting was celebrated even from the opposition fans. So the India united for him, because of him when franchise based regional war were going on. Just over the two hour long, it was a well detailed biopic. If you're an Indian cricket fan, you surely would love it. Even if you're a cricket fan from overseas, there's no reason to ignore it. A must see for all who love this sport, as well as who never heard of it to learn something out of it.\r\n\r\n_10\/10_","id":"59dbec3b9251412514066df1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59dbec3b9251412514066df1","movie_id":401552}

Which while hardly being a film that deserved a theatrical run - or indeed a must see horror - is still a shame because it's a very tidy little chiller.\r\n\r\nMood is nicely set by the opening where a young Shree Crooks (Stephanie) goes about her daily life alone in the house - her only companion a cuddly toy turtle.

At some point somebody asked the question \"where are we?\" and while I was reflecting philosophically on the matter, somebody else pointed out that we were parked in a lot by the cineplex and we slowly realized that we were here to see 'The Last Jedi'! I could barely function at all, so I went to my old go-to routine of donning dark glasses and a white cane to help disguise my complete stonification by pretending I was just some poor blind guy stumbling around and knocking things over.

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps:\/\/www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nFinally, I managed to watch one of my most anticipated movies of 2017! I am an authentic fanboy of the Star Wars saga and I loved its return two years ago when The Force Awakens was released. Everything looked better, sounded better and the story certainly didn't disappoint me. So, obviously, I was extremely looking forward to The Last Jedi.\r\n\r\nApparently, critics love Episode VIII but fans not so much. Me, well ... I don't LOVE it, but I do enjoy it very much. I do think it is a bit below the previous film's overall quality since it definitely has some issues the first one did not. I am also confident that I know why the fans are not loving this movie and I will explain that after a few paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThis time, I am going to start at the other side of the spectrum. I will begin my review with the film's problems because I do need to get them out of my mind, especially this one ... The subplot involving Finn (John Boyega), Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and DJ (Benicio Del Toro), some of the few new characters added to the franchise, completely ruins the movie's pacing and its narrative is such a tremendous deviation from the main story. It is, by far, the worst issue I have with the screenplay because it does not work as one single problem ... It creates a whole other set of them.\r\n\r\nThe first act's pacing is really fast since it starts with tons of action sequences. However, the second act decreases the rhythm and it is more story-driven, full of mystery-unlocking and character-development scenes. Finn and Rose's nonsense adventure just turns everything slower and even strange. It ends up needlessly extending the runtime (the film could have easily been 15min shorter) and worse ... Possibly creating a love triangle with Rey (I am not even going to discuss this).\r\n\r\nApart from this major issue(s), I have some minor problems. General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) is a strong candidate to become the most annoying character in this new-generation trilogy. Gleeson is fine, he actually achieves a good over-the-top performance, but his character is just tumbling off the rails. Also, on a more technical aspect, the writing does not flow as well as it did on J.J. Abrams' screenplay. There are a lot more exposition scenes which also does not help the pacing at all.\r\n\r\nI wrote earlier about the fans' reasons for them to be disappointed and well, the marketing for the movie did not lie: they do take a lot of chances with this one. Rian Johnson delivers a lot of twists and shocks throughout the whole runtime and it is impossible to assume that every single one of them is going to be mind-blowing and unanimously accepted. I do not want to give anything away from the plot, so I am just going to write that most of the choices and paths they choose for each character, I either simply accept them or I truly love them. As for the rest, I am, at most, underwhelmed (yet, I trust and understand the decisions they went with).\r\n\r\nPeople need to learn how to deal with their own expectations. If you expect something utterly absurd and nonsensical to occur and then it does not, you can't blame the film for not following your crazy idea. So, please, don't start blabbing any movie is bad or disappointing because it didn't fulfill your ridiculously high expectations. Even if they are grounded and thoughtful, you have to embrace the production's approach to the character\/story. If it makes sense, then it is as valid as any other theory. It might be underwhelming if you have high expectations, but it is still a serious take on whatever you are thinking.\r\n\r\nThis is why I think fans are not loving The Last Jedi. The production takes a lot of risks and some of them don't work with everyone, mostly due to fans' radical theories that don't have a place in the film. I think most people might change their initial opinion after a second viewing, myself included. Some things just need more time to process or even a whole rewatch. Since I do not have time to do it before the year's end, I am going with what I have.\r\n\r\nSwitching to the light side (hehe), I do enjoy this movie a lot. Every cast member that was great in Episode VII, transcends themselves in this one. Daisy Ridley is superb as Rey. She has such a massive range of expressions and I am sure her successful future as an actress is surely guaranteed. From the most emotional and somber moments to the most epic action scenes, she is awesome. Her character's mysterious backstory reaches a whole new extent and her interactions with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Luke Skywalker inflict chills all over my body.\r\n\r\nMark Hamill's comeback can't be any more amazing than it is. He delivers a fantastic, emotion-full and very compelling performance. It is even more unbelievable knowing that Hamill had strong personal arguments against the director's interpretation of what was better for Luke. If he is this astounding working against his own idea of who his character really is, then I must praise his exemplary working principles.\r\n\r\nLuke and Rey spend a big chunk of the runtime training on an unknown island and I love every single second filmed on that piece of land. I have to admit that I am a bit frustrated because I think the film should have more time with these two, but due to the issues mentioned in the beginning of my review, the runtime can't be much more stretched. I love what they did with Luke, even if some fans are going to go insane with his journey.\r\n\r\nAdam Driver as Kylo Ren ... The undoubtful star of the whole show. Driver is becoming a menace to every actor working today because he is flawless. He has a powerful, dark, mysterious, compelling and commanding display as one of the most complex and multi-layered characters of the Star Wars saga. Ren's conflict inside his mind and heart is the most captivating feature of his story and his interactions with Rey are so jaw-dropping spectacular that I can't even describe them properly.\r\n\r\nJohn Boyega is once again great as Finn, even though he is part of that horrible subplot. Boyega delivers a convincing performance and Finn shines through some awesome action set pieces. Kelly Marie Tran is actually good as Rose, it is just a pity that her character suffers from the narrative, even though her backstory is pretty touching. Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and the Porgs, the new cute animals implemented in the Star Wars universe, have all the funny scenes plus some action here and there.\r\n\r\nOscar Isaac is quite lucky because Poe Dameron unquestionably has the best subplot of the movie. Isaac offers a very passionate display as Poe goes through some significant character development. His impulsive instincts to attack the bad guys always have consequences and he is put in check by Leia (Carrie Fisher) during the whole time. It is a very interesting and twistful story that elevates the film's main plot.\r\n\r\nCarrie Fisher is elegant and beautiful as Leia, a character that has a lot more screentime than what I expected. I always love seeing Fisher on the screen and she makes everything a bit more realistic to me. Andy Serkis is remarkable as Supreme Leader Snoke, but his character is yet another plot's detail that fans are not going to appreciate so much. I still feel underwhelmed by Snoke in this movie for several reasons, but after some thinking, I do understand his role in the film and his moments are indeed intimidating and dominant.\r\n\r\nRian Johnson work as the director is better than him as the writer. The visuals effects continue to be wonderful and the practical settings are beautiful, once again, there is a lot less CGI than you probably think. Excellent cinematography and the John Williams' score induces enormous levels of nostalgia and excitement. The action sequences are mind-blowing, the stunt work is phenomenal and there are tons of pure epic and awesome scenes.\r\n\r\nThe main plot includes a very dark and mysterious side to it that I thoroughly love. A lot of unexpected twists and turns make The Last Jedi more original than The Force Awakens, even if one or two plot points might be underwhelming, and it also has a very well balanced tone. Finally, a thrilling, breathtaking, action-heavy third act ends the film with magnificent glory and with many heartfelt moments.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Star Wars: The Last Jedi delivers something that I can be proud of experiencing. Terrific performances from the cast, but a flawlessly powerful display from Adam Driver as Kylo Ren steals the spotlight. Rian Johnson takes a lot of risks with decisions that will make the fanbase debate for years and while I find most of them truly jaw-dropping, a few left me underwhelmed. The main story keeps its obscure mystery while packing some jaw-dropping, epic action sequences and excellent character-development scenes. Nevertheless, it departs from JJ\u2019s visual storytelling, delivering a more exposition-heavy screenplay and some pacing issues bring the movie down, largely due to the unnecessary detour of the subplot involving Finn and Rose. In the end, it still belongs to my top half of the saga, fighting for the 4th spot with Return Of The Jedi and Rogue One.\r\n\r\nRating: B+","id":"5df9384c65686e00158a23de","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5df9384c65686e00158a23de","movie_id":181808}
{"author":"LadyGreenEyes","content":"This one killed the franchise!  I have been watching Star Wars movies since they started literally, going to the theater and enjoying the fun.  Love the original three.  Liked the prequels well enough.  I even enjoyed the cute little Ewok movies, with the kids.  \r\n\r\nThese later films have been a mixed bag.  Most were watchable enough, though not really the caliber of the old films  Sure, the effects are great, but a good movie needs more than special effects and cool alien makeup and some fun droids.\r\n\r\nThis movie was seriously disappointing.  Everything about familiar characters was changed, and the plot was so busy with pushing some weird agenda that it failed to deliver any of what we go to a Star Wars movie to see.  At this stage, I couldn't care less about the newer characters, and the whole \"Mary Sue\" aspect to the one main girl (see, I can't even recall her name!) is just annoying.  This film w bad enough that the dedicated SW fanboy in my household just quit watching, and actualy, for the first time ever, skipped the following movie entirely.  \r\n\r\nSo, congrats, Disney; you killed one of the most successful franchises ever.","id":"5c15a5c8c3a36866cc370c2c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c15a5c8c3a36866cc370c2c","movie_id":181808}
{"author":"moovies","content":"\"Not the best but certainly the most overhyped\"\r\n\r\nAs the Rebellion tries to evade The First Order, Rey asks Luke Skywalker to teach her the ways of the Force. Meanwhile Kylo Ren is still a whiny POS.\r\n\r\nDirector\/writer Rian Johnson faced a gargantuan task. Two years ago J.J. Abrams did the impossible by making a successful sequel to \u2018Star Wars\u2019. Johnson had to follow that up with something more creative because let\u2019s be honest, \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 (TFA) was a copy. He succeeds partially.\r\n\r\nWhen the movie started there were cheers. It doesn\u2019t get any better than the iconic opening crawl with John Williams\u2019 score. Although there\u2019s a certain resemblance to \u2018The Empire Strikes Back\u2019 (opening scene, Luke on the remote planet) \u2018The last Jedi\u2019 isn\u2019t a copy. Johnson has came up with a more or less original story with new characters and some twists.\r\nHowever, the problem with some of the new characters is that they get too much screen time while contributing nothing to the story. In some cases up to the point where they\u2019re just plain annoying. Benicio Del Toro anyone? Meanwhile we find out nothing new about the characters we got to know in \u2018TFA\u2019. Rey, Finn & Dameron still feel new.\r\n\r\nThe villains are another problem. The most iconic part about \u2018Star Wars\u2019 has always been the villains. Darth Vader is an icon. Emperor Palpatine and Darth Maul were also quite impressive. Without spoiling anything I think it\u2019s safe to say Kylo Ren (who\u2019s still suffering from huge mommy and daddy issues), Supreme Leader Snoke & General Hux are terribly underwhelming.\r\n\r\nThat of course doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a bad movie. Although it runs too long it entertains. The effects and choreography are top notch and the overall look of the film is stunning. DOP Steve Yedlin does a fine job. The final battle looks amazing ( the red stripes on the salt plains). Although there\u2019s a bit too much humor for our liking, there\u2019s some genuine funny moments. The Porgs have a bright future ahead of them marketingwise.\r\nOf course there\u2019s the nostalgia factor. It\u2019s great to see those familiar faces again and the sound of lightsabres and TIE fighters are music to our ears.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it\u2019s obvious Johnson and Disney want to go down a new path. Whether that path is the right one remains to be seen. With the announcement of a new trilogy coming up it feels like they\u2019re milking it. And you can take that literally. What\u2019s up with that milk scene? Cringeworthy.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem is that \u2018The Last Jedi\u2019 is incredibly hyped. There are reviews that say the movie is dark and that it\u2019s the best since \u2018The Empire Strikes Back\u2019. I know opinions can differ but it doesn\u2019t come close to any of the original trilogy.","id":"5bf85e340e0a261ac208d94d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bf85e340e0a261ac208d94d","movie_id":181808}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"My oldest son, as well as myself of course, wanted to watch this movie already before Christmas when it went up Geneva but it was pretty much sold out (unless you wanted to sit at the very edge of the theatre). I manage to book tickets for yesterday though so\u2026here\u2019s my ramblings about the movie.\n\nAs usual with these kind of movies, where there is a large following of fans, there is also many dissenting voices. Some people apparently are going as far as to want this movie to be undone. Well, my take on that is that these people need to grow up or let go or both. Luke is no longer a young farm boy running around saving the universe. The Star Wars universe and its characters are evolving and that is the way it should be and the way it is. Time for the next generation to pick up the torch.\nBoth me and my son really liked this movie. After the abysmal episodes I to III (Jar Jar Binks still haunts me in my dreams) I have really enjoyed the Star Wars movies.\n\nI quite liked The Force Awakens but it is true that it felt a bit like a rehash of A New Hope. Not only does this one not feel like it is reusing old material (too much) but it also feels like it is opening a new chapter in the Star Wars universe.\nThe FX is as good as you have the right to expect from a Star Wars movie. The story is fresh and well developed. It will not win any Oscars of course but I liked it. It makes things evolve while at the same time giving enough room for action and a wee bit of humor.\n\nThe characters are almost all good and well played. I am looking forward to seeing more of most of them, especially, Rey and Poe. I\u2019m not 100% convinced about Finn and Rose but I can live with them.  Kylo Ren do not yet fill up the shoes of Darth Vader but he is showing promise. Contrary to Snoke I do feel he should put on a mask though.\n\nThe two characters I did not really like was General Hux and DJ. The first one was just incompetent. I\u2019m not sure if he was supposed to be a bit of comical relief or not but, as far as I am concerned, we can do without him. DJ, well I guess he was supposed to not be liked so he did a good job of that but these kinds of assholes just frustrate me to no end. We never saw him actually meet his demise in this movie so if he is brought back I hope it will be for the sole purpose of rectifying that oversight\u2026as violently and painfully as possible.\n\nOf course, we saw a few new ships as well and as usual with the Empire bigger is better\u2026or maybe not. Not sure what to say about these new designs. At least they did not look like a enlarged (except for the bridge) Star Destroyer like Darth Vader\u2019s Super Star Destroyer.\n\nOne thing that really bugged me in the first battle though was the rebels\u2019 so called \u201cbombers\u201d. What kind of bloody moron designed those? They were just so wrong in so many ways. The design itself was just silly looking. They were slower than a flee on a patch of tar. Seriously, a space bomber that crawls along? Actually, why make a \u201cbomber\u201d in space at all? That brings us to the biggest gripe of them all with this ludicrous design\u2026dropping bombs vertically? In space? How the fuck do they fall?\n\nSure they looked somewhat cool when they dropped their bombs\u2026if your knowledge of physics is on the level of your average politician (and obviously a few Hollywood employees as well).\n\nAnyway, on the whole me and my son had two and a half hours of great fun watching The Last Jedi. I hope the next movie expands on the threads this one started. I have to say that I was a bit sorry about the feeble state of the resistance at the end, so I do hope the next writer will not let this drag on. One way to ruin Star Wars for me would be to turn Star Wars into some Battlestar Galactica variant with resistance survivors on constant run from the empire. Now it is time for the resistance to strike back, and for Rey to evolve her Jedi powers.","id":"5a43b0320e0a264f7704e83a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a43b0320e0a264f7704e83a","movie_id":181808}

{"author":"izgzhen","content":"The Last Jedi started with a very tense emotion, capturing all viewers' attention tightly including mine (I've seen all movie episodes of Star Wars series so this type of scenario should look familiar to me).\r\n\r\nThis tense and epic feeling filled the entire film, so even it is a bit lengthy, people won't sleep over :) however, the scenes involving Rey and Luke on the isolated island planet look super quiet and mindful. It was similar to the scene in previous episode when Luke was seeking help from the Yoda Master. However, it felt more complex, because never had Yoda been described being evil, not a bit.\r\n\r\nOne tiny detail that I felt redundant and unconvincing was the reincarnation of Leia Princess. How did she fly back to the ship? As far as I can tell, no reason is given in the film. This lets you suspect whether she was going to be who can command the Force like a Jedi, but well all you can do is just suspecting.\r\n\r\nAnother critical option that I had to express was about the role of Kylo Ren. He is a complex character, and I am not sure that he believed in until the very end of the story. The climax of this complexity arrived at the scene when he killed Snoke and fought along with Rey, trying to persuading her to come for *a new world*. But this complexity simply came and disappeared. The story continued in the old way and our powerless always furious Ben Solo kept playing a simpleton role of any typical bad guy. The role is depicted as, adequately complex, but not consistent and lively enough (compared to the former Lord Darth Vader).","id":"5a58d3870e0a2634ef00be10","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a58d3870e0a2634ef00be10","movie_id":181808}

{"author":"Bulletproof5FDP","content":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi \u2013 This Is Not The Film You\u2019re Looking For\r\n\r\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens kicked off the Sequel Trilogy and many proclaimed the movie has returned Star Wars back to form. Though the plot of the movie is literally the same as A New Hope, The Force Awakens invoked mysticism of the characters and plot elements and raised numerous unanswered questions that would hopefully be answered in the next installment. Star Wars: The Last Jedi follows directly after the events of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and though the film attempts to hurl the Star Wars franchise into newer territory, the Last Jedi is a visually stunning spectacle that managed to undermine everything established in The Force Awakens and does great deal of disservice to our legacy characters. \r\n\r\nRey \u2013 Overpowered?\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest gripes I had with The Force Awakens was that Rey was insanely good at just about everything. She beat Kylo Ren, an experienced Force user, with no Force\/lightsaber training, performed a Jedi mind trick with ease, flew the Millennium Falcon with little trouble, and managed to stop Kylo Ren from probing her mind. We were introduced to the mystery of Rey\u2019s parents and her strength with the Force, neither of which are addressed in The Last Jedi. A relatively short passage of time occurs between films and Rey is even more overpowered than ever, receiving absolutely no training from Luke and she bests him (a Jedi Master!) in combat with no explanation as to how she is so strong with the Force. Luke in the Original Trilogy started off as a farm boy who has no knowledge of the Force until Obi-Wan teaches him about it. He received training by Yoda and failed miserably at combating Darth Vader, losing a hand and his lightsaber in the process. By the time of Return of the Jedi, Luke is established as being an experienced Force user who constructed a new lightsaber and is able to perform Jedi mind tricks. Rey, on the other hand, shows no signs of struggle and easily manages to lift boulders by the end of the film (Luke struggled to even concentrate and lift a small amount of rocks when training with Yoda). The film offers no attempt to address Rey\u2019s Force strength and we\u2019re left with having to accept she\u2019s strong for no reason. Had there been a much longer passage of time between films, then it would be a bit more acceptable. However, her unanswered strength in the Force further solidifies the fact that she is overpowered. Rian Johnson has set her overpowered nature in stone and doesn\u2019t leave much room for her character to grow and develop in Episode IX. All that we can expect for Episode IX is another showdown between Kylo Ren and Rey and it\u2019s obvious that Rey will win.\r\n\r\nFinn & Rose \u2013 The Canto Bight Tales\r\n\r\nFinn was established in The Force Awakens as a former First Order Stormtrooper that became disillusioned with the First Order and decides to flee, getting as far away from the First Order as possible. Finn decides to stop running away when Rey gets captured by Kylo Ren, overcoming his fears and decides to take charge in rescuing her. He even directly battles Kylo Ren at the end, though he is easily defeated and severely injured. His character (and his arc) is tossed aside in The Last Jedi, delegated to being just a side character of no importance to the film\u2019s plot. Finn is paired up with Rose (who\u2019s just as bad as Jar Jar Binks) and go on a mission to Canto Bight to look for a master codebreaker to disable the First Order\u2019s hyperspace tracker. The Canto Bight segment is easily the worst portion of the film that drives the pacing to a screeching halt, offers nothing of importance to the overall plot and results in no actual payoff. Finn and Rose conveniently find a hacker (DJ) when jailed for a parking ticket and manage to escape, freeing numerous abused horse-like animals in the process but leaving the slave children behind. When on board Snoke\u2019s flagship, they are caught by the First Order and DJ reveals he tipped the First Order to save his own skin and for a monetary reward (So unexpected!). Finn battles with Captain Phasma, who is quickly discarded and they steal a transport to Crait. During the Battle of Crait, Finn is given a tremendous moment to shine as a hero when he decides to sacrifice himself by flying the vessel directly into the Death Star-like battering ram, but is pushed out of the way by Rose who delivers a cringe-worthy line of \u201csaving what we love.\u201d This moment will forever solidify Rose as the worst Star Wars character and steals Finn\u2019s moment of glory. His sacrifice would have given Finn a solid character arc from a cowardly First Order deserter to being a heroic figure who gave his life to save others. Rose\u2019s idiotic choice could have resulted in the First Order wiping out the Resistance and she will always be remembered as the character that managed to be worse than Jar Jar Binks.\r\n\r\nPoe v Holdo \u2013 Dawn of the SJW\r\n\r\nPoe Dameron is an exceptionally skilled pilot that planned a calculated attack on the First Order Dreadnought and though his plan to destroy the Dreadnought resulted in numerous Resistance casualties, Poe is successful at destroying the Dreadnought, but is immediately demoted by General Organa (Leia) and command is given to Vice Admiral Holdo (Purple Haired SJW). Poe knew the risks of war and deemed it necessary at the moment to destroy the Dreadnought and had he not acted on his gut instinct, the Resistance would have been completely obliterated. Instead, he is treated like he\u2019s a bumbling idiot and Holdo refused to even notify Poe of the plan with the escape pods. It honestly feels as if this film has an SJW\/Feminist agenda that strongly attempts to make the male characters (Poe, Hux, Kylo Ren, etc.) as nothing but idiots and elevates the women to a level of superiority. Politics will always have a place in the Star Wars franchise (the Prequels were built upon a politically driven foundation), but not in this shape or form. Even though Poe\u2019s plan of destroying the Dreadnought was successful and allowed for the Resistance to escape, he is seen as unhinged and acting out of line by Holdo, never once acknowledging Poe for his heroic action of practically saving the Resistance. Poe is denied the opportunity of being the heroic figure, but it was perfectly acceptable for Holdo to sacrifice herself by flying the Resistance cruiser through Snoke\u2019s ship. Holdo did nothing memorable to deserve a heroic sacrifice and it\u2019s absolutely disgraceful that Poe\u2019s character is painted as this unhinged, reckless pilot who is made out to be an idiot for his actions. Poe deserved a much better character progression in this film. As for Holdo, she was placed in this film for the sake of having a woman be in charge for no apparent reason other than to drive the fact that the man (Poe) is an \u201cidiot\u201d and the woman (Holdo) is the \u201csuperior, intelligent figure.\u201d\r\n\r\nSnoke \u2013 In The End, It Doesn\u2019t Matter\r\n\r\nSupreme Leader Snoke was set up to be the mastermind pulling the strings of the First Order and the next main villain after Palpatine. He is portrayed as a mysterious, disfigured individual who\u2019s strong with the Force and swayed Ben Solo to the Dark Side. In The Last Jedi, he is seen dressed in golden robes in a red throne room and his royal Praetorian Guards protecting him. He displays a tremendous amount of strength in the Force by conjuring Force lighting directly into the ground and sending Kylo Ren flying back and suspending Rey in the air in an intensely painful Force grip. He even was able to merge the minds of Kylo Ren and Rey together across the galaxy using the Force. He was set up to be this figure who\u2019s just as powerful and intimidating as Palpatine. But alas, Snoke is immediately discarded in the film and dies in a very unsatisfying manner. Who he is, where he came from and how he rose to power no longer matter: He\u2019s just an extremely powerful and disfigured individual with no provided background information. Snoke decides it\u2019s smart to place Luke\u2019s lightsaber on the throne\u2019s arm rest and continues to taunt and insult Kylo Ren with Rey on the floor. He orders Kylo Ren to kill Rey and gloats that he knows what Kylo Ren is thinking. However, Kylo Ren slowly moves Luke\u2019s lightsaber towards Snoke with the Force (How Snoke or none of the Praetorian Guards notice is beyond comprehension). He then ignites the lightsaber, which impales Snoke and is then cut in half, the top half of his body tumbling to the floor. His death also puts the numerous fan theories to death. Snoke no longer matters. \r\n\r\nKylo Ren \u2013 Still Throwing Tantrums\r\n\r\nOne of the best aspects of the film is not Luke Skywalker: it\u2019s Kylo Ren. Right off from the start, Kylo Ren is insulted and scolded by Snoke, which causes Kylo Ren to leave the throne room and smash his mask into pieces. Kylo Ren is still shown to struggle with the Dark Side and when the opportunity comes to blow up the command bridge Leia is on, he hesitates and decides against killing his own mother. Kylo Ren seemed to solidify his status as a villain in The Force Awakens when he killed Han Solo and in this film, he questions his own intentions and through his Force communication with Rey, the idea that Kylo Ren could be redeemed is brought into question. It\u2019s a very interesting idea seeing Kylo Ren possibly turning back to the Light Side. The team-up between Rey and Kylo Ren was also another well-done idea that showed Rey realizing that she could possibly bring Kylo Ren back to the Light. Rey decides to see Kylo Ren in an attempt to turn him away from the Dark Side, then it\u2019s revealed that Snoke manipulated the Force between them to lure Rey to him. After Kylo Ren kills Snoke with Luke\u2019s lightsaber, Rey and Kylo Ren team up with each other and take on the Praetorian Guards in one of the greatest combat sequences in all of Star Wars. Kylo Ren is able to easily defeat many of the Praetorian Guards and when it seems that Kylo Ren will turn away from the Dark Side, he asks Rey to join him by his side. Disillusioned by the fact that Kylo Ren just wanted to overthrow Snoke and assume leadership of the First Order, Rey and Kylo Ren engage in battle and destroy Luke\u2019s lightsaber in the process. The idea of establishing Kylo Ren as the main villain of the Sequel Trilogy is quite intriguing and allows for more room to develop Kylo Ren into the ultimate villain, though it came at the cost of killing off Snoke. Overall, Kylo Ren is a very solid character with a more defined vision of being the leader of the First Order.\r\n\r\nLeia Organa-Skywalker \u2013 I\u2019m Mary Poppins, Y\u2019all!\r\n\r\nSadly, this film marks Carrie Fisher\u2019s final film appearance due to her death in late 2016. It was great to see more Leia in this film, though her role is largely downplayed and does not get a moment to shine like Luke and Han. Leia has been shown in past films to be Force-sensitive, but the way this film portrays her Force abilities is beyond terrible. After the command ship\u2019s bridge is blown up, Leia gets sucked out into the vacuum of space and is assumed to be dead. However, she opens her eyes and is shown to have actually survived. She reaches out her hand and proceeds to literally fly towards the main Resistance cruiser that makes her Mary Poppins in space. We all knew Leia was Force-sensitive, but the way her Force abilities were portrayed was executed horribly. No one talks about or brings up Leia surviving while in space and Leia herself doesn\u2019t even speak about it at all for the remainder of the film. She is hospitalized on the ship and command is then given not to Poe, but to Vice Admiral Purple Hair. Prior to her Mary Poppins moment, Leia berates Poe for his successful plan in destroying the Dreadnought and demotes him on the spot. Why is Leia so upset over Poe\u2019s plan? Poe knew the risks in launching the attack and his plan resulted in the destruction of the Dreadnought and possibly killed thousands of First Order members. Leia and Holdo seemed to just team up on Poe, labeling him an idiot for launching a successful attack. Despite these issues, Leia should have been the one to fly the cruiser directly through Snoke\u2019s flagship, it would have been the honorable way to send off Leia, allowing her to have a truly shining moment. Her Mary Poppins Force moment absolutely defies how the Force works. With the death of Carrie Fisher, her final performance as Leia ends on a quite dim note and she deserved a much better send-off.\r\n\r\nLuke Skywalker \u2013 This Isn\u2019t The Jedi You\u2019re Looking For\r\n\r\nAfter the cliffhanger of Rey handing Luke his blue lightsaber on Ahch-To, the fan base was eager with joy on what direction the story will go with the reveal of Luke Skywalker. Luke holds his original lightsaber and has a look of mixed emotions, then the unexpected happens: Luke throws the lightsaber over his shoulder and storms off. What should have been an epic moment in Star Wars history was turned into a moment for a cheap laugh. I take this scene as a metaphor for The Last Jedi: J.J. Abrams handing over The Force Awakens to Rian Johnson, who proceeds to throw out just about everything established in The Force Awakens for the sake of being \u201cdifferent\u201d just because. Though I praise Mark Hamill\u2019s epic performance as Luke Skywalker and honestly love Luke\u2019s portrayal, the direction they placed for Luke was severely underwhelming. Luke reveals he traveled to Ahch-To for the sole purpose of wanting to die, which goes against what Han said about him seeking out the first Jedi Temple. So what was the point of the map in the previous film if he didn\u2019t want to be found? Then in a flashback, he actually considered killing his own nephew at night by creepily sneaking into his hut and probing his mind, then discovers a lot of darkness and corruption by Snoke. So instead of confronting his nephew during the day, he considers killing him in his sleep? This is the same Luke that sensed the good in his father Darth Vader and personally went on a mission to bring his father back to the Light, of which he ultimately succeeds. Yet, because he probed Ben Solo\u2019s mind and saw darkness, Luke deemed it necessary to just flat-out murder his nephew? This felt extremely out of character for Luke to even consider doing such a thing. This is also the same Luke that went out of his way to save the Rebellion, fought alongside the Rebellion, and played a major role in the Empire\u2019s defeat. Then in this Sequel Trilogy, he gives up and lives in isolation after the massacre of his Jedi Academy, doesn\u2019t seem to care at all about the rising threat of the First Order, and shuts himself off from the Force. Later in the movie, he has a change of heart and appears on Crait, walking directly towards the army of AT-M6s, AT-ATs, and AT-STs. He and Kylo Ren duel, though Luke doesn\u2019t swing his lightsaber once and simply dodges all of Kylo Ren\u2019s hits. Kylo Ren impales and slices Luke, but nothing happens and in a \u201ctwist\u201d, Luke is revealed to be Force projecting himself and did not leave Ahch-To at all. He fades away from the battle, leaving behind a furious Kylo Ren. At the end of the film, Luke stumbles over on the rocks he was sitting on and looks out into the horizon, sees two suns (reminiscent of A New Hope) and dies, becoming one with the Force. Though I praise the idea of using a Force projection, it does a great disservice to Luke Skywalker\u2019s character and undermines his character\u2019s growth from the Original Trilogy. Luke should have physically appeared on Crait and demonstrated his vast strength in the Force by easily destroying the artillery and engaging in a fierce duel with Kylo Ren, but ultimately loses and is struck down by his nephew. That would have given tremendous emotional depth to Luke and be a showcase on how far along Luke has grown with the Force. \r\n\r\nOther Bad Moments In The Last Jedi\r\n\r\nLike all Star Wars films, The Last Jedi features a lot of flaws and some very questionable moments that don\u2019t do this movie any justice:\r\n- Humor has a place in Star Wars, but not to the point of distorting the tone of the film, making it seem like a Marvel film (ex. Poe trolling Hux at the beginning of the film was cringe-worthy and feels out-of-place).\r\n- General Hux was honestly a sinister figure in The Force Awakens. He is turned into a complete incompetent fool in this film and is oblivious to the fact he\u2019s being prank called by Poe. \r\n- Captain Phasma was again underutilized and despite putting up a strong fight against Finn, she is quickly killed off. What was the point of bringing back Phasma?\r\n- Canto Bight killed the pacing of the film and resulted in no beneficial pay-off to the movie\u2019s overall plot. \r\n- Rose preaches about the rich being bad people for selling weapons to the First Order and feels the need to preach about the abuse the race animals face, yet offers no sympathy at all to the slave children.\r\n- The final scene featuring the young slave child using the Force to pull the broom gives the idea that anyone can use the Force with no training whatsoever. \r\n- Luke doesn\u2019t seem to react at all when he learns of Han Solo\u2019s death.\r\n- No Knights of Ren in this film, not even a mention or any clue as to their whereabouts.\r\n\r\nOther Great Moments In The Last Jedi\r\n\r\nDespite the numerous issues that plague this film, The Last Jedi features a lot of great moments that truly shine:\r\n- The opening scene and subsequent assault on the Dreadnought was very action-packed and felt like a true Star Wars film\r\n- The final battle on Crait, though highly reminiscent of the Battle of Hoth, was phenomenal and the idea of using a Death Star-like battering ram was well-executed. \r\n- Snoke\u2019s throne room battle between the Praetorian Guards against Rey and Kylo Ren is honestly one of the greatest battles in all of Star Wars. It was well-choreographed, tense, and demonstrated how powerful a team Rey and Kylo Ren make.\r\n- Finn and Captain Phasma\u2019s battle was spectacular and seeing Phasma deflect a blaster shot with her armor was amazing.\r\n- Rey and Kylo Ren\u2019s Force communication added much needed development to both characters and added a layer of depth to their own motivations.\r\n- Luke\u2019s interactions with Rey were well-done, especially when Rey literally reaches her hand out to the Force, Luke plays along and brushes a leaf against her hand.\r\n- Chewbacca feasting on a Porg and a group of Porgs look at him with fear in their eyes.\r\n- Luke seeing R2-D2 on board the Millennium Falcon and R2-D2 plays the original message by Leia.\r\n- Yoda\u2019s appearance as a Force ghost and knocking some sense into Luke.\r\n- Holdo flying the Resistance cruiser through hyperspace at Snoke\u2019s flagship, resulting in the destruction of numerous First Order ships.\r\n- Luke confronting the First Order on Crait, of which Kylo Ren orders them to fire at Luke with all their artillery. Luke walks out of the smoke undamaged and dusts his shoulder off.\r\n\r\nClosing Comments \r\n\r\nDespite the film having moments of greatness scattered throughout its runtime, The Last Jedi is heavy on flaws that are magnified as the film progresses. The film seems to take the quote \u201cLet the past die, kill it if you have to\u201d to heart and literally kills the history of what\u2019s came before, especially The Force Awakens. Just about everything established in The Force Awakens is simply swept under the rug. The end of the film places the Resistance back to the same state the Rebellion was at in A New Hope. Why is this new trilogy just simply repeating the past? Though Rian Johnson is a fantastic director, he simply does not work for Star Wars and proves with The Last Jedi he has no understanding of how Star Wars works, especially with regards to the Force. The Force is treated more like a superpower that anyone can attain with no training required. The Last Jedi is far from being the worst Star Wars film, but is still far from being the best. J.J. Abrams is slated to return to the franchise to direct Episode IX and will attempt to fix the mess that Rian Johnson left behind with this new trilogy. Help us, J.J. Abrams. You\u2019re our only hope.\r\n\r\nRating: 6\/10","id":"5a9595d30e0a262efb00036b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a9595d30e0a262efb00036b","movie_id":181808}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is a good solid cold war spy story with plenty of action. I have to say that I liked this movie a lot.\r\n\r\nI expected a fairly shallow over the top action flick with a sexy but not very bright kick-ass chick as the main protagonist. To my surprise I got something quite a bit more than that. Sure the movie is quite \u201cHollywoodish\u201d, it is supposed to be a action movie after all, but it is surprisingly well done and Charlize Theron is great as the sexy, not at all stupid and very much kick-ass chick.\r\n\r\nAs a bit of a twist the story is told in the form of a debriefing at the MI6 headquarter. This type of storytelling can be a bit miss or hit since, unless the writer is good at it, it has a tendency to spoil the movie and the events already when the movie starts. I would say that in this one they got it right.\r\n\r\nThe movie is frequently quite dark and gritty which of course is fitting with the former East Germany setting. To my great delight they did not stoop to the usual dark, almost black and white, boring type of footage that you too frequently get. Instead the dark and gritty scenes are filmed in a \u201cdarkish\u201d blue hue and the scenes actually have a lot of color in them.\r\n\r\nThe story is a fairly standard spy-is-given-a-mission-behind-the-wall-and-it-all-goes-to-hell one. As a story goes it is really not much to write home about and it has the usual plot holes and illogical twists. What makes this movie good is how it is implemented.\r\n\r\nAs I have already mentioned Charlize Theron is great in her role. She is sharp tongued, hot and kicks ass. Unlike many protagonists in movies like this one she not only administers pain but she receives it as well. Actually the movie starts with scenes of her showing off bruises all over her body (yes all of it).\r\n\r\nTo fill out the picture we get some brutal, and I mean brutal, KGB agents, the traitorous colleague, the defector and a few other characters. Together they embark on a roller coaster ride of spy work, chases, (brutal) ass kicking etc. All of it very well done as far as I am concerned. It is not the silly fx loaded blow-everything-up kind of action but instead up-personal-beat-them-up action.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I quite liked the end of the movie as well. The twist at the end was maybe not the biggest surprise of the year but I definitely liked it. I really do not like movies that fizzles out with a bunch of loose ends and objectives not achieved. This movie is, to my great enjoyment, not one of those.\r\n\r\nTo me this movie was really good. Certainly better than I expected.","id":"5a703b79925141374500bbab","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a703b79925141374500bbab","movie_id":341013}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"I have seen it said of _Atomic Blonde_ that it is hollow piece wrapped in an attractive shell. I would respond by saying that \"attractive\" hardly does the shell justice, it's absolutely fucking gorgeous. Otherwise though that sounds about right.\r\n\r\nNo, in all seriousness, the plot itself is more than fine. Even the absolute worst aspects from any individual part of _Atomic Blonde_, no matter how much you pick them apart, more than pass the litmus test for minimum acceptable standard. It truly is a case of style over substance, and that is something that I can understand the complaint for. But it's style **over** substance, not style **instead of** substance. At no point did I feel that the story was cobbled together as an excuse to get to the next setpiece. The story was what it was (a pretty genuine throwback to the espionage thrillers of the late and post-Cold War era) and the aesthetic, the music, the design, was simply how that story was chosen to be delivered. And a brilliant choice at that.\r\n\r\nWalking in, I was already certain that I was going to like the film, because even if it was just an extended version of the trailer, then it appealed enough to my personal tastes that I was in for a good time.

{"author":"Dan_Tebasco","content":"Dan_Tebasco\r\n\r\nReview by Dan_Tebasco \u2605\u2605\u2605\r\n\r\nThe third Tupac Assassination film and definitly the best of the bunch, as the previous 2 were sloppily made and rather forgettable. The previous installments was TUPAC ASSASSINATION and TUPAC ASSASSINATION II: THE RECKONING (revised, rereleased and repackaged as TUPAC AFTERMATH).\r\n\r\nNow that said, this is still not a great piece of documentarial work. In fact the editing is still not that good, I do believe that Richard Bond should have left the editing to the proffesionals.\r\n\r\nVery often you are given information in form of written text and audio, and some of these times the information is different from the other so you have to be able to not only read and process what is said in written form while simultaniously processing whatever the person interviewed is saying.\r\n\r\nWhich makes it a bit confusing at times and you kind of have to add 1 and 1 together to get what they are trying to say with the documentary and instead of digging deeper and deeper into some information that seems important they instead just jump to the next thin on their mind.\r\n\r\nAs expected a bunch of the clips in the video are reused footage from the previous Tupac Assassination films and interviews that Jesse Surratt (aka J Mix) made for his youtube-channel which is dedicated to the life of Tupac and people that knew him (who got a producer slot on this film) and from other stuff.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is they add a couple things that are pointless to the subject really, like for instance they talk about there being disputes within Death Row.\r\n\r\nWhich is fine and all but some examples they give are really stupid, like for instance they have an interview with Crooked I talking about how there was a DVD made by the Crips dissing Death Row.\r\n\r\nAnd they make it look like this happened in 1996. First off, DVD's didn't exist in 1996. Secondly the DVD in question is a DVD called THA ROW KILLA which wasn't released until 2003, many many years after both Big and Pac had been dead and is completely irrelevant to anything in the documentary.\r\n\r\nAnd stuff of this nature, not too much of it luckily but some. And often names are spelled wrong and the like. So yeah needless to say it's a bit rough-handled.\r\n\r\nIt also pack in a segment where they discredit the documentary\/book MURDER RAP which came out last year and people then saw as the gospel of how it all went down. But learning my own experience from watching BIGGIE AND TUPAC by Nick Broomfield when it came out and thinking that Suge Knight was the man behind the killing for many years (to later realise that that was pretty dumb) I knew better than to jump to any conclusions that time around. Especially considering the fishy circumstances of the interview of the alleged driver of the shooting (which was really the only 'proof' that documentary offered).\r\n\r\nAnyway just like the documentary I'm straying a bit away from the topic here, but yeah it's a decent watch. But if you don't have any background information on Death Row records, Tupac Shakur etc etc you'll probably not understand half of what is being talked about. And even then it will probably be a bit confusing... That said, the theory given is a pretty interesting one.","id":"598a44b5c3a36874ff01c268","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/598a44b5c3a36874ff01c268","movie_id":448281}

That said, it wasn\u2019t an exact imitation and had enough to distinguish it; the original upped the ante in the slasher genre, which was in its infancy at the time, and obviously influenced movies in the soon-to-come slasher boom of the late 70s-80s.\r\n\r\nThankfully, this version of \u201cDementia 13\u201d is all-around better and in living COLOR. There are enough changes in the plot\/characters to keep things fresh and interesting. It also eliminates confusing elements of the original, like the two bodies of water that weren\u2019t properly delineated. And, although 8 minutes longer, the film\u2019s still streamlined and doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome.\r\n\r\nYet the first half is superior to the second half, which is highlighted by the eerie introduction to the castle-like manor, the establishment of the characters and their story, as well as the stunning Ana Isabelle as Louise. Unfortunately, her part is rather small, but Channing Pickett (Rose) and Marianne Noscheze (Billie) are okay on the female front. Meanwhile Julia Campanelli is effective as the mentally dubious matriarch.\r\n\r\nThe situation speeds-up in the second half and the twists & turns are sometimes awkward, similar to the somewhat contrived & clumsy second half of \u201cPsycho II\u201d (1983).

Watching with my husband and another friend who was a fan of the original anime, we switched it off after 10 minutes soon after Light's girly screaming. I did manage to play the rest on my own while multi-tasking since I felt I owed it that much. The shinigami Ryuk was the one cool thing, even if they changed his amused observer role the acting and effects for him were great. Everything else though? Instead of a top role model perfect student equally liked by fellow students and adults, Light became a whiney emo brat with so many issues. Mia, who filled in for Misa's role, instead of sweet ditzy but still somewhat smart (and definitely loyal to a fault in her love) just became a *itch. Now I always rooted for L, but these two are our protagonists of the story and unlike the original source, I could find nothing likable or admirable about them. The gore-fest was also distracting. Death Note is a very toned down thriller with most deaths happening naturally with heart attacks, implied suicides, hit by a car and so on but expect Final Destination shock-factor and gory deaths in this adaption.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A love story with not a perfect relationship!**\r\n\r\nIt's a Mani Ratnam film. One of the rare filmmakers, whose films does not need to be analysed or enquired to decide to watch, despite whoever the actors are. The best thing from his flicks are the production quality and this film too had an excellent presentation. Always high standards, even for a simple storyline. A perfect line drawn between reality and cinematic. His films are always a family friendly as this one. This is another love story, but with the backdrop of Indian Air Force during the Kargil war. You should not anticipate more actions, because those parts were only part of the story in a small scale. So it is totally a love tale, though not your regular one. That's the highlight.\r\n\r\nLike most of the Ratnam films, this is also a flashback narration. An ace Indian fighter jet pilot, VC, is locked down in a jail after his jet was shot down behind the enemy line. He has to concern for getting out of there alive, instead he begins to recall his romantic life with a doctor named Leela. How they met for the first time and developed their awkward relationship were slowly revealed. The struggle to patch their differences and make it to work. They saw more downs in their relationship than the ups. Now rotting in a prison, VC has to go back to his homeland to locate her and make everything right from where he had left before going to the war.\r\n\r\nJammu and Kashmir, captured, clumsy relationship, does not it remind you something else from the past. Yes, it was like another 'Roja'. Except it was partially inspired by a real event of the 70s. Great direction. The locations were breathtaking. Like never seen before Jammu Kashmir. The performances were not bad at all. Then what's wrong with this flick? It was the screenplay. Not engaging as a theme like this requires. This should have been a 90 minute film. They had dragged it for another 40 minutes, that did not work.\r\n\r\nThe story was not to be blamed. You won't see such concept in Indian cinema. All the big star's films are the same old storyline with a slight change. This was refreshing, but they let it slip away from the opportunity. Particularly Dileep Kumar's music was a let down. There are many promising musicians today, Ratnam should consider to work with them for a change. As usual, the songs were the disadvantage of the film. But it has always been Ratnam's strength in his storytelling. Here it completely failed. Just one time watchable film. I hope he comes back strong with his next project.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"59bd8d6ec3a3681bae016e57","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59bd8d6ec3a3681bae016e57","movie_id":405684}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**He wasn't designed to fit in with the system!**\r\n\r\nThis is one of those films, you won't properly get the notion. Too random, surreal, but at the end somehow all connects. The narration has multiple layers, that's what confusing at the initial stage. Though I liked the character nicknamed, 'the last free man'. If I had watched this film successfully means, that's the main reason. But I felt they have under-used it or missed a great opportunity. Because it was a wonderful film character. Tens of stories can be created using such role. But why did they go for a dry story. In my opinion, it should have been in the line of 'Captain Fantastic'.\r\n\r\nRami was okay. He did justify the role he had played. But not like a performance of the year. I understand why this film was very dark, and partially being a dark comedy. The overall storyline looked good. The man with ambition, and to meet that end, he had dedicated his life. But he did not know what he's becoming. It was like 'Split' meets 'Bad Santa'. From all, the boat scenes were a bit of out of context. Yet it brought distinct perspective to the character who was struggling with reality. A film for a few selected people.

Tara Reid has a small part in the opening act.\r\n\r\n\u201cParty Bus to Hell\u201d (2017) has the same basic plot as the even lower-budget \u201cThe Craving\u201d (2008), but exchanges the deadly creature for the evil cult, not to mention \u201cThe Craving\u201d is serious horror while \u201cParty Bus\u201d is decidedly horror comedy. The desert locations, satanic cultists and goofy-costumes also bring to mind \u201cRace with the Devil\u201d (1975) and \u201cThe Road Warrior\u201d (1981) (\u201cMad Max\u201d is even mentioned in the movie).

So when you have this idea of having the traditional king kong story made into a action movie about monsters in the skulk island, that sounds like a fcking great idea.

What i also really liked was that it was still very human even though its a monster movie. I personally enjoyed it very much like with any other Kong film there is the love angle which is done with brie larson character which i thought was really sweet to put into a movie that concentrates on being a fun movie. And it achieves being a fun movie. I had a lot of fun watching this film. The plot is simple. The vfx is really  done well. The action sequences where good. Is it forgettable? Kinda.

{"author":"in_the_crease","content":"Don't let the title and promotional material fool you: Kong Skull Island is more military commentary and homage to Apocalypse Now than simply _another_ King Kong movie. In that sense it brings something new and fresh to the series, and is also very much a period piece--a period that all too recently seemed to be contemporary history, not the distant and unfamiliar past in which the film takes place.\r\n\r\nAfter a prologue set during WWII, the current setting of the film opens in the waning days of the Vietnam War. While plenty of films have explored the war in Vietnam, Kong eschewed using combat or anti-war demonstrations on the homefront as the focal point. The Draft, flag burnings, use of the term \"Charlie,\" etc are all absent from the film. Instead, it takes the unique perspective of war from an elite group of soldiers contemplating going home--back to \"The World.\" While some characters look forward to reuniting with friends and family, the contempt for the army and the war that is seen in other Vietnam movies is also absent. These guys are soldiers and they are proud of that; it means something. Their commander is portrayed as an old war horse who is contemplating a future with no war to fight. \r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this, two scientists named Bill Randa (John Goodman) and Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins), lobby to have a military escort assist them in exploring an uncharted island. Randa and Brooks assemble their team which consists of tracker James Conrad (Tom Hiddelston) photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) a geologist San (Jin Tian) and a few other scientists not fleshed out enough to even remember. \r\n\r\nThey meet up with Lt. Col. Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) and the the soldiers we met earlier in the film. With all these convenient characters in place, the movie really begins.\r\n\r\nThe film shifts gears from being a period piece that goes out of its way--sometimes with distracting effect--to showcase outdated technology (a scene in which the camera pans to a table of rotary phones and then lingers for a few seconds comes to mind), to a Tarantino-esque homage to Vietnam War movies. The cinematography is excellent. Jordan Vogt-Roberts makes good use of the physical environment (coincidentally, Vietnam) and made me realize just how in need we were of a beautiful Vietnam War movie in the age of 4K and Real 3D. \r\n\r\nComplete with Credence Clearwater Revival and Jefferson Airplane songs, equipment-laden soldiers marching through swamps, dogtags clinking together, their helmets advertising what they decided to scribble on them, the jolly Green Giant presses on through the jungle--the director's love of Vietnam War movie visuals on full display, the movie moves along with great fun.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the titular character first shows up, the action-packed visuals begin to detract very quickly from the mood Jordan Vogt-Roberts established in the first third of the movie. In the excessive age of more is better, the movie stumbles a bit, threatening to collapse under the weight of its title monster. \r\n\r\nThankfully Kong is reigned in and the human characters are able to command some attention. At this point, the camp is divided in two: Military vs. Civilian. While the Army soldiers are on a rescue mission to bring back one of their own, the civilian folks meet up with the island's native population--including a downed WWII pilot (John C. Reilly) who's been on the island for 30 years. Through him we learn that Kong is a protector of the island. That he is, in fact, not the monster at all. \r\n\r\nPackard is not having any of this, of course, because Kong killed some of his men. This is where the movie makes its statement. Kong is the combatant that fights to protect the natives--much the way Packard and his men are portrayed. Packard mentions that soldiers do the dirty work so our friends and family back home don't have to be afraid. In this, Kong and Packard have a kinship--common ground shared by all soldiers: They do the dirty work so you don't have to. Unable or unwilling to see this, Packard decides to wage a personal war against Kong.\r\n\r\nThis is unwise as Kong protects the island from \"Skullcrawlers\"--massive lizard-like creatures who would eat any living thing on the island if not for Kong's presence. \r\n\r\nThe civilians begin to see Kong as not only necessary, but as compassionate and humane. He saves a trapped water buffalo, marvels at the sight of the aurora borealis, and has a brief but tender moment with Conrad and Weaver. He is the soldier whom, during a lull in the battle, is shown as a well-rounded individual, a reminder that being a soldier is something one does; not something one is. This is also true of other soldiers in the film, such as Cole and Mills. Packard, however, has gone off the deep end. A showdown between he and Kong is inevitable, and with Kong out of commission, the Skullcrawlers are able to run amok and create problems for our heroes.\r\n\r\nAt this point Kong is miraculously resurrected to save the day because the scrip said so. And he does. And the film ends on the sappiest, corniest, and most contrived of happy Hollywood endings.\r\n\r\nWhere the film works, it works well. Its commentaries on soldiers and soldiering are interesting without being heavy handed. Despite the Vietnam backdrop, Jordan Vogt-Roberts avoids making a commentary about the Vietnam War specifically, avoiding political controversy in the process. The actors make good use of what material they have to turn in decent performances. In a movie with Brie Larson, Tom Hiddelston and Samuel L. Jackson, it's John C. Reilly, Jason Mitchell and Shea Whigham who steal the show. Also, Kong looked terrific. The CGI work is better than what the Peter Jackson remake gave us--though the Skullcrawlers looked laughably cartoonish.\r\n\r\nBut, the movie has its faults as well. Its parallels to Apocalypse Now can be distracting at times. As is common with ensemble pieces, there are too many characters on the screen for any one of them to get enough screen time to become memorable. Hiddleston in particular had the least material to work with. His character--such as it was--had no depth or personality. He was simply action movie trope. The interactions between Larson and Kong only work because we know that King Kong has always been a Beauty and the Beast tale. It's forced. Giant ape and pretty blonde get along, because it's a Kong movie. For the uninitiated, it could just feel jarring and uneven.  \r\n\r\nAll in all, the film succeeds as a blockbuster to eat popcorn to. Yet it tries, with varying degrees of success, to reach beyond that. While Kong deserves an A for effort, a B- is all it achieves in its execution. Also, the interesting and unique aspect of combining Vietnam War movies with the Kong mythos is highly rewarding for the audience.\r\n\r\nBetter than average, but still far from perfect.","id":"58d96993925141442f028bef","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58d96993925141442f028bef","movie_id":293167}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Yeah. That was an unconventional encounter.\r\n\r\nSo here we have it, part two of the franchise reinvention of the beloved iconic creatures of cinema lore. After the 2014 redux of Godzilla was something of a tonal misstep, it's unsurprising to find this version of the King Kong legacy going all out blockbuster popcorner, and with that it succeeds - kinda.\r\n\r\nPlot is wafer thin, bunch of humans from various professions rock up at the uncharted Skull Island, each with differing levels of interest as to what might be there. Of which they quickly find out is a whole heap of trouble - big trouble!\r\n\r\nIt's clear that the makers, fronted by director Jordan Vogt-Roberts, are trying to blend crowd pleasing mayhem with thoughtful observations of not only the period the pic is set (1973), but also of man's inherent propensity for stupidity. On the surface, the battles and creature feature carnage in general, are wholly entertaining, but it's sometimes just too ridiculous for its own good. Even worse is that it's shallow, with no real substance of note, particularly where the characters are concerned, rendering a very admirable cast as one note players in the monkey maze.\r\n\r\nHowever, irritants aside, the pic is great fun, with enough excitement and quippy dialogue to make the time spent on Skull Island worthwhile. Be it man versus beasties and the alien terrain they traverse, a popcorn muncher it be. There's some sly humour within (Tricky Dicky Nixon going down), and the nods towards Coppola and Cameron et al are pleasing as punch. You may have to lower expectation levels to not let the problems it has drag you down, and for sure it's not hard to understand why a lot of folk hate it, but it's not a disaster, far from it.\r\n\r\nOne does hope, though, that the next instalment in this series goes up another couple of notches, for Kong, Zilla and the other monster gods deserve it. 7\/10","id":"598349469251416acc000006","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/598349469251416acc000006","movie_id":293167}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I really wanted to give this movie a better score but I just could not bring myself to overlook the stupid and crappy story.\r\n\r\nOkay, let\u2019s start with the bad. The movie is about a group of explorers exploring this Skull Island. No surprise there. They are accompanied by a military detachment. Somewhat okay still, there is a half decent explanation for that. One of the main characters in the movie is Lieutenant Colonel Packard. At first, I quite liked him, especially when he told off the journalist informing her that they did not loose the war, it was abandoned by the politicians.\r\n\r\nHowever, from then on it goes really bad. Warning, spoilers ahead!\r\n\r\nOnce on the island Kong is revealed rather quickly. Something that I felt was a bit of a shame. There was no suspense building up for the reveal of the mighty ape. Okay, I could live with that. What I cannot live with is that these total dumb-asses, having discovered a scientific find of unprecedented magnitude, goes straight on to shooting off their guns. What the fuck? Not only that, they just keep shooting and circling around him while he trashes them one by one. That scene, while sporting some impressive action and CGI, was just so fucked up that one wondered if the author deliberately wanted to insult the audience.\r\n\r\nFrom then on I just cringed every time Colonel Packard was in the picture. He was clearly mentally unstable. He doggedly continued to want to kill Kong and used retrieving his men as a poor excuse. This is just the kind of shitty, overused and cliche\u2019d Hollywood script that drives me nuts.\r\n\r\nNow, with that over with, the movie was technically quite good. The actors are doing a decent enough job of their roles. The story, excluding the Vietnam references and general let\u2019s make the military look bad old bullshit, was actually not to bad. It was a different take on the King Kong history for sure.\r\n\r\nThe CGI, the action and the various monsters were very cool. Not surprisingly King Kong was not the only threat on the Island. This time they did not just throw a few dinosaurs in but was rather creative bringing in creatures from all kind of animal (and insect) families as well as some home cooked ones, the skull crawlers.\r\n\r\nThe scenery is also very enjoyable. Apart from my gripes mentioned above I did enjoy a lot of the movie. However, the military clusterfuck that the script writer threw in there severely diminished my enjoyment of the movie and I cannot really bring me to give it more that a 3+ out of 5 score.","id":"596c76f59251416b210013c3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/596c76f59251416b210013c3","movie_id":293167}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A new dawn. The King has arrived.**\r\n\r\nSeems I'm the only one who did not know it was not a sequel to the 2005 film. The Kong was over a 100 feet tall in this, compared to 25 feet from a decade ago. Being a big fan of that film and Peter Jackson, I hated this idea, especially for totally a fresh cast and crew. So I was not expecting it. Only while watching it, I came to know it was a new version. With a new cinematic, a new set of actors, timeline, completely a different kind of tone for a King Kong film that I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nThey wanted it to be a badass action film than a value added storyline. That does not mean I loved it. It was average. I only enjoyed the nice action-adventures. But the visuals were a more commercialised. I even confused whether did I watched a Hollywood film or an Rajamouli film. You know those terrible methods used for stunt sequences.\r\n\r\nThe most boring part of this film was the same old formula, which is a set of people enter in a dangerous enclosure and only a few come back alive. A couple of scientist escorted by a military to a mystery island hidden in the mists of the South Pacific to do some scientific research. Soon they come to realise they are in a dangerous place where giant monsters live. After losing some of the soldiers, now it becomes a survival game. But the general is obsessed with a revenge. How the rest of the story folds were told with a battle of the film.\r\n\r\nBasically, this film was created to merge two franchises, the rebooted 'Godzilla' with this one. The post end-credit scene gave some important hint about the future of the franchise. But I thought it was too similar to the comedy flick, 'Journey 2: The Mysterious Island'. Usually spoof films were made out of greatest hit films. But it looks like here a reverse case. Though all the actors were good. Nice direction, visuals, music, particularly the sound effects. This film is simply enjoyable and forgettable.\r\n\r\nThere are many things I did not like. The Peter Jackson film was so artistic. Every frame was like a classic painting. In this, the Kong standing on his two feet, walking around like a man, totally turned me off. The giant ape did not behave like a real ape. Many sequences were also borrowed from many other films, only replaced with different creatures and recreated with a fresh setting. This is a perfect time pass film to have on a weekend.

{"author":"BadChristian","content":"Everything about Bright is a true achievement in being terrible. For a movie with a very interesting world and a cool premise, Max Landis and David Ayer and the cast managed to create true dog shit. The largest problem lays with Landis's terrible script with some of the worst dialog I have ever heard and Will Smith's acting and (what I can only assume to be) ad-libbing. Every single actor\/actress does a terrible job, but I pin at least half of that on Landis. All of the dialog is so stilited and the general plot is so full of holes, so slow and bogged down with nonsense, and incredibly ham-fisted with it's obtuse social commentary. Will Smith is a real actor who has real acting skills, he has two Emmy nominations and five Golden Globe nominations, and although there are a few bad spots on his IMDB page, he usually does a fine job. His performance in Bright is essentially just Will Smith being Will Smith who exclusively speaks in pop culture references (which raise a few questions about the world of Bright [Shrek exists in a world where humans and orcs have lived together for thousands of years?]) and curse words. I guess no one wanted to make Will Smith mad so they let him make whatever stupid quips he wants, but it becomes clear that no one making this film gives half a fuck. As bad as the script and plot are (which is a true testament to Landis's ability to punish the audience) it's almost possible to overlook how terrible the the CG and fight choreography are. The explosions and blood spray are below Windows Movie Maker quality and big fight pieces make no sense and are incredibly lazy and confusing. This movie is so stupid that it can't even follow its own rules. Suspension of disbelief only works when the movie works within its own world. Every 15 minutes, Bright does something that either makes no sense or defies the rules it created. I won't go into it much of it to not spoil anything, but a big part of the movie is the hunt for and protection of a magic wand. In Bright's world, only a \"bright\" can even hold a magic wand. If any non-bright touches a wand, they instantly explode. There is apparently no way to know if someone is a bright or not is to grab a wand and see if you blow up or not and they make it seem like brights are rare. So, given this, why does everyone seem to think that they are a bright and try and grab the wand? One minor character even manages to and even though they don't become a burst of goo, there is no way it makes sense for them to be a bright. Bright makes no sense and is easily one of the worst movies I have seen. From a technical stand point, the camera work is fine, the sets are fine, the sound equipment works and was mixed properly, but this is only place Bright can get any points. It's stupid. It's stupid, and dumb, and it makes no sense. I usually disagree with the opinion of the media critics 95% of the time, but I have to agree with them here. I like lame Sci-Fi, Action, and Fantasty movies; I legitimately like Suicide Squad (David Ayer and Will Smith's previous collaboration) and I get nothing positive out of Bright. Unless you are looking for a movie to trash with your friends while you are trashed, stay far away from Bright; it is terrible. TERRIBLE.","id":"5bf332860e0a264f6e022bb3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bf332860e0a264f6e022bb3","movie_id":400106}
{"author":"fung0","content":"Almost a great film, but the ending lets it down just a bit.\r\n\r\nThe concept is brilliant: buddy cop + _Lord of the Rings_ sequel. What you'd expect is a somewhat humorous popcorn action flick. Instead, Bright turns out to be quite dark and deep. It's about racial prejudice, for a start. It's about police corruption. It's about hard choices and trusting people you don't like. And, of course, it's about good versus evil.\r\n\r\nThe Orcs are a stand-in for just about any oppressed minority. It's a clever bit of allegory, if a bit obvious. Less obvious is the portrayal of the Elves, who turn out to be the arrogant, uber-entitled 0.1-percenters. If you always thought the elves in LOTR were a bit snooty, you'll love this switcheroo.\r\n\r\nWill Smith is as good as ever, playing an older and more world-weary version of his character from films like _I Robot_. Joel Edgerton is fine as the Orc, and Noomi Rapace seems to have been born to play an evil Elf.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, after a lot of gritty action superbly directed by Ayer, the ending arrives as a bit of an action-movie cliche. There was so much more meat here, in the characters, in the politics, in the weird magical backdrop. I was hoping for a more character-driven ending, instead of the usual mindless brute-force head-bashing (as superbly exemplified by every DC comix movie of recent years).\r\n\r\nNonetheless, Bright is well worth a watch. It fails in some of its higher aspirations, but reverts to being a very entertaining buddy-cop romp. Which isn't so bad.","id":"5a493535c3a36805f600157c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a493535c3a36805f600157c","movie_id":400106}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Not about the plane crash, but the aftermath of the event.**\r\n\r\nThe best part of this film is it was based on the real. This is the story that follows after the event of two planes crashed head to head in the mid air. Focused on Roman, the one who had lost his wife and daughter in the crash and the Jake, an air traffic controller who was on the duty on the day.\r\n\r\nRoman was not happy for how the officials treated him, and the declaration of the result of the event. On the other hand, Jake was mentally disturbed, that's affecting his family. A year later, when everything was coming back to normal with a book on the plane crash is getting released, a twist in tale emerges and fast forwarding to a few years, the story comes to an end.\r\n\r\nThere's no judgement on the crash, that's how the story carefully evolved. Like how it happened and whose fault it was. If you understand the title properly, you won't ask that, because the film is not about that. It was the aftermath of the crash. Like how people related to the event coped with. I think decently written screenplay with good performances.

{"author":"IncendiaryIndie","content":"**Opening Remarks**\r\n\r\nI went out to see this film armed only with the snippets I watched in the form of television commercials and YouTube ads. The film had a very interesting look and  that really caught my attention. I noticed that the film focused primarily on race, which seemed like an interesting concept for a horror\/psychological thriller. I also saw that Jordan Peele (of \"Key and Peele\" fame) was the director of the film and I was thrown completely off about what type of movie I was going to get.\r\n\r\n**First Impressions**\r\n\r\nTo start off, this film is gorgeous and this presents itself fairly early into the film. Gorgeous quality, gorgeous scenery, gorgeous people. Added with the minimal soundtrack, the film seems very open. Many horror movies try to go for a claustrophobic approach, while \"Get Out\" uses its spacious atmosphere to bring out the unnerving fear of the unknown.\r\n\r\n**Going Smoothly**\r\n\r\nOther than a few moments of \"How exactly is this scientifically possible?,\" you do not have to suspend your belief too often throughout the film. \"Get Out\" has an easy to follow, coherent story line that is aided by its pacing. Honestly, this is some of the best pacing have seen a modern horror film in a long time. Every sequence in this film seems to take the same amount of time and keeps the film moving along at a brisk pace. Every scene is refreshing and contains a new bit of information, instead of lingering on unimportant details. Every sequence is shot with purpose.\r\n\r\n**Getting to Know the Cast**\r\n\r\nThe acting in this movie is very well done. The interactions between characters seemed genuine and characters reacted to situations in appropriate manners. This isn't your average horror movie where the characters make stupid decisions to continue the plot; it all seems very organic. The characters act in a manner that you really connect with and do things that you could see yourself doing in these situations.\r\n\r\n**Further Considerations**\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, the film was directed by Jordan Peele, who has almost exclusively worked in comedy. As a fan of \"Key and Peele\" skits and their major film, \"Keanu,\" I thought I had this film figured out before going to see it. With its subject matter about race, I figured this movie would be more of a joke than it was a straight-up horror film. And while the film is a very witty satire on race relations in America and features some very humorous dialogue and situations, the film drives the horrors of racism to the furthest point. The humor stems mostly from the absurdity of the films premise.\r\n\r\n**That Ending**\r\n\r\nI do not have any major complaints about the movie. It didn't drag on, it mimicked reality, and gave me some very uneasy feelings, which is a plus for a horror film. The only problem I have with the film is the ending. It wraps itself up way too quickly and throws everything at you all at once. Luckily, the ending does resolve itself and doesn't leave any glaring loose ends. The film does end a bit too abruptly for my taste and it would have been nice to see what happens afterwards.\r\n\r\n**Closing**\r\n\r\nI would recommend this film to anybody looking for a different horror experience. It is tasteful and tame compared to other films, but it certainly doesn't distract from its purpose.","id":"58bcdfbc925141607304705f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58bcdfbc925141607304705f","movie_id":419430}
{"author":"Gimly","content":"I rarely concern myself with the sexuality of characters in film, I think nine times out of ten a romance hinders more than it helps, but with _Get the Girl_ I'd like to float you the idea of how drastically the script would be changed if the lead was gay.

Obviously, that is not the case, so instead my takeaway from _Get the Girl_ is two simple facts, the first was some new information, and the second was just confirming something I already knew:\r\n\r\n1) There is a person on this Earth by the name of Jerry Purpdrank, and\r\n2) Adi Shankar is a weird fuckin' dude.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._","id":"5981ed8f92514151ae0165e9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5981ed8f92514151ae0165e9","movie_id":433621}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"If you take this movie for what it is, an action \/ science fiction movie with emphasis on fiction, then it is, in my opinion, actually not too bad.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of with the usual suspects, a bunch of political asswipes setting off to create their, equally usual, clusterfuck firing the one competent person they actually needed to run the climate control project successfully. To make matters worse the entire project are about to be turned over to \u201cthe international community\u201d which of course is a well known recipe for disaster.\r\n\r\nHollywood lives in their usual dream world of course so they throw in suitable, old-fashioned, bad guy with the \u201ccorrect\u201d political views for a bad guy and with an outrageous and apocalyptic plan and we are all set.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s ignore all that crap and focus on the movie. Once that nonsense is out of the way what is left is a fairly entertaining science fiction disaster thriller movie. The special effects are not bad and the movie moves along at a decent pace. The \u201craison de etre\u201d for this movie is the action and the special effects so the story and the acting is adequate and nothing more.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as is all too often the case, the story writer is a bit of a low watt bulb. This satellite network that is the foundation of the movie is fairly unrealistic even for a science fiction movie. Let\u2019s forget about the total insanity in even trying to cover the planet in a network of satellites that are actually physically connected, the feats that these satellites achieve is just so far off the realism scale that is is annoying. What the heck are powering them? Anti-matter, black holes? This could have been done much better.\r\n\r\nThen we have the self destruct sequence that is playing a large part towards the end of the movie. What kind of fucking self destruct blows up a few bits and pieces for show and then pauses so the characters can run around for half an hour or so? Either the story writer is dumb as a door nail or he thinks the audience is that dumb.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the annoying parts aside, as a science fiction and fantasy geek this was a fairly entertaining movie for me.","id":"5ae58ae40e0a26024900267b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ae58ae40e0a26024900267b","movie_id":274855}
{"author":"cevangelista413","content":"Horror and comedy have blended well since around the beginning of film for one key reason: the release that both allow from the audience. The building set-up is not unlike the quiet before the jump scare. Both utilize equations of timing to provoke an unconscious reaction. Because of these similarities, the horror-comedy is a well-tapped genre, especially in the last couple decades of works aiming their trajectory at the cult DVD bin. So it takes a particular level of skill to mine new ground in the territory, particularly from a first time director. What makes Jordan Peele\u2019s Get Out so engaging, frightening and hysterical is that he knows exactly when to play the material straight; which it turns out is most of the time. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cutprintfilm.com\/reviews\/get-out\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Full review <\/a>","id":"58ad891ac3a3682fa000584a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ad891ac3a3682fa000584a","movie_id":419430}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Now you're in the sunken place!**\r\n\r\nNot all the directional debut sees this kind of welcome from the audience. Yeah, Jordan Peele had written and directed it. It is similar to the 90s style mystery-thrillers. Definitely must see for the 90s, 80s guys. It kind of looked like a black comedy, but I guess that's not they had preferred. Especially that teacup scenes and some of the close up shots, that freaks, yet very funny.\r\n\r\nWell, this is the story of an interracial romance. When Chris decides to meet his girlfriend's white family, living outskirt of her hometown, all goes as planned. But he was not sure how her parents take it, that he's a black. Now everything has settled, but his visit started to take a strange turn after a series of weird events. What it is and how he overcomes it is the remaining tale.\r\n\r\nThe casting was amazing. The story was suspenseful. You would feel you can predict the scenes, but not that easy and when twist happens, you will realise it was simple as that. This is a hit film now, but if it was 20 years ago, surely would have gotten a cult classic status. And yes it is, thinking the future.\r\n\r\nWhen this got out and its pre release, I thought it would disappear without any trace. It is rare a recognition a film like this to get to having a second string cast, debutante director and being a low cost film. I got entertained thoroughly as it delivered as promised. But I think some people are overjoyed and praising it like crazy. That's true if you are not a film fanatic, otherwise it is one of those decent films. Surely not to be missed.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"These days have been a bit of a movie marathon with the kids being here since the 24th so we have made quite a dent in the to-watch shelf of my movie collection.\n\nYesterday it was time for some rehashing of the Pendragonian legends in the form of King Arthur: The Legend of the Sword. Usually I find it dangerous business to mess with classical and well proven stories. Do not fix what is not broken and all that. I did, however, find this rehash quite entertaining.\n\nThe base of the story is of course, and thankfully, the same: Uther is killed, Excalibur ends up in a stone, Arthur pulls Excalibur out of the stone, lots of swordfights, Arthur becomes king. The details of that story is rehashed quite a lot though.\n\nThe movie opens up with some fairly cool action where Uther combats Mordred (yes Mordred already in the opening scenes, as I said, rehash\u2026) who attacks Camelot with black magic and king-sized (pun intended) combat elephants. I cannot say too much about what happens without spoiling a lot but the sword ends up in the stone and Arthur ends up\u2026somewhere else.\n\nSo already from the start the movie asserted two things, that it is a different take on the Pendragon saga and that it is fairly heavy on action, black magic and special effects. I was a bit worried about the rehashing of the saga bit at this point but, as you have already deduced from the above, overall I quite enjoyed the movie.\n\nThe movie proceeds by showing us Arthur growing up in a bit more misery than the traditional stories do but it does so in more or less fast forward mode and we arrive rather quickly to the point were Arthur pulls out the sword from the stone.\n\nThis is were I have a bit of a gripe with the movie. This moment felt a bit anticlimactic and even disappointing. There was not big moment of awe just confusion. As the movie blurb hints at, Arthur is neither ready nor willing to become a king. So at this point everyone has to go through the hassle of convincing him. I rarely like this reluctant hero concept. Boring!\n\nLuckily Arthur has a merry band of friends to help him chose the right path and this is were the movie spends quite a bit of time. With Arthur as a bit of a Robin Hood in the woods and him and his compadres nibbling at Vortigern\u2019s heels. Of course every so often Arthur is nudged towards his destiny and the action when he decides, well is forced is perhaps more correct, to pick up Excalibur it becomes a bit of an FX feast.\n\nIn terms of acting and characters I would say that they all made a fairly good job of it. Arthur himself is stuck with the reluctant hero role, which I am not too found of as I wrote before, but he is doing a decent enough job of it. Vortigern is not bad as the chief bad guy. I did like the mage although most of the time she was looking into the distance and flapping her eyelids. That is when things were happening though. You do NOT want this gal to flip her eyelids at you!\n\nNaturally everything was slowly building up towards the big bada boum between Arthur and Vortigern and, again, I think this was fairly well done. Lots of action, lots of magic and lots of FX. I really enjoyed how things played out at the end and all the visuals. One thing that I did like more with this version of the story, okay bit of a spoiler ahead, is that it did not end as tragically as the usual King Arthur story.\n\nBottom line, if you are set in stone as to what the Pendragon saga should be then watch another movie. If not and you\u2019re up for some nice fantasy action adventure in the Pendragon universe you might like this movie. I did!","id":"5a477001925141579d009766","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a477001925141579d009766","movie_id":274857}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**It's now or never! A mother's fight back!**\r\n\r\nTruly shocking for people blindly following the words of critics. This is really a good film. I totally enjoyed it. Well, it was not like I never saw such film. In a century of motion picture history, hundreds of similar films were made. This is just another one, but there's nothing wrong with it. People wrongly judged it. The pace of the film was rocket speed. So basically, there's no time for one to keep looking for flaws. If they do, then they're not enjoying the show. They missed out everything, hence end up bashing it. Just like the clowns, aka film critics.\r\n\r\nIt was another kidnap film that Halle Barry in it, that's similar to her previous film 'The Call'. It did not take long to get into the action. A hardworking mother, going through divorce, fighting for her son's custody. While engaging in a phone call, she loses her son in an amusement park. The alert mother quickly jumps into pursuing when he was seen forcefully taken in a stranger's car. The remaining events take place on the road, with car chases, with a twist before the conclusion.\r\n\r\nNicely written screenplay and well performed actors, particularly Halle Berry. I have never seen she had played such an energetic role in the recent time. Whatever the storyline is, it's kind of an inspiring film. How a mother fought for her son. Totally a mother instinct. You can't simply expect like the film 'Taken'. It might not be realistic, but cinematically honest. The same thing happens in the animal world too. Sad that the film released after so many delays. Moreover, how people responded to it. Believe me, it is a nice film and I definitely suggest it to all.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"59fe21e1c3a36868930264ea","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59fe21e1c3a36868930264ea","movie_id":293768}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is indeed a silly, even childish at time, movie but to me it was also a really really fun movie to watch.\n\nThe movie starts by the Kingsman organisation getting screwed over royally by the psychopathic Poppy Adams which forces what remains of the organisation, all two people, to work with their counterpart in the United States. Just as the Kingsmen are parodies on the stiff upper lip British gentleman the Statesmen are parodies of the southern US gentleman (if you can actually call them that) only even more so. Maybe it is my European heritage but I personally feel the Kingsmen are fairly cool where the drawling Statesmen are more on the silly side.\n\nOnce again Eggsy is the main character although I have to say that I personally like Harry, the original Galahad, much more. He has much more charisma, elegans and smarts. Since he is portrayed on the movie posters I guess it is not much of a spoiler when I say that, to my delight, the rumors of his death were greatly exaggerated. Unfortunately Eggsy is sometimes quite cool and plays his British gentleman role quite well and sometimes he is just dumb as a doornail.\n\nPoppy Adams is okay but she is bordering on the ludicrous too much for my taste. The we have a certain English artist, a Sir no less. I do not know how much they had to pay to get him to take part in this movie but I am fairly sure I would consider it too much. He was just silly as far as I am concerned.\n\nThe movie is of course loaded with gadgets, most of them of the variety that makes noises of varying levels of loudness usually resulting in one or more bad guys biting the dust. It is almost gadget overload but I really liked. Sometimes this amount of totally unbelievable gadgets is dragging down the movie more than anything but in this one it was mostly a success. To me Harry and the gadgetry is what makes this movie.\n\nGiven that I am originally from Sweden I have mixed feelings about Eggsy\u2019s girlfriend and the Swedish royalties. I guess those parts were okay but I could have been without them as well. At least I feel that however wrote the scene with the \u201croyal\u201d dinner could have read up on Swedish etiquette. Knocking on a glass with your spoon, knife or fork means you are about to give a speech, NOT that you want the plates to be changed. A professional servant, and the Swedish royalty DO have professional servants, do not need to be told when to change plates.\n\nThe actual story is, well it is original at least but I would not rate it any higher than okay. It served as a vehicle for stringing together all the stunts and jokes so it served its purpose. The worst part of the story was that I was actually finding myself agreeing with the president. This might perhaps shock some people but I am sorry, if you are dumb enough to ingest that crap, which is also highly illegal, then I have no sympathy for you.\n\nIf you get upset about stupid plot details and plot holes then be prepared to be upset. There are plenty of them in this movie. To me it did not matter too much since this is not really a thriller or drama. It is a spy parody \/ comedy. Having said that it did piss me off a bit that this advanced organisation did not have brains enough to deal with the piece of equipment left in the London cab at the beginning of the movie. I mean, it was just soo obvious what would happen.\n\nAnyway, on the whole this movie was great fun to watch. I hope we get another sequel. Perhaps one with a Japanese version of the Kingsmen? There ought to be plenty of cultural stereotypes to play on there.","id":"5a8c61b79251410ac408fac7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a8c61b79251410ac408fac7","movie_id":343668}

It's something you always get to see, where the man is the instigator of all the sexual relationships and romances. And I wanted the female in this to be who's going after what she wanted and was being very direct and proactive about that. To me, that's what I have seen in many young women, they are very strong-willed and they have their own wants and I thought that would be an interesting angle for it; that we haven't seen_ _much of it._\r\n\r\n- Aoife McArdle; \"'I wanted to make a film that was visceral and dangerous and had a woman at the centre'\" (Aoife Barry); _TheJournal.ie_ (June 24, 2018)\r\n\r\n_Kissing Candice_ is the debut feature from Northern Irish writer\/director Aoife McArdle, whose career thus far has been primarily in music videos and commercials (she's probably best known for the controversial _American Psycho_-inspired video for Bryan Ferry's 2014 song, \"Loop De Li\", and the truncated short film for U2's 2015 song, \"Every Breaking Wave\"). When a music video director moves onto features, problems can arise, and _Kissing Candice_ features many of them; the whole thing plays like a two-hour Lorde video, all deep primary colours (especially red) with no discernible diegetic source; self-congratulatory and often belaboured visual symbolism; oblique narrative justification for many of the scenes; an achronological structure with unannounced flashbacks (think Joseph Conrad's _The Secret Agent_ (1907), except not nearly as well handled), and portentous staring into the middle-distance as the actors emote at one another instead of talking. The film is especially weak in terms of narrative - the entire plot takes up no more than a half hour at most, with the rest all mood and tone.\r\n\r\nHowever, for all that, I rather liked it. The plot, such as it is, is actually built on an interesting enough hook. Set on an unnamed council estate in Dundalk some time after the cessation of the Troubles, Candice (Ann Skelly) is a contemplative, but rebellious youngster (the love child of Terrence Malick and Larry Clark, if you will). As the film begins, she is in the midst of an intense dream involving a young man she doesn't recognise. Several days later, she is stunned when she meets kind-hearted local gang member Jacob (Ryan Lincoln), who looks exactly like the man in her dreams. Jacob has been butting heads with increasing frequency with the gang's leader, Dermot (an excellent Conall Keating), who may or may not have been involved with the disappearance of a young boy from the estate, Caleb (Jason Cullen), who has also been featuring in Candice's recent dreams.\r\n\r\nAnyone familiar with McArdle's work will instantly see the thematic uniformity - like many of her music videos, _Kissing Candice_ depicts troubled youth, cut free from adult supervision and influence, going to extremes. And whilst McArdle proves fairly inept at handling the narrative, the film is aesthetically very well mounted, as we're literally placed within Candice's not-entirely-stable psyche from the off (the hallucinatory opening sequence is especially good in this respect). As the plot outline may suggest, there's a definite vibe of Ryan Gosling's critically reviled (but actually rather good) directorial debut _Lost River_ (2014), and McArdle is obviously influenced by Nicholas Winding Refn and, to a lesser extent, David Lynch.\r\n\r\nMcArdle is clearly talented. However, it might help her career if she directs someone else's script next time, as her writing is what really lets her down here. Nevertheless, it's well acted, looks amazing, and, as debuts go, is not too bad at all.","id":"5cc1726e92514151cafe669d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cc1726e92514151cafe669d","movie_id":473015}

But for some reasons, I felt I'm not that interested in this. Even trailer looked okayish. Watching the film now I realised that I've totally misjudged it. Still not a masterpiece, but a much better entertainer. The graphics were awesome. The settings were totally encouraging to glue to it. The story, stunts, with some of the slow- motions, very detailed and muscularly enchanting.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows the basic storyline of King Arthur. In this, it opened with two brothers feud and following a young man grew up in a brothel. When the city slowly gripped with the myth that the legendary prince would return to the crown, now the king, Vortigern vows to find him first and end the threat. But what comes after him was beyond his expectation. He has to finish it off what he had failed years ago. On the other hand Arthur has all the support, particularly the legendary sword passed on to him by his father.\r\n\r\nI had liked the Disney animated film back when I was a kid.

It's not very good, but it comes across as the sort of movie that might be a really cool time to see on the big screen. Unfortunately, by now it's finished its theatrical run, and because its not very good, I can't imagine it will ever get another one. So the one way I would like to see it, is a way it can no longer be seen. Because it's not very good.\r\n\r\nIt's Camelot by way of Middle Earth, and though I do enjoy these smarmy fast talkin' Brits a good deal in my films, the Guy Ritchie formula just doesn't lend itself to these sort of properties. The experiment just barely worked out in the first _Sherlock Holmes_ movie, and he's been getting further and further away from the mark ever since. Now he's lined up to hit _Aladdin_ next? I just don't see the connection. It's a shame to say it, but I really do want Guy Ritchie to get back to his wheelhouse.

Only on the characters, but the story was pretty much the same like about jealousness. The story of a middle aged woman and to begin the life again. Alice a daughter of a famous filmmaker, is not all happy in her life after the marriage is at in the risk of collapse. Then suddenly all changes when three youngsters she meets at the club.

So basically this film is for her to watch. But the three young actors too was not bad. The story was better, especially how it all ended. This is for the gown ups, above 25-30 years old people. Because of how everything revolved, only they can understand it better. And also for the open minded people, because it's about the modern moral thing like traditional sentiments in a relationship were removed to narrate this tale.

{"author":"furious_iz","content":"A strangely compelling yet uneven film telling two stories, one about a stranded and wounded women who tries to survive the night in a post-apocalyptic world, the other about a man and a woman meet and fall in love.  \r\n\r\nThe post-apocalyptic story would've worked best on it's own, and the love story is kind of a distraction if you are looking for a post-apocalypse film.  The love story works well within the frame work of the post-apocalypse drama, but it's not often that people who like genre films will enjoy a straight romantic drama added into the mix.  I personally thought the two stories worked well together, but the film had several faults.\r\n\r\nFirst off some of the acting was a bit dodgy, mainly in the love story.  I didn't always completely believe the love between the two leads, especially from Gr\u00e9gory Fitoussi.  Brittany Ashworth who plays Juliette was much better, especially in the post-apoc story.\r\n\r\nOne of the other big problems was trying to understand what connected the two stories.  I spent most of the film guessing grand twists, and was disappointed when the twist was actually really small and a bit silly. The classic problem with films that straddle the before and after of an extinction level event is you have to give enough time for the story to naturally play out.  Instead in the film it seems like society completely collapses into a desert waste land in about 18 months.  \r\n\r\nIt's like films that are set 15 years in the future.  Your audience will watch the film now and in 15 years point out all the things that haven't come to pass, let's call it the Back to the Future effect.  And this is one of the flaws of this film, Juliette doesn't look significantly aged enough for this future to be as bad as it is.  Not enough time can possibly pass for the world to completely fall apart.  Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but it took me out of the film a lot.\r\n\r\nAll in all, there are worse ways to spend 90 minutes.  \r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"5af79be29251412c78003248","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5af79be29251412c78003248","movie_id":461992}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"I've killed everything that's walked or crawled. If you do it enough, you get used to it.\r\n\r\nHostiles is directed by Scott Cooper and Cooper adapts the screenplay from the story written by Donald E. Stewart. It stars Christian Bale, Rosamund Pike, Wes Studi, Rory Cochrane, John Benjamin Hickey, Jeremiah Wilks and Jesse Plemons. Music is by Max Richter and cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi.\r\n\r\nIn 1892, legendary Capt. Joseph J. Blocker (Bale) reluctantly has to escort his old Cheyenne adversary Chief Yellow Hawk (Studi) and his family through dangerous territories. The aim is to get them to the Cheyenne tribal homelands of Montana so Yellow Hawk can get his wish to die in peace. \r\n\r\nWhere we at these days with the grand old bastion of American cinema, the Western? The only real constant is that thankfully for lovers of the form there are new directors willing to tackle the genre and bring something to the newer generations. Here we have Scott Cooper, who right from the off hasn\u2019t hid the fact that Hostiles is his rallying call for a better world, or at least a better understanding of different cultures. What better way to cry out than to do it in a Western, using the Indian Wars as the backdrop. Perfect really.\r\n\r\nHostiles jumps right out of the blocks to grab you by the throat with soul shattering violence, with Cooper and his team initially facing charges of old by fronting up a one sided argument \u2013 but there is more. Quickly a switch ensures that both sides of this particular bloody coin have been tossed, scene set for what will follow. A meeting back at Fort Berringer where Captain Blocker receives the orders he simply doesn\u2019t want to obey is in hushed tones, yet the words being spoken are brutally loud and to the point. And on to the journey, damaged souls unbound who not only have to fear hostiles from outside their group, but the hostiles within it and within themselves.\r\n\r\nAs the story moves through the journey undertaken by our protagonists, the makers have not cut corners with the characterisations, the emotional development of the principals is one of the film\u2019s strengths (cast are superb, there\u2019s a real authenticity to their respective performances). Also worthy is the pacing, it is deliberately unhurried and allows the characters to breathe, it also gives the jolts of action more potency, whilst simultaneously we can absorb the stunning landscapes (New Mexico\/Arizona) and rejoice at the pleasures of an outdoor Western.  While how nice it is to have a musical score that doesn\u2019t blunderbuss the important sequences, rounding out what is a top technical production.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s some irritants here, though, so it\u2019s not perfect, and this is before it is marked poorly by those not in sync with the messages of the piece. Ben Foster turns up as Philip Wills, a most edgy character that makes one wish there was far more of him in the pic, for as it is it ends up feeling a bit pointless since he only emphasises what we have learned about Blocker at the start. Then there\u2019s a key turn of events for the story\u2019s  coup de gr\u00e2ce that leaves a frustrating taste in the mouth, not as a film killer or even close in fact, but it should have gone another way one feels. Especially given the two sides of the argument stance Cooper and co had began with.\r\n\r\nYet this is for Western fans a real treat, following in the footsteps of new era classics like Dances With Wolves and Unforgiven, Hostiles may have a new age sensibility in its narrative thrust, but traditionally old age adultness propels it forward. 9\/10","id":"5cb39e520e0a2626cec938b1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cb39e520e0a2626cec938b1","movie_id":384680}

I thought it was deliberately bashed, but after watching it, I realised it's not any good and deserved those remarks. With such production, they should have come up with a nice storyline. Visually, it was okay-okay kind, but the story, the filmmakers are lucky that no one sued them for copying it from other flicks.\r\n\r\nKids with bikes, a science experiment gone wrong, annoying brother and mom's new boyfriend, A new girl in the town, it was everything you have already seen.

The film is tonally brilliant, coming across like _The Breakfast Club_ (1985) directed by David Fincher, perfectly capturing 80s tackiness. Narratively, however, it's extremely plodding, and could easily have been trimmed by 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nIt's also difficult to see what Meyers was trying to achieve; other than a couple of brief moments, we're never given any real access to Dahmer's interiority, so he remains an enigma, always at arm's length (which could have been the point). But is Meyers asking us to feel sympathy for Dahmer because he had a difficult adolescence, came from a broken home, couldn't make friends in school; to quote that great line from Michael Mann's _Manhunter_ (1986),\r\n\r\n> _my heart bleeds for him, as a child. Someone took a kid and manufactured a monster. At the same time, as an adult, he's irredeemable. He butchers whole families to pursue trivial fantasies. As an adult, someone should blow the sick fuck out of his socks._\r\n\r\nOr is this simply a character study (if we didn't know it was about Dahmer, it could be any number of examinations of high school awkwardness)?\r\n\r\nThe lack of clarity regarding the film's theme is compounded by the scenes where it looks as if Dahmer is about to murder someone, only to stop at the last second. This is an especially strange way to generate tension, insofar as we already know his first murder was Hicks. Also, if the film is actually trying to say something of societal worth regarding serial killers, directionless youth, nature vs. nurture etc, trying to draw an audience into the narrative with the prospect of murder probably isn't the way to go about it. The film also fails to really get into the issues of Dahmer's sexuality, and his confusion and frustration about being gay.

{"author":"BadChristian","content":"Against the Night is the so bad it's good horror movie I have been looking for. All of the actors are pretty bad and every character is a total moron. I watched part of it a second time with the commentary because I had to hear from the mad man that made this and he says he casted the actors via Skype, so that explains some of it. It looks like all of the electronics from Best Buy, both the ghost hunting \"tools\" the characters use and the ones he used to film the movie (he does mention buying one of the cameras there). Most of the movie looks like it was shot on an IPhone and doesn't quite look like a movie, but I think it looks pretty good, except for the multiple times where the camera wasn't sure what to focus on and we get blurry shots. They also didn't put much effort into the camera shots. Aside from the what we get from the cameras that the characters are holding, almost all of the other shots are also very shaky. I don't mean shaky like in the shaky-cam style but like every camera is handheld and the cameraman has shaky hands and moves to much. In all of the haunted location horror movies, the most important character is the location and while they did pick a sufficiently \"haunted looking\" location in Holmesburg Prison, it has some big drawbacks. The bulk of Holmesburg is abandoned, but not all of it; there is an active office building and a gymnasium that is sometimes used for prisoner overflow. This means that the totally abandoned prison of the movie, which is some made up place has florescent lights that you can see shining under doors and through doorways and through windows when they are outside. They spend most of the time in the legitimately abandoned part, so it's fine then, but the establishing shots paint a significantly different picture, although I guess active prison bureaucracy is scary too. The second issue is more of a story issue and this movie is littered with story issues. The prison is quickly established as spoke shaped, a center core with ten cell block \"spokes\" emanating. The spokes are not connected to each other and only connect to the core in the one place. One character shown a blueprint of the prison and asked what it looks like. Does she say spokes or a wheel? Nope! She fucking says \"A crop circle!\" The fuck it does! Has she seen a crop circle? We have established that cell blocks don't connect, so when the characters separate (not really a spoiler, because of course they do, it's a horror movie) and groups get locked in different cell blocks, a few go missing. The group in one cell block A (I'll just say Cell Block A because I don't think the actually name them in the movie) has already walked the length of their block and upon returning to the now locked gate that separate them from the core and hearing that some of their friends from a different cell block are missing, turn around and look for them in cell block A. Firstly, you've already walked it and they weren't there. Secondly, how could they be? They have to reason to have gone outside and the blocks do not connect! Well, eventually that second point creates a big problem because later, multiple groups find themselves in the same cell block even though one was locked in cell block A, one in B, and one in C. The only way they could have done that was to go outside and no one has gone through the outer doors. Again, they've shown us an overhead aerial shot that shows the cell blocks do not connect and the only door to the core is locked, so did they teleport, walk through a locked gate, or did someone forget that we know what the prison schematics look like? There are other glaring plot holes, but they fall into spoiler territory later in the movie. In a horror movie, they usually fall into the trope of characters making stupid, illogical and irrational decisions, but these characters push it. Again, many happen later in the movie and I'm not going to spoil anything, but they either have selective short term amnesia or are just the dumbest people alive. The story is dumb, illogical, and just confusing in summary. Another thing that sticks out is the unnecessary and illogical (there's that word again) sexual scenes. The opening has a sex scene where we can see the male character's underwear is still on (and not in a through the hole kind of way) and later the characters have to go the end of their respective cell block and place a steady cam. Everyone knows that there is a guy watching all the cameras on his laptop. One group is a couple and the start to give Mr laptop a private sex show where we see both take their tops off. Another is two girls and they make out with each other for the camera. The director says in his commentary \"I wrote a lot of this movie for 13 year old boys and this is some stuff that thirteen year old boys would like.\" This combined with an overtly sexually aggressive character make quite a few uncomfortable scenes. There are so many problems with this movie and for most of them, the blame is purely on a lack of attention to detail and just not caring about the little things. The gore works all wrong with blood spatter being wildly overdone (the directions don't match up and the amount of blood is inconsistent with the actual slashes) and we never see the actual wounds, just copious amount of blood. There is a time where we can see the gate at the end of the cell block hallway and we see that it is shut. The we hear a slamming sound (clearly added in post) and the characters run to the gate and yell that it's closed. It was already closed before the slamming sound. For some people it may be annoying for characters to not be able to recognize a gas mask and all the other things I've mentioned and they will surely hate this movie. For me, every one of these things was hilarious. The terrible dialog (which the director says is often improvised), obvious inconsistencies and errors, and pure nonsense that this movie just oozes out make this a great \"so bad it's good\" movie. Don't get me wrong, clearly this is an absolutely terrible movie. Everything is just wrong and pure crap. However, I was constantly laughing and thoroughly entertained. Against the Night is a great film for a movie night with friends and I assume it's even more enjoyable after a couple 6-packs or a few bottles of wine. It won't be your favorite movie or even your favorite horror movie, but it just may be the one you enjoy watching the most. They've managed to unintentionally create one of the best comedies of 2017. As a real film, I can only give it 1.5 out of 5, but as an experience, it's a 10 out of 10. I loved it.","id":"5bdaac1c9251415402008b68","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bdaac1c9251415402008b68","movie_id":512926}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**When two different ancient arts meet.**\r\n\r\nThis is not some film. The project was decided when two leaders of the respective nation met a couple of years ago. More like it is China's move to mend the relationship with India. So except Indian cast participation and a few Indian locations, this is completely 'made in China' and for the Chinese market. Like always any Chinese product, this is not a quality product. Just an another 'The Myth' from the same director.\r\n\r\nTeam up between India and China is a rare thing in filmdom, so I was curious about that. It should have been a star studded cast, but from the Chinese side, it does, not on the Indian side. The worst screenplay award goes for Mr. Tong. Literally, it is a retelling story of those great treasure hunt adventure films we had seen so far in our life. Even Jackie Chan could not save it. His presence failed to do the usual magic. Like his signature, action-comedy, nothing new to appreciate either his part or the film.\r\n\r\nThe story follows the famous Chinese archaeologist Jack, who teams up with his Indian counterpart for a new quest. Equipped with the modern technological tools, the crew heads for a frozen lake in the Himalayas. It's the first and an important clue for the rest of the treasure hunt. But it was interrupted by a group of armed men and soon the tale flies to Dubai, followed by Western India, where it comes to end with lots of action and adventures.\r\n\r\n> \u275d'Vastu Shastra', the oldest book ever written about architectural design.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe opening scene sets in some thousand years ago. The graphics were very poor in that part. Even computer games have much better CGI work. So I lost the interest in the film within the first sixty seconds. The stunt choreography was unbelievably terrible. I mean too much unrealistic, I felt it like I was watching some kind of commercial Tollywood\/Rajamouli film. Surely this film was not made under the art and the film-making value. It seems nobody was interested to participate or make a quality film. They made it to just to keep the promise made by the politicians, so it was wrapped up awfully.\r\n\r\nI thought it was a bad combination of words for a title. Kung fu and Yoga. Like the polar opposite, two different philosophies. One is violence and the other one is peace and healthy. Though not bad how those two were utilised to tell the tale. This is a watchable film, but no good at all. Might be the worst Jackie Chan film I've ever seen. Promoting the unrealistic road projects in the film was a bad idea, and enough reason to flop in India.\r\n\r\nThere are many good actresses in India, but they have picked Disha Patani. She's a real beauty, but the performance was worse than the film's graphics. I could not stand for her dialogue deliverance. She just read them rather than expressing naturally as any actors do in the world. The end was really disappointing. An easy compromise. It's good for the real life, but not good for an entertainment film. Those who are seeking treasure hunt film, just stay away from it. Because it looks more like a parody than a distinct one. Overall the film was overwhelmed by lots bad parts. So easily a skippable film of the year, which has a big name in it.\r\n\r\n_02\/10_","id":"5935cd68925141052d002fcd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5935cd68925141052d002fcd","movie_id":383785}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Solving a series of death\/murder mysteries!**\r\n\r\nThe last film I saw from this director was 'Eeram' which was one of the best horror films Kollywood had ever produced and was a trend setter in the modern days of filmmaking in the Tamil language. Now that genre is well explored that you can find every year films like that making its way out. Coming back to this one, I think it is a decently made film. Based on the book of the same name, the screenplay was given preference to the commercial elements like big stars' films. Otherwise, it would have been a better work from the director, as well as for the actor.\r\n\r\nLike todays trend in Kollywood's B movies to make a parallel cinema to the international standards, this one missed that opportunity. After successfully playing a negative role in 'Yennai Arindhaal', this is his comeback film as a solo for Arun Vijay. He had worked very hard for where he's standing today and for the role in this film. I hope he makes good films in the future as well.\r\n\r\nThis is a police story. A murder, a missing person and followed by another attempt of murder, a young cop comes to rescue a young woman, but soon they fall in love with each other. On the other side, the story takes twists and turns while solving the crime. Finding out who and why, the narration enters the final segment and brings an end to everything.\r\n\r\nMuch better film than list-A films and like I said it had the opportunity to be an even better film. One of the best police stories with good casting. The length of the film was a bit concern, though manageable because of engaging plot. The songs should have been trimmed off. If you are a native audience, it does not matter, but for the international viewers, it is definitely offbeat for such intensified crime-thriller. I'm not in favour of recommending it, but surely worth a watch.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5935d07cc3a3685bf90036a5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5935d07cc3a3685bf90036a5","movie_id":402780}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"You can't be serious!\r\n\r\nBorg vs McEnroe is directed by Janus Metz and written by Ronnie Sandahl. It stars Sverrir Gudnason, Shia LaBeouf, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Tuva Novotny. \r\n\r\nThe Swedish Bj\u00f6rn Borg (Gudnason) and the American John McEnroe (LaBeouf), the best tennis players in the world, maintain a legendary duel during the 1980 Wimbledon tournament.\r\n\r\nCut to the chase, this is one for tennis fans to gorge upon, but even then it's a bit too lop sided to fully delight. Being a Swedish production it's heavily loaded towards the personal worries that were plaguing Borg in the very early 1980s. Sadly this renders McEnroe - one of the games greatest and most colourful characters - as being a support player in what set out to be a biographical pic about sports rivalry. \r\n\r\nHowever, what does come across is that both men were driven and actually both were tits for varying reasons. There's unsurprisingly some parental pressures, while Borg feels the strain of breaking records (as his wife chain smokes) and McEnroe strives to get on the ladder to greatness. Sure the tennis sequences don't hold up to scrutiny but both Gudnason and LaBeouf (excellent and excellently cast) come out of the physicalities very well.\r\n\r\nUltimately it's a character study that doesn't delve too deeply for equal parties, but come the 1980 Wimbledon final, with one of the greatest 4th sets ever played, you should be hard pressed not to rejoice. Not only in the sport of tennis played to the max, but in how two supposed rivals actually became the best of friends. 7\/10","id":"5e7f93a72f266b0014598808","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e7f93a72f266b0014598808","movie_id":397538}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Not the film I was hoping for!**\r\n\r\nThis director, I don't think he would ever get another chance to work with any top actors after this film. One of the worst films I have recently. If you are a lead actor's fan, then you might enjoy it for your loyalty for him, but definitely this is not for everyone. Everyone means, this film made especially for the Indian audience, which looks more like an utter Telugu style commercial film than what I know about Tamil films. I watched it mainly for Keerthy, as I haven't seen her any films so far. This is her big leap to the big actors league, but not quite perfect entry. Except it decently did at the box office.\r\n\r\nAs usual, like any big lead star's films, the songs and the preferring details on heroism destroyed the story flow. Yeah, the story does not take the lead with twist and turns and emotions and romance, but it's the lead actor\/character who controlled everything according to his style. This MASS culture was started by Rajinikanth, yet he has changed with the film 'Kabali' to the international standards when it comes to the story narration. These stars below him are yet to learn that tactics. It could have worked better if it was a Tollywood film with their stars.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of unrealistic scenes in the film and stunts are the top among them. The character PK was almost like the negative role Adisheshan from the film 'Sivaji'. The end twist was unbelievable. I mean not in a good sense. Very silly and which makes the earlier development in the story was invalid. I was stunned after the hero committed to bring justice, he changed his approach at the end. That was not a twist, but the writer did not know how to solve the puzzle, so he messed up at the end. Sorry guys, Anytime I would recommend Indian parallel films which are small budget films, have less known actors and directors rather than these stupid masala films.\r\n\r\n_3\/10_","id":"5943062c9251417f6501358a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5943062c9251417f6501358a","movie_id":411717}

Then it was too sexy, that I was not allowed to watch. The world has changed so much all these years. I always wanted to see that, but never had a chance. Now a film, possibly a new franchise if it all goes well. There were lots of expectations on it, but the film did not deliver that.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"I'm not saying women are better. I've never said that. I'm saying we deserve some respect. \r\n\r\nBattle of the sexes is directed by  Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris and written by Simon Beaufoy. It stars Emma Stone, Steve Carell, Andrea Riseborough, Natalie Morales, Sarah Silverman, Bill Pullman, Eric Christian Olsen, Alan Cumming and Elisabeth Shue. Music is by Nicholas Britell and cinematography by Linus Sandgren.\r\n\r\nBack in 1973 there was a tennis match - a show event - where self proclaimed media hustler Booby Riggs (Carrel) took on supreme ladies champion of the era Billie Jean King (Stone). It would be tagged as The Battle Of The Sexes and the importance of such has echoed through time to still be relevant today.\r\n\r\nHere we have a film running at two hours in length that actually plays more as a King biography than it does a piece about the tennis match at pic's closure. Why not just call your film Billie Jean King? That would still have worked and been more closer to the themes playing out. On the King biography terms it's a fascinating and engrossing film, her battle with her sexuality issues - and the media threats that such a thing of the era would produce - and her wonderfully stoic stance for women's acceptance rights in sport. Unfortunately since the focus is more in this area the film becomes repetitive and over stuffed, and crucially it sadly puts the Bobby Riggs story firmly into the background.  \r\n\r\nHowever, there's a lot to like on show here if one can forgive it its ill thought out unbalancing act. The cast performances across the board are top line. Stone and Carell are kind of a given, the latter really nailing the characterisation, but key turns by Riseborough, Olsen, Silverman and a wonderfully flamboyant Cumming light up the period play. The last third as we head towards the match of the title is excellent, characterisations have been set up for maximum impact, while the writers do not pander to gloating or PC banner waving to leave us on a positive and thought provoking note. If only the Riggs axis had been given more meaty substance, and the mid-section not practically slow to a snails pace, then we would have had a better movie more befitting the title - and historical event - than the one we get. 6\/10","id":"5d2ad925a294f0001030eac7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d2ad925a294f0001030eac7","movie_id":369192}
{"author":"CraigJamesReview","content":"Baywatch is a movie based off the popular TV show of the same name which launched the careers of such acting talents as Yasmine Bleeth and Pam Anderson. And then those quickly died right afterwards but hey, the show ran like 11 years and\u0085little known fact, Jason Mamoa was on spin-off show Baywatch: Hawaii.\r\n\r\nThe movie is very much like the show; as in if you walk in expecting to take it seriously you're already watching it wrong. The situations people need to be rescued from are just as ridiculous and far-fetched and the main plot here gets far more convoluted and hackneyed than the average day of any real lifeguard.\r\n\r\nAnd like 21 Jump Street and a bunch of lesser TV to movie adaptations, this seeks to make fun of all of it, plus all the slo-mo beach running. Does it come off as good as Jump Street? No. Do we need this? God no. I mean didn't the show basically already make fun of itself enough as it is?\r\n\r\nBut all I can say here, and I guess the only thing anyone interested in this might want to know is, it could have been so much worse. I'm not saying this is the best movie of the summer so far. I don't really even know if i'm saying this is a good movie. But it's easy enough to sit through and the laughs, while not great, are consistent.\r\n\r\nWhere the script sucks, the cast knows how to make fun of itself. The Rock is the head honcho who takes the job very seriously. Zac Efron is the selfish, cool pretty boy new trainee who clashes with him. Both have a plethora of jokes for one another that work with varying degrees of success.\r\n\r\nThere's a fat lifeguard and the movie takes the shots you would expect it to take but actor Jon Bass also does have some comedic talent here in the Josh Gadd sense of the word. Actually he may even be funnier than Josh Gadd. Point is he works the best here from a comedic perspective.\r\n\r\nThe movie gives us quite a few dick jokes but this dude actually has one embarrassing moment that may rank up there with \"There's Something About Mary\", just with not as good a payoff.\r\n\r\nHannibal Burress also gets a couple scenes for a cameo and I love when he gets those. It's time for Burress to headline a movie though.\r\n\r\nThe women aren't as funny but I guess you can say they add some nice support to that and the action. Alexandra Daddario has shown a few times she's a pretty decent actress, and the others don't just seem like stiffs there to just show off a hot body. Priyanka Chopra is also here as the villain, and she's fine.\r\n\r\nThe whole movie can really be described as fine. It's funny and doesn't take itself too seriously and the cast all seems game for it. You don't have to see, but if you do, know it's already planning on sequels.\r\n\r\nSo I go 6 out of 10 on this one.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Don't mess with this Baby!**\r\n\r\nOne of the stylish film of the year. There's nothing special about the story, but the way it was made looks intriguing. The individual characters, music, stunts, obviously car chases. Not the best role Ansel Elgort has ever played, but in his short, beginning of the career, it quite possibly defines he's ready for the tough roles. Then the British filmmaker known for some wonderful action-comedies, one more addition to his hit kit.\r\n\r\nA youngster who is a getaway car driver for heists, working under a criminal mastermind, is often teamed with a different crew. One of his latest job takes an unexpected twist, leaving his yet to bloom romance with a waitress in peril. His attempt to come out of that, the risk he takes, changes his life forever. The tale ends with an action packed finale.\r\n\r\nThis is the first Kevin Spacey film I'm seeing after all the allegation against him. I blame everyone equally who had let him do it all these years. But that's nothing to do with this film. He was fine as an actor as always. It's just fine to be as one-off film, but the way everything had happened looked like it could have been a great franchise. As of latest news, it is on. The sad part is, all the good characters won't return. Anyway, it is one of the must see from the year T17.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"5a771345c3a3686b5101ed7d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a771345c3a3686b5101ed7d","movie_id":339403}

{"author":"David","content":"Baby (Elgort) is a quiet, unassuming young man, who looks after his ailing foster parent, listens to music both out of his love for it, and a need to block out the tinnitus ringing in his ears that he was afflicted with due to a tragic accident that also took his parents. Baby also has a specific skill set, one that has him doing the bidding of a crime boss Doc (Spacey) to pay back a debt.\r\n\r\nBaby's skill is driving, but not just any driving, the kind of skilled driving that gets Doc's crew of armed bandits away from the scene of bank hold-ups very fast, and then leads crews of police cars on a merry dance, and dodges every trick up their sleeves with a few of his own set to a killer music soundtrack from his iPod.\r\n\r\nWith light at the end of the tunnel, Baby has a chance encounter with cute diner waitress Debora (James), where the chemistry between the two is instant. He sees this as his road to freedom, and a bright new future. This new future is brought to rude halt by Doc who was not yet done with Baby.\r\n\r\nThis film is all about the music soundtrack, and what a soundtrack indeed. With songs like Nowhere to Run by Martha and the Vandellas, to the quintessential driving song Radar Love by Golden Earring, you'll be tapping your toes as well as being thrilled by the action, plus the classy, and slick driving by Baby.\r\n\r\nThe performances in this film are all stand out, relative new comers Elgort, James, and Gonz\u00e1lez do really well in their respective roles. The scene stealing performances by Spacey, Hamm, and Foxx are great in support to Elgort. While Spacey, as he generally does, plays cool, and mellow. Hamm, and Foxx do it with charm, and evil menace as Buddy, and Bats. Jon Bernthal's cameo as the suspicious, and hot-headed Griff was also a delight to watch.\r\n\r\nWritten, and directed by cult favourite Edgar Wright, this film has all the elements that make this a great addition to the tradition of other heist films like Drive, The Getaway, and Heat.\r\n\r\nBaby Driver is probably the most fun I had at the cinemas this year along with Wonder Woman, and Spider-Man Homecoming.","id":"5e3fd9413dd126001453720f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e3fd9413dd126001453720f","movie_id":339403}

{"author":"tajshar2k","content":"Mersal is an awesome movie with great entertainment value. Vijay has given his best performance yet and he deserves praise for his triple role.The movie doesn't overdo the \"mass\" image that Vijay has, but it does provide us with some moments that will give you goosebumps. The cinematography is top notch in this movie, and songs like \"Mersal Arasan\" and \"Aallaporan Tamizhan\" are enjoyable to watch, All thanks to Vijay's dancing skills of course! Action scenes are lacking for Vijay's standards, but given the story-line it makes perfect sense.\r\n\r\nThe story itself isn't anything mind-blowing and fairly average, but the reason why it works well in this case is because of the social messages that delivers. Throughout the movie, there are many references to social issues that are impacting India, and it's nice that the movie takes some time to talk about these issues. The main focus of the movie was about how hospitals are exploiting patients to make extra profit, and I think the movie did good job of drawing out the emotional plight of the victims. The flashback with Vijay's Vetrimaaran character strengthens that sentiment.\r\n\r\nThe performance of the supporting cast was pretty average. Vadivelu makes a comeback to comedy after many years, but I rarely laughed at anything he said. SJ Surya does the stereotypical villain role and does a decent job at it. We probably just expected more out of him, seeing his award-worthy performance in Spyder. The rest of the performances by the supporting cast was average.\r\n\r\nMy main criticism for the movie would be the love interests that Vijay has. Samantha and Kajal's characters were really not needed for this movie, and their only purpose was to fill up 2 songs. The movie spends valuable time with pointless romance scenes, and had the movie been more dedicated to the social message that it was trying it present, there would have been more impact. The only Heroine that was needed was Nithya Menen, who did an excellent job with her character. The magician aspect of Vetri's character was cool, but sometimes it seemed too unrealistic and was only put in the scene to advance the plot. They could have constructed more logical scenes in that case.\r\n\r\nOverall, it was a great movie, and I think most people will enjoy it. Please watch it for the social message and Vijay's performance. You won't be disappointed.","id":"5beb2166c3a36817460580f0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5beb2166c3a36817460580f0","movie_id":456287}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**At the end, every hero's life should be 'happily ever after'!**\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'Blackfish'. It could have been another fine documentary, in the end it was a right choice to be made as a feature film. This is a biographical film, a war drama. The story of a young woman who joined the US army and developed a close relationship with a military dog. They both served in the Iraq war and later separated. So she fought for the dog's custody, especially after it retiring from the service. A touching story about man- animal bonding. You might have seen many dog films, but this is different and so good.\r\n\r\nPeople have rights to choose what they want to be. Most importantly, they can change the field at any time. At least that's how things happen in a democracy. But that's not the case for animals, especially human pets under any kind of the ruling system. Why should animals fight human wars! There were many kinds of animal slaveries abolished, yet this kind of legal things still going on. In the present world, it could be okay, but as an animal lover, I hope in the near future, it'll be called inhumane.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, this is a must watch if you are a pet\/dog lover. If you ever had a dog, you will feel more connected to it. The story was told from Megan Leavey's perspective, but Rex, the dog was the real hero. Both, the real and film dog. I have seen many films of Kate Mara, but when it comes dominant performance, this is the one. This is not a multi- star cast as her most of the film, so she did an awesome job. Slightly emotional too, a good film for all ages. Particularly this is a chic film that's not a romance or a comedy.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Conduit Demon: Take 27!\r\n\r\nOK! It may not be 27 films in the latest conduit demon phase of horror film making, but it sure as hell feels like it! Annabelle: Creation would have been a very good horror film if it had come out 10 years ago, as it is we find ourselves treading familiar ground and relying on the usual horror film making playbook for our thrills.\r\n\r\nAnyone such as myself who is bothered by pediophobia, automatonphobia and pupaphobia will surely be chilled to the bone here, for the makers push it to the max, with fine results. However, once that aspect is stripped away and the sound and visual horror staples grow tired, we are left hankering for a glorious final quarter of film to terrify us - which sadly doesn't materialise as we then get conduit demon 101.\r\n\r\nIn the pluses column there's a superb tie-in to the real Annabelle doll, an adherence to story as fact shrewdly inserted, and the acting (with young Lulu Wilson bright again as she wanders in from Ouija: Origin of Evil) is more than adequate. Sound mix rocks, as does the photographic shadows and shimmers, rendering the production technically good. If only the writers had been a bit more bolder and imaginative...\r\n\r\nMuch better than Annabelle (2014) (which isn't hard really), \"Creation\" is above average fare for casual horror fans with the fears previously stated.

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"There is always a risk involved when revisiting cinema from the past and dusting it off in favor of an ambitious remake for the consideration of today\u2019s adventurous movie-going audience. Hollywood has done this tactic for decades now so this is nothing new to contemplate as food for thought. It is one thing to try and bring back the freshness and impact of the original blueprint from yesteryear for a distinctive film that proved to be critically acclaimed, extremely popular, conveniently trendy and memorable for it box office heyday. So what gives for trying to resuscitate a mediocre 1990 Brat Pack medical psychological thriller and re-packaging it as an updated glossy horror\/SF fantasy focusing on the tiresome and exploitative life-and-death theme for the millennial mindset?\r\n\r\nPerhaps director Niels Arden Oplev (\u2018The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\u2019) can answer this puzzling inquiry as he presents front and center his modern-day take on the nearly three decade-year old Joel Schumacher-directed DOA drama **Flatliners**. Indeed, Schumacher\u2019s original outing was not what one would call engaging or stimulating but at least it boasted a noteworthy listing of talented young Hollywood hotshots (Julia Roberts, Kiefer Sutherland, Billy Baldwin, Kevin Bacon, Hope Davis, Oliver Platt, etc.) to give a creative jolt to this highly contrived existential experimentation regarding the afterlife. However, Oplev concocts a faceless rehash that offers tepid thrills and chills, frivolous fright impulses that amount to all the riveting tension of a leaky bed pan in the emergency ward and a paper-thin payoff that never quite delivers.\r\n\r\nIn portraying young idealistic doctors that have an affinity for exploring the unknown realm of the human condition beyond the physical alertness of existence is somewhat of an interesting concept in consciousness on various levels of medical science, spirituality and just plain man-made curiosity. Nevertheless, **Flatliners** (Oplev\u2019s version, of course) does not have the inquisitive juice to lubricate any in-depth instinctive moral dilemma or philosophical ambivalence in this disjointed supernatural medical melodrama lacking a pulse (yes, pun intended). Oplev\u2019s unimaginative direction and the run-of-the-mill script by screenwriter Ben Ripley does nothing to pump any bombastic blood in this cardiac caper that\u2026er\u2026has no intriguing heart (okay\u2026another pun intended). Ironically, reviving the previous serving of the 27-year old Schumacher vehicle for a contemporary copycat that drips more than a faulty IV bag is the biggest fearful flatliner fantasy to behold.\r\n\r\nOscar-nominated Ellen Page (yesterday\u2019s treasured darling courtesy of her spunky turn as a self-deprecating pregnant teen in 2007\u2019s \u2018Juno\u2019) plays the film\u2019s ringleader Courtney, a medical student whose guilt and fascination with death is incredulously shared by her group of contemporaries. Courtney is carrying a psychological burden involving a deceased sister, so naturally this is among the unfinished issues that haunt her personally. Basically, Courtney and her crew conduct risque experiments in the hospital\u2019s underground basement in which they enthusiastically kill themselves only to be brought back to life afterwards. During their so-called flatliner sessions, they are disturbed by the ominous sensations of their life-and-death odyssey but remain captivated and invigorated at the same time. This does not deter Courney and her peers from stopping their hearts for the eerie adventurous rush they receive when entering the zone of a dream-like or appropriately nightmarish tranquility.\r\n\r\nAmong Courtney\u2019s fellow medical heart-stopping thrill-seekers are James Norton\u2019s Jamie, Nina Dobrev\u2019s Marlo, Kiersey Clemon\u2019s Sophia and Diego Luna\u2019s Rudy, who is the recipient of the golden nugget for playing Page\u2019s\/Courtney\u2019s lovey-dovey boyfriend whose primary role is to revive his sweetie and her associates after their treacherous trip through death\u2019s delusional door. In any event, these halting heartthrobs (get the double meaning?) possess this awkward ambition to prove whether or not there is brain activity after leaving the land of the living. When the flatliners return to their lively senses, they acknowledge that the brain functioning has sharpened for the better. On the flip side, Courtney and her comatose cohorts all start to undergo some supernatural psychosis that promotes an array of problematic mental dysfunction. The significant vital signs include the drudging up of dark tormented secrets embedded in their damages psyches, monotonous memories that create disturbing unrest and an overall nervousness undefined in and out of their death-defying field trip into mercurial madness.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the mystery is not so much how dedicated and challenged these model-ready med students are ready to tip toe through the tulips of traumatic trances while bodily stopping their organs in the name of scientific ambivalence. The real mystery is why this insipid remake of **Flatliners** was even made and revisited in the first place? For starters, Opley\u2019s nervous system narrative into the realm of human consciousness feels clumsy, trivial, pointless and frivolously far-fetched. Even Schumacher\u2019s original edition, albeit it a shoddy one, had some semblance of attempted earnestness despite its cockeyed and uneven capricious construction. Here, Opley does nothing in the least to give his **Flatliners** any sense of flair, distinctive energy, dubious drive, lofty scares or hypnotic insight into this aimless, recycled material. The film looks cheaply produced and the real message of these young doctors\u2019 journey into an abyss of deadened state is merely reduced to them hyperventilating at their own psychological indiscretions from the past. Sounds rather captivating, huh? The true malpractice at work here is the fraudulent posturing of **Flatliners** coming off as an intriguing mega-medical malaise of major proportions. Plus, the obligatory jump-scares are relentlessly obvious and overplayed. Simply put, this drowsy doctored drama has nothing to say or suggest other than to sprinkle some meaningless titillating CGI imagery around to give this horror-induced hokum some creepy credibility.\r\n\r\nAlthough the winking gimmick of having original **Flatliners** star Keifer Sutherland return to his roots regarding the film\u2019s reminiscence as a middle-aged lecturer is somewhat of a feel-good nostalgic touch, there is not much else that one can hang their hat on for this baseless paranormal puff piece into death-style delirium. Page\u2019s Courtney and her care-giving counterparts come off more as polished twenty-something treats that should be shooting a provocative TV ad for The Gap clothing store rather than portraying death-jumping doctors. Sophomoric dialogue and the soulless randomness into the landscape of living and dying take its silly-minded toll beyond belief. Page, once an adventurous and resourceful actress with a nuanced nose for notable colorful parts in indie and mainstream films, is embarrassingly handcuffed to this SF\/horror health care hazard of a motion picture.\r\n\r\nWhat **Flatliners** needs or any other regrettable notions of its future sequels or remakes is a decorative quarantine sign hanging on its hospital bed.\r\n\r\n**Flatliners** (2017)\r\n\r\nColumbia Pictures\r\n\r\n1 hour 48 minutes\r\n\r\nCAST: Ellen Page, James Norton, Kiefer Sutherland, Diego Luna, Nina Dobrev and Kiersey Clemons\r\n\r\nDIRECTOR: Niels Arden Oplev\r\n\r\nWRITER: Ben Ripley\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGENRE: Horror\/Science Fiction\/Drama\/Fantasy\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: * 1\/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** (2017)","id":"59cfe1b29251411448002892","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59cfe1b29251411448002892","movie_id":400710}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Line of flatness for fans of the original - for others not so much.\r\n\r\nStrictly on a personal level, I always felt that the original Flatliners was average at best. A missed opportunity to use the premise for frightening results, to unnerve, unhinge, whilst intelligently examining the life after death question. So when news of this 2017 remake broke I wasn't in the least bit surprised, the idea at the narrative core was ripe for further filmic delvings.\r\n\r\n Niels Arden Oplev's 2017 version is itself problematic, and a long way from being all the things I so wanted from the original film, but at least it has its own twists, a supernatural slant for scares. The makers are also to be applauded for making a truly bold decision in the story, rendering complaints about this not offering anything new as being redundant. \r\nChances are that if you are a fan of the original film you will hate this, if like me you have no affinity to it then this is an ok time waster. While for those not familiar with the 1990 pic can go in for some mild shock and afterlife dalliances. 6\/10","id":"5b548ef0c3a3680b660379f0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b548ef0c3a3680b660379f0","movie_id":400710}

{"author":"Bulletproof5FDP","content":"The much-anticipated Justice League, the follow-up to 2016\u2019s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, was finally released on November 17, 2017. After Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad were both negatively received, Warner Bros. saw a glimmer of hope with the highly-received Wonder Woman and hoped this would push the DCEU forward onto greatness. I saw Justice League on the 19th of November and my consensus: It\u2019s Not Good. Opening to $94 million for its first weekend and with a 40% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, Justice League underperformed both financially and critically. 10 years ago, I would have laughed at the idea of a Guardians of the Galaxy film beating Justice League at the box office and be much better received. Justice League\u2019s performance puts the future of the DCEU in jeopardy.\r\nDue to a personal tragedy in Zack Snyder\u2019s life, he stepped down as director and Joss Whedon (director of The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron) took over post-production with reshoots and filming additional scenes. Most would have assumed that because of Joss Whedon\u2019s reputation, he would be a great asset to the production of Justice League. However, that was strongly not the case. Zack Snyder intended to make this movie with a much lighter tone than Batman v Superman, but Zack Snyder\u2019s style just does not blend well with Joss Whedon\u2019s. What we\u2019re left with is a DC film badly trying to be a Marvel film and the tone is an inconsistent mess throughout. The film loses its sense of identity and doesn\u2019t know what tone (light or dark) it wants to incorporate. Thanks to Warner Bros. meddling with the production of the film and purposely sabotaging Zack Snyder\u2019s vision (as much as I dislike his directing style), we\u2019re left with a film full of sloppy editing and pacing, inconsistent tone, forgettable\/unmemorable music, rushed \u201cdevelopment\u201d of characters, a terribly developed villain, thin plot and clunky CGI throughout. \r\n\r\nThe movie directly follows the death of Superman in the previous film, triggering a sense of fear in people and allowing Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons to seek the 3 Mother Boxes on Earth to trigger a mass transformation of the planet. But instead of showcasing his initial invasion on Earth, the film starts off with disjointed scenes that don\u2019t connect with one another. First with a video recording of Superman looking like he doesn\u2019t want to even be recorded, then jumps to Batman using a criminal to capture a Parademon, then again to Wonder Woman thwarting a terrorist plot (which has nothing to do with the overall narrative), then jumps to a fully-bearded Bruce Wayne attempting to recruit Aquaman. There is no smooth transition between scenes and just results in a jumbled mess that really doesn\u2019t show us a sense of urgency as to why Diana and Bruce want to recruit a team of meta-humans. \r\n\r\nThe movie should really give us a reason as to why Steppenwolf should be feared, but instead, he is portrayed as a generic, badly rendered CGI figure that utters generic villain dialogue and just suddenly appears in Themiscyra through a Boom Tube. We are not given a scene showing who Steppenwolf is or why he\u2019s returned to Earth before arriving to Themiscyra. While there is a scene showing Steppenwolf\u2019s original invasion on Earth and his subsequent defeat by the combines forces of Humans, Atlanteans, Amazonians and Green Lanterns, it\u2019s narrated by Wonder Woman and misplaced during a random moment when she\u2019s explaining the Mother Boxes after he has invaded Themiscyra. The movie should have started off with developing a strong sense of interest for Steppenwolf and his reason for obtaining the Mother Boxes (is he doing this on his own accord or is a higher being \u2013 Darkseid \u2013 ordering him to do so?). Then show his original invasion on Earth without having Wonder Woman to tell us about Steppenwolf. Steppenwolf is basically Loki: They both wore a helmet with horns, they were both given orders by a higher being to retrieve a box (or boxes), they both commanded an army of disposable CGI monsters, they both arrived to Earth through a portal, and both attempted to conquer the world. But the big difference? Loki is actually likeable, while Steppenwolf is greatly forgettable. \r\n\r\nSuperman, the \u201cbeacon of hope\u201d as described by Bruce Wayne, is nothing of the sort. He was portrayed as a strongly brooding figure in both Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, but we do not once see Superman acting as this beacon. Instead, he looked as if he hates saving people and always has a blank expression on his face. There is no sense of romance between him and Lois or him being a beacon of hope, we\u2019re just told that and are expected to believe that. However, his character sees much improvement in Justice League. One of the aspects I enjoyed about the film was actually Superman. In the film\u2019s climax, he actually felt and acted like the Superman we all knew and loved in the past (excluding his two previous films). His revival was quite satisfying, especially when Bruce knew he may not be the same person as before. Then we\u2019re given a glimpse into an Evil Superman where he easily manages to take on all the Justice League members. What I especially liked was seeing The Flash attempt to run behind Superman and as he\u2019s in the Speed Force, Superman moves his eyes and head to stare directly at Barry, catches him off-guard and he\u2019s left with a \u201cWTF\u201d expression on his face. This was honestly one of the best moments of the entire film, but is very short-lived. Lois Lane comes to the rescue and seems to knock Superman out of his disoriented state and they fly back to Smallville. After some brief dialogue, Superman seems to be back to his old self. I just felt his state of mind reverting back to his original self was rushed and relied heavily on Lois Lane to do the job.\r\n\r\nBatman is seen as the weakest member of the Justice League and is turned into a complete joke in this film. He even utters one-liners and is a much more light-hearted character in stark contrast to his debut in Batman v Superman. It\u2019s very out of character for Bruce Wayne\/Batman to be this way. It makes him seem like the DC equivalent of Tony Stark. It\u2019s also apparent that Ben Affleck wants to no longer play Batman, I can totally tell that he just doesn\u2019t seem to care anymore about the role. But he is given terrible material to work with, and I can understand why he would want to stop playing the role. I just hope Ben Affleck can see a glimmer of hope in the upcoming Batman solo reboot. \r\n\r\nNot much to say about Wonder Woman, since her solo film was spectacular and she continued to be damn amazing in this film, but I was utterly disgusted that DC felt it was necessary to overly-sexualize her by capturing close shots of her chest and ass. They even get up-skirt shots of her. It undermines her character established in her solo film and delegates her to being mere eye candy in the eyes of men. Plus the terrorist plot she thwarted, though it was an awesome moment, has no purpose and was a waste of screen time.\r\n\r\nCyborg is easily the least interesting character of the group. There\u2019s brief development that I assume he holds resentment towards his father for bringing him back as \u201cmonster.\u201d We\u2019re not given an inner struggle with Cyborg struggling to deal with the fact of his condition, but the film has to quickly gloss over the Justice League members introduced in Batman v Superman via e-mail attachment in order to form the team. His only shining moment is in the final battle where he is the only one that can separate the Mother Boxes before Steppenwolf can enact his plan. But in Batman v Superman, from the video file, it seemed as if the Mother Box fused with Cyborg, so why is the box still a separate entity? It should have been fused with Cyborg and would raise the stakes a bit higher because Steppenwolf could use Cyborg to fuse with the other Mother Boxes and would force the Justice League to do everything in their power to save him. \r\n\r\nEzra Miller\u2019s The Flash seems to be DC\u2019s response to Tom Holland\u2019s Spider-Man. However, The Flash is a much worse version of Spider-Man with very cringe-worthy dialogue. He\u2019s socially awkward and without hesitation, he immediately agrees to join Bruce Wayne for the reason of wanting friends. What the hell? We saw some development with Barry Allen striving to prove his father\u2019s innocence, but why join the Justice League for the sole purpose of making friends? Plus he even explains to Batman that he has never been in a battle, yet he was shown to be the one that apprehended Captain Boomerang. He is never given a shining moment except for saving a family in Russia and challenging Superman to a race in the mid-credits scene. \r\n\r\nJason Momoa as Aquaman was actually amazing, though he is bogged down by very limited screen time and little to no development. It honestly makes me quite excited for the upcoming Aquaman solo film slated for release late-2018. But a major annoyance I had with Aquaman was that he completely disappears from the movie after fighting off Steppenwolf, then suddenly reappears when the team is fighting Steppenwolf and Parademons in the sewers. There is no explanation as to how he arrived to the sewers, he just appears there. And that is the only time we truly see his powers is when he stops a column of water from flushing them out. In the final battle, they are nowhere near a water source, so what good is Aquaman if he cannot use his powers? However, it leaves me wanting to know more about Aquaman. Despite those annoyances, I thought the scene where Aquaman is unknowingly sitting on the Lasso of Truth and starts to speak the truth about their situation was fantastic and quite humorous, especially his reaction to when he realizes he was sitting on the lasso. \r\n\r\nThe final battle between Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons against the Justice League has very low stakes and takes place in an obscure location in Russia. Unlike The Avengers, where the battle took place in New York and resulted in severe collateral damage, which raised the stakes a lot, Justice League\u2019s climax doesn\u2019t have a sense of world-ending urgency. It\u2019s just a giant CGI battle with the only memorable moment being Aquaman riding a Parademon through a building. There\u2019s no shining moments like Hulk slamming Loki or Hawkeye jumping off the building and shooting at the Chitauri as he\u2019s falling. As Cyborg is struggling to separate the Mother Boxes, Superman appears when all hope seems to be lost and absolutely beats the shit out of Steppenwolf, breaking his weapon and his own Parademons attack him since they smell his fear of defeat. It made Steppenwolf seem like nothing but a giant push-over. But what especially irks me is that the original plan was to have Steppenwolf attempt to sway Superman to join him, Superman is given an apocalyptic vision( similar to the one Batman saw) and he actually sees Darkseid and this snaps Superman out of it and he delivers the final blow to defeat Steppenwolf. \r\n\r\nThough it\u2019s a competent film and I really wanted to enjoy this film, Justice League is a complete let-down that should have been a huge movie event. Given its box office numbers and critical reception, this puts the future of the DCEU in a troubling position. They really should have given each of the heroes a solo film before releasing Justice League, but it\u2019s apparent that Warner Bros. was way more concerned with catching up with Marvel than actually developing a shared universe with well-developed characters. Justice League just did not resonate with me and we can mainly thank Warner Bros. for rushing this film and delivering a disappointing product. \r\n\r\nClosing Comments \r\n- When Cyborg links up to the Nightcrawler, Alfred asks him if he knows him. Alfred and Diana were in the Batcave together when Cyborg reached out to them, Alfred should have recognized his voice completely.\r\n- Steppenwolf should have been a much better-developed villain with a well-defined purpose.\r\n- Mixing the styles of two directors in this film gave it a wildly inconsistent tone. \r\n- The humor, thought it did lighten up the mood, doesn\u2019t work well with Zack Snyder\u2019s style and feels out of place. \r\n- What was the deal with putting so much focus on that Russian family? It takes you out of the element of the final battle and is a cheap attempt at raising the stakes.\r\n- When Steppenwolf was first defeated thousands of years ago, why did they all entrust the humans with a Mother Box? Shouldn\u2019t the Green Lantern Corps be alerted that one of their own perished in the battle? They could have taken the Mother Box back with them, but they didn\u2019t.\r\n- Overall, the movie suffers from trying to do too much with too little time. DC really needs to reevaluate their future releases and as much as we all want another Justice League, they should put all their focus on standalone titles to fully flesh out their characters for now.\r\n- That post-credits scene featuring Slade Wilson\/Deathstroke visiting a recently escaped and bald Lex Luthor is a set-up for the Injustice League\/Legion of Doom, which would make for an interesting idea for the Justice League sequel (if it does happen).\r\n\r\nRating: 4\/10","id":"5a95966ac3a3681170000386","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a95966ac3a3681170000386","movie_id":141052}

{"author":"garethmb","content":"The long anticipated \u201cJustice League\u201d has finally arrived finally combining the biggest stars of the DC universe into one film. The proposed film has faced many obstacles on the way to the big screen ranging from script issues, massive reshoots and a change of Director for said reshoots due to a family tragedy that Director Zack Snyder suffered.\r\n\r\nThe film follows Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Godot), as they look to assemble a team of other gifted individuals to help fight off a pending invasion.  \r\n\r\nThe death of Superman has left a void on the Earth, and this has paved the way for an ancient evil to return as he attempts to conquer the planet after he collects the three needed artifacts that his plan requires.\r\n\r\nIn a race against time, Batman and Wonder Woman recruit Aquaman (Jason Momoa), The Flash (Ezra Miller), and Cyborg (Ray Fisher), to battle to save the planet. Naturally they battle amongst themselves as well as their massing enemies but ultimately decide on a dangerous plan that can tip the odds in their favor and save the day.\r\n\r\nThe action in the film is good but it often plays out like a video game. With so many blatantly obvious CGI backgrounds, the movie looked like a video game. There were numerous scenes that looked like they were lifted from Injustice and Injustice 2 that I mused to myself that someone must have used their Power Up for the shot.\r\n\r\nAffleck and Gadot are good and work well with one another, but there are some serious casting issues with the film. The biggest for me was Ezra Miller as The Flash. I did not like his effeminate, nerdy, socially awkward, and neurotic and at times cowardly take on the character. This is not the Barry Allen I grew up reading in comics or the one that has been portrayed twice in a much better fashion on television. His comic relief status grew old fast and his character really offered little to the film.\r\n\r\nIt has been well-documented that Joss Whedon not only handled the rewrites for the film but took over directing duties to complete the film. You can see elements of his humor scattered throughout and the film does move along at a steady pace without dragging.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue is that so many of the characters are just stiff and one-dimensional. They really are not overly interesting so it is hard to really connect with them and the tasks they are facing. Unlike Marvel who have excelled with dysfunctional groups who fight amongst themselves as well as the forces of evil, this group seems to be going through the paces rather than being fully engaged with the task at hand and each other.\r\n\r\nIn the end \u201cJustice League\u201d is better than I expected, and the two bonus scenes in the credits show some interesting potential down the road.  As it is, it is flawed entertainment that requires audiences to overlook a lot of issues.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5","id":"5a0c5d3e9251414d94012bfd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a0c5d3e9251414d94012bfd","movie_id":141052}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This was my type of Super Hero movie. Simple, straightforward plot without much social nonsens and preaching. Little in terms of the all too common whining and sel pitying by the heroes. They are heroes all the way without any nonsensical vendettas or moral bullshit (mostly). There is an episode with a temporary memory lapse and some unnecessary slowdown but it is quickly dealt with.\n\nOn Wikipedia you can read that the movie was criticized for its \u201coveruse of CGI\u201d. Well, go watch another movie then for Christ sake! News Flash: It is a Super Hero movie! There are supposed to be a shitload of CGI in a super hero movie. Personally I enjoyed every second of the FX loaded scenes.\n\nI am quite happy to finally see a real Super Hero movie and especially to see Batman and Superman again after that utterly abysmal train wreck Batman v. Superman.\n\nI liked all the heros in this movie. The Flash was a bit silly at times but it was bearable. Gal Gadot is as hot (I had to say it) as ever as Wonder Woman. There are a few comical moments but luckily they are not overdone. Aquaman accidentally sitting on Wonder Woman\u2019s \u201ctruth lasso\u201d was quite hilarious actually.\n\nThe SF was generally great. I really liked the explosive action scenes. The colorful tendrils that invaded the land around Steppenwolf\u2019s lair was a bit si-so though. They should have kept them just black and red at least.\nSteppenwolf himself was okay. From a distance he was pretty great but up close (and there was really too many up close scenes of him) he looked\u2026not so great, especially when talking.\n\nThere are a couple of stupid faults of course. Usually involving the good guys just standing around looking while the bad guy screws them. Leaving the, obviously, all important third mother box unguarded and the lust looking stupid when Steppenwolf grabbed it was a real low.\n\nAnyway, I really liked this movie. I do hope we get more like it.","id":"5ac1df4b0e0a260c390196b7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ac1df4b0e0a260c390196b7","movie_id":141052}

The exceptional title song plays during the credits.  \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 59 minutes, and was shot in Atlanta, Georgia (neighborhood scenes) and Hawaii with loads of CGI backdrops.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B","id":"5e76d6ea357c0000194f96a8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e76d6ea357c0000194f96a8","movie_id":353486}

{"author":"amanshroff","content":"**The 90's Game is back and got even more adventurous !!**\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen four teenagers in detention discover an old video game console with a game they've never heard of, they are immediately thrust into the game's jungle setting, into the bodies of their avatars, played by Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, and Karen Gillan. What they discover is that you don't just play Jumanji -Jumanji plays you. They'll have to go on the most dangerous adventure of their lives, or they'll be stuck in the game forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the age of Hollywood's obsession with franchise-building and reboots, the idea for a sequel to 1995's 'Jumanji' came across as another eye-roll worthy project. However, the combination of charming actors Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Karen Gillian and Kevin Hart, made it evident that this would wind up either being a complete trainwreck, or total mindless fun. Fortunately, 'Welcome to the Jungle' falls solidly into the latter category. The chemistry between the lead cast is evident and the script makes the most of this by giving each actor moments to shine and showcase their skills while they clearly enjoy playing their characters.\r\n\r\nJohnson's younger persona Spencer is a nerdy guy who has lived a sheltered life and is afraid of the world. When he enters the game he takes on the avatar of a hunk with no discernible physical weakness. Johnson has fun with this switch of persona and watching him go back and forth doesn't get old. The same goes for Jack Black who plays a self-absorbed, social media addicted teenage girl Bethany. Her switch into Black's trademark rotund shape is the most extreme and ends up being hilarious. While Black and Johnson are engaging as they are completely cast against their typical selves, Gillian and Hart aren't too far behind playing an awkward, insecure but intelligent girl, and an all-star jock boy trapped in a less-than-stellar body respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis entire body-switch premise works on slapstick humour that's not crass and moves quickly with ample action to ensure that the 2-hour runtime doesn't feel bulky at any point. Granted there's a villain problem with Bobby Cannavale's Van Pelt being as one-dimensional as they come. It's conveniently explained away as this is all a video game, and the same rules apply for its lack of depth. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Overall_, 'Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle' ends up being a fun, holiday film that will keep you entertained enough to make it worth your time and money.","id":"5a5c7031c3a3686d7c007302","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a5c7031c3a3686d7c007302","movie_id":353486}

{"author":"Movie Queen41","content":"An enjoyable superhero team movie. It's really being unfairly trashed by the critics. It's not up to the excellence of this summer's Wonder Woman film, but it's quite fun to watch. What made this film better than some of the other previous DCEU films is that it has a sense of humor. Previous films were rightfully criticized for being too dark and humorless. Gal Gadot is the stand out as Wonder Woman. This film did a better job in its portrayal with Superman. In Man of Steel, he battled Zod, which resulted in massive human casualties, without a care, which does not fit the character at all. That made me mad as a Superman fan. Here, he shows concern for innocent civilians, flying away with an entire building of people to make sure they would not be harmed in the battle against the villain. The one weak spot is the Big Bad, Steppenwolf. He's a rather fake looking CGI creation that lacks depth. But he's only the precursor to the REAL villain--Darkseid. The two end credit scenes are entertaining. The last one teasing the formation of the Legion of Doom\/ Injustice League is particularly intriguing.","id":"5a106496c3a3686286032952","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a106496c3a3686286032952","movie_id":141052}
{"author":"amanshroff","content":"**Our childhood superheroes all together !!**\r\n\r\n\r\nYet again a new DC installment from one of the most controversial directors of Hollywood Zack Snyder, who directed Man of Steel (2013) and Dawn of Justice (2016). The large of number of nerds around the globe are waiting for this from the childhood to see their favorite iconic heroes team up for the first time in Cinematic history. The basic plot of movie revolves around some deadly external threat wanting to conquer earth like every other CBM adaptations. The movie offers the same story as we see in most of the fandoms where a group of lonesome warriors come together to save earth.\r\n\r\n\u201cMen are still good\u201d, deeply inspired by the Superman, Batman has again gained his faith in humanity and wants to start working for it and saving it. The Batman continuing its investigation on what Lex Luthor was planning to do in Dawn in Justice. Diana and him are uniting some new members like Victor Stone Aka Cyborg and Arthur Curry aka Aquaman and Barry Allen aka Flash in order to find their potential for good and unite against common threats when the world need it.The movie shows how people who lives alone finds it hard to adjust among new people. One of most important part of the movie is The Superman in his full character development, and showing to audience that sometimes Superhero needs other Superheroes to save them, because at the end of the day everybody loves a classic DC story where \u201cSuperman saving everyone and beating the crap out of bad guys\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe performance of characters was good as the \u201cmaterial\u201d was given to them. Batman which is played by Ben Affleck in JL was a bit out of character unlike the previous ones i.e. in Dawn Of Justice where he was The Freaking Bat ,The Worst Knightmare. He was purest personification of Frank Miller\u2019s The Dark Knight, brutal, badass emotionless vigilante who everyone fears but in JL he was watered down too low and Yeah the guy smiles too. It may be horrifying to see Joker smiling but trust me its more horrifying to see Batman smiling . After her wonderful victory over RT Gal Gadot could do a lot better. Wonder Woman was kind of distracted and could not establish character as she did it in Dawn Of Justice and Wonder Woman,or may be we were expecting more. Cyborg who is a brilliant sportsman who lost his life after an accident. It was good to see Zack tried to show how life of normal human changes after horrifying accidents. The guy is in conflict with himself which is brilliantly played by Ray Fisher. Just like Ben Affleck Ezra miller too was first hated then became everyone\u2019s favorite kid in JL. His conversations brings the tone of movie somewhat lighter. Now we have king of Atlantis, He looks like Khal Drogo had a kid with some most beautiful mermaid. Thanks to Jason Momoa ,Aquaman is total badass unlike its previous versions . I don\u2019t want to spoil Superman but yeah Henry really nailed it.He finally became The Superman everybody wanted. His journey is complete. He knows why he is here, to save us all. We had another badass mortal on the team, He is Alfred portrayed Sir. Jeremy Irons. Actually we are not in a position to judge Sir Jeremy but yeah he was one of the best parts you will love in JL. We saw his sassy quick-witted talk with Bruce. You may find the movie is not catchy ,may be this was result of messed up situation where Zack Snyder left the movie due to his personal problems and put it in hands of other director Joss Whedon. Those two are totally different in their approaches so it resulted in such situation.\r\n\r\nAlthough you may find a lot of negativity about this movie like previous DC films, because one of the things that audience forgets that DC characters are very dark unlike their contrary Marvel whose characters are cheesy and kind of funny, their stories and plots revolve around words like Hope , Justice and humanity not like Shawarma or Devil\u2019s Anus jokes .This is a average movie not an Avengers movie. One thing I want to say that they kind of rushed to create a team up rather than Solo movies of Characters. This kinds of things  makes hard for audience to adjust as they don\u2019t bond with DC characters as easily they do with Marvel one\u2019s. The CGI was somewhat down as compared to other CBM\u2019s and could have been a lot better. \r\n\r\n\r\n_Overall_, the movie will attract you if you see it as first team up not if you compare with other ones. This DC movie is worth watching.","id":"5a5c6f4b925141323e00794e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a5c6f4b925141323e00794e","movie_id":141052}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Jungle, is not a place for humans anymore as thousands of years ago!**\r\n\r\nA much better, in fact, one of the best biopic about the survival in the wilderness. It is an Australian film about a young Israeli named Yossi, who went for a trekking in the Bolivian jungle with three others, but had got lost and fought for survival. It's 1981, the rainy season is just a corner away, but the four went to find a lost Indian village. After everybody got separated, the remain story told from Yossi's perspective, how he faced the nature's challenges to keep alive and make safely to the human civilisation.\r\n\r\nThe film was very good compared to what the trailer and teaser hinted out. Radcliffe is getting better with his every new film. With performance like this, surely everybody would accept him in the coming days. So we could see him in big projects, in big roles. Good writing and direction, but it was based on the biographical book of the same name. The film was entirely shot in Australia, but you can witness the real South American atmosphere. Something what bothered me was, Yossi an ex army man, so this kind of survival skills is taught in the army camps, yet he was scared and struggle like a normal person. Overall, it is a good film to go for it.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"5a7709c6925141059a0456da","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a7709c6925141059a0456da","movie_id":390062}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"The Yossi Ghinsberg Survival!\r\n\r\nJungle is directed by Greg McLean and adapted to screenplay by Justin Monjo from the book written by Yossi Ghinsberg. It stars Daniel Radcliffe, Joel Jackson, Alex Russell and Thomas Kretschman. Music is by Johnny Klimek and cinematography by Stefan Duscio.\r\n\r\nFilm is the retelling of real incidents when in 1981 Israeli adventure Yossi Ghinsberg entered deep into the Amazon Rainforest and found hell waiting for him.\r\n\r\nPeople keep doing it, these adventure types going into treacherous Mother Nature territory to explore and discover the untapped world - only to find misery, while some are never seen again. Greg McLean mixes adventure and horror perfectly, which when coming from the director of Wolf Creek and Rogue comes as no surprise. It's standard formula in narrative drive, man meets new friends in beautiful surrounds, it's all very jolly and daring, and off they go in search of wonderment. \r\n\r\nOf course, as is often the case, these stories can sometimes end in utter distress, Ghinsberg was a very lucky fellow to come out alive and tell his amazing story, which is in turn compelling and excellently performed by the cast. As problems begin to surface, the group dynamic begins to facture, with one particular character highly dubious in motives intent. The terrain gets steadily worse, then they got to eat of course, and as bodies begin to wane, decisions on a survival course of action take precedence. Then it's over to high peril for Ghinsberg who has to try and salvage body and mind in the hope that he might somehow escape his jungle nightmare.\r\n\r\nOnce the pic turns its entire focus on Ghinsberg's solitude, things become a little repetitive and much of the chilling danger begins to ebb away. Yet we are willing him to survive, to stay hooked in as we grasp for a semblance of good news to come out of an otherwise dark tale. Clearly from Ghinsberg's perspective, the real man himself, there was a yearning to be a better man, for better or worse, but the film is a little out of focus for an in depth portrayal of Yossi, with this blend of survival horror and characterisation not quite working. That said though, this still comes as highly recommended viewing, as does further reading on the incidents featured here. For come the closing credits, as real people are shown in photos, and their actual fates written in type, you know there has been no titillation here. 7.5\/10","id":"5d57c077bc865777712c7235","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d57c077bc865777712c7235","movie_id":390062}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A tale of two motorcycle cops!**\r\n\r\nI haven't seen the 70s series from where this film got inspired by. But before that, I had in my mind that it could be a remake of 'Electra Glide in Blue'. Anyway, it was directed and starred in one of the main roles by Dax Shepard. His direction job is not going anywhere. Though all his so far attempts are appreciable. In this film, it was Michael Pena, who led the rest of the characters. He'd done similar roles in other films like 'End of Watch'. But literally, he ruled it by sidelining everybody else in the film, including Dax.\r\n\r\nTwo motorcycle highway patrol cops team up. They are not an ideal match for the job, but they are assigned in that way by their superior. One of them was an ex-motorcycle stuntman and the other one who had lost his partner recently. They begin to investigate a highway robbery that leads them in the right direction. But can they handle those gangmen who have overpowered them in many ways is what brings twist, before ending with a big action sequence.\r\n\r\nA stylish cop flick and a quality presentation, but messed up by its screenplay. The story had a purpose, but the film scenes looked not arranged properly in order. There are many unnecessary scenes, just to bring some comedies. Yeah, some of them were really fun, but the film overwhelmed by bad jokes and random action sequences. The actors were good, though it was only the lead two who were the bright spot in the narration. If you forget all the logics, you could enjoy it. It serves a decent entertainment.

Great voice acting, great songs without having the burden of exposition via song that you find in the more musical ventures by Disney.  I loved that you could see genuine guitar chords being played, so often in live action films the playing of musical instruments, especially guitar are poorly faked.  None of that in this animated gem.\r\n\r\nOne thing I personally loved was the depiction of Mexican culture.  Although I really enjoyed _Moana_, I thought it was a little bit too much of a pastiche of multiple Pacific cultures when it should have just picked one (Maori) and stuck with it.  _Coco_ celebrates Mexican culture, and depicts it well.

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Something certainly rings true in the horror thriller **It** that capitalizes on that common known fear that clowns are creepy annoyances to those that have an intense phobia towards them. In the case of **It\u2019s** dastardly powder-faced joyboy or shall we say corrosive killjoy Pennywise the Dancing Clown, he definitely takes the cake in terms of his treacherous tendencies to quiet the unsuspecting kiddies in devious fashion. Here is a tip, parents, do not invite the poisonous Pennywise to your kids\u2019 birthday party any time soon to blow up balloons and sing songs. This is just a friendly little warning. There is more to elaborate on regarding the sicko circus funnypants freak later.\r\n\r\nDirector Andy Muschietti (\u2018Mama\u2019) delves into this surprisingly delicious twisted and terrorizing tale of a killer clown that gets his jollies off snuffing the lives out of rural-based youngsters in this calculating frightfest that pushes all the right buttons of panic and perversion. Skilfully edgy and traumatically tasty, **It** is a refreshing throwback to old-fashioned gory-minded gems where the boundaries of old-fashioned scare tactics were designed not only by the actual act of homicidal happenings but the mere suggestive nature of the heinous hedonism taking place. Polished and gripping in its shadowy and shifty overtones, **It** is convincingly probing as an absorbing psychological character study with an off-kilter sense of defiance in its naughty commentary on youthful innocence being compromised.\r\n\r\nBased on the novel from famed hair-raising author Stephen King, **It** delivers the solid, sordid goods of a wild and wicked imagination following the acidic exploits of a menacing clown in the aforementioned Pennywise (played with penetrating  and devilish aplomb by Bill Skarsgard from \u2018Atomic Blonde\u2019) whose murderous methods of slaughtering the young has been a staple signature in his madness for centuries now. The surviving tykes in the quaint town of Derry, Maine must now safeguard themselves from the makeup-wearing whackjob and figure out a way to terminate the baggy-panted beast before he continues to strike again and victimize another doomed child.\r\n\r\nThe backstory behind Pennywise\u2019s existence is that he is some shape-shifting demon that emerges from the sewers only to target the unlucky rugrat in his immediate path while conniving, and conducting his blood-thirsty ways. However, there are a group of children that refuse to play dead for the demented clown and the quest to create an ill-advised showdown with the deplorable Pennywise would prove to be a very violent and mentally scarring experience in the process.\r\n\r\nThe story centres around young Bill (Jaeden Lieberher, \u2018Allegiant\u2019) and his early encounter with the sadness of unknowingly witnessing Pennywise\u2019s wrath as it was inferred that the clown had to do with the demise of his precious little brother, George (Jackson Robert Scott), who never returned after enthusiastically wanting to work on a fun project in the basement. This haunting revelation sticks with poor Bill until this very day.\r\n\r\nNowadays, Bill must cope with the typical obstacles at school avoiding bullies and dealing with the pitfalls of peer pressure and needing to belong to a group of trusty associates. Thus, Bill is able to cement close relationships with the town\u2019s other free-spirited youngsters. Still, there is that hovering myth about the mysterious sewers and, yes, the evil-minded Pennywise is at the forefront of fearful concern for Bill and the bunch. In fact, the gang will succumb to their collection of fears, paranoia and hesitation as the suburban legend of the creep-seeking clown clouds each of the kids\u2019 tainted psyches.\r\n\r\nThe ensemble of young actors in **It**  all register accordingly with their characters\u2019 childhood shock in trying to overcome the overwhelming and petrifying mindset that has invaded their sensibilities. Lieberher has an authentic raw turn as the lead lad invested in the bizarre boundaries of matching wits with the demonic chalk-skinned trickster and his committed craziness. The other supporting cast of exposed kiddies on this adventurous train wreck of terror includes Sophia Lillis (\u201937\u2019), Finn Wolfhard (from television\u2019s \u2018Stranger Things\u2019), Jeremy Ray Taylor (\u2018Alvin And The Chipmunks: The Road Chip\u2019), Wyatt Oleff (\u2018Guardians Of The Galaxy\u201d), Chosen Jacobs, Jack Dylan Grazer (\u2018Tales Of Halloween\u2019) and Nicholas Hamilton (\u2018Captain Fantastic\u2019).\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Skarsgard\u2019s clown of corrosion in Pennywise steals the show with his nefarious nature blistering shamelessly in seedy-minded elation. Clearly, Skarsgard chews the tarnished scenery with his abominable costumed cretin tip toeing on the unassuming sidelines while striking gory goosebump moments for his pubescent prey on screen and the twitchy audience off screen.\r\n\r\nSure, **It** suffers from the conventional trappings of cheesy false alarm jolts and the obligatory lurking in the dark sequences are arbitrarily tossed in as an aftermath for the legitimate lunacy of our star-making crazed and corruptible clown to perform his showboating insanity. Besides, what horror showcase has not welcomed the invitation of the overused and abused jump-scare techniques highlighted by a jittery soundtrack? Still, Muschietti and screenwriters Chase Palmer, Cary Joji Funkunga and Gary Dauberman manage to supply the infectious and insidious **It** with well-executed scary shenanigans, well-paced anxiety, wavering vulnerability and decent acting on behalf of the performers that aptly brought to life the eerie visions and vitality of King\u2019s complex, creative mind.\r\n\r\nTruly **It** is one of the best harrowing and in-depth horror\/psychological thrillers to emerge in 2017. Also this titillating tale of cautionary kiddie chaos may be one of King\u2019s formidable movie adaptions since the effective tension-filled, off-the-wall brilliance of 1990\u2019s _Misery_.    \r\n\r\n**It** (2017)\r\n\r\nWarner Bros.

Stephen King's _It_ is one of my all time favourite books, and I don't know that it will ever get a faithful adaptation (totally understandable seeing as the thing is 1200 pages and contains a multi-book spanning mythology of Space Gods and Turtle vomit), but this does a pretty good job of interpreting the feeling of the novel, even if it's not a great adaptation the events as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe kids are all great, Skarsg\u00e5rd makes for a good Pennywise, Pennywise improves as the piece moves forward, and the town is completely believable as \"Derry\" in the '80s.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**It's always family first in the apocalyptic world!**\r\n\r\nIt was not what I was expecting, enjoyed it though. The trailer, the posters hints something else. So I thought it could be a horror, but it was even a terror or a thriller flick. Well, there were a few occasions where it was edgy, though in the most of the film nothing really happened. Slow but not boring. A simple storyline, limited cast and a apocalyptic theme. Surely you would have seen hundreds of this kind, so when you watch it, you won't find anything new out of it. Then remains the question, is it any worth!\r\n\r\nI liked a simple take. Just like the film 'The Survivalist'. A small family living in an isolated place, but very precautious about any outside threat. The world is infected with an unknown disease and people are dying everywhere. Recently they had buried one of their family members. So they are not taking any chances with anyone. But now after a terrifying encounter, another family joins them and how things go on from there are the rest of the tale to tell us with a small twist.\r\n\r\nWell, you won't see Joel Edgerton doing a solo film often. But this was a different, because of a small budget and the kind of narration. He did good and so the rest his co-stars. Firstly, it was not a horror film. Then there were a few intentional scenes to scare the viewers, but it wasn't anywhere near to scary. I've watched the whole film and I still don't know what comes at night. Dreams? Nightmares? Looks that's what it implies. Other than that it is a drama film with a little thrill. It can be watched nothing more than once.\r\n\r\n**6\/10**","id":"5a1ebf44c3a3680b8d07a922","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a1ebf44c3a3680b8d07a922","movie_id":418078}

{"author":"accioconnor","content":"It is a movie that looked interesting, but I wasn't necessarily anticipating, because it had the potential to be awful. After seeing it, I can say that while it is good, I don't think it's nearly as good as other people are saying it is, and it had the potential to be. Starting off with the good, the film has some fantastic performances from the kids. I think the best performances in the film are from Andy Skaarsgard (or however you spell it) for Pennywise, and the kid who had asthma. I don't know his name, and I haven't seen him in anything before, but he stole the show. The movie also has some pretty scary moments. The scene inside of the house is one of the scariest scenes of the year, and there are lost of images that were genuinely disturbing. While the films was full of cheesy dialogue, the conversations between the kids are extremely entertaining and captivating. When it came to characters, MOST of the characters are well done and fleshed out. And that leads me to one of the 4 things that keep this film from being great in my eyes. Some characters, such as the bullies and Stan, and bland and have no back story. Therefore, whenever they are put in danger, it isn't nearly as scary as with other characters. Another reason I didn't love this film is the rock fight scene. Basically, the Losers Club stumbles upon the bullies and they throw rocks at each other. The rocks seemingly bounce off of their head without any problems like a trampoline. No one gets killed, or even knocked out. Overall, it was a very bad scene. For the most part the special effects were pretty good. However, the leper outside of the creepy house was awful. The costume would be great if it were for a haunted house or prank, but not for a big budgeted horror movie. When it came on screen I literally thought it was a bully playing tricks on him. And the last problem I have with the film is that the police are seemingly nowhere, along with parents. *Mild spoilers* One of the bullies murders his dad, a police officer, and then around a few scenes later, the son dies too. The bullies like to go around thereatening kids with knives and carving H's into their bellies. I think we would see at least one police officer investegating something in the film, and if not, I think my parents would notice if one day I came home and there was a gigantic blood pool on my shirt. Overall, It is a very fun movie. There are certainly better movies out there, but with this, I have an urge to go watch it again in theaters. It is a perfectly fun popcorn flick.\r\n\r\nScore: 7.5\/10","id":"59d3d70bc3a36844e10033bf","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59d3d70bc3a36844e10033bf","movie_id":346364}
{"author":"Gimly","content":"I don't need happy endings in my movies. A downer ending is often what makes a movie great. But I do like satisfactory ones. _It Comes at Night_ did not give that to me. Mystery is often its own reward, and I do believe that's what writer\/director Trey Edward Shults was going for here, but it didn't wind up hit that resonant for me. This particular movie felt like it wasn't about the journey, it was about the destination, and we essentially didn't get one.\r\n\r\nJoel Edgerton is fantastic of course, but any one of the other actors could have been as well, we'll never know because they were never given that opportunity.

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Decent enough, but not a patch on Haigh's previous work_**\r\n \r\n> _I feel everything I do is related to that sense of loneliness and that longing to not be alone. I think all of us spend most of our time feeling alone and we find ways to disguise our loneliness - whether it's relationships, a job or whatever it is - because we know that our central state of being is probably to feel alone. For this story that's especially true: Charley spends a lot of time running away, he leaves the frame and disappears. I think we're constantly battling with loneliness, finding things that make us feel bet__ter, striving for things that we think are going to make us happy and then when they fail to do so, striving for the next thing to try and repeating the process over and over. It's just our basic biological need that keeps us going._\r\n\r\n- Andrew Haigh; \"_Lean On Pete_: In Conversation With Filmmaker Andrew Haigh\"; _Candid_ (May 5, 2018)\r\n\r\n15-year-old Charley Thompson (Charlie Plummer) lives with his father, Ray (Travis Fimmel), who is drinking himself into an early grave. Finding work caring for an ageing racehorse named Lean on Pete, Charley is devastated when he learns that Pete's owner, Del Montgomery (Steve Buscemi), is planning to slaughter the animal. Determined to save his friend, Charley steals Pete, and the two set out on an odyssey across the modern American frontier.\r\n\r\nFans of writer\/director Andrew Haigh will know his unassailable talent for what one might label unsentimental emotionalism; his films deal with intensely emotional situations without lapsing into Speilbergian fawnishness. And, although compared to the excellent _Weekend_ (2011), and the masterful _45 Years_ (2015), _Lean on Pete_ is a touch melodramatic, Haigh's talent for allowing character and theme to rise organically to the surface through quiet moments of introspection is still very much to the fore. So why not a higher score? Adapted from Willy Vlautin's 2010 novel of the same name, the biggest problem with the film is that things are laid on too thick; Charley is very much a Job figure, and suffers such a litany of misfortunes that one fully expects him to be diagnosed with terminal cancer. Similarly, the pseudo-allegorical nature of the characters he encounters is too on-the-nose for the realistic _milieu_ Haigh has crafted. Part state-of-the-nation address, part _bildungsroman_, it's worth a look, but is ultimately lacking a satisfying thematic through-line.","id":"5cb2f073c3a36808a2ac89d1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cb2f073c3a36808a2ac89d1","movie_id":407890}

{"author":"jessetaylor","content":"Alongside _Weekend_ and _Moonlight_, _Call Me By Your Name_ is the greatest queer film I have seen in the past ten years. It's a gorgeous, quiet masterwork - Luca Guadagnino has given us something truly special here. I'll cherish this one for a long, long time as it's extremely human and very personal. The fact that the legendary James Ivory wrote the screenplay for this shoots this over the top and slam dunks it into the cinematic stratosphere. Truly stunning work that deserves to be remembered, preserved, and celebrated for decades to come.\r\n\r\nThe performances in this are so mesmerizing. I've never liked Armie Hammer as much as I like him in this. He really embodies his character and it's a lived in, fully realized performance. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet - who has a great year ahead of him with other big projects - is absolutely captivating as the young lead in this coming-of-age tale. I've seen many a coming-of-age film, but this one is one of the truest portrayals of a gay youth coming to terms with his sexuality, emotions, and his own body.\r\n\r\nThere are so many phenomenal scenes, but the one that stands out above the rest - and the one that made me cry in a theatre full of festivalgoers - is Michael Stuhlbarg's final monologue. It's one of the most honest and real moments I've seen in any film and one of the best father and son moments too. Crossing my fingers so hard that this becomes a huge critical darling and garners some attention come awards time (specifically for Guadagnino, Ivory, Chalamet, and Stuhlbarg).\r\n\r\nOh, and bonus points for that final shot of Chalamet's face as the credits roll. It's the best of its kind since Glazer's _Birth_ in 2004 when Nicole Kidman shattered all of our souls.

The movie itself was not. In fact \"Cage Dive\" is trying to cash in using the Open Water title. This film had nothing to do with the Chris Kentis film. In fact it is similar in nature to \"47 Meters Down\" instead. Basically a small group of unlikable unrealistic friends decide to make an audition video for an extreme survivor type reality program. They decide to fly from Los Angeles to Australia for shark diving. Still with me? It gets dumber from here. Predictably the boat is capsized and everyone is dumped into the ocean. Various people die from either the accident or from shark attacks. One of the members of the group finds a flare and winds up killing someone in a raft due to her own petty and selfish nature. The flare accident was just that.

{"author":"tmdb44054871","content":"What can I say about this movie? Let's see here. For starters it should not have been titled Open Water 3. That was the distributors attempt as a quick cash grab. This movie has zero things to do with the original. None of the characters were likeable and the mistakes made could have easily been avoided. I found the film to have been both boring and predictable. Not to mention unoriginal. I felt that a lot of the scenes were plain and simple ripped off from other films and poorly edited together. The idea of shark cage diving and then having the cage to malfunction was last seen in \"47 Meters Down\" which was imho iffy in it's own right. The video\/dvd box looks similar to Jaws with the GSW rising to the surface and the cage sinking well see my earlier comment about 47 Meters. The ending was also unoriginal, boring, and poorly acted. The sharks however did seem okay. CGI might make things a little easier in the editing room but it is not easy to get them right. I'd avoid this stinker at all costs. You're better off to screen the original.","id":"5e8a9aa9d363e50015b7cb66","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e8a9aa9d363e50015b7cb66","movie_id":420707}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A mystery surrounding a girl's death.**\r\n\r\nAn Australia's murder mystery set in a small town. The film was based on the novel of the same name. Starred by the next generation Aussie actors like Levi Miller and Angourie Rice. But the film was not what I had expected. Just okayish. Not at first glance I liked it, because I thought it was a little out of common sense, even from the kid's perspective. I don't blame the entire film, but the opening. Too intentional and right away jumped into the suspense.\r\n\r\nThis is a children's film, the story of teenagers, and a mystery surrounding the death of a girl. After the unconvinced start, not even the end brought any consolation. Though it could have been for just me. That's what I felt. So according to me, only the mid parts held the film for me to look for something in the later. All it had was the wonder characters and the storyline. The rest of the film failed to stretch with the best developments. Definitely a good tale for literature, but for a film, to witness everything on the visuals, it needed more detail. Only if it had depth, I would have found it a better film.\r\n\r\nThe story that happened in the holiday week that comes between the Christmas and the New Year. In a fictional Aussie town called Corrigan, a young Charlie was approached by Jasper in the middle of the night. Later he comes to know Jasper's girlfriend has been murdered. Now they are set to find who did it and why bofore the athorities do! The following days are crucial for both of them as the whole town is terrified by the incident. When the time comes to the truth, the secrets were revealed just before the film's end.\r\n\r\n> -xX] You're just like her, your mother. You're peas in a pod, you two. [Xx-\r\n\r\nThere was a little distraction like the Vietnam war, racism. All the above, the character Jasper Jones seemed an imagination of Charlie. Because of his secret appearance, but that did not last long. Yet the murder mystery always stayed top of the film topic. When the end revealed everything, that reminded me the films of 60-70 years ago. The timeline for this film too was in the same period, precisely 1969. The locations were awesome, the cinematography should be appreciated.\r\n\r\nI thought the Jeffrey was an under-used or unrequired character, until the cricket match scene that's dedicated to him. Following it, what happened to his family was a nice flow of the story. Charlie's family too, the issue of the parents, crisis is their marriage. As I said, the film had ingredient, but did not cook properly. The reviewers, the film critics comparing it to some of the classics like 'To Kill a Mockingbird' to 'Stand By Me'. But I would say, it is too late to come to get equal status of those films. It was just an above average, but if it came in the 80s or 90s, surely would have been a gem and changed the Australian filmdom.\r\n\r\nDespite the film title, the story was narrated by Charlie, the one who developed an unexpected relation in the most extreme situation with Jasper Jones. Apart from one worst week of his life, he also finds his first love. A coming-of-age film, worth a watch, but no doubt that it should have better. Not sure if the majority would like it or dislike it, but it is once watchable film. Finally, it got nominated for the Australian Academy Awards for this year (2017) in six categories, sadly it had won nothing. I hope that should not be a reason for you to skip it!\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"5a770a480e0a26643c04a190","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a770a480e0a26643c04a190","movie_id":414027}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**He wants to return to his glory days!**\r\n\r\nAnother boxing film and this time its from Britain. Seems a small scale film. Most part of the film was a drama. But the entire final act was the event what everyone had waited for. Like any boxing film, it had the same story that a struggling boxer wants to get back to his professional position and he's intended to do anything for it.\r\n\r\nThe pre-developments were a perfect setting for the what comes in the latter. More than that, a fine base laid for a sequel. This film was average, to me, but its open ending could take it to an even better level in his next. Because of the platform, it could become a small 'Rocky' series, if the filmmakers are willing to go that length. Besides, the title name was an ideal one for such sport.\r\n\r\nAn ex-boxing sensation seeks his return to the ring after losing everything in the life. Recovering from alcoholic, the age is not on his side to get his glory back. No one is supportive. All he has is his firm mindset. But can he do it, especially the professional level challenge is being far fetched, what are all his other options and how far he would go are the remaining story to tell us.\r\n\r\nAn okay film for a first time director. The cast looked okay too, and so the screenplay, even though built from a very familiar background. It tried its best to get the viewers sympathically with its main character. But not everyone gets that emotional appeal as he struggles. Particularly the final fight was guessable its direction.

{"author":"Jay","content":"Seeing Jane Goodall speak years ago in Portland was one the best speeches I\u2019ve witnessed. Viewing this movie really brought that back into the front of my memory and had me tearing up during the first third of this documentary. What Jane Goodall did is nothing short of miraculous. As a young woman with no formal education in this area of study, she really gave no fucks and pursued her dream. Her determination to succeed in spite of the odds became a passion even before she realized her true purpose in Gombe. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m not one to have idols but if I did she would be one. So goddamn inspiring in so many ways.\r\n\r\nThis doc is essentially rediscovered found footage from 2014 that was shot during the 60s when Goodall first went to Africa to study the chimps and what that was like and how challenging it was. So from this \u201clost\u201d footage the filmmakers had to construct a narrative, which becomes the story of Goodall\u2019s life from childhood to present day, including her marriage to Hugo and raising her son around apes. Half of this film works extremely well. The other half is typical biography filler to round out her story. The average rating between these two parts is 8\/10. I\u2019d prefer to watch more of her time with the chimps, what was learned from this experience and how she was able to share that with the world.","id":"5a6622b7c3a3685717000099","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a6622b7c3a3685717000099","movie_id":470819}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Disappointingly shallow_**\r\n\r\n> _In Germany, we have serious issues with the rise of neo-Nazis, and how they've - neo-Nazis and racists - now reached the centre of society. In the Nineties, you could see the enemy. They were skinheads, and they were idiots, and violent. But what are they wearing now? What do they look like and how do they talk? Now, they are very smart. We had the so-called NSU killings. Between 2000 and 2007, a group of three neo-Nazis, two men and one woman, killed ten people. Nine immigrants - eight with Turkish or Kurdish background, one with Greek background - and one_ _German police officer. And until 2011, the police, the society, and the press thought these murders were done by the Turkish mafia. Just because the victims were all killed with the same gun, and they were Turkish, people said, \"_These must have been drug dealers, or they must have something to do with prostitution_.\" That's the racism of the society. In November 2011, it came out that these killings were done by this group. And it came out by random - not because of a successful police investigation._\r\n\r\n- Fatih Akin; \"'I Will Get Attacked for It, But F*ck That': Fatih Akin on _In the Fade_, Diane Kruger, and Neo-Nazis\" (Bilge Ebiri); _Village Voice_ (January 2, 2018)\r\n\r\nFatih Akin, the writer and director of _Aus dem nichts_ [lit. trans. _From Nothing_] is a political individual; he makes political films and he makes political statements in his personal life. Akin identifies as a German-Turk; he was born in Hamburg, but his parents are both Turkish, having come to Germany with the first wave of Turkish immigrants following the _Wirtschaftswunder_ of the fifties and sixties. He lives and works in Germany, and although almost all of his films are set there (the notable exception is _The Cut_), and all have German-funding, he considers himself a Turkish filmmaker. When he won Best Screenplay for _Auf der anderen Seite_ at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, he accepted the award \"_on behalf of Turkish cinema_.\" Easily the best known\/most notorious of his political statements, however, was in 2006 when he was photographed wearing a t-shirt with the word \"BU\u5350H\" on it (the \"S\" replaced by a swastika). Displaying a swastika in public is against the law in Germany, and after a complaint was made, he was investigated (but not charged) by German police. He later defended the shirt, stating,\r\n\r\n> _Bush's policy is comparable with that of the Third Reich. I think that under Bush, Hollywood has been making certain films at the request of the Pentagon to normalise things like torture and Guant\u00e1namo. I'm convinced the Bush administration wants a third world war. I think they're fascists [...] You can apply irony to something like that. You can redefine the symbol in a politically correct horizon. My T-shirt is more than mere provocation. You have to look into the context. The swastika is not there on its own, but as part of the word 'BUSH.' One would have to be pretty stupid, not to understand that._\r\n\r\nIn short, this is not a guy afraid to speak his mind.\r\n\r\nAkin's main political preoccupation in his filmography, however, is not Nazism or American presidents, it's the experience of Turkish immigrants in Germany, specifically the racism often directed towards them, racism which is oftentimes found masquerading as patriotism. It is unknown how many Turks are actually in Germany, as the German census doesn't allow people to record their ethnicity, but as of 2011, there were 2.7 million inhabitants with at least one Turkish parent. However, academic estimates suggest there be as many as 7 million Turks, or people identifying as Turks, in the country. Now, with that many people of a different nationality in a country, problems are going to arise (just ask the British), and this is where Akin focuses a great deal of his energies. Everything from _Solino_ (2002) to _Gegen die Wand_ (2004) to _Auf der anderen Seite_ (2007) to _Soul Kitchen_ (2009) has political DNA derived from the experience of racism in Germany.\r\n\r\nSo, with that in mind, _Nichts_ (co-written with Hark Bohm) doesn't jump off the page as a typical Akin film - when former convicted drug dealer Nuri Sekerci (Numan Acar) and his son are killed in a bomb blast at his office, his wife Katja (Diane Kruger) has faith that the police and courts will find and punish those responsible. However, as Katja finds herself becoming more and more disillusioned with the systems which are supposed to be on her side, she comes to believe she must take things into her own hands. Read like that, this could be any number of bad Hollywood movies (F. Gary Gray's wonderfully risible _Law Abiding Citizen_ (2009) springs to mind). However, when we include the fact that Nuri is Turkish, and that the police quickly come to suspect the bombing may have been connected to a Neo-Nazi group, it fits much more comfortably into his _oeuvre_. Unfortunately, it's not very good.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the film is rigidly divided into an intentionally artificial three-act structure, with each act given its own title (\"The Family\", \"The Trial\", and \"The Sea\") and introduction by way of home-movie footage. One of the most significant problems with the film is that the acts simply don't yoke. The first is a pretty decent study of grief, the second is a rather dull courtroom drama, and the third is a bizarrely hollow (and irritatingly repetitive) investigation into the morality of revenge. The last act mirrors the first in its use of slow pacing, long shots of people not doing very much, and sparse dialogue (as opposed to the very wordy second act), and while this is interesting in setting the narrative up in the first act, it falls flat in the third, as the whole thing ends up coming across as rather po-faced and self-important; a film convinced of its own profundity. For all that, however, up until the conclusion, I was thinking I would give it three stars; it's entertaining enough, in a fairly disposable way. But then the bottom falls out. The last scene itself is actually pretty good. It's what happens next that irritated me.\r\n\r\nThis has not been an especially political film - the Neo-Nazi storyline barely features; a few mentions by police in the first act, a single scene in the second, and a couple of short scenes in the third. That's it. As Katja is the only character who is really given any degree of agency, the Neo-Nazi characters are little more than background extras (in fact, in some scenes, they are _literally_ background extras). So this is not a film which spends a lot of time delving into issues of racism in Germany or offering insight into the rise of Right-Wing Populism across Europe. It's a revenge drama. However, as it ends, a legend appears on-screen informing the audience how many race crimes are committed against Turks in Germany each year. The film has absolutely not, by any stretch of the imagination, earned the right to preach to the audience in this way. It's almost as if Akin forgot he was trying to make something political, only remembering in time to throw together a vaguely worded statement on the sufferings of his people in an effort to give the audience something to think about. It doesn't work, with the statement serving only to trivialise the issue by trying to tie it to a film in which it barely featured, and it leaves a decidedly bitter aftertaste.","id":"5cc1746c9251412577fd0b6b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cc1746c9251412577fd0b6b","movie_id":423646}
{"author":"TreesOfEternity","content":"**Warning: Spoilers**\r\n\r\nLet me start off by saying this film is not about terrorists striking in the US but about home grown terrorist in Germany, specifically Hamburg. It is there that Katja (Diane Kruger) is married to Kurdish immigrant Nuri Sekerci (Numan Acar). The pair also have a 5 year old son named Rocco. Nuri runs a business that helps new immigrants translate various documents to help them and one day Katja drops off their son there while she visits with one of her friends. As she leaves she bumps into a young woman who left her bike nearby unchained.\r\n\r\nAs she returns home that evening she finds the road she takes past the office blocked off and flashing police lights illuminating the buildings. Stopping she gets out of the car and runs to find the office building blown apart. Someone has exploded a bomb outside and both Nuri and Rocco were instantly killed.\r\n\r\nKatja is torn by the event and is doing all she can not to lose control. Her friend and parents come to stay with her and keep an eye on her. Going out one night she contacts her friend and lawyer and he provides her with drugs she takes to deal with her inner pain, drugs one of his clients left. The lawyer worked for both her and Nuri, helping when years before when Nuri was a drug dealer. Having a child changed all that and Nuri and Katja had remained clean for years.\r\n\r\nShe tells the police all about the girl she saw and the investigation moves forward. But rather than dig for the truth the police seem more focused on Nuri as an immigrant and potential terrorists himself. Noting his past record they check the house out and find her drugs but the officer in charge lets her off the hook. Still, their focus remains on Islamic terrorists ignoring the description of the girl she gave them. Until someone else gives her up.\r\n\r\nIt turns out the pair responsible for the bombing were neo-Nazis, Andr\u00e9 (Ulrich Brandhoff) and Edda M\u00f6ller (Hanna Hilsdorf). With evidence in hand the prosecutor charges them and the trial proceeds. This becomes a fascinating part of the film showing how differently the cases are handled there than here. Each day Katja must face the discussion of the deaths of her loved ones, certain in her own mind that these were the two that destroyed her family.\r\n\r\nThe question rises as the trial progresses just how far the defense is willing to go. All of the past is brought up to steer the focus away from the defendants. The defense also makes an attempt at discounting the evidence that was found in the home of Andr\u00e9's father, the man responsible for calling in the police and leading to their arrest. It isn't certain whether this line of defense will play out in favor of the defendants or in favor of Katja. But finding justice and finding revenge are two different things to consider.\r\n\r\nThe movie is well made and acted with Kruger turning in yet another great performance. She is center stage here from start to finish, the entire film revolving are her character. This is a complex character not prone to hysterics all the time but unraveling due to her circumstances as the film progresses. Kruger makes her believable and the pain she releases is tangible at times.\r\n\r\nThe movie is definitely a depressing tale to follow and it moves along with ups and downs as it moves forward. And while Kruger does a tremendous job I felt it difficult to get involved too deep with the character and her predicament. Still it was an interesting film to watch and worth taking a look at.\r\n\r\nActing was A+, Human emotion was A+ but do not mix who is who with what is what for that Kurds are not Turks. If you read Greek history for the past 600 years, you know what is what. Bringing in the Nazis in this is just a way to distort viewers perception of what is evil.","id":"5b33cc54c3a368531a017faa","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b33cc54c3a368531a017faa","movie_id":423646}

{"author":"Sheldon Nylander","content":"Picking almost right where the previous film ended, \"John Wick Chapter 2\" deals with the consequences of Wick's return to the assassin life and how he got out to begin with.\r\n\r\nAs expected, it expands on the mythology hinted at in the first movie, with the revelation that there's a high council of sorts, other Continental hotels around the world, and a very widespread network of assassins.\r\n\r\nAlso as expected, it ups the ante with bigger action sequences, and a much higher body count. We get to know more about some rival assassins played quite brilliantly by Common and Ruby Rose (whose character communicates solely through sign language; in many cases, this kind of thing is used as a gimmick to make the audience remember a character when they have nothing else to distinguish them, but it's not the case here  and is used only as an aspect of the character; smartly done). Keanu Reeves...let's the Reeves of old come through a couple times, with a couple of bizarre and inappropriate inflections. Ian McShane's Winston expands a little bit, although he still refers to John as Jonathan, which is just wrong. If it's supposed to be some kind of an in-joke with them, they don't reveal anything about it. Again, I think there's more going on with Lance Reddick's hotel manager than they're letting on. And I was a little disappointed that Peter Stormare wasn't in more of the film, as he's always fun.\r\n\r\nAgain, the world is very wide, and almost seems like everyone is involved with this underworld. There is an indication that that's not the case here and there, but we never get to meet anyone who doesn't know what's going on, which keeps some of that suspicion up.\r\n\r\nThe plot follows a pretty basic structure. Actually, it follows a pretty rigid structure. In a two hour movie, it can be broken down almost exactly into half-hour sequences, something that struck me as a little odd. There are some minor plot twist. Nothing major or out of the blue, but at least there was an attempt.\r\n\r\nSo now we come down to it. Is it better or worse than the first movie? Well, I would have to say \"yes\". It definitely ups the ante and is a much bigger film than the first movie, expanding on the mythology and the characters. At the same time, it falls into the trap that a lot of these bigger, badder sequels fall into, which is that with the bigger scope, it feels like they have to use a bigger yoke on everything in order to keep in reined in and from going off the rails on its own. In fact, they may have expanded the world too quickly, going from a city in the first movie to the entire globe in the second. That rapid expansion makes that bigger yoke much more percpetible and, while the ambition is admirable, at times I wondered if they may have bitten off more than they could chew.\r\n\r\nStill an enjoyable action film, and if you liked the first film, you'll most likely enjoy this one.","id":"5d86b3a35a469000199b431e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d86b3a35a469000199b431e","movie_id":324552}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I was really hoping I would like this movie. I so enjoyed the first one. However, when the credits started to roll at the end I found myself wondering \u201cWhat the fuck happened?\u201d.\r\n\r\nBe warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.\r\n\r\nOne thing I really liked about the first movie was, as you can read in my review about that one,  that it was a no bullshit, kill the bad guys and no emotional regrets, kind of movie. John Wick went all out for revenge and at the same time we got introduced into this cool world of assassins, safe havens, hidden \u201cshops\u201d for guns, classy tailors providing bullet proof costumes etc. etc.\r\n\r\nIn this movie he is forced onto a job by a real asshole. He is constantly reluctant and walks around with a sad puppy face all the time. Of course said asshole screws him halfway through the movie and that would have been a good time to start get back on track with some decent payback story but unfortunately the script writers thought otherwise. After some more of the same shit no one really wins in the end (although one of the two adversaries suffer a more \u201cpermanent\u201d setback than the other).\r\n\r\nWorse is that, in my opinion, in their eager to put together some crap drama this movie essentially screwed up the possibilities for a John Wick 3 unless they pull some rather big surprise rabbit out of the hat for that one.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of action in the movie of course but also her I feel that it was a bit too over the top. No one, absolutely no one, seems to be able to shoot straight except for John Wick. This makes the action feel more like a parody a\u2019la Kill Bill than a more serious action, revenge movie. Yes it is cool to watch but only up to a point. Heck, if this would have been a Star Trek (TOS) episode Hollywood\u2019s entire supply of red shirts would have been used up on a single movie. While I am bitching I should perhaps also mention that the amount of beating that John Wick seems to be able to absorb is \u2026 unbelievable.\r\n\r\nI did enjoy the movie but not at all as much as I hoped I would. To me it has a completely different spirit than what I remember from the first one and the ending is, again to me at least, not a happy one.\r\n\r\nHaving said that the action sequences are as cool, crazy but cool, and violent as they are unbelievable. I found it a bit sad that they wrecked his nice car though.\r\n\r\nOverall a enjoyable movie but no match for the first chapter and I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 out of 5 stars.","id":"594e9c78c3a368329b040322","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/594e9c78c3a368329b040322","movie_id":324552}

Reeves isn't known for having an extremely wide range, but his devotion to making this movie a kick-ass martial arts production is second to none.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**All eyes on him and all guns pointed at him.**\r\n\r\nIt was not an attracting title for a sequel. The first film was good, completely an unexpected, but I was expecting this one, even though not as much as I was excited to see 'Jack Reacher 2'. That film was good, but did not meet with its first film's merit. And this sequel, really amazing. One of best follow-up flick and better than the original. That feat considered very rare in cinema and here is the one.\r\n\r\nEntirely different than the first. I meant the storyline. A new action, a new adventure, and even on a bigger scale. Though the initial parts were average. I totally disliked that killing assignment Mr. Wick took in his hand, but what followed after made the film great, definitely not to be missed for that alone. Especially if you are an ardent action film fan. For me, that reminded me 'Kill Bill', but they are not the same kind, except the fighting concept with hundreds.\r\n\r\nContinued from a couple of days later where the previous narration had ended. Now the retired assassin, John Wick forced to take a final job, but soon he finds he was backstabbed. Every eye on the town on him and every gun pointing at him, there's no way he could get out of it easily. So, he has to fight them all, just in order to survive. Then what comes later are even more aggressive screenplay that's ends with left open the door for the third film.\r\n\r\nNow this became a stylish franchise. That's what happens when a stuntman takes up the directional job for an action flick. He did not write it, but he knew exactly how to create them, technically perfectly. Besides, he got wonderful, dedicated actors to achieve that. Not just Reeves, but all were awesome. Believe the third film would be a kick-ass, particularly the pace that could match with likes 'Crank'. Just watch it already and be prepared for the next, the mega finale.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"59b1eb6bc3a3682c2208b51e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59b1eb6bc3a3682c2208b51e","movie_id":324552}

{"author":"RoidDroidVoid","content":"Bong Joon-ho has brought us yet another masterpiece.  Before viewing Okja, I was a little concerned that it would be just a sappy feel good family film about a kid that developed too much of an attachment to a farm animal.\r\nNow, I'm simply amazed at how Bong manages to always give us such emotionally and politically complicated films.\r\n\r\nIf you understand his style and knack for subtle commentary, then you will see this as another excellent film in the same vein as The Host.\r\n\r\nThe obvious commentary is clear but not overwhelming and the subtle bits are in true Bong style.  I think many may misinterpret some of his choices, particularly with Gyllenhaal's character and performance, but if you grasp Bong's social and political stances then you'll appreciate the choices.\r\nFor anyone who is unaware, all of Bong's movies contain certain elements.  There are the overt elements that include humor (sometimes within the least humorous of situations), suspense, emotional connection, the folly of man and a lack of responsibility on the part of a government or corporation.  But these elements are supported by subtle inclusions which are dotted throughout his movies like little watermarks and always serve to say the things that should be said without saying them.\r\nBesides these factors, and for those less inclined towards analytical movie watching, there is always a great story and magnificent cinematography.\r\nOkja is no exception.\r\nThe only disappointing aspect of this movie is that it just came out, I've already watched it and now I'll have to wait another 2-3 years for another Bong movie to enjoy.\r\nI have seen The Host at least 10 times and I could watch it again right now.  I'm certain to see Okja at least two more times with those with whom I enjoy seeing his movies and I don't think it'll feel like a chore either.\r\nIn my opinion, Bong is one of the most consistent filmmakers to have ever made a movie and that streak remains unbroken with Okja.","id":"595440c19251412ac704207b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/595440c19251412ac704207b","movie_id":387426}
{"author":"A-Dubya","content":"I was hoping for more. I thought it would delve further into her battles in the hip-hop world, and include more than just brief cameos of rap legends and icons (Biz Markie, MC Shan, Marley Marl, and a young NaS), but instead it turned into just a pseudo-bio\/male-bashing escapade. I enjoyed some parts about it, primarily the focus on her rap career, Roxanne's Revenge, and how she came up in the game, but a lot of the time, it felt like this film was something it wasn't advertised as. \r\n\r\nBeing a huge hip hop fan, mainly of the 80's and 90's, I was excited when i saw a biopic on Roxanne Shante. I'm a huge fan of NY hip hop from this era. I was disappointed when most of the film focused on her family struggles, and poor relationships (I would even say decisions too) with men. I knew there would be a backstory about her upbringing, but instead of really talking about the hip hop pioneer that she was, and maybe battles with KRS and others, it was like a 45 minute man-bashing flick veiled as a doc about a hip hop legend. Almost every male character is basically portrayed as abusive, manipulative, violent, or a sexual predator. The few males that somewhat have redeemable qualities are pushed aside, not to be focused on.  This trope is one that seems to be the norm far too often in films of the last few years. It is very annoying to me, and reeks of disillusion. Every male is not a creep, just as every female is not a saint in the real world. Even the last excerpt at the end of the film before the credits was so out of place, and didn't seem to fit anything other than an agenda to bash males for \"not handling their responsibilities, and bringing women flowers\". What this has to do with hip hop culture, or anything relevant, for that matter, is beyond me. \r\n\r\nIt could have been so much better, if it legitimately was about the career of Roxanne Shante, and her rise as a hip hop icon in the 80's. 2 door knocker ear rings out of 5.","id":"5ac431dfc3a3682db5042f1e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ac431dfc3a3682db5042f1e","movie_id":426257}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_What a shambles_** [contains spoilers]\r\n\r\n> Racer and the Jailbird _is a fictional tale of love and crime, of desire and failure. A love tragedy, or better, an_ Amour Noir_. I consider_ Racer and the Jailbird _to be the second part of my crime trilogy. Each part is freely based on a particular moment in Belgian criminal history. For_ Bullhead_, my source of inspiration was the hormone mafia. This time, I draw inspiration from notorious Brussels gangs and equally from the adrenaline driven world of auto racing. However, as was the case with_ Bullhead_,_ Racer and the Jailbird _will not be a_ _film about these gangs, nor a biography of one or another real-life gangster. The foundation of this story is the love between a man and a woman and the impossibility of actualising their relationship. Their love is thwarted not only by their characters and origins, but also by the blows that fate deals them._\r\n\r\n- Micha\u00ebl R. Roskam; \"Director's Statement\"; _Le Fid\u00e8le_ Press Kit\r\n\r\n_Le Fid\u00e8le_ [lit. trans. _The Faithful_] is an absolute mess of a film, and one of the most egregious examples I've ever encountered of a narrative systematically undermining and imploding in on top of itself, unable to bear the weight of a litany of clich\u00e9s, melodrama, and inexplicable decisions (on the part of both the filmmakers _and_ the characters). Imagine, if you will, an evil projectionist sitting in his projection booth trying to think of ways to be evil. He's not too imaginative, so about the only thing he can come up with is showing Michael Mann's _Heat_ (1995), and instead of the final reel of that film, the evil projectionist splices in the last reel of James L. Brooke's _Terms of Endearment_ (1983) or Gary Marshall's _Beaches_ (1988). The incongruity between the first 90 or so minutes of _Fid\u00e8le_ and the last half-hour is no less jolting or ridiculous, as the script inexplicably morphs from a heist movie into a pseudo disease-of-the-week based tearjerker that is so bad, yet so earnest, so enraptured with itself and convinced of its own profundity, I kept expecting Kirk Cameron to pop up.\r\n\r\nHowever, that things should have turned out this way is by no means a given. Written by Thomas Bidegain, No\u00e9 Debr\u00e9, and Micha\u00ebl R. Roskam, and directed by Roskam, the filmmakers have an impressive enough pedigree to promise much. Bidegain is best known for his collaborations with Jacques Audiard, co-writing _Un proph\u00e8te_ (2009) and _Dheepan_ (2015 - on which Debr\u00e9 also worked), as well as Joachim Lafosse's soul-crushingly brilliant _\u00c0 perdre la raison_ (2012). In short, these guys know story construction. There is one red flag, however. Bidegain also co-wrote the screenplay for Audiard's _De rouille et d'os_ (2012), which was hideous, and made a mockery of Craig Davidson's excellent short story collection on which it was based. Of course, the real gem in the line-up is Roskam, with _Fid\u00e8le_ as his third feature (and his fourth collaboration with Matthias Schoenaerts, having also worked together on the 2005 short film, \"The One Thing to Do\"). His feature debut was 2011's _Rundskop_, a devastating seismic powerhouse of a movie that bludgeoned you over the head with any optimism you may have dared bring to it. _Rundskop_ was one of the best films of the year, and was rightly nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2012 Academy Awards, also winning a bunch of Best Film awards (AFI Fest, CinEuphoria Awards, Film Festival Oostende, Palm Springs International Film Festival), and cleaning up at Belgium's 2012 Magritte Awards. Roskam followed up that auspicious debut with _The Drop_ (2014), which was good, but nothing special.\r\n\r\nThe acting talent in _Fid\u00e8le_ also suggests a high-quality product. Schoenaerts is an intense performer whom I've seen compared to a young Robert De Niro, and who tends to be good in everything, even if the movie around him is rubbish. Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos isn't as well-known, but she was mesmerising in Abdellatif Keichiche's _La vie d'Ad\u00e8le \u2013 Chapitres 1 & 2_ (2013), for which she won over twenty Best Actress awards, as well as being one of three recipients of the 2013 Palme D'Or, the first time in Cannes' history that the award was shared between filmmakers and actors (the other winners were her co-star L\u00e9a Seydoux and the film's screenwriter\/director). Together, Schoenaerts and Exarchopoulos make for a distractingly attractive couple, with effortless sexual chemistry between them, and a nice sense of playfulness. It also helps that neither seems particularly shy about doing sex scenes.\r\n\r\nAnd so, with all that in mind, for the first 90 minutes or so, _Fid\u00e8le_ chugs along nicely \u2013 a little overwrought, but well put together and enjoyable enough in a disposable sort of way. It's a fairly familiar story; essentially, will the love of a good woman save the recidivist criminal with a heart of gold? Gino \"Gigi\" Vanoirbeek (Schoenaerts) is a thief masquerading as a car salesman (the \"jailbird\" of the horrendous English language title which I point-blank refuse to use), B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte \"Bibi\" Delhany (Exarchopoulos) works for her father (Eric De Staercke) at his construction company, but spends her free time on the race track (the \"racer\"). They are introduced by her brother Bernard (Thomas Coumans), who doesn't know what Gigi really does, and they quickly fall in love. However, as time goes by, Gigi finds it increasingly difficult to keep the truth of what he does away from a suspicious Bibi. After a successful bank robbery, Gigi is persuaded by his colleagues to do \"one more heist\" (yep, that old chestnut), despite the \"_risk versus reward_\" (to quote _Heat_) scenario it seems to be.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Michael Mann, parts of _Fid\u00e8le_ are unashamedly influenced by Heat, particularly the bank robbery scene, whilst Gigi's cover as working as a car salesman is taken directly from Mann's underrated debut _Thief_ (1981).\r\n\r\nThe plot summary above takes us through the first act (which focuses on Gigi), and into the second (which focuses on Bibi). And then the bottom falls out, as the screenplay makes one of the most bizarre about-turns I've ever seen. The one element of _Rundskop_ which needed work was that Roskam introduced several plot strands which just didn't integrate into the surrounding narrative, almost as if they were from an entirely different film. I'm thinking of the comic-relief mechanics, who were fine on their own (and pretty funny), but out of place in such a nihilistic film. Another example would be the tough-as-nails workaholic cop (Barbara Sarafian) who is determined to get her man no matter what, or the homosexual undercover cop (Tibo Vandenborre) promising an informant they can get together after the case is done. These elements were fine in isolation, but just didn't settle into the overriding narrative. Now, think of that lack of integration, and then multiply it by several thousand, and you will be some way to understanding just how badly the last half hour of _Fid\u00e8le_ gels with everything that has preceded it.\r\n\r\nBut it's not only the fact that the film has an identity crisis and morphs into something completely different. One might forgive that if that something different was well written. As a heist movie, _Fid\u00e8le_ works pretty well, but as a tearjerker, it's horrendous. For starters, Roskam tries to cram far too much into a short space of time. The last half hour of the film jumps all over the place from Bibi's dad being blackmailed to Gigi's recidivism catching up with him to trouble conceiving a child to ovarian cancer to chemotherapy to mysterious Albanians who can't be trusted to a dogfighting ring. And with Bibi on the brink of death, when Gigi arrives in the hospital to see her, she's already slipped into a coma. So they never get to say goodbye. Then he gets beaten up. Twice.\r\n\r\nRoskam handles all of this with a spectacularly misguided solemnity that ends up manifesting itself as nothing other than mawkishness. He just keeps on piling melodrama on top of clich\u00e9 on top of angst. The audience at the screening I attended actually started laughing as the characters experienced misfortune after misfortune after misfortune. It just never ends, and, most unforgivingly, the suffering has absolutely no cathartic effect whatsoever, it just exists in a vacuum of its own making; there's no moral component, no sense in which any of the characters come out the other side having learnt something, and the audience itself certainly doesn't experience any kind of emotional purification, any sense in which their pity or fear has been engaged or purged.\r\n\r\nAnd what's especially frustrating is that the film's individual components are well put together. The acting is strong (it would be almost unwatchable were the acting anything less than exemplary), and Roskam's direction is predictably solid (the aesthetic centrepiece is a brilliantly staged three or four minute single take shot of a complex heist on a motorway). Hell, even the end of the film, the final sequence as Gigi drives across the city, is brilliantly shot, and the revelation that his and Bibi's conversation continued after he joked that he was a bank robber really caught me by surprise. And the last line is superb (it's also more emotive than all the melodrama in the preceding half hour). It's for reasons like this that I haven't scored the film one or one-and-a-half stars.\r\n\r\nHowever, although the destination is pretty satisfying, how we have gotten there is so ludicrous that it renders any sense of accomplishment completely null and void. It's just a shame, because although in an isolated sense, most of the film is well done, the totality is a disaster. A huge disappointment from a director who only seven years ago showed all the promise in the world. I'm not convinced yet that _Rundskop_ was a fluke, perhaps _Fid\u00e8le_ will prove to be the exception in Roskam's _oeuvre_, but with this and _The Drop_, I'm starting to get a little worried.","id":"5cc25ef5925141593ef3b0c0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cc25ef5925141593ef3b0c0","movie_id":414063}

There\u2019s also a nod to \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d (1967).\r\n\r\nThomas Jane should\u2019ve gotten an award for his performance, as he literally disappears in the role and is unrecognizable. His farm hick accent is so thick I strongly recommend using the subtitles.\r\n\r\nThe themes revolve around disloyalty, the danger of allowing hostility (hatred) to fester, the abuse of authority\/manipulation and the power of conscience.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes and was shot, believe it or not, in Western Australia. Additional cast: Kaitlyn Bernard appears as the kid\u2019s neighbor girlfriend and Neal McDonough her father.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B","id":"5bd211c5c3a3687adc002387","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bd211c5c3a3687adc002387","movie_id":452507}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**To face a revenge threat!**\r\n\r\nOkay the first film was good one. Then I thought it was unnecessary to make a sequel for it. But someone clarified that it was not made outside the novel to make money. It's indeed adapted from the sequel book of the original film's source. Though coming out 20 years later was the disadvantage. Except some praises it had received, particularly by its hardcore fans, it was average at the box office and I thought same as well.\r\n\r\nI did not like the story. It was just a random drag, not knowing what direction to head. That's until the third act, and once all the three main characters come together, so it gets interesting with something. Like surviving from from a revenge threat. It was the actors who saved the film. Otherwise, it is not even an average as I consider now. I don't think retaining the title was a good idea, but I think it was just for its fans. Or else, a new title name would have done a decent justice to what it had narrated.\r\n\r\nAs I know, this is the director's first ever sequel and he's not getting better since his Oscar win, a decade ago. Especially the last two flicks, despite based on the very good subjects. Definitely no to the T3. Instead, I want another Oscar nod film from him. This would have been ever worse if somebody else would have made it. Yet, a watchable film, only if you had liked the first.

{"author":"Milo_Jeeder","content":"Being horror my favorite genre, I am always willing to give national horror flicks a chance and I had heard nothing but good things about \"Aterrados\", which was surprising, given that Argentinian horror flicks don't get a lot of positive reviews (and for a good reason). Now, having high expectations can be a bad thing, so I tried to watch this film without expecting anything either good or bad, but, in the end, I was somewhat disappointed anyway.\r\n\r\nIn \"Aterrados\", we see different supernatural events taking place in the suburbs of an unnamed Buenos Aires town. The first eerie events occur inside the house of a young couple, who find their home invaded by a strange invisible presence. One night, the woman is violently attacked by this supernatural force, resulting in her death, for which her husband is later hold accountable. In a different place, a young boy meets a gruesome death after being hit by a bus, only to rise from the dead and return to his home in a state of decomposition. Finally, a young man desperately seeks professional help after being harassed by a ghost-like creature that wanders around his house during the night. A police officer, a sheriff and two investigators of paranormal events step in to find out what the heck is going on with these cases, given that these strange events took place in different locations, but in the same block, which, clearly, cannot be a coincidence.\r\n\r\n\"Aterrados\" is a film that gently makes the effort to give the audience a quality product and given the low budget, this is very much appreciated. However, Demi\u00e1n Rugna, who both directed and wrote the film, fails to tie all the loose ends of what initially promises to give us a complex story. While the second half provides a nice amount of gruesome imagery and some surprisingly decent special effects, the story falls apart by not giving us solid answers to really understand the reason behind the paranormal events that take place in this particular area. The only explanation that we briefly get from one of the investigators is rather simplistic and unconvincing: apparently, water has something to do with this gruesome mess (um, okay). According to the investigator, water contains microorganisms that keep life and can connect the realms of the dead and the living. Other than that, we don't really know what these supernatural entities are up to and we don't quite get an explanation regarding their nature. At some point, it is mentioned that these forces crave for blood, which provides them with a vampire-like quality, I suppose. Be that as it may, the explanations are unsatisfying. Is there a particular force, entity or presence responsible for everything that happened? In most of these supernatural horror flicks, there's a main antagonist who is after a specific target, like, a single character or an entire family; however, in \"Aterrados\", there seem to be several forces attacking several unconnected individuals, which creates a very convoluted final result. Ghosts stories are usually annoyingly similar when it comes to give us a climax with an explanation regarding the supernatural events, but I would have gladly accepted a clich\u00e9 over nothing. Seriously, how hard could it be? Something simple would have sufficed, like: A person was somehow wronged, which resulted in his or her death. Afterwards, the spirit of said person, now residing in an alternative realm, torments the living for what they did. (see? not too complicated).\r\n\r\nThe characters are forgettable for the most part. Our main \"hero\" (who appears after the first 25 minutes!) is just really not interesting or relatable in any way. His personal story is pettily revealed towards the last part of the film, but it's difficult to get attached to him, not only because he is a generic police officer in a horror flick, but also, because he shares too much of his \"leadership\" with the other three bland heroes.\r\n\r\nI can overlook the low budget, the amateurish dialogues and the unengaging locations, but the story has to make sense. While some directors manage to get away with a convoluted story that doesn't tie all the lose ends, they provide a strong dream-like atmosphere that makes up for the messiness, which Rugna fails to provide in this particular film. In a film directed by Fulci, the stylish cinematography compensates the lack of a solid plot full of loose ends... Rugna cannot afford to do that, at least in this case.\r\n\r\nThough I personally didn't care for it that much, \"Aterrados\" is really not a terrible film and it manages to stay on the decent side for the most part, staying away from any type of unintended hilarity. Rugna shows a lot of potential by creating genuinely disturbing moments of tension, which is crucial in a horror flick. The gruesome imagery, great photography and good camera work make this film worthy of, at least, a single watch. Some people are claiming that this is the best Argentinian horror flick (honestly, though, there isn't much to compete with) and I've noticed that hispanic horror fans seem overly enthusiastic with this film. This actually makes me happy and gives me hopes that Argentina may produce more horror films in the future. Hopefully, they will be an improvement over this one.","id":"5c4132200e0a2654c1933eba","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c4132200e0a2654c1933eba","movie_id":489430}

{"author":"furious_iz","content":"A slow-burn horror that doesn't quite burn enough.\r\n\r\nBefore I get started let me just say that angst and anger are not the same thing.  I have read so many reviews that have described the character of Leah as angst-ridden.  Angst is fear or anxiety, often about the future, it is not the same thing as anger...\r\n\r\nLeah is a teen living with her grieving mother.  She likes black metal and the occult.  She's not completely off the rails, still respects her mother, but she is clearly dealing with the loss of her father as is her mother.  Her mum decides it is time to uproot from the family home and shift to a cabin in the woods.  After a massive argument the angry teen summons a demon\/witch\/entity to kill her mum, and spends the rest of the film regretting and trying to reverse the ritual.\r\n\r\nThere's some good acting, some nicely fleshed out characters with a lot of grey moral areas, no one is completely good or completely bad.  The mother is simultaneously cold, selfish, distant, loving, caring and concerned.  The daughter is angry, upset, respectful and loving.  \r\n\r\nThe witch is a little like the shark in jaws, all subtle out of focus, with only the odd decent look at it.  That is both a good and a bad thing.  Fans of horror might feel let down, but fans of thrillers might think it is all a little too much\r\n\r\nThere are some monumentally bad decisions which are hard to get over, and the ending lacked some punch, but it is mostly a well made quiet film.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"5ad7cf6ac3a368719c005125","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ad7cf6ac3a368719c005125","movie_id":448194}
{"author":"cityguide","content":"\u201cScotty and the Secret History of Hollywood\u201d wears a lot of hats, none of which quite fits. A salacious tell-all about the hidden sex lives of postwar movie stars; a peek at the underbelly of the repressive moral dictates of the studio system; a breezy biography of a self-described Hollywood prostitute and procurer; and a psychosexual study of a possibly damaged victim of extreme childhood abuse.\r\n\r\nOnly the last offers a clue to interpreting the movie\u2019s more astonishing revelations and unprobed corners. Until then, Matt Tyrnauer\u2019s gossipy portrait of Scotty Bowers, an impish nonagenarian and former Marine, listens without judgment as he describes decades of servicing the closeted hungers of stars like Rock Hudson and Katharine Hepburn, helped by an eager network of World War II buddies. Back then, in a couple of trailers behind a gas station on Hollywood Boulevard, $20 could buy just about anything.\r\n\r\nMeandering behind Mr. Bowers as he shares faded photographs of extravagantly endowed young men and prurient factoids about his famous \u201ctricks\u201d \u2014 cheekily illustrated with scenes from classic movies that read rather differently in hindsight \u2014 Mr. Tyrnauer surreptitiously hoses away the layers of dirt to reveal the fragility of his subject\u2019s anything-goes hedonism. Benevolent hustler (he never took a cut of others\u2019 action) or naughty fabulist \u2014 perhaps both \u2014 Mr. Bowers putters around his hoarded Hollywood Hills home and gazes into the hole in his patio deck as if searching for something lost long ago.\r\n\r\nConsequently, what starts out salty ends up as something sadder and more complicated. And when he unabashedly recalls a childhood rife with sexual encounters \u2014 which he insists were consensual \u2014 with adults, the camera fixes on his mile-wide grin and we wonder if his mission to meet the needs of others has somehow ignored his own.","id":"5b6480730e0a267ef8059f1e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b6480730e0a267ef8059f1e","movie_id":469062}

They should have been dropped it, yet the film was not that bad. It was simple and cute, somewhat better than the previous ones. Basically, there's no story, everything was an adventure and the story came out of it. The adventure of four Smurfs to outdo their arch-rival, Gargamel. They were racing to find the secret village, but with different agendas. They had to face many hurdles before getting close to their destination. After that what came was a surprise.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I guess I am going to disagree both with the critics, wich of course is not at all unusual, as well as with a lot of the actual viewers of this movie by saying that I really liked this movie.\n\nI guess that I can to some extent understand that some viewers are disappointed. That would be the viewers that have read the comics that the movie is based on. Unfortunately someone in the production team decided to take bits and pieces from several comic books and mash them together as well as change some key elements. It is really annoying when that is done. It is usually an indication that somewhere some dumbass who did not understand, and certainly did not respect, the source material had way too much influence on the production. It is really a shame since the comic book from wich the core of the of the story seems to be taken is certainly more than good enough to stand on its own.\n\nWell luckily the mashup that they produced is actually bloody good. Something wich in my experience is quite rare. The Valerian comics lends themselves very well as a base for some spectacular sci-fi  with plenty of weird creatures and spectacular scenery. Add Luc Besson to the mix and you have to spell spectacular in all caps.\n\nThis is definitely a Luc Besson movie. Plenty of action, spectacular (yes I repeat myself but this movie deserves it) scenery, a fair amount of weirdness. In short a lot of stuff this particular viewer likes.\n\nThe mashed up story is not too bad. It is predictable as hell of course, even though it is not following the comics, but it is making a decent job of tying together all the action and FX and the action and FX is really the main reason to watch this movie after all.\nI have to say that I think most of the characters were pretty okay. It seems that the performance of the two main characters where generally not so well received by a lot of people. I guess I can somewhat understand that but I still cannot refrain from saying: Read the fucking comics! Okay it is a French comic and there are probably few people outside of France (or at least outside of Europe) that have read them. Me being one of the few of course. Anyway, Valerian and Laureline are supposed to be somewhat weird, silly and a little bit childish. Personally I think they did a fair job of interpreting the comic book characters the way they should be. We probably have Luc Besson to thank for not getting a some Hollywood, thirteen on a dozen, characters.\n\nI do miss some bits of the real comics though. The transmutation animal played a much more visible role in the comic and so did the three information peddlers wich gave a much more professional impression in the comic book by the way. I also think it was a shame that they changed the story of the Muh so much. Their role in the comic book was much more impressive to me.\n\nStill, most of the bits and pieces that is taken from the different comic books and mashed together are quite faithfully reproduced, at least visually and the results turned out really really good as far as I am concerned.\n\nTo wrap it up, to me, this movie was a fun, spectacular, action filled sci-fi extravaganza. A typical Luc Besson movie and I mean that in a good way.","id":"5a3824f4c3a36814ab06fc79","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a3824f4c3a36814ab06fc79","movie_id":339964}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**UNfortunately-FORGETTABLE film!**\r\n\r\nDirectional debut for a producer. I think she did well. But the film had a major issue. The film was decent with nice performances and production quality. Though it came at a wrong era. Came in too late, at least two decades late. If you had watched a decent number of films in your life, probably you have already seen plenty of similar film. And most of those would have come from the late last century. As what the title says, it was totally opposite of meaning that unfortunately a forgettable film. All the above, they have kept open ending, hinting a sequel could come. I already feel that is a bad idea!\r\n\r\nSince it was very familiar, easy to predict the scenes and dialogues. Particularly the climax was a let down. I expected something better than usual. The clues, twist, all were ordinary. Though the actors were decent. That does not mean it is worth watching for them. Definitely won't work, unless you are a big fan of anyone of them. Something for sure that it looks like they ran out of the ideas. Why would someone want to make the same old film with a new cast. Why not call it a remake or a reboot! Anyway, don't think it is worth a watch, unless you haven't seen many films in your life or born yesterday.\r\n\r\n_4\/10_","id":"59bd8bdf925141356d017c0d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59bd8bdf925141356d017c0d","movie_id":418437}
{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Decent but forgettable_**\r\n\r\n> _There are some terrible things in the air these days and I think we've reached the point where it's seriously threatening our existence on this planet. If we look at the biggest narrative of our times, climate change, it's exactly about that. The whole world has to come together and let go of a certain way of living but it seems that we just can't. We all have the same objective, and really we all have to compromise in one way or another and be considerate of each other - and if we don't, we are risking the future of our children. But still we can't do it. Ho__w fucked up is that? It's this terrible individualistic way of thinking and living which is indeed encouraged by our capitalistic society._\r\n\r\n> _What happened during the development of this script is that I tried to open up the narrative, making it receptive to different interpretations of those ideas. By the end it turns into sort of a fable where the larger metaphor is living in a community, in peace with other humans. In that sense you can also read this story as one about two different, conflicting nations, ethnic or religious groups - I think those stories share some things in common with the issues we can have with our neighbours._\r\n\r\n- Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigur\u00f0sson; \"_Undir tr\u00e9nu_ Production Notes\"\r\n\r\nAnyone who knows anything about Scandinavian cinema knows two things. The first is that Nordic noir is huge at the moment. Originally used to describe crime fiction told from the perspective of the police (good examples are Maj Sj\u00f6wall and Per Wahl\u00f6\u00f6's Martin Beck novels, Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander novels, and Jo Nesb\u00f8's Harry Hole novels), the term has more recently been employed in relation to a wider-ranging genre of television shows (_Forbrydelsen_, _Bron\/Broen_, _\u00d3f\u00e6r\u00f0_, _Fortitude_, _Midnattssol_) and films (Erik Skjoldbj\u00e6rg's _Insomnia_, Balthasar Korm\u00e1kur's _M\u00fdrin_, Christian E. Christiansen's _ID:A_, Thomas Vinterberg's _Jagten_). The other thing that anyone knows is that Nordic comedy is jet black, with its opacity often such that non-Nordic audiences can be left asking \"was that really a comedy?\" Not necessarily because they didn't find it funny, but because they're not entirely sure what parts they were supposed to find funny, _how_ they were supposed to find it funny, even _if_ they were supposed to find it funny.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of films such as Jalmari Helander's _Rare Exports_ (a research team in Lapland find a massive underground chamber, in which is held a hibernating Joulupukki, the murderous Scandinavian precursor of Santa Claus), Andr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal's _Trolljegeren_ (found-footage of a trollhunter, who operates by weakening his quarry with the sounds of Christian rock), Timo Vuorensola's _Iron Sky_ (Nazis living on the moon since 1945 return to earth to re-establish the Third Reich), Felix Herngren's _Hundra\u00e5ringen som klev ut genom f\u00f6nstret och f\u00f6rsvann_ (the 100-year-old resident of a nursing home escapes from a window and has a series of adventures), Hans Peter Moland's _Kraftidioten_ (a snowplough driver starts a gang war whilst seeking vengeance for the death of his son), Gr\u00edmur H\u00e1konarson's _Hr\u00fatar_ (two brothers who haven't spoken in decades must work together to save a herd of sheep), and Anders Thomas Jensen's _M\u00e6nd og h\u00f8ns_ (a group of five middle-aged half-brothers learn of one another's existence for the first-time). In Iceland, the term used to describe this kind of comedy is \"_g\u00e1lgah\u00famor_\" (\"gallows humour\"), and it's a style which is often lost on international audiences \u2013 as the brief plot summaries above suggest, it often focuses on dark subjects which one wouldn't immediately recognise as comedic - what we might term, only partially correctly, as \"tragi-comedy\". And so, with all of this in mind, we have _Undir tr\u00e9nu_ [_Under the Tree_], as textbook an example of _g\u00e1lgah\u00famor_ as you're likely to find.\r\n\r\nWritten by Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigur\u00f0sson and Huldar Brei\u00f0fj\u00f6r\u00f0, and directed by Sigur\u00f0sson, the film begins with Agnes (L\u00e1ra J\u00f3hanna J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir) accusing her husband, Atli (Stein\u00fe\u00f3r Hr\u00f3ar Stein\u00fe\u00f3rsson), of cheating. Although he denies it, she throws him out, and he returns to his parents, Baldvin (Sigur\u00f0ur Sigurj\u00f3nsson) and Inga (Edda Bj\u00f6rgvinsd\u00f3ttir). A shadow hangs over the family in the shape of the disappearance years earlier of Atli's older brother, Uggi. Whilst most people, including Atli and Baldvin, believe Uggi committed suicide, Inga refuses to accept this, still expecting him to return home at some point. Next-door live Konrad (\u00deorsteinn Bachmann) and his wife Eybjorg (Selma Bj\u00f6rnsd\u00f3ttir), who is closer in age to Atli than she is to Konrad himself. The two couples are in the midst of a passive-aggressive dispute concerning a large tree in Baldvin and Inga's garden, which is casting a shadow over Konrad and Eybjorg's sundeck. Baldvin is open to the possibility of trimming it, but Inga point-blank refuses, arguing that Konrad's first wife never had a problem with it, and it is only because of Eybjorg's vanity that there is an issue now.\r\n\r\nAll of this is set up within the first ten minutes or so, and what plays out for the rest of the film is a juxtaposition of the two main conflicts \u2013 that between Agnes and Atli on the one hand, and that between the neighbouring couples on the other \u2013 as each becomes more and more bitter, and the parties involved more extreme. And this is essentially the film's bread-and-butter \u2013 a serious marital conflict contrasted with a farcical neighbouring conflict, with each commenting upon and informing the other; no matter how serious the dispute regarding the tree becomes, it is always tempered and rendered preposterous by the much more consequential issues playing out between Atli and Agnes. Likewise, no matter how acrimonious that conflict becomes, it is always called into relief by the comedic elements in the dispute concerning the tree.\r\n\r\nThis is how a lot of _g\u00e1lgah\u00famor_ works \u2013 the serious and the absurd placed alongside one another so as to create a somewhat unrealistic _milieu_. An especially good example of this in _Undir tr\u00e9nu_ can be found in the opening scene, which plays out in a more conventional comedic style than is typical of the genre, before a tonal shift renders everything far less humourless. The film begins with Agnes and Atli going to bed, as Agnes puts in ear-plugs, and the sounds of a couple having sex can be heard on the soundtrack. The film then cuts to a shot of a couple in bed, with the sound bridging the cut, and letting the audience know this is the same couple heard in the previous scene. Except it isn't. Another cut reveals that some time has passed, and the couple in bed is actually a film Atli is watching on a laptop in the living room. Wearing headphones, he doesn't hear Agnes come in, and as he begins to masturbate, she asks him if he's watching porn. Slamming the laptop shut, he jumps up and flat out denies it. However, he is unaware that the porn he was watching is now playing on the computer screen behind him, in full view of Agnes. All pretty funny up to this point. However, the farcical manner in which the scene has progressed thus far is undermined as Agnes realises he hasn't been watching professional porn \u2013 rather, he has been watching an amateur video, in which he is the star. The multiple misunderstandings and layered realisations, coupled with a well-handled manipulation of audience expectation (and an excellent example of an L cut being used thematically) render the scene farcical, but only up until the point Agnes recognises Atli on screen. Here, the tone shifts dramatically as the film essentially switches genres mid-scene.\r\n\r\nAnother example of such a shift is found during a resident's meeting in Agnes and Atli's apartment block. The meeting has been called by an especially fastidious resident to address the loud love-making of a young couple \u2013 the same couple heard in the opening scene. As the irritated chair and his heavily pregnant wife detail all they've had to listen to at night, including a truly hilarious reaction to the young couple's dirty talk, the scene plays out in a fairly conventionally comedic way (the addition of a hard-of-hearing neighbour who doesn't understand what all the fuss is about is particularly funny). This comedic element is maintained when Agnes attempts to embarrass Atli by standing up and asking the residents if they think it's normal that he films himself having sex with women and then masturbates to the footage, to which the man in the loud couple nonchalantly responds, \"_Sure_.\" However, the scene darkens considerably when nobody reacts to Agnes's question the way she expected, and she is effectively dismissed and told to sit back down, leaving herself far more embarrassed than anyone else. Comedy in the midst of heartbreak, tragedy transposed into humour.\r\n\r\nThe film also features elements which are much more straightforwardly funny, albeit if relying on the audience's capacity to detect irony. For example, as Agnes and Atli's split becomes more and more bitter, Baldvin chastises Atli, telling him that he and Agnes should have been able to sort things out by now, talking things through \"_like grown-ups_\". Good advice. Except, when Baldvin offers it, he is about to spend the night sleeping in a tent in his back garden so as to prevent Konrad (who had purchased a chainsaw earlier in the day) from cutting down the tree. Atli himself doesn't point this irony out to Baldvin, and it's up to the audience to read between the lines and see the absurdity on display.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, for a film with such a farcical plot, it's immensely predictable. About twenty minutes in, I guessed how it would end \u2013 not just in terms of where the plot would go, but I literally guessed what the last shot would be. And I was right. A colleague of mine came to an identical conclusion when he was watching it. That kind of predictability is never good. It's also a little difficult to see what Sigur\u00f0sson is trying to say with the film. Part absurdist comedy-of-manners, part satire of first-world problems, there isn't a huge amount of substance here. Is the film offering up a commentary on the inherent pettiness that can come to dominate divorce proceedings, or is it more concerned with mocking the self-importance of middle-class suburbia and the attitude that an argument about a tree can be seen as more important than the breakup of a marriage?\r\n\r\nAlso, when the inevitable happens, and the humour gives way to inexorable darkness, with the two conflicts dovetailing, and tragedy enveloping all six main characters, I don't think Sigur\u00f0sson handles the transition especially well. Rather than allowing the material to become as ultra and unironically serious as he does, perhaps maintaining a comedic through-line would have been more effective (_Kraftidioten_ is a good example of how to do this \u2013 although the film gets exceptionally dark in the final act, which features precious little seemingly worth laughing at, it maintains its comedic edge, right up until, literally, the last shot). _Undir tr\u00e9nu_ lets the comedy drop away entirely, and although the last scene may be an attempt to share a wink with the audience, it comes on the back of a couple of scenes which weren't especially well integrated into the tone of the preceding narrative.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's enjoyable enough whilst it lasts, but there isn't a huge amount of substance, and, in the long-term, it's not especially memorable.","id":"5cdcc8cec3a3683d17c274a7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cdcc8cec3a3683d17c274a7","movie_id":472640}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Young & hungry to fight crimes!**\r\n\r\nNo doubt, Tobey Maguire Spider-man is the best. It was also the first modern superhero of the millennium. The visual effects and entertainment wise, the second live-action Spider-man was good too, but this one is so different. This is about a teenage superhero. Just a kid. Having possessed such superpower, how he manages it alongside his normal life was nicely told.\r\n\r\nThis story begins straight away, because the introduction was done in the previous Marvel film, which are part of Avengers universe. Peter Parker assisted by Tony Stark, is very keen to fight small crimes compared to what Avengers fighting for. He feels, he's held back by Iron Man, so he wanted to make independent decisions. At one stage he succeeds in that, but things get more severe. Fighting bad guys, and the other side of his life, a romance, how the remaining story turns out are revealed with a twist.\r\n\r\nTom Holland was good. The story was simple, more like one liner. But the visuals and each scene forged nicely. Having seen all the five previous Spider-man films, this was quite predictable. Particularly the characters and their connections. Seeing how it had ended, it is possible that the daughter of the villain could take-over her father's place. That would be very interesting, because of the linkage between the film characters.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing the first look, I was afraid that this young Spider-man might be overshadowed by Iron Man, but those parts really well done. Comparing it with the 15 years ago Spider-man, the technology has been the biggest change. That's why I still love Tobey Maguire film. Very simple and down to the earth without cell phones, computers. But the current superhero films are all alien oriented\/connected theme, and of course digital technology a big leap. Hoping the next film too would impress us with the same intensity. So lets wait for summer 2019.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5a770dcfc3a36859ec04ad39","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a770dcfc3a36859ec04ad39","movie_id":315635}

It is an excellent action\/adventure movie for kids. Unfortunately I am not really in that viewer segment and for me this movie was pretty bad.\r\n\r\nThe movie is childish.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The transformation!!!**\r\n\r\nIt is a little confusing. I don't think everybody who saw it understood at the first attempt. Otherwise, it would have not received such a low rating. The film failed to give the explanations in an understandable way. Only if you are good enough to figure it out everything by yourself like by observing the characteristic behaviours, dialogues and scenes that including illusion\/dreams, then it can be considered a good one. So, comparing to the book it was based on, I don't know if the book complicates its readers the same way.\r\n\r\nIn the opening, a mother breathes her last before taking an oath from his not to speak a word till she returns. Very unusual scene, because she died by the side of her son and nobody else present, like her husband. Then a new nurse arrives to take care of him. She was confident that she can make him talk again, but later she begins to know more about the place and the people. Unexplainable things happen. Well, the film says it all, but it's hard for us to get the details. Following, a twist comes, then everything back to normal, like nothing ever happened.\r\n\r\nAll the actors were okay. I particularly watched it for Emilia Clarke. I loved the location, the atmosphere. Not a typical seaside sunny Italian place, but shot at the misty medieval house. In the beginning I thought it was like another version of 'Miracle Worker'. In the midway, I thought of 'Hidden Face'. None were right. But I only got it when I googled about it after the watch and realised there was no dream sequences at all, especially coming to the climax part. All are real, and which is a twist.\r\n\r\nMaybe it need to be watched twice, particularly after googling about what part you did not get. So it was like 'Skeleton Key' meets 'Safe Haven'. I don't want to say anything further to spoil your watch if you're yet to see it. Just watch it and make your own opinion whether you liked it or not, but try to understand it first what happens at the end. Now I've changed my rating slightly, yet the film was so old fashioned. If it had came a couple of decades ago, would have considered a best one. There are people who love such film, even today, like maybe the old guys. So it is for the selected people.\r\n\r\n_5.5\/10_","id":"59b1e8e692514107af09015b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59b1e8e692514107af09015b","movie_id":301372}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A night of twist and turn events.**\r\n\r\nMaybe if you haven't seen the original, you will enjoy it, particularly if you like a thrilling clash between the cops and gangsters. For me this is the third version from the last three consecutive years. After the original French film based on the same name of the book, followed by the Kollywood remake 'Thoongavanam'. The second film was not bad, considering the way it was made to the Indian standards. They did not change much, but in this one the initial parts were almost the same and the following developments were too much. I mean literally they turned it into twice thriller with tight action sequences. Their main idea was to leave the open conclusion for a possible sequel. Which was really too intentional that not everybody would be happy with, for like those who liked the previous versions.\r\n\r\nThe actors were good, but Michelle Monaghan was the best among. Unlike the same characters from other versions, I don't know how they turned Monaghan's role so powerful. That's the negative, as the film Jamie Foxx in the lead. Otherwise, as a neutral, this is not a bad remake. The Immigrant joke was trimmed off, since today's US is not in favour of such comedies in films. And many events, especially film scenes were accelerated. So the camera moves one place to another in a quick succession unlike other versions. Yeah, these changes were needed, since the film was not a fresh piece of work or even first remake. But like I said too muchness spoiled the party. Even though one time watchable film.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"5943086e9251417f9b012546","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5943086e9251417f9b012546","movie_id":324542}

{"author":"Mark Rushow","content":"Watched Alien: Covenant a 3rd time. It is a lot better than first meets the eye. The drastic difference from what we were expecting in direction from Prometheus threw all of us off. We had expectations of what we would get to see and we didn't get those. There is so much detail and such good acting. It takes multiple watches to pick up on it all. It blends the styles of Alien, Aliens, and Prometheus all together and does it very well. There is also a lot of subtle reference to Terminator 2. The dynamic between the androids Walter and David and the acting that went into that is something quite special. In that alone is a reference to T:2. My first 2 watches I didn't appreciate the android Walter like the character deserves. I was biased against his character in light of the android David. The android Walter and how he was portrayed also blends the style of android we see in Aliens. The actor's voice and demeanor reflect that of the android Bishop and gives us a bridge to his design. Michael Fassbender really did one hell of a job acting those two parts of Walter and David. Near the end of the movie there is another nod to T:2 as a beam is clearly marked as such and the scene that follows has a strong T:2\/Aliens sequence and taste in styling to it. Through and through the acting is very good. Details are abound everywhere. There are a few points of rather convenient plots however overall the film is now among my favorites right along side Aliens and T:2.","id":"59843bcec3a36875730003c1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59843bcec3a36875730003c1","movie_id":126889}
{"author":"CraigJamesReview","content":"Alien Covenant marks the third Alien movie directed by Ridley Scott and the second prequel to the franchise after Prometheus. They also seem to be getting worse with age.\r\n\r\nPrometheus was really a lot of questions searching for answers, ambitious in asking not only about the creation of alien life, but human life as well. However the plan to stretch out these topics into 3 or 4 movies should be met with some skepticism.\r\n\r\nEspecially considering the basis for this was started by Damon Lindeloff, the creator of Lost and the man most of us are still waiting for answers for most of the things that happened on Lost.\r\n\r\nHe of course has abandoned this second movie, leaving it in the hands of the far more capable John Logan, but even he struggles to find meaning here, or escape the clich\u00e9s that have started to grow like a Xenomorph in John Hurt's stomach.\r\n\r\nWe're dealing with a whole new crew this time; the Covenant. They are headed on a colonial mission to another planet before an electric shock takes out the ship, the Captain, and 47 other members.\r\n\r\nReluctant to get back into their pods for a 7 year journey, the on board crew responsible for the ship's upkeep decide instead to answer a distress transmission coming from another planet.\r\n\r\nThat's where they find what continues to be the best character in these prequels; Michael Fassbender's David the Android. His motivations and whether he considers himself human or God is constantly in question and Fassbender's soft-spoken performance continues to haunt.\r\n\r\nI also really do consider Prometheus to be one of the most gorgeous-looking special films of the last decade and this continues that- from the Covenant ship to the grain fields and other vegetation eerily covering the mostly desolate other terrain of the planet.\r\n\r\nWe also get the first look at the Neo-morph, who is born the same way, seems a bit faster than the Xeno-morph but the main differences are it doesn't have the Venus fly trap tongue and it can stand like a human. Pretty cool.\r\n\r\nJust it's at this point I should probably say that after Aliens there started to be less reason to want these. Alien 3 was fine, Prometheus I thought could really go either way depending on the sequels, and Alien 4 of course was garbage.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem here is that it feels so redundant. We get a distress call, the crew investigates, some background characters do stupid things leading to impregnation, someone says \"we never should have come\", final alien chase.\r\n\r\nThe aliens, when you can see them, are cool, but there is a lot of downtime between them, and a few quality kills does not a 200 million dollar mega blockbuster make.\r\n\r\nIt's also really odd that Prometheus does this whole thing of setting up the engineers as the creators of human beings but here they only get one scene and let's just say those looking for more info about them will get angry.\r\n\r\nThe promise of some larger conversation is in here somewhere but these movies feel so stretched out at this point that when this does get to the few moments of actually having something to say, it's hard to get re-engaged.\r\n\r\nThe characters don't help either as most just come off like archetypes. Katherine Waterston is the Captain's widow and really the bargain basement Ellen Ripley here.\r\n\r\nBilly Crudup plays the faith-based character, and like the last movie, this movie seems to be including that without ever really giving it value in the meaning of life conversation.\r\n\r\nBut at least those two have some background. I'm so tired of most of these others. The ones who just go tramping through the woods of an unknown planet or show the decision making skills of the Trump administration. You're not supposed to make us root for the alien, guys.\r\n\r\nFinally i'm no closer to understanding why these movies are necessary. It's easy to tell what this movie wants to do and it's even easier to see the twist coming a half hour before it even comes.\r\n\r\nThere are a few nice kills here, I will give the movie that. If you can remember to wake yourself every time Fassbender and Fassbender (he also plays an android named Walter) have a philosophy conversation, you might find some interesting stuff there too.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A mid air hijack thriller!**\r\n\r\nThe opening scene looked nice, but soon it turned out a disaster. I did not like how one cop saved the day, just like that. Then moving to the second stage of the film, which is going to take place on a plane on the mid altitude. So another one day event film, because I've seem quite a lot of them at the recent time. Do I know this director? No, I don't. The Actors? Not all, but those I'm familiar with are not a big star or I've not seen them for a very long.\r\n\r\nThe story is about a domestic plane getting hijacked. Like most of the film, our hero who is happened to be a cop is on that plane when an unknown gang takes over it in the mid air. When the incident breaks out, she slips away to find out the reason behind it. Meanwhile, in the panic and chaos, the plan disrupts for the gang. Later the motives were revealed to us, following, the end approaches where one final confrontation to take down the bad guys happens.\r\n\r\nThe overall production looked decent, except the graphics part. That graphics were terrible, compared to other B movies that has better visuals than this. The performances were okay. The story was nothing, just an event based film and how people would react to being in such position was the film. Totally, an unnecessary film. Particularly Dolph Lundgren, who did nothing than piloting. What a waste! And then the end was unbelievably bad, but expected from such film. No, not worth a watch.\r\n\r\n_3\/10_","id":"59b1e822c3a3682d8703d9ce","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59b1e822c3a3682d8703d9ce","movie_id":443700}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**An unusual combo to hunt for a missing woman!**\r\n\r\nThe same old formula, but they had tried to give something new out of it. It did not succeed, though I felt it was a decent film. It was a day tale, everything happens in just one day and night, except the opening and the end parts. So this is the story a young lazy man and his ex girlfriend's rich father, joins hands to find her who was not responding to the calls and texts. The worried father, alongside her ex goes for an adventure, where they meet many unexpected things and people and overcome it to get what they are looking for.\r\n\r\nThe story was boring, but the cast was good and so the pace of the narration. Less than 90 minutes, its a non-stop entertainer. Not everybody would think it is a best or at least a decent film. Because there's no story, everything's a series of event like an adventure documentary. JK Simmons was so good. 'Whiplash' unleashed his capacity and now at least with a role like in this, he's shining. Yeah, this film is for him if you want to watch it. Tipton looked sexy, but she was like appeared only for 3-4 minutes in the entire film. Definitely worth a watch, but not a must see.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"597e05e09251415d5d019ee2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/597e05e09251415d5d019ee2","movie_id":352501}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Even the monkeys stood upright at some point.\r\n\r\nHee! Ridley Scott, it seems, is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't as regards the Alien franchise he so gloriously kick-started back in 1979. Prometheus was too cerebral for many and definitely bogged down by expectation levels. Not without flaws of course, but a very tidy science fiction piece it be. So we roll on to Alien Covenant, which while not universally reviled, has certainly garnered some fearful scorn in Alien franchise fan circles.\r\n\r\nAlien Covenant is a cover version, no two ways about it, it's a retread of what was showcased in 1979, only with the tie-in to Prometheus and a continuation to the origins of Xenomorph and pals. Clearly we have a case of Scott making one for the fans, a return to chest busting goo and space adventurers under great duress, all of course while he fills in the blanks as well. For sure it's lazy when put up against Alien, and indeed against his other superlative sci- fi offerings such as Blade Runner and The Martian, but for those who lambasted Prometheus for its non Alien conventions, you have now got what you hankered for. Any expectation of this turning out to be a fresh masterpiece was always going to be crushed, so really it's best viewed as a loving retread. Yes! Bad science, plot and logic holes, average acting etc, these rightly don't deserve forgiveness, but it's hardly the devil's spawn here, in fact its's great fun as much as being a visual treat.\r\n\r\nLog cabin on the lake.\r\n\r\nWe start with a prologue involving Weyland and David, the conversation involving creation, the most pertinent of which being the question of the ages, where do we come from? Then after a tantalising tinkle of the ivories for Wagner's \"The Entry Of The Gods Into Valhalla\", we are whisked into outer space 2104 to be in the company of the Colonisation Vessel Covenant. Crew 15 - Colonists 2000 - Embryos 1140. The destination is ORIGAE - 6, ETA in 7 years and 4 months. Only Walter the Android (Michael Fassbender) is awake, until it's time for the crew to be abruptly awakened from their hyper sleep...\r\n\r\nCrusoe and the pathogen.\r\n\r\nFrom the off disaster strikes, thrusting the crew into emotional strife. Characters are introduced, conversations and traits establishing the bare minimum that we need to know, then a ghost transmission is received from Sector 87, planet number 4, and off we go into familiar territory. Things inevitably go from bad to worse and the action, blood flow and creature feature conventions are all laid out for our digestion. There's some surprises in store, with Fassbender a double bonus, and there's some striking chatter ranging from if there's benefits of the human race? and even that involving the poets Byron and Shelley.\r\n\r\nBed Bugs.\r\n\r\nWho will survive? If anyone? Just what does the finale have in store? As we get devilish answers, and the barn storming aural pleasures of the full orchestral version of \"The Entry Of The Gods Into Valhalla\", it's tied up nicely and the pulse rate can settle. Job done. No bar raising here, no film to push the space lander out into new dimensions, just a good honest sci-fi thriller to be viewed with that in mind. 7\/10","id":"59c62a13c3a3681461037321","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59c62a13c3a3681461037321","movie_id":126889}

Of course, the android going rogue was pretty obvious, but if the Star Wars franchise can feature a planet destroying space station in 3 of 7 movies, I'll give Sir Ridley a pass.  If you are looking for the loose ends from Prometheus to be tied up, I suggest you include Sir Ridley in your prayers so he can survive long enough (the man is friggin 80) to film the prequel to _Covenant_ currently titled _Awakening_ that will hopefully meet your expectations.","id":"5983babf9251410759000836","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5983babf9251410759000836","movie_id":126889}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Good robot! Bad robot!**\r\n\r\nAfter some gaps, the 'Alien' franchise came alive with the prequel 'Prometheum' which originally said to be a spin-off. Particularly, it landed in the hands of the original maker. Now, even the original title back in action. It's another prequel, hence the prequel series on the making. The next film too will be the same kind, before the overall storyline in the franchise align in a straight line.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed it. But not as good as 'Prometheum' or the first two 'Alien' films. The issue with it was, the same old clich\u00e9. There's nothing in the story. It was like any space film that's set in a similar fashion. The 80 per cent of the film was what we had seen in the earlier 'Alien' films. Just altered scenes with a new cast and a great visuals. So the update makes it the special.\r\n\r\nThe story focused too much on the robot. The alien parts were reduced. Because it was like the first appearance of the original aliens we saw in the old films. Precisely to say, the origins. Genetic modification, crossbreeding, there comes the beast. From this film what I have learnt was, it was nothing but more or less the same old fear the humans have about that the robots which are the ones going to make humans go extinct. Except here the aliens come between them. Hence, falling prey to the same clich\u00e9d theme from any sci-fi that had humanoid.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, well maintained film in its balance coming from previous hits in the series and going forward to bring more hits. This flick would serve as a fine bridge between them. So only 18 years to go between this, from 2104 to 2122. I'm already anticipating the next film. As I have heard, that film would be focused more on the robot. That's going to be a different experience. Fassbender's time to have some space adventures.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59ec96f8925141245f0034a5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59ec96f8925141245f0034a5","movie_id":126889}
{"author":"mansabT","content":"I am going to be honest, I did not have high expectations from this film especially because of the trailers more than anything else. I was definitely not expecting to be thoroughly entertained and did not expect to laugh hysterically for most part of the film. The trailers and even the songs did not do justice to a film which has a solid screenplay and is shot so well that at times you forget you are watching a Pakistani film. This film definitely has more highs than lows. The characterizations of the three main protagonists are brilliant, their interactions (for the most part) enjoyable and some of the dialogues are remarkably witty. Fahad Mustafa, Mohsin Abbas Haider and Javaid Sheikh own their characters completely right from the get-go and in this sequel are more improved versions of their respective roles. Shakeel\u2019s (Javaid Sheikh) is definitely the most enjoyable one among them all.\r\n\r\nWhat I absolutely loved about this film was that it is a side-splitting, all out comedy. The writers do not hold back at all but at times they even go overboard. One aspect of the film however which did not appeal to me and which wasn\u2019t even needed was the excessive use of foul language, the F word (although muted) is used number of times and there are plenty of other scenes in which the crass jokes are added unnecessarily. The toilet humor makes you cringe a couple of time but there are plenty of scenes in which it is tolerable and even hilarious!\r\n\r\nThe plot of the film is also unpredictable, the writers couldn\u2019t have given the viewers a more solid entertaining plot. It is however not logical; since this is a comedy film therefore I feel it is unfair to decipher every tiny detail based on logic! I must say that it is one of those very few Pakistani films which has a solid and well thought out storyline which went well with the theme of the film. Like other films written by Nabeel Qureshi and Fizza Ali Meerza, this one too highlights the trials and tribulations of the common man residing in Karachi in particular but the script on the whole will be relatable for any Pakistani viewer since the issues faced by every Pakistani are the same. It addresses class difference and much more. Watching Marina Khan act on the big screen after a long time was an absolutely delight. Nayyar Ejaz is brilliant as Sultan al- Baklawa; it has to be one of his best performances. Saleem Mairaj and the actor playing his companion were absolutely brilliant in their respective roles. \r\nNa Maloom Afraad 2 can easily be termed as a film which is fun and also an impressively \u201cstylish\u201d film which is visually stunning as a whole. The biggest shortcoming of the film is that it failed to include the talented female leads in the story effectively. Like Actor In Law and Na Maloom Afraad, this one too relegates the female characters in the background and does not really incorporate their characters properly in the story. This is especially sad because Hania Aamir and Urwa Hocane both have given remarkable performances even though their characters have not been explored properly. Both the actresses were even excluded from the songs, which I felt was rather unfair because they deserved more screen time. Instead of showing Sadaf Kanwal\u2019s item number, they could have been part of a song which took the story forward in some way. The song \u201cChal Hug Ley\u201d was also a disappointment because the girls in bikinis could not dance and their bare bodies were supposed to be the only attraction. I definitely expected better from a director like Nabeel Qureshi at least in this context. Urwa Hocane dances so well and Hania Aamir I am certain could have shown her dance moves too if she was given a chance to do so. The songs and the way they were shot was the biggest disappointment in the film.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would give this film 3.5 out 5 and recommend it to anyone who does not mind a few jokes which are in bad taste. This film will make you laugh especially if you watch it with a friend. Even with a few shortcomings, you will leave the cinema hall happy because NMA 2 is definitely an entertaining film. The styling, makeovers and the cinematography give this movie a unique and modern look. Nabeel Qureshi\u2019s creativity reflects in many scenes and I especially liked the scene which came before intermission. The background score is also highly impressive. This film has a completely different flavor from PNJ therefore if you enjoyed one, you should definitely watch the other. Those of you, who like me found the gold commode repulsive should go watch this film as well, you won\u2019t be disappointed!

They invite her to their hideaway, but might regret it.  \r\n\r\n\"Girl from Nowhere\" (2017) is an Indie psychological drama from South Africa costing $203,000 (converted).

{"author":"Reno","content":"**About a writer, most a poet!**\r\n\r\nAt least it tried to be something fresh. The Netflix's experimental films giving great opportunities for small directors and stars. Not all the flicks clicks, but different than what we usually get from other production houses. So that's how I ended up watching it and its an appreciable effort, but the film was average. Although the end scene was really good, I mean that homeless person part.\r\n\r\nThe film is about an infamous greeting card writer and tells how his professional life stumbles upon. While trying to make a comeback, he has to face a couple of trouble, including his unexpected romance and to keep up the promise he had made to a rich guy. Till the final scene they kept the momentums surrounding them both. So it feels like an intentional drag, since the whole film depended on those things and nothing else.\r\n\r\nWorth watching for Bob Odenkirk. The rest of the cast was not bad. Whatever the concept is, like, about a writer, kind of poet, but it avoids to exposing us the character how great he's with his work.

If, though, a Christian were to throw in his lot with a wrongdoer who has been rejected by God and disfellowshipped, or has disassociated himself, that would be as much as saying \"I do not want a place in God's holy mountain either.\" If the elders saw him heading in that direction by regularly keeping company with a disfellowshiped person, they would lovin__gly and patiently try to help him to regain God's view (Matt. 18:18; Gal.6:1). They would admonish him and, if necessary, \"reprove him with severity.\" They want to help him remain \"in God's holy mountain.\" But if he will not cease to fellowship with the expelled person, he thus has made himself \"a sharer (supporting or participating) in the wicked works\" and must be removed from the congregation, expelled.\u200b_\r\n\r\n- \"Disfellowshiping: How to View It\"; _The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah's Kingdom_ (September 15, 1981)\r\n\r\n_Apostasy_ is the low-budget feature debut of writer\/director Daniel Kokotajlo and, as the name implies, it tells the story of a breakdown in the relationship between a member of the faithful and the organised religion to which they adhere, which, in this case, is the Christian denomination movement known as Jehovah's Witnesses. However, whilst the film tells the story of one person abandoning their religion, it also tells the parallel story of two people who refuse to do so, committing themselves more and more to its practices, even as they come to question some of its dogma.\r\n\r\nIvanna (Siobhan Finneran) is a mother to two girls, Luisa (Sacha Parkinson) and her younger sister Alex (Molly Wright). Living in a working-class area in Oldham, Greater Manchester, all three are Witnesses, with Alex in particular embracing the role of a publisher (the name for Witnesses active in proselytising), even going so far as to learn Urdu so she can better preach to people in the neighbourhood. The film begins with Alex attending her doctor (Poppy Jhakra), who is explaining that her condition means she may need a blood transfusion in the future. Giving her a document to sign agreeing to allow such a procedure, the doctor promises to keep it a secret from Ivanna. Alex, however, has no interest in signing. Born anaemic, she received a blood transfusion when only a few hours old, against the wishes of Ivanna, and because of this, she is burdened with a sense of guilt, believing she must atone by adhering rigidly to Witness doctrine, helping at the local Kingdom Hall (the term used by Witnesses for their places of worship), and preaching door-to-door. Meanwhile, Luisa returns home from college, and tells Ivanna that she's pregnant, and even worse, the father is not a Witness. Ivanna is disgusted, demanding that Luisa marry the father. When she refuses, she is \"disfellowshipped\". However, as one of the requirements of disfellowship is that family members who remain Witnesses cannot have any significant contact, Ivanna forces Luisa to leave home. At the same time, Steven (Robert Emms) arrives in the neighbourhood as a new elder. He becomes friends with Ivanna and Alex, and after a few weeks, proposes to Alex.\r\n\r\nThis plot summary takes us up to about a half-hour in the film, which is loosely divided into three discernible acts \u2013 the first focuses on Alex, the second Luisa, and the third Ivanna. At the end of the first act, the plot takes a turn, which I have to admit, I didn't see coming, and which changes everything for the family and how they conduct themselves and observe their religious beliefs.\r\n\r\nTo fully engage with the film at a critical level, one must first contextualise its _milieu_. Kokotajlo is himself an apostate, as he was raised a Witness, but left in his 20s. However, what does being an apostate mean in a practical sense? Why is it such a big deal? _The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah's Kingdom_, one of two official Witness magazines (and which features prominently in the film), defines an apostate as a person who has abandoned the worship of Jehovah, and aligned themselves with Satan, and\/or a person who has rejected the church's teachings, doctrines, dogma, biblical interpretations, and religious holidays. Along these lines, The Watchtower calls apostates \"anti-Jehovah\", explaining that when the End Time comes, they will not be permitted to enter the Millennial Kingdom. Important here is that anyone espousing a doctrine which deviates from official policy is also seen as an apostate, and is disfellowshiped, even if they still consider themselves a Witness (more on this issue later). According to _The Watchtower_, apostates are motivated by bitterness, and exhibit traits of \"_prideful intelligence, lack of love, and dishonesty_,\" with their goal being to \"_to tear down Jehovah's people and to distort the Truth_.\" Reasons one may become an apostate include presumptuousness, ungratefulness, misguided independence, jealousy, and mental disease. Such people are prone to drunkenness, have loose morals, and fornicate with multiple partners. Witnesses regard apostates as much worse (in a moral sense) than they regard non-Witnesses, and if a Witness even speaks to an apostate, the church considers that person \"_a sharer in [the apostate's] wicked works._\"\r\n\r\nFrom a contextualisation standpoint, it's also beneficial to give a brief overview of the development of the religion, particularly its eschatological dogma, as this is central to Witnesses' core beliefs, and an important theme in the film. Witnesses' origins can be traced to 1870, when Charles Taze Russell formed the Bible Student movement. Millenarian in design, the movement was greatly influenced by Millerism and Adventism, and employed hermeneutics to reject foundational Christian doctrine, including trinitarianism, the existence of hell, and the immortality of the soul. In _Three Worlds, and the Harvest of this World_ (1876), Russell and Nelson H. Barbour developed a dispensationalist eschatology, arguing that Christ had been on earth since 1874, and in 1878, the current dispensation will end, and human society will be replaced by the Millennial Kingdom, in which only the chosen few will be allowed to live. In 1879, Russell began publishing _Zion's Watch Tower and the Herald of Christ's Presence_ so as to communicate to people that the End Time was imminent. In 1881, he posited that this was the year of the Rapture. By this stage, there were enough people following Russell to warrant the formation of a governing body, Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, the Society was formally recognised as a religion, and Russell now posited 1914 as the end of human society, a claim he felt was corroborated by the outbreak of the Great War. He died in 1916, still of the belief that human society would soon collapse, but the date was now 1918. Russell was succeeded by Joseph Franklin Rutherford, who offered a different interpretation of the scripture; the End Time didn't began in 1914, instead, it would begin during the lifetime of the generation alive in 1914. In 1920, he asserted that the Millennial Kingdom would come into being in 1925. The term \"Jehovah's witnesses\" was adopted as the religion's name in 1931, taken from Isaiah 43:10. Rutherford died in 1942, succeeded by Nathan Homer Knorr, who commissioned a new translation of the bible to be used by all Witnesses (_The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures_). In 1966, the date of the End Time was changed to 1975, and was subsequently changed again in 1984, 1995, and 2010.\r\n\r\nThe current belief is that Satan was cast down to earth sometime after October 1, 1914, and he rules over humanity by controlling governments. Since 1932, Witnesses have believed that 144,000 people will be resurrected during the End Time, and transferred to heaven to rule at Christ's side, whilst the rest of the faithful will remain on earth, living in the Millennial Kingdom, a theory based upon a literal interpretation of Revelation 14:1-5.\r\n\r\nAccording to official publications, there are now over eight million Witnesses worldwide. The refusal of blood transfusions (another important theme in the film) was introduced in the Netherlands in 1945, based primarily on Genesis 9:4 (\"_Only flesh with its life - its blood - you must not eat_\") and Leviticus 17:10 (\"_If any man of the house of Israel or any foreigner who is residing in your midst eats any sort of blood, I will certainly set my face against the one who is eating the blood, and I will cut him off from among his people_\"). In 1961, having a transfusion became grounds for disfellowship, at which time Dr. Am\u00e9rico Val\u00e9rio claimed transfusions lead to \"_moral insanity [and] sexual perversion_,\" whilst Dr. Alonzo Jay Shadman argued, \"_the poisons that produce the impulse to commit suicide, murder, or steal are in the blood._\" It is estimated that in the period 1961-2016, over 33,000 Witnesses died rather than accept blood. In 2016 alone, there were over 1,200 deaths.\r\n\r\nWith all of that in mind, one of the most impressive aspects of the film is how implicitly Kokotajlo introduces many of these themes, trusting in the audience's intelligence to do the legwork, whilst not even providing us with music cues to tell us what we should be thinking at any given moment. For example, like most religions, Witnesses considers itself the only true religion, and only its adherents will be saved. This is brought to the fore when Alex encounters people who don't subscribe to her beliefs; meeting two of Luisa's college friends, she is bemused that they don't agree with Witness teachings, and even more incredulous when she finds out that not only are they not Witnesses, they are areligious altogether. It's a scene which deftly demonstrates the isolationist nature of Witnesses without telegraphing it.\r\n\r\nTied closely to this is the theme of having independent thoughts, which, again, is introduced very subtly. After Luisa is disfellowshiped, she makes an effort to return to the fold, but Steven expresses doubts as to whether she will succeed, as she \"has too many of her own ideas,\" something frowned upon by Witnesses. That Kokotajlo views this as a central theme in the film is evidenced in multiple interviews he has given. Speaking to _The Irish Times_, he says,\r\n\r\n> _one of the biggest things that happened to me was going to college. Suddenly, people were asking for my opinion on things. That was a new concept for me as a Witness. At the Kingdom Hall, if you were asked questions, it was an opportunity to say what was already there in the Watchtower._\r\n\r\nSimilarly, speaking to _The Guardian_, he states,\r\n\r\n> _I went to college, and that was the key, really. People would ask my opinion on something, and I would be scrambling round trying to find an answer in a text somewhere \u2013 because that's what life as a Witness is like. It's group thinking based on the interpretation of a text._\r\n\r\nLikewise, speaking to _Screen International_, he explains,\r\n\r\n> _I was harbouring doubts since I went to college. I realised that people at college were interested in your opinion. That was a new concept to me because being a Witness it was always about reaffirming the text, group-think, it wasn't about encouraging independent thought._\r\n\r\nAnother important theme is even more implicit \u2013 likening Witnesses to Scientology. This is never overtly addressed, but Kokotajlo's presentation of how Witnesses deal with certain issues unquestionably draws parallels with how Scientologists deal with those same issues. This is perhaps most obvious in how the film depicts disfellowship, emphasising that the family of someone who has been disfellowed must cut off contact with them. This is virtually identical to the notion of \"suppressive persons\" in Scientology, and in his _Irish Times_ interview, Kokotajlo states,\r\n\r\n> _that's representative of what a lot of Witnesses have to go through. Family members are forced to shun other family members._\r\n\r\nLooking at the film in a more aesthetic sense, an interesting stylistic device is how Kokotajlo presents characters talking to Jehovah. Although they speak aloud, the people around them don't hear what they're saying (think of a soliloquy on a crowded stage in Shakespeare). This essentially positions the viewer as Jehovah \u2013 just like Him, we are in a position to hear what others cannot. Indeed, on a couple of occasions, this positioning of the viewer is foregrounded even more, as characters speak direct-to-camera. It's a daring move, but one which is extremely well handled, unifying form and content.\r\n\r\nThe film is undeniably bleak, but never melodramatic, in its depiction of the conflicts that can arise when a family dynamic is in diametrical opposition to Witness doctrine. However, a vital point is that whilst the film is highly critical of the closed-off nature of the religion, the rules and regulations, and the unfulfilled prophecies, it depicts very humanised characters. In relation to this, Kokotajlo told _The Irish Times_,\r\n\r\n> _one of the aims of the film was to treat the Witnesses with a lot of respect [\u2026] I have a lot of compassion for the people within the religion. It's the rules that the organisation creates that I have an issue with. Not the people trying to navigate those rules._\r\n\r\nAlong the same lines, the acting is exemplary, which each of the three leads evoking both sympathy and derision at different points. That the viewer can empathise with a staunch fundamentalist such as Ivanna is testament both to Finneran's nuanced performance and Kokotajlo's compassionate screenplay. The story obviously comes from a place of respect; this is not an arbitrary and\/or sarcastic hit-job written by someone who is bitter about their time in the religion, but is instead a presentation of how Witness dogma can affect the people on the ground. Dogmatic proclamations from on-high are all very well and good, but what happens when they clash with the everyday? This is essentially what the film is about, and Kokotajlo handles it brilliantly.\r\n\r\nFrom a directorial point of view, he keeps things simple and functional. The lack of budget works for the narrative, as Kokotajlo shuns any kind of directorial gymnastics in lieu of a pseudo-documentarian approach to the material, with the influence of people such as Anthony Asquith, Terrence Rattigan, and Ken Loach unmistakable. In this sense, Oldham comes across as a very real and lived-in neighbourhood, as opposed to an abstract society which feels like it doesn't exist beyond the parameters of the text.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, this is strong filmmaking; in equal measure emotive without being apologist, and informative without being condemnatory \u2013 not an easy balance to pull off by any means.","id":"5cda20b70e0a26045ccd1d5d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cda20b70e0a26045ccd1d5d","movie_id":473309}
{"author":"iieeef","content":"A tender story about a teenager who loses her sight after a riding accident and has to learn to cope with her new life. Not quite embracing any of the guide dogs offered to her, her life begins anew when the guide dog trainer decides to train an adorable miniature horse to be her companion animal. \r\n\r\nObviously geared towards the older single digit crowd, this story unfolds without a single emotional outburst or anything that might possibly scar the young ones. In this world, going blind carries with it the same inconvenience as having to take out the trash or do the dishes. Ugh, chores. Ugh, blindness. But maybe that's good in teaching the lesson that it really is not a big deal, and everyone should be treated the same. Of laughable distinction though, and worth mentioning, is the casting of the parents. Amy Smart and Liam McIntyre are both just old enough to seem ancient to any nine year old, and since that's the target audience we can ignore the fact that they lack chemistry as a couple, bear no resemblance to their child, and give off more of an auditioning actor vibe than a parent concerned with their 16 year old daughter's new disability. Add to that the fact that lead actress Avery Arendes, though entirely capable, carries herself with such seriousness that the presumed age gap between her and her parents shrinks. So for heart, this film gets a solid two thumbs up from the under ten in me. But the middle schooler inside is looking down his nose at me and wants to kill me for picking this on Netflix.","id":"58c64b789251411d62013694","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c64b789251411d62013694","movie_id":430421}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"As with many of the biopics I've seen recently, _Darkest Hour_ is more focussed on delivering you the facts than getting you involved with the characters. It is an interesting idea to have the majority of the story revolve around the of whether or not to sue for peace. That as a core concept in so much as the question of \"Do I take the guarantee of saving my country or do I take the risk of saving the world?\" and beyond that \"Is there even a right answer to that question? And who am I to decide something this big?\" is a great philosophical centre for a movie. But I never felt like I knew why any of these people had the answers that they gave. I get that in a historical context, these aren't characters they are real life people, so they answers they had are the answers we see, but again, we are only given the _what_, not the _why_.\r\n\r\nExcept you can throw all of that away because here comes Gary Oldman in his Oscar nominated transformation to make this movie 100% worth watching.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it.

{"author":"Bhargavi Chandrashekar","content":"There are many ways a film creates and holds the hype right from the commencement to its release. Mufti did exactly the same, it not only created the hype but also held the pulses of the people patiently all through the year and those became impulsive the moment the trailer was released and then those were again held back until the film was officially released( ie today). Now the film, in reply, is getting pulsating response as a payback by the audience.\r\nMufti, right from its film\u2019s title to star-cast and their appearances, created raging curiosity among the audiences but barring few niggles it completely lives up to the expectations.\r\n\r\nThis underworld-crime thriller starts with a spy-operation by Police Department in collecting the evidences against Bhairathi Ranagal ( The underworld Don Character played by Shivanna ) to bring him to the books but fails miserably resulting in loss of lives. Gana ( the undercover cop character played by Srimurali) is planted as one of the gangsters in Bhairathi Ranagal gang and what unfolds on the screen further is an engaging crime thriller along with predicable drama (with a mixed sequences of politics-comedy-romantic ). Gana slowly understands the pain-points of Bhairathi Ranagal which made him to take up the crime who acts malevolently against the odd ones and remain equally benevolent to the needy ones. Gana who joins the gang to arrest Bhairathi Ranagal ends up becoming an admirer of his benevolence but this underworld-crime thriller, as expected, ends within the confines of the law.\r\n\r\nThe director has cleverly drawn the parallels between the characters ie Srimurali Vs Vashisht Simha, Srimurali Vs Shivanna, Shivanna Vs Devaraj and then there is an emotional parallel between Shivanna and his sister which is expressed through emotional-act with no-word-uttered between the both until the climax. All the roles played by each character stands aplomb.\r\n\r\nEvery star in this film has his own mass-appeal and screen presence which is perfectly used by the Director and nowhere the movie goes beyond the line to overly-commercialize the enterprise( except comedy-romantic tracks).\r\n\r\nShivanna has played many Don roles in the past but this will stand aloof in his list. His acting and more importantly the dialogue delivery looks stylish and something stands as a renewed energy on a whole. Srimurali\u2019s intensity, his high octane action sequences and perfect one-liners takes the lion-pie of Mufti and he perfectly plays as a foil for Shivanna. Then comes Vashisht Simha who plays wily-gangster role and perfectly grabs whatever the screen time is allotted wish his screen time was stretched a bit more. Devaraj, the seasoned actor easily glides into politician role. Prakash Belwadi is apt in small role.\r\n\r\nThe entry scenes of Srimurali and Shivanna, train sequence, action sequence at temple, accident trap by Devaraj for Srimurali with flashback dialogue, pre-climax fight, climax and couple of emotional scenes stands tall along with crisp dialogues. If cinematography by Naveen Kumar is cynosure to eyes then music and background music by Ravi Basrur is the soul of the film.\r\n\r\nIn spite having just two songs in the film and slightly predictable narration the film never dips or bores but what completely distracts or disowns the same narration are the unwanted comedy tracks of Chikkanna-Sadhu Kokila as well as romantic-track between Shanvi Shrivastav and Srimurali. If the Director wants to make this film look classical then he should sit tonight and completely edit these two tracks and send apology letters to the concerned actors involved in these two tracks for editing out their scenes.\r\n\r\nNarthan(who earlier assisted to Prashant Neel for his Ugramm), the Director has choosen the underworld crime thriller to make his perfect launch in a big way. His toil is completely shown on the screen. The story, the roles written for the character, shooting the sequences aesthetically , capacity of handling such big star-cast, the costumes, the sets etc glitters on the screen as drama unfolds with a pulsating background music and visual delighting cinematography.","id":"5def3f9cdc86470011c75526","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5def3f9cdc86470011c75526","movie_id":499990}

When yet another remake of Murder on the Orient express came out I was somewhat hesitant. After all, the one with David Suchet was perfect.\r\n\r\nI guess I was right to be hesitant. This is another one of those remakes where you just wonder\u2026why?

It was poorly done by a clueless scriptwriter and director and it was deeply disrespectful to the original character.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of by introducing Hercule as the pedantic, somewhat weird, person that he is but the attempt is just dumb and silly. Apart from the scene more or less making Hercule look like a jerk, these people apparently know him, why would they serve two eggs of different sizes in the first place? Oh right, because the director thought the audience was too dumb to make that reflection.\r\n\r\nThen there are some things that Hercule simply do not do. Like walking on the roofs of train cars, climbing around and chasing criminals as if he was some action hero. He even gets shot and more or less just shrugs it off for Christ sake!\r\n\r\nAnd do not get me started on that grotesque moustache! As I said, an Americanized version of Hercule Poirot. Unfortunately bigger is not always better.\r\n\r\nI can go on for some time here so let\u2019s move on.\r\n\r\nTechnically the movie is not that bad. The scenes, the decor, the acting in general etc. can even be said to be good. Unfortunately, for me, this was constantly overshadowed by the brutal slaughtering of my beloved Hercule Poirot character.\r\n\r\nPart of this is probably due to the movie trying to focus so much on Hercule that most of the other actors almost feel like \u2026 props, even though they themselves are doing quite a good job of their roles. One reviewer wrote that \u201cThe actors seem to have been invited, not to play characters, but to watch Kenneth Branagh act.\u201d and there seems to be some truth in that.\r\n\r\nThe movie ends with a hint of further moves. Personally, I hope there will not be a continuation of this train wreck (pun intended).","id":"5ad834500e0a26434500cea2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ad834500e0a26434500cea2","movie_id":392044}

She sees again in her mind's eye that other Jonathan as as he'd materialised on the street - sees again the way he merely glanced at her, unseeing, uninterested, as he passed her by. As if they didn't know each other and were not lovers and of course they didn't know each other, were not lovers...Molly recalls speaking his name as if it were a magic talisman that might make things right: Jonathan. But the man's name was James._\r\n\r\n- Joyce Carol Oates; _Lives o__f the Twins_ (1987)\r\n\r\nFrom prolific French auteur Fran\u00e7ois Ozon (_Sous le sable_; _8 femmes_; _Frantz_), _L'amant double_ [_Double Lover_] is partly a study of sexual obsession, partly an oneiric mystery (think Neil Jordan's _In Dreams_), and partly a conventional thriller (more whoisit than whodunnit). \"Freely adapted\" from Joyce Carol Oates's 1987 novel _Lives of the Twins_ (published under the pseudonym Rosamond Smith), and written by Ozon and Philippe Piazzo, the film tells the story of Chlo\u00e9 (Marine Vacth), a woman with a fragile mental state, who falls passionately in love with her psychoanalyst, Paul (J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier). Within a few months, she has moved in, however, as time goes by, she slowly starts to learn of a significant part of his identity which he has been concealing.\r\n\r\nImagine, if you will, _Vertigo_ (1958) remade by someone like Gaspar No\u00e9 or Lars von Trier, and you'd be some way towards getting a handle on Ozon's latest; completely barmy (you know you're in strange territory when the second shot of a movie is, quite literally, an internal shot of a vagina). As one would expect from Ozon, the aesthetics are solid - the film is built upon an inventive visual style employing juxtaposition, pseudo-split screen, and copious amounts of shots with one person in the frame proper, and the person to whom they're talking only visible in reflection. The sound effects are also excellent and really jolt you out of your seat on a couple of occasions. Similarly, the acting is strong, with both Vacth and Renier unrecognisable in their respective roles.\r\n\r\nHowever, the melodramatic and self-congratulatory plot is an absolute mess. Many of Ozon's standard tropes are here; a dissection of the academic middle class\/intelligentsia, an examination of the schism between appearance and reality, an attempt to elucidate the mind of a complex woman, a psychoanalytical bedrock, the mutability of identity etc. But it's all diffused through an utterly farcical narrative, which fails to get even the basics right. For example, sex is a central theme, but by the time we get to the fourth or fifth sex scene, it has completely lost its potency (compare, for example, Abdellatif Kechiche's infinitely superior _La vie d'Ad\u00e8le \u2013 Chapitres 1 & 2_, (2013) where sexuality is just as central, but which features only two sex scenes). The same goes for the increasingly ridiculous plot twists, once you get to three or four and you're still in the first half of the movie, you just stop caring. Ozon has always been hit and miss, for every _Sitcom_ (1998) and _Swimming Pool_ (2003), there's an _Angel_ (2007) and a _Ricky_ (2009), and _L'amant double_ is, in the end, a rather pointless film that seems to think it's saying something exceptionally profound about desire and identity. It isn't.","id":"5cbdce9ec3a368136986c091","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cbdce9ec3a368136986c091","movie_id":451955}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Hail to the Science Fiction gods as they came to their senses and granted upon the eagerly movie-going masses the long-awaited arrival of a stunning and opulent _Blade Runner_ sequel. Perhaps we should praise the understated genius and visionary mastermind Ridley Scott for his 1982 directorial accomplishment in serving up what appeared to be an underappreciated and overlooked SF thriller in its heyday over three decades ago only for it to emerge now as one of the greatest Science Fiction futuristic capers worthy of its cult classic following?\r\n\r\nMaybe the long overdue kudos are reserved for the diehard nostalgic _Blade Runner_ bunch whose committed and fanatical fandom was the key catalyst for this undeniably brilliant, brainy, dazzling and polished presentation to resurface and give new vitalizing breath and striking energy to the Science Fiction genre in conception? Could it be possible that Hollywood simply saw opportunistic and healthy box office receipts to restart another pop cultural juggernaut from yesteryear\u2019s cinematic scene?\r\n\r\nIs there a returning Harrison Ford fixation\/fetish blossoming courtesy of his past blockbuster film resume that boasts the obvious inclusion of prominent SF\/adventure fantasy biggies such as both the _Star Wars_ phenomenon and the _Indiana Jones_ installments with _Blade Runner_ now taking up the matinee mantle?\r\n\r\nRegardless of the film-making forces at hand or the key reasoning for this 164 minute visually arresting odyssey updated and packaged for bombastic _Blade Runner_ enthusiasts and dedicated SF connoisseurs the proof is in the proverbial pudding as **Blade Runner 2049** has made its auspicious presence known and succeeds thrillingly as an indelible wonderment in imagination, intrigue and intelligence.\r\n\r\nBreathtakingly rich and vibrant in its overlong execution, **Blade Runner 2049** is a lustrous escapist epic that resonates with snappy pop, thought-provoking tendencies and atmospheric grittiness that soundly resonates. And yes\u2026the participation of the aforementioned and omnipresent Ford reprising his role from 35 years ago is indeed the appealing and motivating factor to re-enter the anxiety-driven world of intrusive replicants,  societal annihilation and the guessing game of humanity infiltration.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the intense workmanlike charm and structured suspense in the rebooted **Blade Runner 2049** has not missed a single beat as it colorfully brings its brand of contemplative tension and underlying humorous texture to this sumptuous spectacle. Importantly, the film\u2019s philosophical edginess and saturated cynicism stays true to Scott\u2019s unflinching vision of introspection about the valued properties of life and who are the chief architects of such a unique gift of existence. Consequently, speechless Science Fiction audiences once again are transfixed by the mesmerizing yet old adage about the rivaling \u2018have\u2019s and \u2018have nots\u2019 especially so vital in the gloomy squalor and doomsday darkness that Scott created so fervently in his vintage edition that set the stage for renegade blade runners in a power struggle with defiant, roguish replicants disastrously flirting with the sacred boundaries of humankind.\r\n\r\nFilmmaker Denis Villeneuve (\u2018Arrival\u2019, \u2018Sicario\u2019, \u2018Prisoners\u2019) has stepped into some pretty mighty cinematic shoes in dusting of the mothballs of _Blade Runner\u2019s_ haunting and hedonistic past in an accomplished effort to bring forth a percolating potboiler of a challenging and imaginative hue to its succulent successor in 2049 with surging, exquisite aplomb. Screenwriters Michael Green (\u2018Alien: Covenant\u2019, \u2018Logan\u2019) and Hampton Fancher (\u2018Blade Runner\u2019, \u2018The Minus Man\u2019) manage to brilliantly convey the dystopian disillusionment as the caustic yet compelling commentary concerning the decline of humanity and how it is feverishly on the brink of non-existence. The fuzzy lines are crossed for the calculating chaos and corruptible wheels that are turning so aimlessly and shockingly. The sins of sinners, good, bad or indifferent, gloriously are stemmed in moodiness and mystery. Additionally, notably iconic cinematographer Roger Deakins (\u2018Fargo\u2019) cultivates a dank, hazy-coated landscape where shadowy imagery compliments the dour suspicions of determined man versus durable machine co-existing in a hostile futuristic fantasy world of techno-dismal dimensions. Also, kudos are reserved for Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch for their soaring, energetic score that undercuts the tension and turmoil.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Ryan Goslin (Oscar-nominated for 2016\u2019s \u2018La La Land\u2019) is a young blade runner known as \u2018K\u2019 whose mission is to track down veteran Rick Deckard (the returning Harrison Ford\u2026also a former Oscar nominee) in the aftermath of a major uncovered secretive revelation that requires the missing senior badge-flashing blade runner\u2019s undivided attention. The problem remains, however, is that Deckard has been out of circulation for three decades and so the search is on for K to hunt down the long-absent Deckard.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Officer K\u2019s critical and contemplative police work is, to mildly put it, seek out the about-to-expire, unpredictable and resistant replicants and eradicate them when necessary. The replicants, mechanical menaces with artificial intelligence that are living among the humans incognito, are the main focus of the LAPD and K enthusiastically is immersed in the manhunt for the hidden techno-tyrants with militant mindsets that could strike at any moment among the walking flesh. K strives to put them out of their mechanical misery as his sworn duty to serve and protect but he is handcuffed (no pun intended) by the political politeness and procedural proprieties as pushed by his boss Lt. Joshi (Robin Wright). Basically, K is under surveillance based on his fragile mental state and Joshi is the one to contain this gritty-minded cop\u2019s wandering psyche.\r\n\r\nThankfully, there is undeniable texture and intensity that fortifies **Blade Runner 2049** due to the layered and complex story that effectively taps into the robust realm of man\u2019s possible mercy call at the dominant feet of advanced and sophisticated technology. This observational sentiment certainly rings true in contemporary times as selective human beings feel lost, intimidated, overwhelmed and need to surrender to the mounting shifty pressures of an exposed society seemingly ruled by sinning opportunists on both sides of the shady aisle, mechanisms rendered equally with blood and bolts.\r\n\r\nRefreshingly, **Blade Runner 2049** is devoutly cerebral in passion and old school perception. Oddly, Villeneuve\u2019s mixture of science fictional roots and thought-provoking dramatic art house probing works while adding a realistic and somber milieu of existential foreshadowing. Gosling is gloriously geared as the hound dog-faced law enforcer too close for comfort on the fringe of film noir-style burnout as he gets embroiled deep into an abyss of head-scratching discoveries. Ford does not miss a single beat as the gravel-faced, handsome-aged Deckard saddled in adventurous mode despite the matured years since his early 80s heyday in the mundane, ground-breaking _Blade Runner_ blueprint from yesterday. Oscar winner Jared Leto (\u2018Dallas Buyers Club\u2019) joyously lets it all hang out as the wickedly off-kilter character Niander Wallace. The feminine inclusion of Wright\u2019s top policing babysitter Joshi and Ana de Armas as K\u2019s love interest, Joi, are welcomed personalities. Ex-wrestler\/actor Dave Bautista (hot off the \u2018Guardians Of The Galaxy\u2019 film series) is a larger-than-life specimen as always in proven popcorn blockbusters.\r\n\r\nConvincingly well-structured, profound, purposeful and without a prosaic bone in its bountiful body **Blade Runner 2049** is stunningly sumptuous Science Fiction theater for the thinking man and for the progressive machinery master-blasters as well.\r\n\r\n**Blade Runner 2049** (2017)\r\n\r\nWarner Bros.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**I like my ending better! Not the one comes after that!**\r\n\r\nIt was a little surprise film, but not that great. I really enjoyed it. It was thrilling, suspense and fast paced storytelling. I usually like this type of flicks. If you too prefer entertainment over a masterpiece, then you would enjoy it as well. Only the beginning was slow, but once the concept of the film ignited, it was a non-stop entertainment. So the later parts are like between the two characters that took place in an isolated place. A great setting and with all the development, the film totally gets you.\r\n\r\nA struggling alcoholic writer who got rescued by a stranger at a diner, invites him to the home for the stormy night ahead. Later the stranger decides to help him out with his writing, so his stay extends. With talking to each other, the writer comes to know what kind of person he's brought into his house. His agenda ires the stranger and hence a conflict begins between them. The rest of the film is to disclose who ends where with a twist at the end.\r\n\r\nWhen the second act begins, that's when your guessing game starts. At the end of that section, I had in my mind that at least 4 to 5 possible paths the story could head. With that kind of option, who won't enjoy such film. Whatever I predicted, that did not happen. That's another reason why I liked it. The twist was good, and so the performances by Jonathan Rhye Meyers and Antonio Banderas. BUT when all was going well, the end scene before the credits, disappointed me. It should have not been in the film at all. That's why I did not like 'Prince of Persia' too.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I have put off viewing this film for quite a while. The main reason for this is that I am somewhat reluctant watching a movie where the story is pretty well known before you sit down to watch it. However a few days ago I finally did and, given all the hype, I have to say that I expected more, a lot more.\r\n\r\nSure the movie is a cinematically very well down movie. Acting, camera and all that is excellent. Unfortunately that is all there is.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, where the hell did the over-inflated budget go? Dunkirk was a major undertaking with almost 400 000 soldiers involved and hundreds and hundreds of boats. We get to see what? A few columns of soldiers, a handful of boats and three pitiful spitfires against a bomber and two Fock Wulfes. To add to this insult we pretty much get to see the same bloody event over and over from different angles. This is an insult to all the brave men that made this rescue possible.\r\n\r\nThere are a few likable people in the movie. Like the Navy commander and the elderly guy on the pleasure boat steaming to rescue. The rest are either psychotic or morons.\r\n\r\nRealism? Not so much. Like the scene where a bunch of soldiers are trapped in a boat being shot to pieces. Would any one in their right mind really have thought they could plug dozens and dozens of holes with their hands and then sail across the channel?\r\n\r\nThen we have the spitfire which runs out of fuel and glides around forever over the beach so the director can get some scenic shots done. Other times fairly large boats gets damaged and flips over in seconds.\r\n\r\nI would also have expected some pre-story. Some build up. But no, the story starts right away with these measly handful of boats and planes taking for bloody ever to drag themselves over to where they are supposed to go.\r\n\r\nQuite a disappointment indeed.","id":"5c2b93dec3a3682913a152be","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c2b93dec3a3682913a152be","movie_id":374720}

{"author":"defjeff","content":"Dunkirk is a beautiful and unconventional World War 2 epic that is undoubtedly captivating, but it takes risks that may alienate some viewers. \r\n\r\nWhen people talk about a film they think it's about the setting, but it's actually about the characters. Saving Private Ryan isn't about World War 2. It tells a story about a squad of soldiers tasked with finding a young Private Ryan and getting him back safely to his family. Saying Dunkirk is a film about the Battle of Dunkirk however, is not inaccurate. The setting and characters are one. The choppy waters of the English Channel are equally as important, if not more so than the people who fought and died in them. As much as this makes for an interesting way to make a mainstream war film, it's also the reason why I wouldn't care to sit through it again. In some ways, it feels like watching a documentary with the narration turned off. \r\n\r\nI walked away impressed, and at the same time emotionally and intellectually unfulfilled.","id":"59b8094f9251417e650011f9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59b8094f9251417e650011f9","movie_id":374720}
{"author":"Pierre_D","content":"Tense film draws you to a doomed group.\r\n\r\nThose how are veteran war historians will quibble at some parts of Dunkirk, notably the separation of English and French troops in evacuation and the ships used to evacuate them. Dunkirk uses a few conceits to keep you involved. The first, which adds a notable amount of tension to the film, is a ticking clock in the background moving you to the final day. We see intercut scenes from different periods, prior, during and enacting the rout.\r\n\r\nActing is excellent throughout, and versimilitude is achieved with models of aircraft, uniforms, landing stages and so on. Injections of friendship and subsequent loss direct our affection to the sufferers. Harry Styles is more than competent as a young troop and Kenneth Branagh brings integrity and verve to his role as a tired and firm leader. If one oversight might have been addressed, it is the lack of focus on the German side of things in this affair. Our few glimpses are of German fighters and so on, with very explanation of the goings-on at the front.\r\n\r\nOverall an excellent war movie meant to be among your top ten, if not top five (It will be hard to dislodge All Quiet on the Western Front, Apocalypse Now, Paths of Glory, Saving Private Ryan and Tora Tora Tora!, among others). Recommend highly a good 8\/10.","id":"5984ff1fc3a36875040120b5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5984ff1fc3a36875040120b5","movie_id":374720}

Dunkirk did a great job of allowing us to focus less on the actors and more on the story. I feel this movie put me in the story and allowed to experience first hand some of the lives that were impacted.\r\n\r\nThere wasn\u2019t a lot of character building in this movie, but that\u2019s what I loved, I feel like I was allowed to more so build on the experience over one person\u2019s story.

There were multiple stories and perspectives, all which immerse you into the current situation.\r\n\r\nChristopher Nolan did a great job of creating an overwhelming feeling of hopelessness throughout the movie, I felt like I could never feel safe and constantly looked for a way out.

The icing on the cake is she brilliantly & ruthlessly performed it. She deserves compliments, accolades & credits for it. Sshivada already proved her acting talent in \"Nedunchaalai\" & \"Zero\", thus this is easily another feather in her cap. As audience, we hardly come across Tamil actress who carried significant role on their shoulders. Sshivada has all the potential to grab the special place as a good actress soon if she consistently acting in this type of vital roles.\r\n\r\n\"Thandhiraa\" song need special mention here, S.N. Anuradha's lyrics beautifully summarize the Vasundara character.\r\n\r\nLyrics excerpts:\r\n\"Adiye nee kalavaani kutti kaattaeri\r\nkannaadi dhegathil kaattaaru nee\r\n\r\nAmul baby makeup-il Anakonda nee\r\n\r\nAzhagaana sadhigaari adangaa pidaari\r\nSidharaamal pandhaadum siru marmam nee\r\n\r\nBarbie doll getup-il pachchondhi nee\r\n\r\nAzhagaana abaththae ival thaane vilagu\"\r\n\r\nAbishek Joseph George - I like his body language, expressions, performance as a blind man.

Outshines better than the two lead roles (Kalaiyarasan & Janani Iyer).\r\n\r\nBala Saravanan's entry initially makes me feel like this film lost it's track since comical episodes seems appear nowhere in a serious subject. I need to admit that the comical portions was relief and it's not spoil the core subject of this film & it's good too.\r\n\r\nIf you like C. V.

That too coming from a nation like Canada is a bad example. The other film was 'The Wall'. There should be no mercy on terrorism and pisslam.

You can't choose wisely, because there's no good terrorism and bad terrorism.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, Seasn Bean was good. Except the opening, it is a one day event film and most of the film take place in a house. The film was one sided perspective. Hence it gave a wrong message! I don't know why some filmmaker set to give people wrong information. It's only nurturing evil over good.

{"author":"jessetaylor","content":"This film defies being rated on a scale of 1 through 5 - it's truly almost impossible to do so. I want to rate this a 5 and I want to rate this a 3 at the same time. Both would be wrong though so I'll just settle in the middle. Aronofsky has given us many brainsick films in the past, but this is on a whole other level. Remember the batshit crazy climax of _Requiem for a Dream_? Multiply that by 50 and you get the batshit crazy climax of mother! - and that is a *huge* understatement.\r\n\r\nI don't really want to talk too much about the film's plot or the finale as not much about the film is known to the public at this point. It's absolutely worth it to go into this film as blind as possible or maximum effectiveness. All I'll say is that the _Rosemary's Baby_ influenced poster and marketing so far is a big curve ball - it has nothing to do with that film although Polanski horror elements are clearly an inspiration to Aronofsky here.\r\n\r\nI do want to praise three specific elements of this film that worked the best for me: (1) The sound design was absolutely magnificent. There is no score to this film - not quite sure what J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hansson did here - but the sound design is eerie as hell and supremely memorable. (2) The production design is next level. The house in this film is basically the co-lead (you'll see what I mean when you watch it) and it evolves drastically over the course of the film (again, you'll see what I mean when you watch it). Excellent art direction that I haven't stopped thinking about all day. (3) The performance from Jennifer Lawrence is harrowing as she really gave herself to this film and to Aronofksy's vision, but the performance that stuck with me is the one from Michelle Pfeiffer. She really embodied her character and even though she's only in maybe the first 60% of the film, she left a deep impression on the rest of it as well. Her character is crucial to the film and she injected such mystery and gravity to the events that followed her exit.\r\n\r\nWill soon watch this again and hopefully have more meaningful thoughts. It's hard to say too much right now when hardly anyone has seen the film yet, but believe me, there is a lot to be said about _mother!_","id":"59bb363dc3a3680efe005032","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59bb363dc3a3680efe005032","movie_id":381283}

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"Mountain peaks with its immersive cinematic photography and glacial poetry. \u201cMountains were places of peril, not beauty. An upper world to be shunned, not sought out. How then have mountains now come to hold a spellbound? Drawing us into their dominion. Often at the cost of lives. Because the mountains we climb are not made only of rock and ice, but also dreams...and desire. The mountains we climb, are mountains of the mind.\u201d\r\n\r\nPassages from Macfarlane\u2019s book \u2018Mountains of the Mind\u2019 sweep through the piercing crevices of Ozturk\u2019s mountaineering photography, accompanied by Dafoe\u2019s heavenly soothing narration. Exploring the relationship between humanity and mountains across time, \u201cinto a space where time warps...and bends\u201d. Providing insight into their alluring endangerment, the mind\u2019s requirement to feel alive. A lust for death-defying experiences where the stoic poses of grandiose mountains intimidate, cursed with the uncontrollable meteorology that governs them. Souls perish beneath the snow encrusted rocks. Others enlightened by the achievement they have just accomplished. \u201cSensations are thrillingly amplified\u201d. Earth\u2019s most imposing natural wonders of the world, have now become passions. \u201cOur fascination became an obsession\u201d. To conquer. To discover. To relinquish one\u2019s self unto the summits where deities rest.\r\n\r\nMountain refuses to be categorised as just a documentary, but rather cinematic immersion. Enabling nature\u2019s seduction to beguile and mesmerise. Towering peaks hypnotise to the accompaniment of Beethoven and Vivaldi\u2019s stringed odes. The Australian Chamber Orchestra supplying an additional poetic interpretation to the lofty heights of snow-capped summits. Panoramic horizons woven into a methodical observation, edited exquisitely to create a narrative flow. The first expedition to Everest. Humanity\u2019s eternal desire to achieve the unachievable. Modern tourism and its environmental impact. Extreme sports. Nature\u2019s water cycle. A symphony of characteristics brought together to enrapture those who dream of the bone deep cold. Stunning. Bewitching. Photographic beauty that is rarely surpassed onscreen. For every shot of these formidable rock formation, is a mental link that questions the psychology of humanity. A surprisingly affecting and visceral experience.\r\n\r\nHowever, much like the terrain that is captured, its pace is uneven. The balance between physical and human geography tipped towards the latter. Aspects such as the water cycle, volcanic surplus and glacial formations failed to coincide with the human element that enveloped this documentary. Furnishing no insight other than to resemble a rudimentary geography lesson one would watch at school. The daredevil stunts, mountaineering expeditions and environmental detriments were at the forefront, fortunately. Still, even these aspects were depicted unevenly with the environmentalism garnering a total of five minutes of the runtime. Considering the feature is just over an hour long, its secondary message had insufficient time to manifest.\r\n\r\nTo end this review, a passage from Macfarlane\u2019s book, which should be read just for its exquisite poetry in itself, will suffice and perfectly sum up Mountain as a feature. \u201cStone and ice though are far less gentle to the hand\u2019s touch than to the mind\u2019s eye. The mountains of the Earth have often turned out to be more resistant, more fatally real, than the mountains we imagine\u201d.","id":"5e21841b397df000169818da","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e21841b397df000169818da","movie_id":462145}

{"author":"fung0","content":"_American Made_ is a peculiar film, but a very enjoyable one. It takes a playful, satirical look at the origins of the notorious 'Iran-Contra' affair, through the eyes of pilot Barry Seal. Along the ways we get thrills, laughs, astonishing (true-life) twists and turns and some vivid characters.\r\n\r\nEven if you followed the public Iran-Contra scandal, you may be unfamiliar with the story of Seal, who started running guns for the CIA years before the familiar public scandal erupted. American Made is a fast, breezy, amoral look at the ins and outs of a covert operation made to go wrong. There's no judgment here; in fact, we come to like Seal's crazy make-it-up-as-you-go-along approach to flying, to crime and to life in general.\r\n\r\nTom Cruise is perfectly cast as the cocky, reckless pilot. I've done a fair bit of flying, and I've met one or two hot-shots like (in a lesser degree) the one Cruise portrays. Cruise has lately been playing parts that are much too young for him (e.g. _Jack Reacher: Never Go Back_), but his age works well in this case. In a way, Seal is a guy fighting to stay young.\r\n\r\nIf there's one there's one thing to regret about _American Made_ it's that it carefully avoids most of the political backdrop. We're told that the Sandinistas were evil Russian-backed Communists, which is undoubtedly what the CIA would have said at the time. (Hindsight is more ambiguous.) We're shown, just barely, how the Reagan administration evolved a cockeyed criminal scheme for its own ends, but the film ends where the public Iran-Contra scandal began. Ollie North is a presence in only one or two shots.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, Barry Seal's personal story arc is wrapped up perfectly. The ending doesn't let anyone off the hook, but it does leave us questioning our own moral position, as we're inevitably drawn to like and admire Barry Seal, in spite of his total lack of scruples or judgment.\r\n\r\nDoug Liman directs with his usual flair.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This movie has been sitting on my unwatched shelf for quite a while and yesterday I finally got around to watch it.\r\n\r\nI actually found this movie to be not too bad actually. It is far from a cinematic masterpiece but it is a pretty solid action\/revenge movie. Dylan O\u2019Brien is, unfortunately, pretty meh as the main character. Michael Keaton on the other hand is quite good in his character.\r\n\r\nIt is a reasonably action filled movie and I really like that they didn\u2019t try to turn it into some PG-13 crap. It is sometimes fairly brutal. The story is okay. It works. It is not overly complex and some people are probably moaning about it not being original enough. Well, I say, so what? It is a good concept so why screw with it? I do like revenge movies and although this one is far from the best, it is not at all shabby.\r\n\r\nI wonder why some people seems to be claiming that this movie is just crap, one star out of ten and so on and so forth? Is it maybe because it dares bring up the subject of Islamist fanatics killing innocents? Or maybe because it doesn\u2019t try to sugarcoat things and explain these \u201cpoor misunderstood\u201d psychopaths but lays the blame straight on said lowlife as well as on Iran? Or maybe because it doesn\u2019t try to blame certain of today\u2019s political retards\u2019 preferred boogieman Russia?\r\n\r\nI have not read the book so I guess, if it doesn\u2019t do the book justice, I can somewhat understand not liking it. However, to me, this was a decent, not spectacular but decent, two hours of entertainment. Decent action, decent speed and (with the exception of O\u2019Brien) decent acting.","id":"5d6392abbc8abc193a252333","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d6392abbc8abc193a252333","movie_id":415842}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**They're trying to bring back the series!**\r\n\r\nSo the Amityville series continues. What this is like overall a tenth film. The last one was a decade ago. I'm okay with their idea of bringing it up. But there's nothing new in it. Only it was a different cast and timeline. So basically, you probably have seen this story in other flicks.\r\n\r\nA family of a single mother with one child with a serious medical condition moves into the most popular haunted house, the Amityville. The other one, a teen girl discovers the rumours from her new schoolmates. But the mother won't heed to it, till unusual events begin to unfold. So how it all ends are the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nThe cast was good, and that's it, the film was average. If you are a big fan of horror, then this would be even a worse film, because you might have seen hundreds of similar flicks. I think Amityville franchise is dead, because of bad storied films.

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_I really wanted to hate it!_**\r\n \r\n> _When I placed my head on my pillow, I did not sleep, nor could I be said to think. My imagination, unbidden, possessed and guided me, gifting the successive images that arose in my mind with a vividness far beyond the usual bounds of reverie. I saw - with shut eyes, but acute mental vision, - I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life, and stir with an uneasy, half vital motion.

He sleeps; but he is awakened; he opens his eyes; behold the horrid thing stands at his bedside, opening his curtains, and looking on him with yellow, watery, but speculative eyes._\r\n\r\n- Mary Shelley; \"Introduction\" to the 1831 Revised Edition of _Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus_\r\n\r\nWatching _Mary Shelley_ was a curious experience. I knew I should hate it, because, although it gets many of the facts right, it gets a massive amount wrong, and thematically, it's a mess. As an English academic by trade, it really should have irritated me no end. Additionally, pretty much everyone I know who has seen it (both academics and non) have loathed it. And I found it very difficult to disagree with any of the criticisms they had. The film is, in places, laughably bad. But for all that, whilst I most certainly didn't love it, nor did I hate it. In fact, I actually liked quite a bit of it. I'm ashamed!\r\n\r\nOkay. Let's get the basics out of the way. Directed by Haifaa Al-Mansour (_Wadjda_), and written by Emma Jenson (Al-Mansour is credited with \"additional writing\"), the film bills itself as the true story behind the composition of Mary Shelley's (Elle Fanning) first (and best) novel, _Frankenstein_ (1818), with the poster proclaiming, \"_Her greatest love inspired her darkest creation_\". This is essentially false advertising; of the two hour run-time, the writing of the novel takes up roughly twenty minutes of the last half hour. Instead, the film is a fairly insipid love story, beginning shortly before the first meeting of Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin and Percy Bysshe Shelley (Douglas Booth) in 1812, and culminating in 1819, after the initial anonymous publication of _Frankenstein_.\r\n\r\nAs a love story, the film's main focus is, obviously, the ebb and flow of the relationship between Mary and Shelley. With this as the organising principle, and Mary herself as the lynch-pin to the whole endeavour, many of the main events in those seven years are covered; Mary's stay in Scotland with William Baxter (Owen Richards), where she first met Shelley; her difficult relationship with her father, William Godwin (Stephen Dillane); Shelley's unexpected arrival in London at Godwin's invitation; the collapse of Shelley's marriage to Harriet Westbrook (Ciara Charteris); the antagonism between Mary and her stepmother, Mary Jane Clairmont (Joanne Froggatt); Mary's attempts to escape the shadow cast by her deceased mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, author of the mildly influential _A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects_ (1792); her close friendship with her stepsister, Claire Clairmont (Bel Powley); the elopement of Mary, Claire, and Shelley, and their constant struggle with debt; Shelley's concepts of \"free love\"; the death of Mary and Shelley's first child; the summer of 1816 in Geneva, when she and Shelly stayed with the \"_mad, bad, and dangerous to know_\" (to quote Lady Caroline Lamb's famous description) Lord Byron (Tom Sturridge); Mary's friendship with Dr. John Polidori (Ben Hardy) and the tragedy concerning his short story, \"The Vampyre: A Tale\" (1819); and, ultimately, Mary's composition of _Frankenstein_.\r\n\r\nThe overarching A-B-C is all present and accounted for, but, within that reasonably accurate framework, there are a huge number of omissions, inaccuracies, and unwelcome interpolations. For everything the film gets right, it gets so much more wrong. For example, although it correctly shows that Shelley was of the opinion that Mary and Thomas Hogg (Jack Hickey) should become lovers, it fails to acknowledge that Mary herself wasn't entirely opposed to the idea, and was actually good friends with Hogg, whom she often confided in. Upon the death of her first child, she wrote to Hogg,\r\n\r\n> _My dearest Hogg my baby is dead-will you come to see me as soon as you can. I wish to see you-It was perfectly well when I went to bed - I awoke in the night to give it suck it appeared to be_ sleeping _so quietly that I would not awake it. It was dead then, but we did not find that out till morning - from its appearance it evidently died of convulsions - Will you come - you are so calm a creature & Shelley is afraid of a fever from the milk - for I am no longer a mother now._\r\n\r\nIn the film, Hogg is a lech who tries to force himself on Mary. The film also gets it right that Shelley and Mary first expressed their love for one another at her mother's grave, but it shies away from what many scholars believe; that Mary lost her virginity to Shelley on or near the grave. Instead, the film features a dreadful clich\u00e9d sex scene in a bedroom bathed in firelight. More romantic? Probably. Historically accurate? Almost certainly not. Another point that's presented fairly accurately is the poor living conditions after Mary, Shelley, and Claire elope, and the fact that they were constantly in debt and frequently had to flee their lodgings in the middle of the night. However, the film fails to depict or even hint at the fact that Shelley and Claire were, for a time, lovers. Finally, although the film correctly depicts many of the details of the summer of 1816, it neglects to show that Mary was taking large quantities of laudanum for pretty much the entire time she was in Geneva.\r\n\r\nRegarding the performances, first we have Tom Sturridge as Byron. Good lord in heaven! Again the film gets the basics right - Byron was notoriously lavish, flamboyant, and fickle, living a life of excess, even for a Romantic poet, and well known for using and discarding women, and, on occasion, men. However, Sturridge's performance is a thing to behold. He has always tended towards overacting, but his performance here makes Al Pacino's work in Harold Becker's _City Hall_ (1996) look positively catatonic. It's just laughable how bad he is in the role, turning Byron into a cartoon character. Stephen Dillane's Godwin is also problematic. Dillane is an immense actor with an extraordinary range (compare his performances in Antoine Fuqua's _King Arthur_, _Game of Thrones_, and Charlie Brooker's _A Touch of Cloth_), but he plays Godwin identically to how he played Leonard Woolf in Stephen Daldry's _The Hours_ - a put-upon, buttoned-down intellectual, trying not to offend anyone, talented in his own right, but living in the shadow of the greater talents of people he loves. Jane Froggatt plays Clairmont as a wicked stepmother straight out of Disney, with no depth to the character whatsoever. A lot of reviews have heavily criticised Fanning's work as Mary, but I thought she was okay in the role. Not spectacular, but not as bad as I expected. Her accent isn't too bad either (and certainly better than Maisie Williams's ridiculous Scottish brogue). However, one can't help but wonder what Saoirse Ronan would have done in the role, had she chosen to do _Mary Shelley_ instead of Josie Rourke's _Mary, Queen of Scots_ (2018).\r\n\r\nHowever, easily the biggest problem with the film, and the one that most of my colleagues and friends have trashed with the most fervour, is the script. First of all, it tries to cover too much, and instead of saying a lot about a few events, it says little of interest about a lot of events. But its biggest flaw is that it reduces one of the greatest love affairs of all time to a series of ridiculous and repetitive petty squabbles that wouldn't be out of place in an episode of _EastEnders_. The film is at pains to impart how empyrean Mary is, presenting her as a character whose soul is infused with the poetry of an era. However, when depicting her squabbles with Shelley, she's reduced to little more than a cipher for her beliefs, as is he in relation to his. As they literally have the exact same argument about five times in the film, and each time, because their characters have been reasonably well defined, the fact that they're arguing about things that they are well aware of makes the whole thing seem ludicrous; it's all about his free love and failure to provide for Mary clashing with her protofeminism and political sensibility. The film essentially gives us a _CliffsNotes_ summary of some of the key texts of the day, including Godwin's _An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice, and its Influence on Morals and Happiness_ (1793), but it completely fails to provide a solid political or philosophical context, with both Mary and Shelley seemingly existing in some kind of intellectual bubble of their own creation. Lastly, the attempt to link passages from _Frankenstein_ to specific events in Mary's life via flashbacks, is horrendous; poorly conceived, and just as poorly executed.\r\n\r\nHowever, for all that, I can't hate it. Al-Mansour (the first woman from Saudi Arabia to direct a Hollywood funded movie) directs the film confidently and competently. The period detail is excellent. Amelia Warner's score is rousing in places, Caroline Koener's costumes are well designed, Paki Smith's (_Free Fire_) production design is impressively detailed, and David Ungaro's (_A Prayer Before Dawn_) cinematography is suitably gritty. There are also some fine performances; Booth is pitch-perfect as a frustrated and free-thinking Shelley, and Ben Hardy is superb as Polidori, whose tragedy is unfortunately glossed over far too quickly.\r\n\r\nSo, with all that said, it's not a film I'd recommend unreservedly, but it's not something I'd warn people not to see. In fact, one of the questions I had after watching it was who was it made for; who was the target audience? Academics and people familiar with the events will almost universally hate it, whilst a more mainstream audience used to superhero movies and explosions will find it boring beyond belief. A very curious experience!","id":"5cc25c990e0a265b0ff11e31","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cc25c990e0a265b0ff11e31","movie_id":332283}
{"author":"sykobanana","content":"How does a non-actor become the lead in the highest grossing movie of the year and then not continue to act afterwards?  Do we have a new genre of film \u2013 the Docody (can I call a documentary-comedy that, because it sounded better than commedary)?  Is all of this just stranger than fiction?  \r\n\r\nAll of these could be used to describe this film, but there is so much more to George Lazenby's life story... especially the way he tells it...  So, what is it then?\r\n\r\nFirstly, Becoming Bond is not the Thin Blue Line, Grizzly Man, Bowling for Columbine, Citizenfour or any of the Oscar winning documentaries that you've seen.  \r\n\r\nIn Becoming Bond, Lazenby talks about his life, at times brutal honesty and poignancy.  Distilled from about forty hours of interviews, it could be surmised as boy meets girl, boy becomes man, man becomes Bond \u2013 but that sells it short.  \r\n\r\nGeorge has lived an interesting life and describes it in equally engaging ways.  What this means for the narrative is that sometimes the truth is not always bland... so much so that 40 minutes in:\r\nDirector: \tHow much of this story that you\u2019ve told me is true?\r\nGeorge:\tWhich one?\r\nDirector: \tThe whole story...\r\nGeorge: \tHey, how can I remember it if it wasn\u2019t true?\r\n\r\nBecoming Bond is made similarly to Touching the Void with actors dramatising parts of the story.  But where that doco was drama, this is more comedic and fittingly, the acting here is playful \u2013 reminiscent of the TV series and archetypes of that era (think Batman or the Brady Bunch).  \r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is solid, the directing and editing are sound and the score hints at Bond themes whilst staying individual (much like George's Bond).  Josh Lawson has obvious fun (he picks up George's swagger and little mannerisms well) and little cameos also pepper the film (Jane Seymour, Dana Carvey).  \r\n\r\nOne criticism that can be raised is that the secondary characters are very one dimensional, but I feel this is in line with the narrative of the film \u2013 it's George's take on his own life.  \r\n\r\nBecoming Bond is one of the most enjoyable documentaries I've seen.  \r\nIt's not a perfect film; Shakespearianly dramatic; nor is it covering a life changing topic.   \r\n\r\nBut what makes this movie special is that its just how I'd picture it if I happened to have the good fortune to ask George the same questions over a beer or six.  \r\n\r\nAnd thats a credit to both the filmmakers and Lazenby.","id":"5a5740160e0a2607d7036d9c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a5740160e0a2607d7036d9c","movie_id":438493}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"For some frightfest filmmakers the challenge of molding and shaping the horror genre in their own imaginative vision is a definite given. The horror genre is a broad scope of a creepy canvas in which movie-makers can manipulate the kinds of colorful fear and tension that they want to convey artistically. Writer-director-producer James Cullen Bressack is no different when catering to his brand of glossy horror-themed hedonism in certain substance and style. Bressack\u2019s **Bethany** is the nightmarish narrative rooted in conventional creepiness that is surreal enough to be considered somewhat intriguing yet routinely atmospheric in its traumatic presentation. Nevertheless, the twenty-something Bressack is loaded with the potential behind the camera and one can measure the enthusiasm of his supernatural endeavors embedded in the somber-induced **Bethany**. Still, Bressack\u2019s 90-minute stretched-out cinematic shock-to-the-system is recycled, saggy and manufactured.\r\n\r\n**Bethany** pretty much sticks to the familiar formula of the hellish horror playbook and one wishes that if Bressack had the gumption to deviate from such a known pedestrian format than perhaps his goosebump spectacle could have benefited from a welcomed twist of an unpredictable edginess. Essentially, **Bethany** is a laundry list of follow-the-dots caustic cliches that include the obligatory unknown factors of a haunted house, a beleaguered and possessed little girl, strange happenings that transpire in the darkness, spousal indifference and uncertainty and a miserable maternal presence lurking in the shadows. Unfortunately, Bressack presents a disjointed juggling act as all the sketchy and bizarre elements in **Bethany** feel cobbled together to tell a rather drowsy, nail-biting tale.\r\n\r\nThe scary story is jointly anchored by Aaron (played by the film\u2019s co-screenwriter Zack Ward) as a businessman whose decision to relocate to a large dilapidated house that he has inherited with his wife Claire (Stephanie Estes) will prove costly as time marches on within this haphazard homestead. In fact, the inherited house in question happens to be Claire\u2019s abode from a youthful yesteryear. Both Aaron and Claire are conflicted although the spotty script gives the main source of meaty mayhem to Estes\u2019s Claire as she is bombarded by inescapable childhood memories that rack her tainted soul to no end. Naturally, the horrifying house triggers all the kiddie-minded chaos and corruption that the minor Claire (played by Anna Harr) endured while constantly bombarding her in flashback scenes that feature her problematic mother Susan (Shannon Doherty). Of course the legitimate antagonist that haunts Claire more than ever is an imaginary friend \u201cBethany\u201d\u2013an intrusive spirit that yearns for her undivided attention something fierce. However, Bethany is not to be ignored and things start to get really vitriolic under her spooky roof. After all, a nasty bowl full of cockroaches flowing out of Claire\u2019s food seems tame to the other kinds of freakish occurrences taking place.\r\n\r\nSo what is Claire to do concerning her recurring household hallucinations? Better yet, how can Claire conquer her personalized demons in the form of a developing breakdown highlighted by a double dose of insanity and mishandling of reality? Well, for starters Claire\u2019s and Aaron\u2019s psychologist Dr. Brown (played in refreshing fashion by off-kilter comedian Tom Green) tries to get to the bottom of his disillusioned patient\u2019s piercing plight.\r\n\r\nBethany wants to forcefully tackle the questionable mental state of its harried heroine and this is an interesting notion on paper. However, co-scripters Bressack and Ward (outside of their directorial and acting duties) fall short because the film does not have the sturdy depth, construction or creative confines to pull off such a revelation involving a vulnerable woman\u2019s psychological capacity (or incapacity in this particular case). It feels more as a tepid tease than a tactical strategy to delve into the dysfunctional dynamics of a broken woman hindered by a checkered past. One becomes indifferent as to whether they want to venture a guess as to whether or not Estes\u2019s Claire\u2019s ghostly torment is genuine or perhaps an exaggerated figment of her twisted imagination.\r\n\r\nSadly, the awkward techniques that Bressack (and Estes\u2019s bewildered performance) incorporates through aforementioned cryptic flashbacks and recollections seem quite artificial. There have been previous recent horror showcases that explore the topical fodder of a lost woman losing her mental marbles in a horrible house of reminiscing that were received slightly better with fresher eyes from the moviegoers that originally viewed these similar themed scare flicks. Films such as Nicolas Pesce\u2019s _The Eyes of My Mother_ and Mickey Keating\u2019s _Darling_ from 2016 easily eclipses the same premise currently being ushered in the seemingly retread **Bethany**.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, **Bethany** boasts some decently measured performances particularly from the better known supporting players in one-time spastic _Freddy Got Fingered_ irksome personality Tom Green as the cerebral head shrink out to examine Claire\u2019s nerve-racking noggin and former explosive TV tart Shannon Doherty as the misguided Mommy Dearest from yesterday. Clearly, audiences have seen the sordid antics as displayed in **Bethany** countless times before so there is nothing really distinctive or daring that would suggest this gory vehicle to be nothing more than a visceral run-of-the-mill roller-coaster sitting on some complimentary chills and thrills. It is too bad that there was not more macabre meat on the blistering bone surrounding the household hysterics of a wounded woman on the edge of dismissive delusional destruction.\r\n\r\n**Bethany** (2017)\r\n\r\nSTARRING: Stefanie Estes, Zack Ward, Tom Green, Shannon Doherty, Anna Harr, Keith Jardine\r\n\r\nUncork\u2019 d Entertainment\/Brilliant Screen Studios\r\n\r\n1 hr. 30 mins.\r\n\r\nDIRECTOR\/WRITER: James Cullen Bressack\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: NR\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** (2017)","id":"58d1be02c3a36838d500f283","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58d1be02c3a36838d500f283","movie_id":444109}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Only beauty would conquer the beast!**\r\n\r\nThis is not the first time screen adaptation, that means every one of us have seen either version of the films according to what generation we belong. Mine was the animated one and then there was a modern-day version called 'Beastly'. Not to forget there's a recent French version made on the big scale that I yet to watch. So it's not about the story at all. It is about the quality of film, performances, and particularly how the modern technology used to narrate the story.\r\n\r\nLike the recent Disney's live-actions 'Cinderella', 'The BFG', 'The Jungle Book' and many more, this is another excellently adapted film from the book. Though visually it tried to be true to the original, and that's absolutely great thinking. Because in this modern world, we all try something new out of the original contents for sometimes to mess it up.\r\n\r\nExcellent casting, the beauty was the best pick among all. The graphics were awesome. The CGI beast was flawless, yet that usual dark and cloudy atmosphere helped it to be so perfect. Since it is listed under Musical, I was worried about the songs. I truly don't like modern Musicals. But this film was not completely filled with songs. Yes, there were like half a dozen, but good ones. Retained the songs from the 1991 film, and in addition three new were composed.\r\n\r\nI did not think the Disney would get away with consecutive successes. Great achievement, and their attempts were very precautionary on their every step. Now this is Disney's second highest grossed film ever and first in live-action. The film was for all ages unlike old Disney films. That's the best thing about the modern Disney films that they have adopted.

For me, this is like hundredth. When I first saw the trailer, I said 'not again'. 'Time loop' is just a concept, but the storyline for it drawn differently.

{"author":"Toxic Fletch","content":"A slow paced film for sure, Hex overcomes this ultimately offering a beautiful and haunting experience for those with patience and attentiveness.\r\n\r\nDuring the English Civil War two soldiers from opposite sides of the conflict find themselves alone in the woods against each other. As one is older and thus more experienced things are not equal between them, but the elder soldier underestimates the younger soldier's survival instinct in what leads to a cat and mouse game during which they discover they are not as alone as they thought and find themselves unable to leave the woods, trapped by a witch.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography in Hex is simply beautiful taking full advantage of lush woodland scenery and an old ruins. Re-enactment props and costumes give it an authentic look, combined with the scenery, beyond its means. The audio in this is truly amazing, from the slightest brush of tall grass to a crackle in a fire to a babble in a brook, the environment is full and crisp.\r\n\r\nThree incredibly talented actors bring to life a story tautly stretched in tension. The director keeps the mystery going making good use of the surroundings, the night, and of course the unknown. Fear and suspicion rule day and night for the soldiers, not only of an unseen enemy but of an unknown trust as to whether they could turn on each other at any moment. The tension plays out as thick as the tall grass in the meadows.\r\n\r\nThis is not a story of just a moment in history, as that is its adornment, but within is an allegory pertinent in our times that certainly provides something to think about and stays with you, for those who don't shrink away from it. Slow paced it is, and it could have used some trimming in my opinion, but beautiful and haunting throughout is what sight, sound and an open mind will reveal.","id":"5a14bfc8c3a36807330010cc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a14bfc8c3a36807330010cc","movie_id":486892}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_A well-told love story, set against a background of religious orthodoxy_**\r\n\r\n> _An important point to make from the outset is that Jewish law does_ not _teach that it is forbidden to be a homosexual. On the contrary, Jewish law is concerned not with the source of a person's erotic urges nor with inner feelings, but with acts. The Torah forbids the homosexual_ act_, known as_ mishkav zakhar_, but has nothing to say about homosexuality as a state of being or a personal inclination._\r\n\r\n> _In other words, traditionally, a person with a homosexual inclination can be an entirely observant Jew a__s long as he or she does not act out that inclination._\r\n> \r\n[...]\r\n\r\n> _Lesbianism is never mentioned in the Torah. One talmudic passage refers to homosexual acts between women: \"R. Huna taught, Women who have sex one with the other are forbidden to marry a Kohen.\" The_ Halakhah _rejects Rav Huna's opinion and allows a lesbian to marry a Kohen. However, Maimonides ruled that lesbianism is still prohibited and should be punished by flagellation. The prohibition is not as stringent as that against male homosexuality because the Torah does not explicitly prohibit les\u00adbianism, and because lesbianism does not involve the spilling of seed._\r\n\r\n- Rabbi Michael Gold; _Does God Belong in the Bedroom?_ (1991)\r\n\r\nDepicting the problems that can arise when deeply held spiritual beliefs clash with notions of personal freedom, _Disobedience_ is the story of a forbidden love given a second chance. Based on Naomi Alderman's 2006 novel, written for the screen by Rebecca Lenkiewicz (_Ida_) and Sebasti\u00e1n Lelio, and directed by Lelio, the film covers some of the same thematic territory as Lelio's previous features; _Gloria_ (2013) deals with a 58-year-old divorc\u00e9e trying to re-enter the dating scene by frequenting singles-bars, and the Oscar-winning _Una mujer fant\u00e1stica_ (2017) looks at a transgender waitress trying to come to terms with the death of her boyfriend, whilst also navigating a prejudiced society. In _Disobedience_, Lelio turns his attention towards a lesbian relationship within London's relatively insular Modern Orthodox Jewish community. What all three films have in common is the centrality of a complex and strong woman facing up to (almost exclusively patriarchal) societal hostility. Kind of like a cross between Todd Haynes's _Carol_ (2015) and Daniel Kokotajlo's _Apostasy_ (2017), _Disobedience_ eschews melodrama, and is uninterested in presenting a binary story where faith is the Big Bad. Although it is certainly critical of the strictures that can result from a rigid application of _Halacha_ [Jewish religious laws] and\/or a literal interpretation of the _Taryag Mitzvot_ [613 Commandments], the community itself is depicted respectfully, with the most representative Jewish character arguably the most sympathetic figure in the film. _Disobedience_ does feature a very graphic lesbian sex scene, but it's one of the most thematically justified, least exploitative sex scenes I can remember, crystallising many of Lelio's thematic concerns. Although things can be far too on the nose from time to time, Lelio's subtle and non-intrusive direction more than compensates for that, and overall, this is a fine film, both thought-provoking and moving.\r\n\r\nThe story opens in a synagogue in London as Krushka (the great Anton Lesser), the local Rav, (similar to a rabbi, except an _Halachic_ expert) delivers a sermon explaining that angels and demons are locked into their destinies, with only humanity \"_free to choose_\". This freedom, however, is both a privilege and a great burden, as it affords humanity the opportunity to disobey the edicts of _HaShem_ [lit. \"The Name\"; used to refer to God when discussing Him outside scripture]. However, before completing his sermon, Krushka keels over and dies. Meanwhile, in New York, Ronit (Rachel Weisz), his estranged and non-practising daughter gets word of his death. After getting drunk and having anonymous sex with a man in a toilet, Ronit heads back to England. At the home of her childhood friend, Dovid Kuperman (an extraordinary Alessandro Nivola), Krushka's understudy, Ronit quickly learns the community is not especially pleased to see her, as the shadow under which she left has not dissipated. Despite this, and although he wasn't expecting her, Dovid is happy to let Ronit stay with him and his wife, who, Ronit is stunned to learn, is her former best friend, Esti (Rachel McAdams). The film then plays out over the next few days, as the community prepares for Krushka's _levaya_ [funeral], as it becomes apparent that Ronit and Esti were once more than friends, which may, or may not, have had something to do with Ronit's departure and her estrangement from her father. However, the more time they spend in one another's company, the more their once-held passion for one another bubbles to the surface.\r\n\r\nThematically, _Disobedience_ is far more concerned with the clash of views that results from Ronit's return than it is with condemning the beliefs of the community _per se_. When she first arrives at Dovid's house, she instinctively reaches out to hug him, forgetting about _negiah_ [the forbidding of physical contact between men and women not related by blood, or married], and he immediately, although not unkindly, recoils. This tells us both how long she has been away, and how thoroughly she has rejected the doctrines of the faith. Later, there is an exceptionally awkward (but very funny) _Shabbat_ [Jewish day of rest] meal, where Ronit seems to take great delight in being as outrageous as possible, riling up the assembled guests with her progressive worldview. In a discussion about the role of women in society, for example, she points out that every time a woman gets married and takes her husband's surname, a part of that woman's history is erased. This kind of ideological conflict, however, is also found _within_ the characters themselves. Esti, for example, is torn between her desire for Ronit on the one hand, and her commitment to Dovid and her belief in their faith on the other. For her part, Ronit too internalises discord; although she has been estranged from him for many years, she is genuinely hurt to learn just how completely Krushka had divorced himself of her memory, seen most clearly when his obituary refers to him as \"_sadly childless_\".\r\n\r\nTellingly, during the _Shabbat_ dinner, Dovid tries to play peacekeeper, whilst a couple of cutaways to Esti show her smiling to herself as Ronit burrows under the skin of those present. This kind of delicate touch on Lelio's part can be seen throughout the film, with numerous wordless gestures allowing the actors to convey backstory in lieu of exposition. For example, after Ronit arrives, although Dovid recoils when she tries to hug him, and although when she tries to light up a cigarette in his kitchen, he asks her to smoke in the garden, he accompanies her outside, shielding the flame from the wind in a gesture both kind and intimate. Another excellent example is found later that night as Dovid and Esti prepare for bed, and Esti gently and playfully strokes his beard, suggesting her genuine affection for him.\r\n\r\nOn paper, the story might lend itself to a condemnation of the kind of social suffocation and emotional repression that can result from fundamentalism. Instead, however, the film spends time building a respectful, if not idealised, picture of the community's beliefs and practices. Although no-one is especially happy that Ronit is back, they are never openly hostile, the way Hasidic Jews, for example, might be. A key part of this respect is Dovid himself, played by Nivola (in an Oscar-worthy career-best performance) as an inherently decent and honourable man; when Ronit returns, he is the only one to extend her a genuine welcome. In a less nuanced film, Dovid would be a fire-and-brimstone obstacle to Ronit and Esti's happiness, a Roger Chillingworth-type personification of traditionalism and rigidity. Instead he is presented as someone who, like Esti, faces a difficult choice \u2013 that between his communal position and his faith on the one hand, and his genuine love of Esti and affection for Ronit on the other, his lifelong devotion to the _Tanakh_ [Hebrew Bible] conflicting with the modern day progressive sensibilities that come from living in a metropolis. Indeed, perhaps Dovid's most salient characteristic is conflict \u2013 when he tries to lay down the law to Esti regarding her conduct, his heart never seems in it; when he expresses disgust at her tryst with Ronit, he almost seems embarrassed to be reacting the way he is. This conflict is manifested aesthetically in a scene where Dovid is addressing the synagogue. Lelio films the scene in such a tight close-up, that every time Nivola moves even slightly off his mark, he goes out of focus. It's a brilliant example of content generating form, and is typical of Lelio's directorial lightness of touch.\r\n\r\nHowever, for all that, the film never lets you forget that this is a community of _negiah_, where married women must wear a _sheitel_ [wig] in public, and where the genders are strictly divided at religious services. As Ronit and Esti discuss their sexuality, Esti points out that she and Dovid have sex every Friday night, \"_as is expected_\", and that the reason she was married to Dovid in the first place was that Krushka hoped \"_marriage would cure_\" her, a concept not a million miles away from homosexual conversion therapy. In this sense, although respectful of the community, even depicting some of the communal benefits of such a tight-knit group, the film does challenge some of the tenets of their belief system, particularly its rigid traditionalism and myopic sexism, both of which feel increasingly out of place in the early 21st-century. In this, _Disobedience_ fits very much into Lelio's _oeuvre_, with all three of his films dealing with repressive _milieus_ placing restrictions on women.\r\n\r\nObviously, a major theme throughout is sexuality. Much has been made of the sex scene between Ronit and Esti, with some critics accusing it of being little more than titillation at best, a graphic example of the male gaze at worst. However, this reading is to completely miss the point of the scene in relation to the narrative as a whole. There are actually two sex scenes in the film; one between Ronit and Esti, and the other between Esti and Dovid. And although they couldn't be more different, they also couldn't exist without one another, as the abandonment, lust, and sense of pressure being released when Esti is with Ronit contrasts sharply with the detached, formulaic, and passionless scene with Dovid; the two scenes explicitly comment on one another, each hinting at the meaning to be found in its counterpart. In this, they recall the four sex scenes in David Cronenberg's _A History of Violence_ (2005) and Abdellatif Kechiche's _La Vie d'Ad\u00e8le \u2013 Chapitres 1 & 2_ (2013), two sets of two scenes which, again, comment upon and contextualise one another. The scene between Ronit and Esti is the physical manifestation of the characters' long-repressed desire for one another, a release of the yearning that has been building up for years. It's a wholly justified narrative moment, and a completely necessary beat for the two characters. It's not an aside or a piece of voyeuristic male fantasy, it's the centre of the whole film. Together, the two scenes represent Esti's binary choice \u2013 an unbridled and sexually fulfilling, but unstable relationship with Ronit, or a dutiful and dull, but respectful and secure relationship with Dovid.\r\n\r\nIf I had one major criticism, it would be that although Lelio's direction is extremely subtle, some of his and Lenkiewicz's writing choices are spectacularly on the nose. The opening sermon is a good example \u2013 a religious diatribe whose subject is mankind's freedom to choose, the concomitant ability to disobey, and the notion that freedom is impossible without sacrifice, in a film about these very same issues. Another example is that Dovid and his _yeshiva_ students are discussing the one book of the _Tanakh_ dealing with sexuality rather than spirituality, the _Song of Songs_, whilst Esti's secondary school students are studying adultery in _Othello_. The worst example of this, however, is found when Ronit and Esti go to Krushka's house and Ronit turns on the radio, which just so happens to be playing The Cure's \"Lovesong\", a song which perfectly encapsulates their situation (\"_Whenever I'm alone with you\/You make me feel like I am home again_\"). It's not exactly subtle. I'm also not a massive fan of Matthew Herbert's score, with its jaunty use of woodwinds cutting against the ominous tone of the narrative.\r\n\r\nThese two issues aside though, this is an excellently crafted film. Once again examining female desire, issues of patriarchal oppression, and profound self-doubt, Lelio delivers a mature and considered meditation on the conflict between faith and sexuality. Eschewing the kinds of black and white criticism of secular isolationism as seen in films such as Sidney Lumet's _A Stranger Among Us_ (1992) or Boaz Yakin's _A Price Above Rubies_ (1998), Lelio respects the _milieu_ too much to cast it as the villain. Instead, there is an elegance to the way in which he depicts it. Equal parts sensual and spiritual, the lethargic pace and absence of any narrative fireworks will probably alienate some, especially those expecting a pseudo-porn movie, but for the rest of us, this is thoughtful and provocative cinema in the best sense of the term.","id":"5d1bdb6394d8a8000f3c0eba","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d1bdb6394d8a8000f3c0eba","movie_id":419743}

That was an interesting thing for us to explore, this microcosm of an organised religion really._\r\n\r\n- Rebecca Daly; \"Interview with Rebecca Daly\"; _Film Ireland_ (November 12, 2018)\r\n\r\nEssentially a parable about the nature of religious extremism and, to a lesser extent, the perils of self-imposed isolationism, _Good Favour_, Rebecca Daly's third feature (after _The Other Side of Sleep_ and _Mammal_), is far more interested in asking questions than answering them. Functioning as a kind of blank canvas onto which viewers can project their own interpretation, a cinematic Rorschach image, if you will, the film is not especially concerned with either standard character arcs or narrative beats (indeed, it makes latter-day Terrence Malick seem densely plotted). Instead, it works primarily as a pseudo-allegorical examination of the possibility for hermetic religious groups to see the miraculous in scientifically explainable phenomena and pure coincidence. For many, the slow pace culminating in a highly ambiguous ending will prove too alienating, but for me, the deliberate narrative style is perfectly matched to the unsettling and studied story Daly wishes to tell, and the _d\u00e9nouement_ is as well-handled a piece of cinematic ambiguity as I've seen in a long while.\r\n\r\nSet in an ethnoreligious Christian community of goods in \"_the forests of Central Europe_\", prior to the beginning of the film, the community's faith has been shaken \u2013 newly born cattle have been dying without reason, and a young boy named Isaac has gone missing. Governed by the tenets of a semi-literal interpretation of the Gospels, the people of the community live a frugal, Spartan-like existence, almost completely self-sufficient, and with no electricity or any kind of modern amenity. Although set in the modern day, they dress in Puritan garb, and all work is done by hand. The film begins when 17-year-old Tom (Vincent Romeo) confusedly emerges from the forest. Wounded and exhausted, he wanders into the commune and collapses. Initially, the elders aren't too sure what to do with him, but Mikkel (Lars Brygmann), the group's leader, elects to interpret his arrival as a blessing, touting him as the possible solution to their recent problems, and encouraging his followers to accept him as one of their own. Either unwilling or unable to speak about his past, Tom agrees to live by their rules and work in the commune. Sent to stay with a family, father Hans (Alexandre Willaume), Mikkel's brother, is distrustful, but his wife Maria (Victoria Mayer) and daughter Shosanna (Clara Rugaard) quickly grow close to Tom, with a latent sexual attraction developing between him and Shosanna. The children of the commune also welcome Tom's presence, following him everywhere as if he were the Pied Piper. It soon becomes apparent just how determined the group are to maintain their privacy \u2013 children are told there is an invisible barrier in the woods guarded by monsters; Sophia (Marie-Louise Coninck), Mikkel and Hans's mother, is seriously ill, but despite the protests of her husband, Peter (Baard Owe), Mikkel refuses to allow her to be taken to a hospital; when the local police arrive to investigate reports of a missing child, the community lie, saying a child simply strayed too far in the forest and was subsequently found. As time passes, the local children, and soon some of the adults, begin to attribute Messianic characteristics to Tom, who slowly starts to assume a more central role in the community.\r\n\r\nThe genesis for the film was when Daly's regular writing partner, Glenn Montgomery, saw a newspaper article about \"Forest Boy\". On September 5, 2011, a young man presented himself to Berlin City Hall, saying, \"_I'm all alone in the world, I don't know who I am. Please help me_.\" Giving his name as Ray, he claimed that he was 17, and that his mother had died in a car crash when he was 12. Since then, he had been living in the forests around the Ore Mountain Range with his father, Ryan. However, Ryan had died some time previously, and Ray had buried him \"_in a hole in the forest underneath some stones_\". As a minor and an orphan, Ray was placed in a social services hostel by the Berlin Jugendamt [Youth Office]. Although he had no ID, and was unable to speak German, Ray was able to eat with a knife and fork, knew how to bowl, and could operate a laptop and mobile phone. He was soon enrolled in school, began learning German, and started to receive pocket money from the state. Multiple attempts were made to learn more about him, but all failed \u2013 language experts couldn't identify the accent with which he spoke; DNA, fingerprints, and photographs circulated through Interpol revealed only that he had no criminal record; a couple in Switzerland claimed he was their grandson, but DNA tests disproved the claim. However, in June 2012, on what would have been Ray's 18th birthday, Berlin police published a photo asking for help in identifying him. Shortly thereafter, a young woman came forward saying Ray was an ex-boyfriend. Quickly admitting he had made everything up, Ray revealed his real name was Robin van Helsum, and he was a 20-year-old Dutch national. He was evicted from the hostel, and in September 2013 was sentenced to 150 hours of community service. According to van Helsum, he devised the scheme after falling into rent arrears and learning his ex-girlfriend was pregnant with their child.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to RT\u00c9.ie, Daly explains,\r\n\r\n> _I got an email into my inbox one morning from my co-writer Glenn Montgomery with a link to an article about a young man who walked out of the Black Forest into Berlin, presented himself to social services and told them he had no idea who he was or where he came from. I was immediately intrigued by this setup. What is the potential of an individual with no identity?_\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Daly had become fascinated by her grandmother's adherence to her Catholicism, despite the revelations in Ireland regarding clerical sexual abuse and the Magdalene Laundries. As Daly tells RT\u00c9,\r\n\r\n> _I was particularly fascinated by faith, specifically my grandmother's faith. It was so ingrained in her that it could acknowledge the many abuses that had happened within the Catholic Church and still endure. We asked ourselves what beliefs might someone persevere with in order to preserve their idea of the world, and then pushed this idea to its most extreme point._\r\n\r\nThese two separate issues, the person without an identity and the notion of enduring faith, came together to form _Good Favour_.\r\n\r\nThe film signals it's part-esoteric, part-allegorical status almost immediately \u2013 when Tom stumbles into the commune, there are holes in both of his wrists and a large gash on his side. Does he bear the Stigmata or is it a coincidence? This is the first of the many, many (many) questions the film poses which could be addressed via either an ecclesiastical-based supernatural interpretation or a scientific explanation. For example, a central question throughout the film, and perhaps the narrative's main driving-force, is whether Tom is a Christ-figure capable of performing miracles, or simply a flesh-and-blood human who shows up at the right time, and whose \"miracles\" are nothing of the sort. He is seen by some as a non-corporeal visitor, the possible saviour of the community, and by others as an interloper and possible charlatan, but which group is correct? The film is in no hurry to answer any of these questions, or even foreground them, leaving it up to the viewer to notice, to question, and, more often than not, to answer.\r\n\r\nBuilt upon a foundation of magic realism, the film's _milieu_ is presented realistically, but there is definitely something intangible in the air. For example, when a young girl is drowning and Tom saves her life, is it because he has healing hands, or simply because he knew how to treat her medically in the circumstances? The scene is shot in such a way as to suggest both, without committing to either. Tony Cranstoun's editing and Tibor Dingelstad's cinematography are such that definitive interpretation is often occluded, with the viewer in the role of final arbiter.\r\n\r\nWhat is especially interesting is that the film itself sees Tom in a non-definitive manner \u2013 he is depicted as both a young man, enjoying playing in a lake with some children, aware of his sexual awakening, disgusted by a large container full of rotting calf carcasses, _and_ as someone who strikes a messianic pose whilst standing on a hillside. His role as possible saviour receives its most sustained analysis in the brilliantly conceived and executed finale. Relying on the viewer's perception, ambiguous camera blocking, and fascinating editing rhythms, the scene is as ambivalent as the rest of the film, whilst also directly addressing the mystery at the heart of the narrative.\r\n\r\nWithin all of this, an important theme (as it was in both _The Other Side of Sleep_ and _Mammal_) is surrogacy, particularly the notion of starting as an outsider, and moving into a position of belonging. With this in mind, the film obviously deals with the concept of the Other, with Tom depicted as both the protagonist trying to find acceptance, and the antagonist bringing chaos and disruption with him. According to Daly,\r\n\r\n> _I was interested in exploring the condition of the outsider [\u2026] this idea of belonging, of being inside or outside of a social group, or the centre of power, seems more relevant now than ever with the migrant and refugee crises and Trump's disturbing rhetoric. Terrifyingly our world seems to be divided into those who belong and those who may or may not be let in, and we wanted our story to reflect that and to explore the very natural human drives to want to be included._\r\n\r\nFrom an aesthetic point of view, the depiction of the community itself is exceptionally well-handled by Daly. Based on the Hutterites, a semi-isolated Anabaptist group founded on the basis of the Schleitheim Confession, the unnamed group in the film (whose actual belief system is never explicitly revealed) are not there to provide Daly with an easy target for derision and social commentary. Instead, the depiction is one of respect, with Daly emphasising many of the community's more beneficent qualities. However, there can be no denying that _something_ is not quite right. The deaths of the cattle and the missing child are simply narrative manifestations, the results of which are a subtle challenge to Mikkel's leadership, a challenge spearheaded by Anne (Helena Coppejans), Isaac's mother, who up to now has been urged to \"_believe in God's plan_\".\r\n\r\nThe film features lines such as, \"_We should not be afraid to suffer_\" and, \"_We must put our trust in God_\", but one gets the distinct impression that such sentiments are on the brink of becoming meaningless, with the piety behind them in danger of being rebelled against. Indeed, the tone of the film is one of barely-contained explosiveness, as if the group, with all their buttoned-down communal good, and advocation of Christian morality, is just one bad day away from going full-Waco. When they speak to one another, what they say is never as important, or as interesting, as what they seem to be withholding. When they look at something, they always seem to be more interested in whatever is in the periphery. It's to Daly's credit that this sense of palpable strangeness and combustion is so apparent on screen. Directing what _isn't_ happening can't be easy. This is helped immeasurably by Dingelstad's murky photography and its muted colours; when a policeman visits the commune, the colours on his car seem garish when compared with the palette used to up to that point. The cinematography is also used to make an important thematic point. Employing shallow focus when in the village, the image is flattened, with background details difficult to discern. When outside the village, however, Dingelstad uses a much deeper focus and a wider depth of field. This has the effect of making the village seem dull and lifeless, whilst the forest is vibrant and endless.\r\n\r\nAlso noteworthy is how quiet the film is, with the sound design by Steve Fanagan (_Last Days on Mars_; _Frank_; _The Hollows_) working in tandem with the cinematography to suggest the importance of the forest, its status as almost a living being. With almost no score, many scenes are set against a backdrop of total silence, aside from the wind rustling through the trees. This gives the impression of breathing, as if the forest is literally respiring. The relative silence is not only important during scenes set in the forest, however. For example, dialogue scenes are often punctuated by stretches of silence, adding to the mystery at the film's core, and enhancing the unsettling tone, as if the whole film is one step away from itself becoming an awkward silence. Additionally, on the rare occasions when background music is used, the scene is usually one of Tom and one of the other characters sharing a moment of emotional closeness. The use of music in these scenes helps to illustrate the importance of this moment for the people in the commune, and, by extension, Tom's ever-growing significance in their lives.\r\n\r\nAs with both of Daly's previous films, _Good Favour_ is not interested in providing (easy or otherwise) answers. Instead, it directly encourages the audience to speculate, with its _mise en sc\u00e8ne_ specifically built so as to create maximum ambiguity. It's Daly's most complete artistic statement thus far, combining the centrality of mood and tone from _The Other Side of Sleep_ with the uncomfortable issues raised in _Mammal_. The slow pace and ambiguous ending will put many viewers off, but, for me, both work to help establish theme and tone, as Daly slowly builds up a disquieting worldview, before examining what happens when that view is fundamentally disrupted. Beautifully shot, excellently edited, superbly written, and brilliantly directed, it's definitely not for everyone, but there is undeniable craft on display here.","id":"5d08119d92514104c4be5ae8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d08119d92514104c4be5ae8","movie_id":473356}

{"author":"BadChristian","content":"I can only assume people were joking when they told me Good Time is a good time. It most certainly is not a good time! Good Time is very uncomfortable, anger inducing, and depressing and I enjoyed every minute of it. Easily the highlight is the color palate with most scenes being lit by neon lights or the glow of a TV or a distant street light. As dark as the movie went tonally, seeing Robert Pattinson's face lit up by a neon red light is beautiful. Personal preference, but I'll watch a movie just for the neon lighting and Good Time uses it as a great counter to the dirty feel of everything else. The story was my least favorite part, but the acting, cinematography and score work so well that it didn't bother me that much. I say the acting it great, but really I mean that Robert Pattinson and Benny Safdie are great, everyone else is really just a way to move the plot forward and are fine (except Barkhad Abdi who just doesn't connect). If you've only seen Pattinson in the Twilight Saga (I'll admit that's the only time I've seen him) where no one acts and just recites lines with dead eyes, this is such a departure and he really delivers a believable and authentic performance. The story isn't perfect, it's got some pacing problems and a few \"Why are they doing that?\" moments, but it's a very compelling story that is just so dark and grim, but still manages to carry heart. The plot sets Pattinson as the protagonist, trying to help his mentally challenged brother after they leave home but it's really complicated whether or not you want to root for him. The ending isn't what I expected or wanted, but it is a solid ending and it works for the film. Good Time is not a movie that most people will appreciate or even want to watch if they know what it's really about, but if you can respect a fully dark and bleak film that doesn't let up it is a worthwhile film that has something to say.","id":"5bf333250e0a264f6e022c57","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bf333250e0a264f6e022c57","movie_id":429200}

The blurb sounded quite interesting and the trailers were promising even though I always take trailers with a huge pinch of salt. I have never read the original Manga. Whether that is good or bad with respect to the movie I do not know.\r\n\r\nThe good stuff as far as this movie is concerned is, not surprisingly, the visuals. I would not say that they are stunning but the are quite good. The environments are interesting and the special effects are not bad at all. I have to say that the tank design was pretty poor though. Not very exiting as a fictional design and utter nonsense from a functional point of view.\r\n\r\nThis is as far as the good stuff goes. The story is okay but it is pretty predictable and not that much to get exited about. It could have been more developed for sure. I would actually have liked to see the Major do a few more missions beating up the bad guys. That was where the movie shined a bit and showed the best visuals and special effects.\r\n\r\nThe acting is pretty mediocre to be honest. Even Daisuke Aramaki, which was a character that I did like, felt rather bland. The main bad guy was just a uninspiring thug.\r\n\r\nTo me the movie more or less felt like the pilote episode of a TV-show with a huge budget for visuals.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Too late to come out to impress its fans!**\r\n\r\nIt was not my most anticipated film of the year. Like usual for any film, I just wanted to see it and enjoy it. The film was fine, but that does not mean so good. From the visuals to the performances, it sounded great. But the story wasn't. When the original concept was created nearly 30 years back, it fascinated people for being something new and powerful. But for the current world, for the current generation, it is just an ordinary sci-fi. All I say is it just came out at least 15 years late. So the 90s kids would have loved it!\r\n\r\nThe storyline was nothing, but a self-discovery of a half human, half machine. This has been the plot of hundreds of robot films. But it's just differently told. One of only kind, a human brain was saved after the severe accident and given an artificial body. Now she's known as Major fights the crime. But some day later, she's haunted by glitches in her vision which directly connected to her past that she does not remember. The rest of the film was finding the truth and other consequences, before it all ends.\r\n\r\nVisual effects were the only advantage for this film to come out in the present era. The rest of the film was simply okayish. I don't know what the original source fans say about it, but it is a one time watchable film. Otherwise, there are plenty of similar good films, like this is nothing much different than 'Robocop'. Or the recent TV series 'Westworld'. Scarlett Johansson could become a reason for some people to peek into it. The writing and direction were average. Watch and forget kind of film.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"5a77051e0e0a26643c049c90","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a77051e0e0a26643c049c90","movie_id":315837}
{"author":"tmdb81799156","content":"I was unable to make it to the theaters for this one due to traveling for work those first two weeks.  And then it was gone; couldn't find it in any theaters. I'm sure glad I didn't waste my money for that and only spent $1.62 to rent it from RedBox.\r\nThe trailer didn't show much, which is good.  I hate trailers that give away everything about a movie.  \r\nSo, a hot girl is always good...   \r\nAnd it had the teaser nudity that isn't real but is a suit - I'll let you be the judge of that.\r\nThe rest is the same old overused nonsense from all other science fiction movies:\r\nA lot of fighting, shooting, explosions and destruction - way too much of that... but just about all sci-fi and superhero movies these days only contain that.\r\nThe first hour was incredibly boring.  After about 70 minutes, it got just slightly interesting and then all the fighting\/shooting\/destruction began.  There is nothing interesting about that - we've all see that hundreds of times. It's ridiculous.\r\nWhy can't any of these shooters hit anything?  We still have that.  It isn't interesting to watch.  Thousands of rounds flying and everyone missing their target.  With all this high tech stuff, why don't they have more advanced weapons?\r\nI have to say, I was in Arizona earlier this year and fired a handgun for the very first time.  It was a 6-shooter, a Colt \"Peacemaker\", you know the pistol of the \"West\".  You don't \"AIM\" those, you lift them to just above waist high, look at your target & not the gun, and pull the trigger. After just a few shots, it starts to become very natural. Any sane person can hit a target the size of a person at least somewhere on their body, even if they are moving.  24 rounds: I had 24 hits & 0 misses at various distances. But the people in these movies can't hit anything even when they do aim and with much better weapons.  \r\nAnd then you have Major, her manufactured body can stretch & tear, wires breaking, and it can still function?  Uh, NO, it wouldn't.  That's not how mechanics and electronics work.\r\nThe City: a ridiculous \"Blade Runner\"\/\"Fifth Element\" type of city but with fish floating around.  No, not interesting at all. Just very silly.\r\nOh, one petty but very annoying thing: They can build an entire body and install a human brain in it and get everything to work but they can only give her a ragged, jagged wig or haircut?  That's very weird.  Her crooked bangs were a distraction in every scene that included her facing the viewer.\r\n\r\nIn Summary: This movie has a lot of awesome CGI with a ridiculous plot and horrible acting.  Great CGI alone doesn't make a great, or even a good, movie.  This catastrophe is a perfect example of that.","id":"5979fc6992514107cc015b95","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5979fc6992514107cc015b95","movie_id":315837}
{"author":"Pierre_D","content":"I boned up on this movie by watching the 1995 version and Stand Alone Complex for a bit, loved the repart\u00e9e from Major Kusanagi and her crew and hoped it would translate to the big screen. The movie succeeds in displaying the setting and overall feel of the area. Everything is a grainy, low-tech with abundant neon and cyber-solidified humans. Sadly, the script is a bit of a mess. Kusanagi becomes Major Mira Killian (you'll see why toward the end the film) and Scarlett Johhansson, generally a quite credible actress, is sort of wasted here.\r\n\r\nWe do not get a lot of character development for her or her crewmates. There aren't a lot of quirky, funny moments as there are in the animated versions. Worse still, a lot of the teaser from the movie are just absent here, and one feels cheated. Overall this is a fine bit of popcorn absorption but fails to live up the series's standards and fails to give any of the actors much to work with. See it on a rainy day, if nothing else.\r\n\r\n3.5\/5","id":"591de0e59251414a57022805","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/591de0e59251414a57022805","movie_id":315837}
{"author":"Wanderless","content":"I've watched Ghost in the Shell at the cinema 3 days ago, knowing\r\nbeforehand about the controversies that have surrounded this movie for\r\nthe last 6 months or so. Science fiction movies are probably my\r\nfavorite genre and I also enjoyed most of Scarlett's movies for the\r\npast 8-9 years so those two factors were a plus for me going in. \r\n\r\nRegarding the whitewashing business, I think its been blown way, WAY\r\nout of proportion by social justice warriors with nothing better to do\r\nthan drag media attention over whatever they're feeling insecure about\r\nthis month\/year. For those of you who might be on the fence about\r\nwatching a Caucasian actress in the role that (supposedly) should've\r\nbeen reserved to an Asian actress, please consider this a NON-MATTER\r\nand watch it anyway. The character she is portraying is SUPPOSED to\r\nlook Caucasian\/white. It was the same in the source material and even\r\nthe creator of that anime said so in interviews.\r\n\r\nNow, is the movie any good? In my opinion, yes. Yes it was. It wasn't\r\namazing but at the very least entertaining. There is a good amount of\r\npeople who score this a 1\/10 because they are butt hurt that the story\r\nwas changed a lot. Please ignore them and see for yourself even if\r\nyou're a fan of the anime and are able to keep an open mind. I think\r\nmaybe I was able to judge it more objectively because I had zero\r\nknowledge about the story in the anime going in, but, if nothing else,\r\nthe movie actually made me want to watch those old ones to compare.\r\n\r\nThe acting - 7.5\/10 - Since Scarlett Johansson is the only big name\r\nthat the movie is being marketed alongside, I'd say she did a good job.\r\nAt no point in the movie could I say she didn't belong there. She\r\nplayed the part of cyborg who had difficulty belonging in a human world\r\nvery well. The cast is diverse enough in my opinion, though some of\r\nthem get pretty little screen time.\r\n\r\nThe visuals - 9\/10 - If there is one point most critics\/viewers are in\r\nalignment concerning this movie, that point is definitely the visuals.\r\nThe movie both looks and feels spectacular, with the futuristic city\r\nlooking like a close-future mix of Blade Runner and TRON. The\r\ncombination of CGI and practical effects looks organic, the movie's\r\npowerful themes of excessive self-augmentation and technology almost\r\nrunning amok represented very well visually.\r\n\r\nSoundtrack - 8\/10 - Sometimes pretty subdued, sometimes\r\nalmost-but-not-quite in your face, I found the soundtrack to vary\r\nbetween decent and very good in some moments. It didn't MAKE the movie\r\nbut it enhanced a good deal in my opinion.\r\n\r\nStory - 7\/10 - Here is where the good points of the movie kinda start\r\nto run dry. A lot of other people would probably rate it a lot lower,\r\nwith 5 or 4's if they're at least trying to be objective. Yes, the\r\nstory is fairly predictable, and the fact that the movie is only around\r\n100 minutes long doesn't do it any favors either. Here is probably\r\nwhere most of the legitimate hate towards this movie stems from. The\r\ncreators adapted a story that had a lot more depth and philosophical\r\ninsight and turned it into a somewhat generic cyborg coming of age\r\nstory mixed with an evil corporation doing questionable things. The\r\nvillain is also very cookie-cutter and has almost zero depth. HOWEVER,\r\nI do think that concerning this film's particular themes and narrative,\r\na weak villain doesn't hurt it so much since its more about\r\nlosing\/gaining your humanity through technology than any bad guy trying\r\nto shoot you.\r\n\r\nWriting\/Dialogue - 6\/10 - By far the movie's weakest aspect. In fact, I\r\nbelieve if some more meaningful dialogue and character interactions\r\nwere written into this film, it could've easily been 1 or 2 points\r\nhigher on anyone's scoring system. As it is, the dialogue is shallow\r\nand fairly run-of-the-mill for about half the movie's length. Some bits\r\nof good interactions are sprinkled here and there, and thankfully\r\nthat's enough to preserve the soul of the movie's central theme of\r\nhuman souls surviving in machine bodies, BUT not enough to give Ghost\r\nin the Shell the depth it should've inherited from the source material.\r\n\r\nOverall - I gave this movie 3.5\/5 stars here, mostly because I\r\ncouldn't give it a 7.5\/10 which felt more appropriate to me. My advice\r\nwould be to not listen to the whitewashing nonsense, because that's\r\nexactly what it is, nonsense. Also don't listen to the haters who rate\r\nthis movie a 1\/10 or call it shit because those people should not be\r\nreviewing anything to begin with. It is a decent movie, with great\r\nvisuals and a theme that might get you thinking for a couple of days\r\nafter seeing it. The acting is decent, with an above average\r\nperformance from Scarlett and a good soundtrack that might hit the\r\nright spot on occasion. The only bad aspects, like I mentioned, are the\r\nfilm's rather short running time and weak dialogue\/writing which hold\r\nit back from being truly great.","id":"58e78fe5c3a368730204ce99","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58e78fe5c3a368730204ce99","movie_id":315837}
