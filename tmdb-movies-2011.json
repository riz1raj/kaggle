Starring the exquisite coloratura soprano Emma Matthews as the innocent girl priestess Lakm\u00e9, and superb tenor Aldo Di Toro as the love-struck Gerald, the story tackles religion and cross-cultural love against a backdrop of British rule in India in the mid-19th century.  French conductor Emmanuel Joel-Hornak brings out the full depth of the lush, dramatic score, with familiar high points being the beautiful renditions of the well-known Flower duet and Bell Song. Dominica Matthews adds her rich voice as Mallika and Stephen Bennett is darkly dominating as Brahmin priest Nilakantha, Lakm\u00e9s father, while Roxane Hislop is a consumate Mistress Bentson.  Set and costume designs by Mark Thompson fill the stage with rich colour, atmosphere and exoticism, complemented by Nigel Levings warm lighting.

The story is about a young scaffold construction worker who is charged with assaulting his boss. By the end of the film, all our assumptions about guilt and blame are turned on their heads. As 10 people sit in a room discussing the turn of events that brought our protagonist to breaking point, twists and surprises reveal that all is not quite as simple as it seems. Michael Rymer directs his screen adaptation of 'Face to Face' (written by Australian playwright David Williamson), as an ensemble piece about 10 very dissimilar Australians bound together by a complex pattern of relationships and shared histories. Hysterically funny and deeply moving, each character's role in the drama peels back another layer as the story digs down to the roots of who these people really are.","poster_path":null,"release_date":"2011-09-08","title":"Face to Face","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"popularity":1.594,"id_imdb":"tt1648154"}

Centering around a disturbing performance by Christopher Denham (SOUND OF MY VOICE), the film provides a dark and hopeless exploration of domestic violence. When the mother (Marianna Palka, NEDS, GOOD DICK) challenges her husband (Denham), she commits her family to a most unsettling journey - a dreamlike chase through the nearby woods. The husband's pals (Michael Mosley, PAN AM, SCRUBS, and Ivan Sandomire) push the brutality of the film in their hunt to capture the mother. The film culminates in an absurd final scene, one that can only end in violence.","poster_path":null,"release_date":"","title":"Restive","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"popularity":0.6,"id_imdb":"tt1766037"}

The agency, along with many environmental and animal rights groups, praised the decision: it was almost as though they were triumphantly heralding the return of some unjustly banished royalty. But their real triumph was that, by elevating animal over man once again, they were given access to tens of millions of dollars and greater control over both private and public property. Putting wolves in Yellowstone was never about saving wolves or balancing ecosystems. There was another agenda. One they would not reveal to the American public, but would see through, no matter how far they had to bend the rules, no matter how much they had to steal, no matter how bad they had to lie, no matter the cost. And they did it. What\u2019s done is done.
