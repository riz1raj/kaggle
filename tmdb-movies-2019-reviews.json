{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nWho would have thought that the first (positive) surprise of the year would be a movie starring Seth Rogen in a romantic-comedy?! This genre has been having trouble for the past few years (only a handful of films are worthy of high praise), but Long Shot's amazing cast called my attention at the beginning of 2019 when I was organizing my watchlist of the year. I genuinely love Rogen type of humor, and Charlize Theron is one of the best actresses of the 21st century. Add three more terrific actors like Bob Odenkirk (President Chambers), O'Shea Jackson Jr. (Lance), and an unrecognizable Andy Serkis (Parker Wembley), and you have yourself a clear path to success.\r\n\r\nSo, what's the missing key ingredient? A well-written and compelling story, which is the number one problem with rom-coms of today. Most of these movies go straight to streaming services since they're the easiest ones to produce. Just gather a reasonably decent cast, put together a cliche narrative about how two people with nothing in common end up together through the most unlikely and dumb plot devices, and you have a low-budget \u201csuccess\u201d. Long Shot\u2018s premise follows a variation of that concept and it still carries the trademark conventionality, but it's the chemistry of its leads, the hilarious comedy and the beautifully-written screenplay that makes this one stand out.\r\n\r\nThe dialogues don't feel forced, a large portion of the jokes land, and the best compliment I can give to this film: it took itself seriously, and it worked seamlessly. There\u2019s a heartfelt message to transmit to the viewers, and it\u2019s delivered in the most realistic possible way. The romance doesn\u2019t seem far-fetched or born out of nowhere. Instead, it has a wonderful arc, filled with real-life relationship moral dilemmas and difficult decisions. Everything that any character says either makes sense or makes you laugh.\r\n\r\nThe cast is brilliant as expected. Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron\u2018s chemistry is palpable, and it\u2019s one of the reasons why the romance part of the movie works. They clearly had much fun on-set, and that\u2019s visible on the big screen. Rogen provides most of the laughs, but he also proves that he can be dramatic if necessary.  Theron is just impeccable. She simply can\u2019t act a single line of her script in a way that\u2019s not perfect, whether it\u2019s a romantic scene or a comedy bit. Her range is on display throughout the entire runtime, and Jonathan Levine should be extremely grateful as a director to have such an outstanding actress to work with.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all of this, there\u2019s one thing I never expected to be praising right now: the makeup department. Before the film, I knew that Andy Serkis was on the cast, but I completely forgot what his role was. Without an ounce of exaggeration, I truly believe that it\u2019s almost impossible to recognize him as Wembley if you don\u2019t know beforehand that he participates in the movie. When I re-checked the cast members, I remembered that he had a role indeed, and I was almost as surprised by the discovery as I was with how much I enjoyed this film. O\u2019Shea Jackson Jr. also delivers a hilarious performance while Bob Odenkirk doesn\u2019t really have much screentime to shine.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those movies that you can\u2019t precisely point out obvious flaws. A flawless film doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a perfect 10\/10 movie. It just means you really don\u2019t have any major issues with it. If every single aspect of a film is just \u201cgood\u201d, then the movie is \u201cgood\u201d, not \u201cincredible\u201d or \u201camazing\u201d. That is how I view Long Shot. It\u2019s an extremely entertaining rom-com, undeniably one of the best I\u2019ve seen these past few years. Even though the main concept follows the genre\u2019s traditional storylines, its well-written screenplay, hilarious comedy bits, and outstanding protagonists make a surprisingly serious story remarkably entertaining. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a fast-paced 2-hour runtime that I recommend to anyone who just wants to have a good time at the movie theater.\r\n\r\nRating: B+","id":"5ccc6117c3a36836b0db894e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ccc6117c3a36836b0db894e","movie_id":459992}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Tarantino\u2019s revenge on the Manson psychos***\r\n\r\nIn the late 60s, Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), a popular TV Western actor, finds his career taking a downturn and tries to recover with the encouragement of his kick-axx stunt double and best friend, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Sharon Tate (Margo Robbie) & Roman Polanski are neighbors with Jay Sebring always hanging around (Emile Hirsch). Meanwhile the Manson Family nutjobs are lurking in the background, prepping to attack. \r\n\r\n\u201cOnce Upon a Time\u2026 in Hollywood\u201d (2019) is Quentin Tarantino\u2019s 9th full film and, for me, ranks somewhere in the middle of his oeuvre. It may not be as great as \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d (1994) and \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d (2012), but it places well with \u201cInglourious Basterds\u201d (2009), \u201cJackie Brown\u201d (1997) and \u201cThe Hateful Eight\u201d (2015).  \r\n\r\nA famous director once succinctly defined a great movie as such: Three good scenes, no bad scenes. While the second part of this definition is debatable with \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,\u201d seeing as how the movie could've certainly been tightened up (there are some dull sequences), there's no doubt that it fulfills the first part. \r\n\r\nMy three favorite scenes are: The amusing satirical Bruce Lee confrontation; the great Spahn Ranch episode, which effectively creates an underlying sense of menace; and, of course, the entertaining hippie attack in the final act.\r\n\r\nThankfully, there are numerous additional gems: The friendship and respect of Rick and Cliff; the audacious flamethrower sequence; Rick's breakdown with the precocious girl actor (not actress); the beautiful women throughout; the great cast, including several celeb cameos; the entertaining soundtrack; Brandi, the pit bull; Rick's meltdown in his trailer; Rick finally pulling off a quality acting scene via ad libbing; George Spahn not remembering Cliff; everything (surprisingly) turning out to be precisely as so-and-so said; the allusion to what MAY have happened to Cliff's nagging wife (Rebecca Gayheart) on the boat; the way it should have turned out on that infamous night; and the heartwarming close,\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles area.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-","id":"5d7ee2a83c43440998a16f94","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d7ee2a83c43440998a16f94","movie_id":466272}
{"author":"Matthew Brady","content":"\u201cWhen you come to the end of the line, with a buddy who is more than a brother and a little less than a wife, getting blind drunk together is really the only way to say farewell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2018Once Upon a Time In Hollywood\u2019 is a chilled blast from the past told like a fairy tale. It\u2019s both aimless and yet meaningful with the commentary on the new era in Hollywood. The movie pays tribute to old Hollywood, film making, Sharon Tate, stunt work, and actors. This is perhaps Tarantino\u2019s most personal and mature movie his made, until the last 10 minutes (which I love) goes complete ape sh*t.\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t think of any other director where the passion and love for movies is so transparent through Tarantino's craft. He\u2019s such an old school film maker that he and Martin Scorsese are the last golden age directors, as every new release feels like an event. In this movie, Quentin presents 69\u2019 Hollywood at its peak, as he remembers it from his childhood. He manages to rebuild classy LA thanks to the crew and creative team. \r\n\r\nBright neon lights, fashionable clothes, and late 60\u2019s automobiles. There\u2019s a couple of scenes where Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), drives around LA and there are long shots that shows off the environment and it\u2019s amazing the amount of detail and effort went into the setting - with Robert Richardson brilliant Cinematography bringing it all alive. \r\n\r\nLeonardo DiCaprio was absolutely excellent as the fading Western star, Rick F**king Dalton. Dalton, a self-centered, yet vulnerable actor that you both laugh and pity. I will often forget about DiCaprio comedic chops, something similar to Ryan Gosling. I also like the subtle stutter that\u2019s sprinkled through out, which is sad when given some thought that it\u2019s something he\u2019s got to deal with. There\u2019s a heartfelt scene where Dalton tells his young co-star about a book his reading and mid way through explaining the story he realises it mirrors his life, and breaks down in tears with me crying with him. Yep, I teared up in a Tarantino movie. Leo was the pulse of the movie.\r\n\r\nBrad Pitt was amazing as the deadpan and cool Cliff Booth. This is probably my favorite performance from him. Cliff\u2019s main character trait is his strength and he demonstrates it multiple times, but leaves the scene before anything can escalate. The chemistry between Leo and Brad was electric. Pitt was the meat of the movie.\r\n\r\nMargot Robbie was an absolute delight portraying the late Sharon Tate. Despite her slim screen time, but whenever she has screen time, I couldn\u2019t help but smile. I instantly fell in love with her and it\u2019s painfully to think something so sweet and pure could be taken away from us by brainwashed zombies who don\u2019t deserve a life, just a jail cell. I thought her portrayal in the movie was a beautiful tribute and how they handle her gives new life into her legacy. \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a great scene where Sharon Tate watches a movie in cinemas that\u2019s she\u2019s in, but instead of Margot Robbie re-creating those scenes, they just show the real Sharon Tate in the movie. Now people were left a bit confused over this decision, although it\u2019s clear to me that erasing the real Tate out of the movie would be more disrespectful to her memory, so leaving her in is a touching tribute to her career and her work. Robbie was the heart of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe other supporting cast all did terrific with the little screen time most of them had. Kurt Russell makes a welcoming return as a character that I assume is Stuntman Mike from 'Death Proof' - either way still a welcoming presence. He\u2019s also the narrator and I find it hilarious whenever he tries to pronounce Italian movie titles. Al Pacino was a blast to watch as the tight and yet colorful producer. Mike Moh portrayal of Bruce Lee may have sparked some controversy recently, but I thought he was entertaining regardless and I don\u2019t really think it mocks his legacy at all. I mean, this is the same director who made a four hour movie honoring the legend. Margaret Qualley was crazy good as the hippie girl who\u2019s brain washed into a cult family. It\u2019s crazy to know that Damon Herriman has played Charles Manson twice in the same year and month for this movie and the TV show \u2018Mindhunter\u2019, which you should totally check out by the way.\r\n\r\nJulia Butters, Luke Perry, Timothy Olyphant, Dakota Fanning, Bruce Dern, and Damian Lewis - a stellar cast that did a stellar job.\r\n\r\nAfter letting the film sit for awhile, there\u2019s so many memorable lines that I would often catch myself recreating just from memory after seeing it twice. There\u2019s so many great moments as well. The lights of LA coming to life at the dust of dawn, or the suspenseful scenes that actually got me feeling tense watching it. Without spoiling anything, but the Spahn Ranch scene where the Manson family stares down a defenseless Cliff Booth as he tries to speak to an old friend was terrifying - reminds me of the opening scene of \u2018Inglorious Bastards\u2019, in terms of building up tension that you wait in anticipation to explode.\r\n\r\nStill, I think this is the best representation of the Manson family I\u2019ve seen in any movie...by portraying them as absolute buffoons.\r\n\r\nAnd of course with it being a Tarantino movie, the music is lost treasure revived for a modern generation. Always fantastic and incredibly catchy. I can\u2019t think of anything better than Cliff driving around LA with the song \u2018Bring a Little Lovin\u2019 playing in the background.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: I\u2019ve seen this movie twice already and I still have a desire to watch it again. This is slowly creeping up to being my favorite Quentin Tarantino movie, but time will tell I guess.","id":"5e2f2840c56d2d00154e5a16","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2f2840c56d2d00154e5a16","movie_id":466272}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nQuentin Tarantino is one of the best filmmakers of all-time. He has undeniable talent behind the camera, and his movies are fated to leave a mark in each year they\u2019re released. In addition to that, he\u2019s also an extraordinary screenwriter, as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood proves once again. His knowledge of the early decades of film is vast, so every feature he produces is always going to be filled with references to those \u201cfairy tale\u201d years. And that\u2019s precisely what this movie is: a fairy tale in Hollywood, hence its title. Let me just leave this here right off the bat: I\u2019m not going to address any controversy surrounding this film (namely, the whole Bruce Lee depiction and the Manson Family, in general), as I\u2019m always fair and impartial to the movie I\u2019m reviewing. Moving on \u2026\r\n\r\nMy knowledge of the 60s isn\u2019t that good. Obviously, I know the whole Sharon Tate story, as well as the famous Manson murders, but when it comes to actual films from that decade, well \u2026 Probably, I only know a few by name, a classic scene, or a memorable soundtrack. Tarantino uses his large runtime to place tons of references to that period, and that\u2019s one of the reasons the first act of the movie drags. There\u2019s a lot of time spent with characters just driving cars while listening to music (references in the songs), wide shots of the city as they drive by (references in the buildings), or even just playing an LP and dancing to it (reference in the songs, again).\r\n\r\nI understand that these mean something, but if they don\u2019t develop the character in any way, then these are just Easter Eggs and have no impact on the actual narrative. The first hour or so is filled with sequences which sole purpose is to show how much Tarantino knows about that time, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with it, as long as it tells a story. That\u2019s the second issue I have with the first act: it takes too long to establish its characters, and there\u2019s no apparent objective within the story. It feels like a person just strolling around with no destination, which in itself isn\u2019t a bad thing. But if you put together repetitive sequences plus a story that no one knows where it\u2019s going or how it connects to the only thing people are actually expecting (the Sharon Tate event), then you\u2019ll bore the hell out of the audience (a lot of people constantly left my theater to get more food or something, and they weren\u2019t in a hurry).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, from the moment we start understanding who Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth are, what they do, what they did, and what they want with their lives, then the film becomes incredibly captivating. It\u2019s definitely a character-driven story. It\u2019s a fairy tale where Rick tries his best to overcome his own personal issues to be the very best movie star, after being on an exponentially negative path. Cliff, as his stunt double, lives off of his buddy by doing everything he needs around the house and everywhere else. These two are inseparable, and their scenes are always filled with laughter and joy, even in the darkest moments. OUATIH works because of its beautifully-written characters.\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t care about them, then you won\u2019t enjoy the film at all. In addition to this, if you don\u2019t know anything regarding the art of filmmaking, then you\u2019ll probably hate it since it will become extremely dull. It\u2019s one of those movies that anyone can like. However, for someone who knows and understands how films are made, it will always be a better time at the theater. You can love this movie, sure. But if you love filmmaking and you have knowledge of its techniques, you\u2019ll love it even more. There are so many technical achievements worthy of appreciation that I can\u2019t get to all of them, so I\u2019ll just address two of my favorites. The first has to be the black-and-white flicks inside the actual film. Putting Leonardo DiCaprio acting on classic westerns with over-the-top performances is an absolute delight. Watching those features in a 4:3 black-and-white screen, filled with classic sound effects, and cheesy one-liners \u2026 Wonderful.\r\n\r\nThe second allows for my favorite scenes of the whole movie: the extensive one-take dialogues. I mean, 10 or 15-minute sequences where DiCaprio just gives it his all. This is how every single film should be done. There\u2019s even a joke in the movie where Rick criticizes a particular type of filmmaking because they would film every character separately saying their lines and then editing them together. Unfortunately, that\u2019s how most features are done today. Therefore, from watching a simple dialogue scene with DiCaprio and Julia Butters (a 10-year-old little girl!) to a bar sequence which belongs to a movie Rick is filming (this one even has Rick asking his lines, and the camera has to go back to its starting point), everything with no cuts whatsoever \u2026 What can I ask more from a director?!\r\n\r\nObviously, if this is a character-driven narrative, the cast has to be genuinely compelling. Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie \u2026 I mean, do I even need to explain how phenomenal they are? DiCaprio proves once again he\u2019s one of the greatest actors of all-time. The ability that he has to put 200% in every single scene is unbelievable. I even started to tear up once his character is able to find his footing, solely due to the actor\u2019s performance. The Oscar nom is guaranteed, let\u2019s see about the win. Brad Pitt also has tons of nominations on his lap with an astonishing supporting display. He has a subtle performance, but it\u2019s pretty incredible how much he can transmit to the audience by putting (apparently) so little effort. Margot Robbie doesn\u2019t have that much screentime, but her character had the simple objective of showing how glamorous and dreamy an actress\u2019 life could be at that time, so she didn\u2019t exactly need to deliver her A-game.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s always good to see Al Pacino (Marvin Schwarz) on-screen, and I\u2019m thrilled that Margaret Qualley (Pussycat), who I know from The Leftovers (one of the most underrated TV shows of the century), is finally getting some recognition. Technically, like I said above, it\u2019s close to a masterpiece. It\u2019s Tarantino, everyone knows what he\u2019s capable of, but having in mind his most recent features, it\u2019s a pleasant surprise and evidence of quality to the naysayers that he was able to produce a film with less bloody action. There are terrific demonstrations of great cinematography (Robert Richardson), and the editing is always impeccable in Tarantino\u2019s features (this time due to Fred Raskin). The score is addictive, and it carries a very significant role in the movie. I would say that if Tarantino was able to shorten its runtime and control its pacing better, this would be a technically perfect film.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood isn\u2019t the best Quentin Tarantino\u2019s movie, but it\u2019s undoubtedly one of the year\u2019s best. Filled with award-winning lead performances (second Oscar for DiCaprio, please), this character-driven story is packed with references to the 60s which will be the divisive point in whether people will enjoy the film or not.

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps:\/\/www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI'm not the biggest fan of straight-up romantic comedies (rom-coms). I don't think I absolutely love a film from this genre, and if I do, it probably doesn't solely belong to the rom-com's list (they could also be musicals, dramas, etc). Most of the times, I appreciate them enough to feel fulfilled. Very rarely, I feel totally disappointed or with a hate feeling towards one. Paul Feig delivered a couple of great comedies during his career (Bridesmaids, Spy), and the underrated\/overlooked A Simple Favor, which I enjoyed very much. With Emma Thompson (Adelia) as both supporting actress and screenwriter, Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding as protagonists, Last Christmas grew on me in the week of its premiere, making me genuinely excited for its session.\r\n\r\nThis Christmas' movie sort of falls in the middle. I don't exactly \"like\" it that much, but I still left the theater happy and reasonably entertained. It actually possesses a dramatic tone deep within, but it never fully explores it, maintaining the lighthearted and festive vibe throughout most of its runtime. Clarke and Golding share amazing chemistry, and their scenes are very romantic, sweet, and emotional. However, it's more of the same. Last Christmas doesn't bring anything new since it follows the same cliches every other rom-com does.\r\n\r\nIts only bold and different take on the story is a plot twist that raises too many logical questions. Instead of carrying an emotionally powerful impact, it merely delivers an initial shock that goes away once people start to really think about it. Nevertheless, I praise this storytelling choice. It's never easy to pull off a twist, but the truth is that if Emma Thompson and Bryony Kimmings didn't take this missed shot, I wouldn't have spent the whole trip back home thinking about the film. I would have probably forgotten it as soon as I got into the car. So, congrats on trying something different, even if it didn't quite work for me.\r\n\r\nThompson ultimately shines as Kate's mom, though. No missteps here. She's hilarious, and she has some of the funniest lines of the whole thing. Michelle Yeoh (Santa) also has a couple of fun moments, but her subplot feels a bit strained. Emilia Clarke incorporates the clumsiness and awkwardness of her character seamlessly. If you're familiar with Clarke's interviews and public persona, then you know that Kate is basically the over-the-top reflection of Clarke. Despite her lack of luck, she's still charming and a good person that went through a traumatic event that changed her life (duh). Golding is glamorous and perfect as expected, especially since his character needed precisely these attributes.\r\n\r\nTheir relationship grows in a not-so-realistic way, and while this might be justified by the last act's twist, other plot points are not. My main issue with the movie is really those last 20 minutes. In addition to the twist, every single subplot is closed like nothing happened. From a particular family situation regarding sexual orientation to Yeoh's entire side story, all are either solved off-screen or way too easily. It's a rollercoaster of good and bad writing decisions. It has a couple of exciting downwards slopes and tight turns, but most of it is a slow ride with nothing truly thrilling or astonishing.\r\n\r\nLast Christmas tries to be \"the next big thing\" concerning Christmas classics, but it falls short of its goal. Boasting a fantastic cast, with two charming, compelling leads in Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding, Paul Feig delivers a lighthearted, festive film, but stuffed with cliches and a twist that doesn't quite work. Emma Thompson shines as a supporting character but has some missteps in co-writing the story with Bryony Kimmings, showing significant struggles in tying up the loose threads left by the side stories. Despite its storytelling issues, it's a flick I recommend to anyone who loves seasonal movies with a beautiful message, some fun moments, and a score packed with our favorite George Michael's songs.\r\n\r\nRating: C+","id":"5dee1ef4dc86470011c535c8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dee1ef4dc86470011c535c8","movie_id":549053}

It's a reclamation of the right to tell one's own story, a story of abuse and trauma, the malignant tendrils of which have spread to every corner of Ireland. There are very few people in this country over the age of 40 from working-class families who don't know someone who experienced the horrors of the Magdalene Laundries or the Industrial Schools. For me, it's an uncle who spent a year in St. Josephs Industrial School, Artane, one of the most notorious in the country. His crime? He smashed a window. He's 81 now, and has never spoken of his experiences in that place; whatever happened to him there, he will take to his grave. Almost all of us from working-class backgrounds have similar stories in our families. I mention specifically working-class families because poverty is one of the main themes of the film. Or rather, the exploitation of poverty, insofar as the Laundries and Schools provided what was essentially slave labour - a workforce plucked almost wholly from the working-class.\r\n\r\nFlynn was born in 1957. His mother sold vegetables at a market stall whilst his father swept the streets. The 14-child family lived in a two-bed 'apartment' in Mercer House on Dublin's south side, with the parents too poor to send Flynn or his siblings to school. So they roamed the city, getting into mischief. And as the years went by, sibling after sibling would find themselves in court for some asinine misdemeanour (like stealing a dinky car or a box of chocolates), and would invariably be sent to one of the Schools, where they would be regularly beaten and raped. Austin Clarke had viciously condemned the Schools (and the church's hold over the Irish populace) as far back as the 1960s, but it was Flynn's 1983 novel _Nothing to Say_ which offered one of the first eye-witness accounts of life behind closed doors. 1983 was a time when the Catholic Church still ruled Ireland, but in the next two decades, others would follow Flynn, culminating in 1999 with _States of Fear_, the Tom\u00e1s O'Sullivan-researched and Mary Raftery-produced RT\u00c9 documentary series about the abuse of children in the Schools. The series proved so explosive, it led to then-Taoiseach Bertie Ahern issuing a formal state-apology before the last episode had even aired. Since States of Fear and the publication of Raftery and O'Sullivan's _Suffer the Little Children: The Inside Story of Ireland's Industrial Schools_ later that year, the Catholic Church's vice-like grip on Irish society has eroded almost to the point of non-existence, a process that has only picked up speed in the years since the 2009 publication of the findings of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, commonly known as the _Ryan Report_, a 10-year 2,600-page investigation into an industry built on abuse, neglect, and hypocrisy. Yet the removal of the church from its role as supreme moral authority in Ireland doesn't change the fact that so many innocents suffered for so long, it doesn't rewrite history. That history is the subject of the aptly-named _Land Without God_. And as much as it's an act of reclamation, so too is it a plea that we never allow that history to be forgotten \u2013 we owe the victims that much at least.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the story of Flynn's time in the Schools, how his siblings were damaged by their own experiences, and how the family has spent the last 50 years attempting to recover. However, because so many people have similar such stories, Flynn's story is very much a representative narrative. The film is an intimate family portrait, but it's a portrait which many will recognise as not dissimilar to their own. However, rather than functioning as an investigative piece or a catalogue of abuse, it is instead more anthropological, looking at how the majority of those sent to the Schools and Laundries were poor and how the working-class people of Ireland have yet been able to find peace. Why did this happen? How does one recover from such trauma? Why did the state do nothing? Unanswered and perhaps unanswerable questions that cast a shadow over Ireland which will take a very, very long time to dissipate.\r\n\r\nWith Flynn as interviewer, he speaks to his sisters Anne, Margaret, and Evelyn, his brothers Patrick and Bernard, his nephews Gary, Luigi, Clive, Ronaldo, and John, and his niece Anne as they recount (many for the first time) their separate but similar experiences. They make no bones about the fact that they were truants, but their story illustrates the shameful barbarity of how the state dealt with the impoverished even when they committed only the most minor of infractions. Not only that, but so too does it attest to the failure of a system wherein the Schools were ostensibly intended to be places of reform, as time spent there when children often led to addiction and prison in adulthood - reference is made to \"_the beast they placed in us_\", as the family speak to how they were far worse coming out than they were when they went in.\r\n\r\nThe theme of poverty runs throughout the film, with Flynn recalling the social stigma of being poor, recollecting, \"_we were branded_\" and asking, \"_is it a crime to be born poor?_\" There's real anger that the two most powerful bodies in Ireland at the time, the Catholic Church and _Rialtas na h\u00c9ireann_ (Government of Ireland), targeted the most vulnerable and defenceless of people. However, poverty is important not only in terms of how the Schools housed children almost exclusively from poor backgrounds, but also the marginalisation of the working-class in later years, as Flynn points out those who were in the Schools tend to be thought of only in terms of victims and survivors, denied their own agency, rarely seen as the keepers of their own narratives (\"_our past did not happen_\"). At a Q&A with Flynn after a screening at the Irish Film Institute in Dublin, he stated that the film is an attempt to \"_put this history into the national discourse_\", whilst on the film's official website, he writes,\r\n\r\n>_our story has always been stolen, sold and told by somebody else. We have been pitied rather than given justice. This film is told by those who witnessed, experienced and suffered the institutions first hand_ [...] _I want this film to redresses the absence and silence and correct the historical record. This is an opportunity to ensure Ireland's history and our history is included and written by those who experienced the unthinkable and who live to this day with the unfixable._\r\n\r\nTied into this is Flynn's disgust with the Retention of Records Bill \u2013 a controversial bill proposed in February 2019 that proposes to seal the records of the Ryan Report and its associated bodies for 75 years, with a provision to renew the bill every 25 years. Currently, the National Archives Act, which the Retention Bill aims to bypass, provides for the withholding of records more than 30 years old only when the release of such records is deemed contrary to the public interest, constitute a breach of statutory duty, or contain information supplied in confidence that could cause danger to living persons. The Retention Bill would seal all records, not just those fulfilling the above rubric. In the documentary, Flynn declares, \"_they now want to lock up our testimonies for 75 years_\" (the records will be sealed even for those who provided evidence) in what he sees as another example of the working-class being denied ownership of their own history.\r\n\r\nFrom an aesthetic point of view, the film is composed of two main elements - interviews with Flynn's family and footage of Flynn visiting the places of his youth and the Schools in which he was detained, now mainly derelict shells. This footage has a remarkably tactile component as Flynn is shown touching everything with which he comes into contact \u2013 running his hand along railings, peeling paint from walls, opening and closing doors, wiping dust off tables. The footage is usually accompanied by a poetic monologue written and spoken by Flynn, with the importance of memory in the voice-over cogently represented on screen, as if touching these places galvanises his recollection.\r\n\r\nIf I were to criticise anything, it would the short runtime of 74 minutes and the strange stylistic choice to intermittently feature Flynn in a room with a chalkboard, on which he writes the subject-matter about which he is going to speak. Obviously intended as chapter headings, it's the only formal affectation in the film, and it stands out as stylistically divorced from everything else, a more directorially manipulated element than the raw _cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9_-style filmmaking employed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis minor step notwithstanding, _Land Without God_ is powerful stuff. People outside Ireland are far more likely to be familiar with the Magdalen Laundries than the less-documented Industrial Schools, and for that reason if nothing else, it's an extremely important film. Raw and honest, it's equal parts moving, infuriating, and harrowing. I don't imagine it'll find much of an audience in theatres, but it should have long legs beyond that, especially in education, where it'll be an invaluable primary source. It should also travel well, finding audiences keen to learn more about this black chapter in Irish history and the hypocrisy of a church who shielded its members as they preached morality in public whilst raping children in private.","id":"5dbcebf1a5890200196b50d5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dbcebf1a5890200196b50d5","movie_id":640222}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_A great story powerfully told_**\r\n\r\n> _The great depths of the ocean are entirely unknown to us; soundings cannot reach them. What fanes in those remote depths, what beings live twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the waters, what is the organisation of the animals we can scarcely conjecture?_\r\n\r\n- Jules Verne; _Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea_ (1870)\r\n\r\nAside from space, there can be no working environment as potentially dangerous, perilously exacting, and psychologically isolating as the ocean floor. Colloquially known as \"doing sat\", saturation diving is a technique to reduce decompression sickness amongst divers who work at great depths for long periods. Living in either an onboard pressurised capsule or a self-sustaining pressurised underwater habitat, divers breathe a helium-oxygen mix that prevents nitrogen narcosis, transferring to and from the work site via a pressurised diving bell. Written by Alex Parkinson, and directed by Parkinson and Richard Da Costa, _Last Breath_ is the latest in the man vs. nature subgenre of documentary filmmaking. Using a mixture of talking head interviews, black box footage, camcorder material, and excellently mounted reconstructions, the film plays like an underwater survival thriller. And although the directors' insistence on building to a predictable and overly manipulated pseudo-twist undermines the seriousness of the material somewhat, with the story needing no such embellishment, this is still a superbly realised film; tense and fascinating, informatively dealing with a subject about which the vast majority of people will know next-to-nothing.\r\n\r\nSeptember 18, 2012; the commercial engineering ship _Bibby Topaz_ is 115 miles off the coast of Scotland in the North Sea, assigned with testing the safety of a drilling manifold in the Huntington Oil Field. Descending in the diving bell are the relatively inexperienced Chris Lemons, the stoic David Yuasa (so much so, his nickname is \"Vulcan\"), and Lemons's mentor and father-figure Duncan Allcock. As the men descend, the _Topaz_ is hit with bad weather, although not bad enough to cancel the dive (with dive supervisor Craig Frederick explaining, \"_we were at the limits of diving, but it wasn't undivable_\"). As Lemons and Yuasa begin working, Allcock remains in the bell to feed out the divers' \"umbilicals\"; a mass of cables that brings them warm water, light, and oxygen, and keeps them connected to the _Topaz_'s computer and AV systems. At a depth of 300 feet, in pitch blackness, with ten times atmospheric pressure and temperatures just above freezing, without an umbilical, a diver can't last long. With the Topaz locked into position by its Dynamic Positioning (DP) system, everything is going well until the system inexplicably fails, something no one on the boat had ever seen happen. With winds now reaching 35 knots, causing 18-foot swells, the Topaz quickly begins to drift out of position, dragging the bell with it, which in turn drags the men via their umbilicals. Frederick immediately orders Lemons and Yuasa back to the bell, but Lemons's umbilical snags on the manifold, and after being pulled taut, eventually snaps. With only five minutes of emergency oxygen in his reserve tanks, and cut off from all contact with the bell and the surface, his crewmates are horrified to realise it will take them at least 30 minutes to return to their position and try to find him. That's if they can even regain control of the Topaz's DP at all.\r\n\r\nAlthough the talking head interviews are a little flat, the rest of _Last Breath_ looks great, with the reconstructions so well done (it helps that the actual participants play themselves) that they blend seamlessly with the footage shot from the divers' helmet-cams and the _Topaz_'s cameras. The film opens with \"first-person\" camcorder footage of Lemons giving a tour of the _Topaz_, explained naturally insofar as he and his fianc\u00e9e, Morag Martin, tended to send one-another videos rather than writing emails or letters. This inculcates the audience immediately into the _milieu_, insofar as Lemons is literally explaining the workings of the job, especially important in introducing the concept of saturation diving. Once the repair begins, the film adopts an almost pseudo-science-fiction tone, with the foregrounding of unfamiliar equipment and complex ship computer systems, reminding me of something like James Cameron's _The Abyss_ or George P. Cosmatos's _Leviathan_ (both 1989).\r\n\r\nAlso aesthetically important is the score by Paul Leonard-Morgan (_Limitless_; _Dredd_). Is he aping Hans Zimmer? Absolutely. But there are worse composers to emulate, and it's still an extremely effective score, a little overwrought in places, but it does its job admirably, especially in a scene which sees Yuasa set out to try to find Lemons, with Parkinson and Da Costa using Yuasa's narration over shots of each interviewee silently reflecting on the incident, and Morgan's evocative score swelling in the background.\r\n\r\nThe film's structure is both its greatest strength and, perhaps, it's most significant failing. It's difficult to discuss this aspect without spoilers, but essentially, Parkinson and Da Costa introduce a twist of sorts in the last act, and the documentary then literally rewinds to give us the perspective of an interviewee we haven't seen up to this point. It's both an interesting and irritating technique; interesting insofar as you don't usually see that kind of structural trickery in a documentary, irritating because it's wholly unnecessary. The directors would have been better served to simply trust in the strength of their story, which is more than able to stand on its own, _sans_ embellishments. And although it isn't as damaging as a similar example in Tim Wardle's _Three Identical Strangers_ (2018), primarily because the surrounding material is handled more competently, with less crass emotional manipulation, it is nevertheless an ill-advised technique to introduce in a form supposed to eschew sensationalism and narrative chicanery. This is compounded by the fact that it's easy to see it coming, and anyone who spends more than 20 seconds looking into the film will have the twist spoiled, rendering it pointless at best, distracting at worst; running the risk of lessening the impact of the psychological effects that the incident had on the people involved. On the other hand, there's no denying that the structure adds to the mounting tension, I'm just not 100% convinced that the trade-off is worth it.\r\n\r\nThis misstep notwithstanding, _Last Breath_ is an excellent piece of documentary filmmaking. Although it's not quite up to the dizzying standards of something like Kevin Macdonald's _One Day in September_ (1999) or _Touching the Void_ (2003), Jos\u00e9 Padilha's _\u00d4nibus 174_ (2002), or Chris Martin's _Under the Wire_ (2018), there's still a lot to recommend it. Combining elements of the survival documentary subgenre with the aesthetic tropes of the submarine\/submersible movie, the film admirably conveys what for these men is a normal working day; claustrophobia, isolation, an unforgiving environment. Cogently depicting the very strong bonds that form in such circumstances, the film presents a group of very likeable people who have as much respect for one another as they do reverence for the ocean in which they ply their trade. In one respect, it's a story of blue-collar solidarity, in another, it's a slick thriller. Providing plenty of material for the audience with which to empathise, _Last Breath_ is as worth checking out for its quieter human elements as it is for its grandiose struggle against-the-odds storyline.","id":"5d5d8c06202e11001792bf2b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d5d8c06202e11001792bf2b","movie_id":570973}

Every movie has the right to be entertaining even if it completely disregards physics and logic\u2026 As long as it establishes its tone from the start. You can\u2019t make an action film where the main characters survive basically everything they shouldn\u2019t and take everything seriously. It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t have that mix of tones (Furious 7 did it brilliantly), but that\u2019s reserved for some of the best movies of the year since it\u2019s not easy (at all) to balance so many different things. Hobbs & Shaw sets its tone in the first 10 minutes, and everyone knows what they\u2019re getting themselves into. However, it didn\u2019t quite work for me this time\u2026\r\n\r\nThe Fast & Furious saga is an undeniable success, even more in my country where it constantly breaks box-office records. It possesses everything a popcorn blockbuster should have: tons of action (car chases, explosions, fights, shootouts), easy-to-follow plot, and simple character development. There\u2019s no problem in leaving your brain at the entrance of the theater for a couple of hours and just have fun. Of course, Hobbs & Shaw is ridiculous. It\u2019s completely absurd, it has no sense of logic, and it\u2019s unbelievable how many physics-defying sequences occur. But that\u2019s exactly what they establish in those first few minutes, so people just need to sit comfortably and eat that whole bag of popcorn while watching the most ludicrous action on-screen.\r\n\r\nSo, if the tone is well-balanced, why didn\u2019t I enjoy it as much as the rest? People seem to be having tremendous fun (even critics who usually demolish this type of films are liking it), so I guess I\u2019m in the minority here, but I just found the action pretty underwhelming, and the comedy was way off for me. Granted, there are huge set pieces, and there are a couple of great action scenes, especially a motorbike-car chase between Brixton, Hobbs, and Shaw. True, there are a couple of laughs that I couldn\u2019t contain due to how amazing Statham and Johnson\u2019s chemistry is. Nevertheless, overall, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, my main issue with the story: Brixton. Idris Elba is incredible as always, and I really want him to be the next James Bond. However, his character is so poorly written and so horribly explored that I wonder why they made him an enhanced machine with superpowers. Literally, there\u2019s no difference between him and the other two main characters, which ultimately destroys the \u201csuperhero\u201d vibe Elba should have. That\u2019s the problem with having such an absurd movie: if your \u201cheroes\u201d are undefeatable due to their enormous plot armor, how is your \u201csuperpowered villain\u201d different than them? If an explosion goes off with the three of them close, why do Hobbs and Shaw survive in the same way Brixton does? How does a punch from a \u201cblack Superman\u201d has the same impact as a punch from the other two? \r\n\r\nThen, the comedy. It\u2019s not like I disliked Statham and Johnson bantering for five straight minutes in three different scenes. It\u2019s just too long, and not all of the jokes land. The film itself is way too long, just over two hours. If I didn\u2019t know about the whole Samoa sequence from occasionally seeing it on a TV spot, I would have believed the movie was about to end when it started its third act. It feels like it\u2019s going to end, but then there\u2019s a whole other massive action set piece to show off. For the first time in a long, long time, I almost fell asleep during the transition from the second-to-last to the last action moment. The action is also very disappointing having in mind David Leitch is directing. Too many quick cuts, and way too choppy.\r\n\r\nFinally, there\u2019s an attempt at the start of a romance that I won\u2019t spoil, but \u2026 It\u2019s not like it\u2019s forced because it actually isn\u2019t. It follows a logical path, characters don\u2019t say stupid stuff to each other, and it was surprisingly being a good way of stopping to breathe and relax away from all the action. However, as the film reaches its conclusion, they ditch it altogether and never address it anymore. There\u2019s even a line similar to \u201cI\u2019ll let you have a kiss tomorrow if we\u2019re still alive\u201d, but they never go there again. It\u2019s like it never happened\u2026 Why? The only thing that was truly being logical and emotionally compelling is completely ignored by the end. That\u2019s disappointing.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to be too harsh on the movie because I do understand how entertaining and fun it might be. I\u2019m sure audiences will love it, and fans of the franchise will love it even more. The chemistry of the cast is palpable, and everyone is terrific. Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham are awesome as the action superstars, and they\u2019re definitely the main source of entertainment. Vanessa Kirby is also pretty great, and I have to commend the film for keeping two spectacular cameos under wraps. You won\u2019t believe who\u2019s in this movie as well. There are still a couple of cool action sequences, and I did laugh more than a couple of times, so I guess it isn\u2019t as bad as this review might transmit.\r\n\r\nI know I\u2019m in the minority, so I recommend all of you to go watch it and judge it for yourselves. If you enjoy absurdity, ridiculousness, and over-the-top action, as well as cheesy comedy, Hobbs & Shaw might be perfect for you. It didn\u2019t really work for me, though. The comedy was not as good as I expected, the action is not that captivating, and Brixton is such a horribly written and unexplored character, that I kept feeling frustrated every time an action sequence ended. Go for the huge set pieces and the dumb fun, stay for the amazing cast\u2019s chemistry. \r\nPS: if you haven\u2019t watched Game Of Thrones by now, heavy spoilers in this film. You\u2019ve been warned.\r\n\r\nRating: C","id":"5d4850112d1e405082c08263","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d4850112d1e405082c08263","movie_id":384018}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"I think _Ford v Ferrari_ suffers from mismarketing. I don't mean that it was poorly marketed, and that the trailers made it look bad or anything. Just that it was marketed inaccurately. When I was keeping myself abreast of this project, it seemed very much that the insinuation was that the movie would be a battle between Bale's and Damon's respective characters. That this would essentially be the run-through of the whole film, and the climax would feature one emerging victorious over the other. In actual fact, the opposite is true. _Ford v Ferrari_ is largely about the friendship and partnership of those two characters. An occasionally rugged, and one occasion even violent friendship, but a friendship nonetheless. Even the title is misleading. I suppose Ford does v Ferrari at a couple of points over the movie's runtime, but it's not what _Ford v Ferrari_ is **about**. In fact, Ferrari barely features in the movie at all. Here's the kicker though: I actually liked what this thing ended up being, more than I think I would have enjoyed a movie that really did revolve around Bale actually versing Damon, or one about Ford actually versing Ferrari.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it.

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"_**I'd have preferred to see Michael Mann's version, but this is an impressive and heartfelt study of friendship and triumph**_\r\n\r\n>_Next year, Ferrari's ass is mine._ \r\n\r\n- Carroll Shelby, after losing to Ferrari in the 1964 World Sports Car Championship\r\n\r\n>_To take control of this materialised energy, to draw the reins over this monster with its steel muscles and fiery heart - there is something in the idea which appeals to an almost universal sense, the love of power._\r\n\r\n- A.J. Baime; _Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans_ (2009)\r\n\r\nIn 2015, a long-gestating project was announced as entering pre-production \u2013 based on Brock Yates's 1991 book _Enzo Ferrari: The Man, the Cars, the Races_, the film was tentatively called _Enzo Ferrari_ and was to be written, produced, and directed by Michael Mann (_Heat_; _The Insider_; _Ali_). A long-time racing fan, Mann had been trying to bring Ferrari's story to the screen since the book was published (in 1992 it was reported that Robert De Niro was circling the role and Mann would begin shooting right after he completed work on _The Last of the Mohicans_), but in 2015, things seemed to finally be moving ahead. Christian Bale was cast as Ferrari and Noomi Rapace as his mistress, Lina Lardi. And then, nothing. Time passed and no more was heard until 2017, when it was announced that Bale had dropped out and been replaced by Hugh Jackman. And again, nothing. In the meantime, a different film was greenlighted \u2013 an adaptation of A.J. Baime's 2009 book, _Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans_. Set to star Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, it was to be written by Jason Keller (_Machine Gun Preacher_; _Mirror Mirror_; _Escape Plan_) and directed by Joseph Kosinski (_Tron: Legacy_; _Oblivion_; _Only the Brave_). That version of the project never got off the ground, but in 2018, it was announced that James Mangold (_Cop Land_; _Girl, Interrupted_; _Logan_) had signed on as director, working from a new version of Keller's script, written by Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth (_Fair Game_; _Edge of Tomorrow_; _Get On Up_). Rather confusingly, none other than Christian Bale is in the cast, although not as Ferrari, whilst Mann himself is credited as an executive producer. Is this (at least in part) the remnants of his own film? Is his credit related to nothing more than rights, or was he actively involved in making the movie? Will we still see his _Enzo Ferrari_ at some point?\r\n\r\n_Le Mans '66_ (released in North American with the equally generic title of _Ford v Ferrari_) is an excellently made but unadventurous movie. Mangold is a fine director, but he's no Mann, nowhere near, and the film did, to a certain extent, just leave me pondering what kind of kinetic brilliance Mann would have brought to bear on similar material. In contrast, to Mann's body of work, _Le Mans '66_ could never be accused of breaking any new ground or trying anything especially original \u2013 it hits all the beats, it hits them well, but it never strays from the formula. Much as Mann's _Ali_ (2001) was a boxing movie on the surface only, being far more interested in politics and institutional racism, Mangold's film isn't really about motor cars \u2013 it's about friendship, male pride, personal integrity, sticking it to the Man, art v commerce, individuals v corporations; it is, in essence, a thematically broad and aesthetically anonymous pre-_auteur_ theory audience-pleaser made with the technology and aesthetic sensibilities of modernity. And whilst the individual parts may be unsatisfactorily safe and familiar, the whole is unexpectedly accomplished and immensely enjoyable.\r\n\r\nThe film begins in 1959 as Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) wins that year's 24 Hours of Le Mans in an Aston Martin DBR1\/300. However, shortly after the victory, he's told he has a heart condition and must stop racing. The film then jumps to 1963, as Ken Miles (Christian Bale), a brilliant but volatile and unpredictable driver, is running a sports car repair garage in LA, but the venture is failing (mainly because he continuously berates his customers for one thing or another). The British-born Miles has a reputation as one of the best drivers in the world, and is renowned for his almost supernatural ability to identify problems in test cars after only one or two laps. However, because of his personality, no one will hire him. Meanwhile, Ford Motor Company Vice President and General Manager Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) suggests that Henry Ford II (a superb Tracy Letts, who steals every scene he's in) buy the cash-strapped Ferrari N.V., speculating that Ford's involvement in international racing may go some way to countering the company's reputation for making boring and unattractive family cars (in essence, he hopes the purchase will give the company more street cred). Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone), however, turns down the deal in favour of a counter-offer by Fiat Automobiles, which is more lucrative and allows him to retain ownership of Scuderia Ferrari (Ferrari's racing division). He also calls Ford II fat. Enraged, Ford II determines to build a car capable of winning Le Mans, a race which has been dominated by Ferrari for years, winning in 1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1963. Iacocca reaches out to Shelby, the last non-Ferrari driver to have won the event, and asks him to design a car which can beat any Ferrari. Shelby and his engineering partner Phil Remington (Ray McKinnon) get to work but soon Shelby explains to Iacocca and Ford II that they will need a great driver as well as a well-designed car. And so he reaches out to Miles, who comes on board, but immediately clashes with the Ford executives, particularly Senior Executive Vice President Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). Nevertheless, Shelby, Remington, and Miles press on developing the GT40, a car capable of reaching speeds of 135 mph, if only it didn't keep breaking down.\r\n\r\n_Le Mans '66_ is somewhat similar to Damien Chazelle's _First Man_ (2018), insofar as it uses the grandiose moments of history to tell an intimate story. Whereas Chazelle used the Apollo Program as the background against which to examine a failing marriage, Mangold uses the determination to win Le Mans '66 as the background against which to examine issues such as friendship and the clash between gifted individuals for whom success is its own reward and corporations who don't see value in anything unless it's monetarily successful. Indeed, the argument could be made that the film is actually a commentary on the Hollywood studio system, with Shelby and Miles representing independent filmmakers who love the craft and see the medium as an art-form, whilst the Ford executives represent the studio, always more concerned with the bottom dollar than artistic integrity, always getting in the way of the people who, if left alone to work, could produce something spectacular.\r\n\r\nThe film is also extremely funny in places, especially in a scene where Shelby shows up at Miles's house, and the two get into a fight on the street. Miles's wife Mollie (an underused Caitriona Balfe) emerges from the house, looks at the two men fighting, goes back inside, and remerges with a garden chair, a drink, and a copy of _Better Living_. She then sits down to watch the action. It's a hilarious moment, but it's one with great thematic importance \u2013 this is very much an androcentric world (Mollie is virtually the only female in the entire film), but for this brief moment, the audience is allowed to pull back and laugh at the utter ridiculousness of competitive maleness \u2013 boys will be clich\u00e9d boys, always trying to outdo each other, and getting all worked up over something as pointless as a fast car.\r\n\r\nThis thematic focus, however, is not to say the film ignores the intricacies of racing; on the contrary, there's a huge amount of techno-babble concerning vectors, aerodynamics, the mathematics of torque, the torsion of metal, and the ins and outs of physics. Additionally, although thematically, the focus isn't on the races themselves, there's no denying that the aesthetic design of these scenes is exemplary, albeit familiar. Mann would have done wonders here, but Mangold, cinematographer Phedon Papamichael (_The Ides of March_; _This Is 40_; _Nebraska_), and sound designers David Giammarco (_The Amazing Spider-Man 2_; _The Dark Tower_; _The Predator_) and Jay Wilkinson (_Furious 6_; _Man of Steel_; _Alpha_) have crafted some truly intense moments. For the most part, Mangold and Papamichael avoid any objective shots (for example, there are no overheads giving us a good vantage of the entire race), and there are very few shots showing us something that Miles is unable to see. The scenes aren't shot in the first-person, but our vision is anchored to his. This, of course, contributes to a subjective focalisation and creates the sense of being in the car with him, which brings a default level of intensity, as well as giving the viewer a perfect vantage point from which to see just how fast these guys are going and how difficult what they do actually is.\r\n\r\nIs there a Mann influence on the racing scenes? Absolutely; if you're familiar with how Mann often shoots cars in motion (the camera affixed to the side of the car, with the screen virtually split in two \u2013 the side of the car taking up one half, the approaching road taking up the other), you simply can't help but notice the similar positioning of Papamichael's camera. Are they the best racing scenes ever put on film? No; you can find those in Lee H. Katzin's _Le Mans_ (1971), which intercuts footage shot during the real 1970 event with material staged for the film, lending the whole thing an unprecedented intensity that has yet to be topped. However, _Le Mans '66_ makes a hell of an effort, and that can only be commended.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, there are only two of any significance. The first concerns just how safe and rudimentary the film is. Aesthetically, although the race scenes are kinetic and exciting, there isn't anything new or inventive in them; thematically, the film doesn't say anything we haven't heard before; and structurally, it walks a very well-worn path \u2013 chances are that everything that you think might happen in _Le Mans '66_ does happen. This is your basic underdog story, and it adheres rigidly to that template. The character of Beebe is a good example of just how rigidly. In essence, he's a poorly written token villain because you can't have an underdog story without a token villain (usually in the form of bureaucratic interference). In this case, when Mangold feels the need to inject some conflict into proceedings, Beebe will pop up to throw a wrench into the works. His motivation? Apart from some brief references to how he doesn't think Miles is a \"_Ford man_\", his antipathy is never explained \u2013 the character is a Swiss army knife villain who can be used for multiple purposes, a one-size-fits-all token bad guy without an iota of nuance or interiority. The second problem concerns Shelby himself, who is disappointingly one-dimensional (at best), as we learn absolutely nothing about his personal life \u2013 for example, the film makes no reference to the fact that by 1963 he was on wife number three (of seven!). Who is the film's Carroll Shelby, and why should non-racing fans care about him? We never get an answer \u2013 he's Matt Damon wearing a Stetson and speaking with a Texas drawl. And that's about all the character development he gets.\r\n\r\nAlthough these issues are significant in isolation, the thing about _Le Mans '66_ is that it's so well made, it rises above the clich\u00e9d and overly-familiar nature of many of the individual scenes, resulting in a whole that is very much more than the sum of its parts. A film about friendship and integrity rather than racing, it doesn't take any risks, nor does it bend any rules. Indeed it does nothing that could be labelled innovative. For all that, however, I couldn't help but enjoy it. It won't surprise you, it probably won't move you, it certainly won't change your life, but the storytelling is clear and refined, and the journey is one well worth taking.","id":"5de333560cd446001437702b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5de333560cd446001437702b","movie_id":359724}

{"author":"deRedtube","content":"The kingdom of Arendelle needs to be evacuated when the forces of nature threaten to destroy it. Elsa, Anna, Olaf and Kristoff set off to find some answers. But Elsa has been distracted. She has been hearing an unfamiliar voice calling out to her in a strange tune. Led by her, the group follows the melody to find themselves at the edge of an Enchanted Forest with untold mysteries and dangers.\r\n\r\nRather than retracing the steps of its record-breaking predecessor, \u2018Frozen 2\u2019 tries some new thematic tricks. This time around, the surprisingly mature plot focuses on transformation and growing up. The film\u2019s setup leading up to the climax appears to be promising, but its third act doesn\u2019t quite live up to expectations. The conflict resolution lacks a sense of impact and feels rushed. This is particularly baffling since the first half tends to meander, focusing on songs than on purposefully furthering the plot. Additionally, the tracks are far too many and certainly not as catchy as the first film. Which isn\u2019t to say they are bad \u2013 the compositions are layered, but it is yet to be seen if they have enough sing-along power to become as popular as \u2018Let It Go\u2019. Still, the picturizations of the music is incredibly captivating.\r\n\r\nThis extends to the rest of the film\u2019s animation too, and some vibrant colors combine with photo-realistic visuals to create quite a spectacle. Minor details are noticeable as they enhance the essence of each character. While each of the group gets their moments, Elsa and Anna continue to be the focal points. The uncontainable chemistry of Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell, respectively, picks up where they left off without missing a beat. Olaf provides ample humor, either in visual slapstick or by Josh Gad\u2019s endearing yet tongue-in-cheek, almost self-aware delivery. An interesting new character played by Sterling K. Brown is an immediate standout. However, a subplot involving Kristoff and Anna feels shoed in to give Jonathan Groff something to do besides singing probably the most amusing song in the soundtrack.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a tall order to expect this sequel to capture the lightning-in-a-bottle magic of the original, but Frozen 2\u2019s stunning eye-candy and humor will be enjoyable enough for its younger core audience.","id":"5dd831ab3faba00015f96deb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dd831ab3faba00015f96deb","movie_id":330457}
{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nAs you should know by now, I enjoyed Frozen more than I expected. Therefore, I was genuinely excited about its six-year sequel. It\u2019s one of the few movies in 2019 to which I went in 99% blind. I didn\u2019t watch a single trailer, I barely saw any images or small clips, and I didn\u2019t know anything about where the story was going. So, with my expectations moderately high, how did it perform? Very, very well. I\u2019m going to write it straight away: I enjoy this sequel more than the original. For one simple reason: it possesses a more emotionally complex narrative, one which I think the target audience (basically kids) won\u2019t even fully understand.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s really hard to create an animated flick with a story that works for both adults and children. The best of the best are the ones that are able to almost tell two different narratives: one simpler for kids with basic life lessons, and another for adults with more profound themes. Frozen II doesn\u2019t reach this last level, but its layered screenplay allows for an exploration of Elsa\u2019s powers that I genuinely didn\u2019t expect. However, there\u2019s an evident downside to the extreme focus on Elsa\u2019s journey\u2026 The other characters are put aside with irrelevant subplots that only stretch the runtime a bit too much, and unfortunately, reach a certain point where out-of-character actions occur.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s even a period of time where a particular character simply vanishes from the story because Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck couldn\u2019t figure out what to do with it during the last act. Despite the subplots not being impactful or not being able to further develop its characters, I can\u2019t deny some sequences are entertaining and funny as hell. Olaf is the absolute MVP of the film, and just like in the original, he doesn\u2019t exactly have an arc. Nevertheless, he has one of the most hilarious sequences of the year. I cried from so much laughter. His song and a couple of scenes where Josh Gad goes all out are some of the funniest of the whole movie.\r\n\r\nThe voice cast is once again perfect. Anna, Kristoff, and Sven are sort of along for the ride, with the trio only doing something useful in the last 15-20 minutes. Elsa is the real star of the show. From the opening shot to the last, it\u2019s all about her, and her powers\u2019 origin. It might get too convoluted for kids, but despite a few minor missteps, it\u2019s an extremely well-developed screenplay. With a remarkable build-up and some truly amazing songs, Elsa goes through several action moments where she showcases all that her magic can do. And it\u2019s visually mind-blowing. Like in the first film, the animation quality is extraordinary.\r\n\r\nThey really put 200% effort into Elsa\u2019s magic sequences. From her running against a tide of waves to fighting against the four elements (water, fire, earth, and air), there are imaginative and incredibly entertaining scenes, which give the movie a level of entertainment superior to its predecessor. Put this together with the wonderful, powerful score, and you get a pretty epic film, scale-wise. I mean, Into the Unknown is not going to reach Let It Go\u2019s level of worldwide craziness, but it\u2019s a phenomenal song. It\u2019s even better hearing it while watching the actual scene play out. Both this one and Show Yourself have a build-up worthy of sending chills down your spine.\r\n\r\nAll Is Found is also a memorable lullaby that a lot of parents are going to sing for their kids. When I Am Older is Olaf\u2019s hilarious musical moment that left me laughing throughout its entire run. I love Frozen II\u2019s score, more than the original\u2019s. That\u2019s something I genuinely wasn\u2019t expecting at all. Looking back, I now think the first installment doesn\u2019t even have enough significant songs. This sequel has tons of songs that are either extremely important for the characters or funny parodies. All are very captivating, catchy, and emotionally resonant. My advice: please, don\u2019t listen to the soundtrack before watching the movie. Not only the titles and lyrics offer plot spoilers, but they ruin that \u201cfirst experience\u201d feeling. I got chills during a couple of them precisely because I watched besides only hearing them.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Frozen II compensates the six-year wait with a follow-up worthy of standing up to its original, which in my opinion, surpasses it. With an emotionally complex narrative, Elsa\u2019s powers are explored and developed in a captivating, creative, fun, and entertaining way. Disney really put their best animators on this because the quality of animation has never been as visually impressive as this. It really feels like a magical film. Elsa\u2019s magic demonstration plus the powerful, chill-inducing original score are two aspects that together provide some truly epic moments. However, Olaf is the MVP with a lot more screentime than in the original, and with a couple of the most hilarious scenes of the year. It\u2019s a shame that the focus on Elsa\u2019s arc pushed every other character aside, making them feel useless and with no exciting or impactful subplot. Runtime feels a bit stretched due to their side adventures, and exposition is pretty heavy throughout the entire duration. In the end, it\u2019s still a contender for Best Animated Feature Film of 2019.\r\n\r\nRating: B+","id":"5ddcebbea80673001212bb00","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ddcebbea80673001212bb00","movie_id":330457}

{"author":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","content":"Making a quality sequel can be tough, and even moreso when it\u2019s a follow-up to a beloved modern classic. \u201cFrozen II\u201d has huge shoes to fill from the outset, and this second installment of the Disney animated tale of two sisters is a mostly unsuccessful adventure. Even the dazzling animation can\u2019t make up for what\u2019s lacking, including the absence of an instant hit song (nothing here even comes close to the brilliance of \u201cLet It Go\u201d), dry voice performances, and a mediocre story.\r\n\r\nWhen ice queen Elsa (Idina Menzel) begins hearing a strange voice calling her, she and sister Anna (Kristen Bell), Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) and reindeer Sven set out on a perilous journey to discover why Elsa was born with magical powers. It\u2019s a surprisingly dark adventure that, despite beautiful set pieces, is generic. The plot is confusing yet somehow predictable, and everything is Disney-fied and wrapped up with a nice little bow by the final credits.\r\n\r\nMost disappointing are the bland songs (by Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez). There isn\u2019t one number that stands out. It\u2019s a particularly huge letdown after the timeless toe-tappers of \u201cFrozen.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe movie feels like it\u2019s made more for adults than kids, and there are some scary moments (like Olaf wandering through a deep, dark forest and flashbacks to the death of Anna and Elsa\u2019s parents) that may frighten a few children. The idea of an action-adventure animated film with two strong female leads is commendable, but the potential to be something special instead of merely adequate is frittered away.\r\n\r\nWhile the magic doesn\u2019t reach the highs of the first film, \u201cFrozen II\u201d is beautifully animated and visually impressive enough to recommend only to those who love animation as an art form. Everyone else would be smart to skip it.","id":"5e7d5a9e6c74b94ca5cac987","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e7d5a9e6c74b94ca5cac987","movie_id":330457}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"At first I thought this was going to be one of those Chinese co-productions where everyone who's Chinese has superpowers, but then I realised that it was actually every man in the movie who has super powers. So, like, equality I guess, so long as you're a man. On that subject, is it just me or does it kind of suck that Jaime King's character gets taken down in the first act because of the romantic relationship she has with a man old enough to be her grandfather?\r\n\r\nEither way, what's _The Extractors_ got going on? Well, interestingly enough, the fights in this are actually better than the previous _Escape Plan_ movie, despite that movie being entirely about fighting. I weirdly also kind of bought Devon Sawa (who I guess finally doesn't look like he's 17 anymore) as the villain of the piece. But it does feel distinctly as if it's two movies that got jammed together. Or maybe just one actual movie that had another plot jammed into it to accommodate the mandatory Chinese business concern storyline. Not sure that either one of these is the case, but it wouldn't surprise me if one was. Regardless, it's certainly how it feels. _The Extractors_ has a lot of the problems of its predecessor, but it is ultimately a better movie, if not a very good one. It's a shame, the _Escape Plan_ franchise started out... Well not \"strong\" exactly, but, promising I guess?

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_A fascinating premise and setup, but the execution is tedious_**\r\n\r\n>_The Capgras Delusion has been known since the turn of the century but has been treated as a curiosity, an anomaly. The standard explanation, which you find in most psychiatry textbooks, is a Freudian one and the idea is something like this: this young man, like most young people, when he was an infant, growing up, he had strong sexual attraction to his mother, the so-called \"Freudian Oedipus complex\". But then along comes a blow to the head, and suddenly and inexplicably these sexual urges come flaming to the surface, and_ _he finds himself sexually attracted to his mother. And he says, \"_My God, if this is my mother how come I'm attracted to her? How come I'm aroused? This must be some other strange woman._\"_\r\n\r\n>_Now this is an ingenious explanation but it doesn't quite work, because I've seen a patient who has the same delusion about his pet dog. He'll look at his pet dog and say, \"_Doctor, this is not Fifi. It looks just like Fifi, but in fact it's been replaced by another identical dog_\". So how does a Freudian explanation account for this, unless you start talking about the inherent bestiality in all human beings or something like that? So what really causes the Capgras Delusion? Well, it turns out that when you look at an object, the message goes to the temporal lobes \u2013 to the visual centres in the temporal lobes. But seeing is a multi-level process. After you've recognised it, you also need to respond to the object emotionally. This is obvious when you look at a Picasso or a Rembrandt or any beautiful picture. Even when you look at, say, your mother's face, the appropriate emotional warmth has to be evoked. Or when you look at a lion you have to be afraid. And all of this is part of the visual process, but happening in a different part of the brain._\r\n\r\n>_Now, what I've suggested is that what's going on in this patient is the message gets to the temporal lobe cortex, so the patient recognises his mother as being his mother and evokes the appropriate memories. But the message doesn't get to the amygdala, because the fibres going from the temporal cortex to the amygdala into the emotional centres are cut, as a result of the accident. Therefore, there is no emotion. There is no warmth. And he says, \"_If this is really my mother why is it I'm not experiencing any emotions? There's something not quite right here. Maybe she is some other strange woman pretending to be my mother._\"_\r\n\r\n- V.S. Ramachandran\r\n\"Secrets of the Mind\"; _NOVA_, Ep. #28.13 (October 23, 2001)\r\n\r\nWe live in an age where so many people work to live and live to work. We live in an age where Big Pharma has worryingly significant control over our lives via the drugs we're prescribed, drugs that so many people need just to make it through the day. We live in an age of genetic engineering and the commodification of well-being. And these are some of the weighty themes tackled in _Little Joe_, a clinically detached, aesthetically fascinating pseudo-horror with a killer premise, but questionable execution. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed the first hour or so, relishing the slow pace and methodical build, the gradual accumulation of detail, the anticipatory discomfort at seeing the protagonist pushed further and further into a corner. However, at around the 75 minute mark, I realised that this wasn't a slow build _to_ something; this slow build _was_ the something. And with that realisation, it didn't take long for tedium to settle in. I certainly admire the film's thematic complexity and stunning visual and aural design, but, in its totality, it's completely lifeless, the tone rigidly detached and dispassionate no matter what's happening on-screen, like a long sentence spoken in a gratingly monotone voice. It's one of those films I wish I had enjoyed a lot more than I did, but the fact is, I found the last act (which is not especially dissimilar to the previous acts) a real struggle to get through.\r\n\r\nIn the near future, Alice (Emily Beecham) is a senior plant breeder at Planthouse Biotechnologies, a bioengineering lab that designs new types of flora. As the film begins, she and her colleague Chris (Ben Whishaw) have just unveiled their latest creation \u2013 a flower she's named Little Joe, which omits a scent that makes people happy on a biochemical level. Alice has genetically engineered Little Joe to be incapable of reproducing, which will enable Planthouse to maintain complete control when the flower is released to the public. Meanwhile, she must try to balance work with being a single mother to her young son Joe (a superb Kit Connor), after whom she named the flower. In an effort to bridge the two areas of her life, she smuggles a Little Joe out of the lab and gifts it to Joe. Meanwhile, at Planthouse, Bella (an excellent Kerry Fox), who has had mental health problems in the past, is concerned for her support dog, Bello, with whom she's exceptionally close and who comes to work with her each day, but who has started to show signs of aggression. Everyone tells Bella that it's no big deal, but she insists the dog is no longer her dog, that something has changed in him. She soon becomes concerned that this change has been brought about by exposure to Little Joe's pollen. Alice is dismissive until she starts to notice subtle, almost imperceptible, changes in Joe's behaviour as well. Could the pollen somehow be responsible, and if so, to what extent are people being altered, and to what end?\r\n\r\nWritten by Jessica Hausner and G\u00e9raldine Bajard, and directed by Hausner (_Lourdes_; _Amour Fou_), Little Joe is kind of like an episode of Black Mirror, but focusing on biology rather than technology. Building a general tone of unease rather than relying on traditional horror beats (although there is one jump scare, and it's a good one), the film is built on a foundation of stoicism, and if you've seen any of Hausner's previous films, you'll recognise some of the techniques used in _Little Joe_; the stilted, declamatory performances that are a step or two divorced from reality (similar to, although not as idiosyncratic as, the staccato performances in Yorgos Lanthimos's early work); the vaguely defined character motivations; a prominent use of passivity, which sees characters to whom things happen; ambiguity regarding the central storyline \u2013 in the excellent _Lourdes_, this was manifested in the possibility that Christine (Sylvie Testud) may or may not have been miraculously healed, whereas here, it's whether or not people are _really_ changing, or is Alice suffering from Capgras Delusion?\r\n\r\nThe most immediately obvious element of the film is the extraordinary sound design by Erik Mischijew (_Import\/Export_; _Ich seh ich seh_; _Toni Erdmann_) and Matz M\u00fcller (the _Paradies_ trilogy; _The Field Guide to Evil_; _The Collini Case_). Before we see any images, we hear a high-pitched drone, which later becomes a motif that's used multiple times to suggest unease and danger. Important to the sound design is the score, or rather the lack of score. Hausner elected not to have original music composed for the film, but instead to use existing music written by Teiji Ito during the 1970s, which itself is deeply discordant, abrasive, and unsettling and which blends into the sound design. On top of all this, Mischijew and M\u00fcller frequently use the sounds of screeching metal, rustling, screams, and, bizarrely, dogs barking. It's all wonderfully chaotic, defamiliarising, and unnerving.\r\n\r\nThe other aesthetic element that really pops is the cinematography, specifically how the camera moves. Director of photography Martin Gschlacht (_Ravanche_; _Im keller_; _Alpha_) often shots scenes as if he's capturing images for a diorama \u2013 long, slow pans from left to right and right to left that often start and finish with the characters not in the frame. Equally as interesting is that on two occasions, he shoots a conversation by very slowly tracking in between the participants \u2013 one character is screen-left, the other is screen-right, both on the edge of the frame, and Gschlacht tracks in between them to the point where they're no longer on screen.\r\n\r\nThematically, there's a fair bit going on in _Little Joe_. Obviously, concerns pertaining to genetic engineering are front and centre, and in one respect, it's a cautionary pseudo-_Frankenstein_ tale, a story of how playing God can go wrong. Another theme is the work\/home divide. Alice is more focused on her job than her home \u2013 one of the first things we hear Joe say to her is, \"_all you can see are your flowers_\" \u2013 and her decision to bring a Little Joe home is a rather ridiculous attempt to redress the balance; her attempt to (re)integrate the two areas of her life.\r\n\r\nThe film also looks at what could be called \"cognitive zombification\" \u2013 those who Alice suspects are infected by Little Joe act just normal enough for people who don't know them to perceive nothing wrong, but just abnormal enough for the rest of us to see that something is not quite right; it's as if there's a slight phase differential between how they act and how everyone else acts. Symbolically, this represents the idea that if happiness could be made tangible and commodified, rather than such knowledge being used for the betterment of mankind, it would instead be a tool for control \u2013 a narcotic for addicts who don't even know they're addicted. Think about it \u2013 if you created something that could make people fundamentally happy, think of the power you'd wield if you took that thing away, and only you could restore it; \"_sure, I'll let you experience that bliss again, all you have to do is everything I say_\". In an age when happiness as an abstract concept is being distilled into the evermore tangible (think of people whose happiness rests almost entirely on getting likes on social media), _Little Joe_ posits a scenario where the abstract is made completely literal.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's also concerning the issue of people's happiness that we can see one of the film's biggest problems. Whilst the idea that most people would be willing to take fake happiness over real discontent is a compelling one (and almost certainly an accurate one), on more than one occasion, Hausner equates such happiness with the use of anti-depressants. There are multiple references to Bella not being the same since she started taking medication, and the film seems to say that the use of pharmaceuticals to get through the day is akin to people being somehow less than their \"real\" selves. That this is a na\u00efve view hardly needs explaining; one need only mention people who suffer from depression or those with chronic pain \u2013 such people _cannot_ function without their medication, which they need as much as someone with diabetes needs insulin or someone with a heart condition needs nitroglycerin. So to suggest that they are somehow being zombified is not only inaccurate, it's dangerous, the kind of crap that Scientology and Tom Cruise yammer on about. \r\n\r\nOn a slightly different point, I'm not sure that the depiction of Alice's difficulty in finding a balance between home and work, and the suggestion that she has only achieved professional success by neglecting her child, will go down very well with the tens of thousands of professional women who are also single mothers, and who have managed to climb the ladder of success and be there for their children. And, as I've already outlined, the film's pacing becomes a real issue in the last act, when you realise Hausner has little interest in building to anything even mildly resembling a traditional _d\u00e9nouement_.\r\n\r\n_Little Joe_ has a lot going for it \u2013 an intriguing premise, a great cast, a gorgeous visual design, a superb aural design, a thematic complexity \u2013 but it all matters little when the narrative is so tediously self-important and plodding, with a message about pharmaceuticals that's well-intentioned and partially accurate, but also misguided at best and offensive at worst. More an existential thriller than the horror movie as which it's been marketed, I do hope the film opens doors for Hausner, who's clearly a talented filmmaker. But as an individual exercise, it just didn't work for me. Lacking the subtle ambiguity of _Lourdes_, the bombast of a straightforward horror, the esoteric coherence of a good satire, and the narrative drive of a thriller, _Little Joe_ kind of ends up somewhere awkwardly in between.","id":"5e59d89655c92600134dd8a1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e59d89655c92600134dd8a1","movie_id":504585}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps:\/\/www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nThe 92nd Academy Awards are presented this Sunday, and Little Women is part of the few 2019 releases that are only now (2020) being shown in my country. I really want to watch every Best Picture nominee before the ceremony not only to provide my honest predictions but also to have a Top10: Best Movies of 2019 more complete regarding the number of films watched. Well, Greta Gerwig's adaptation of the famous book isn't able to crack a spot in my Top10, but it's definitely worth an honorable mention.\r\n\r\nThere's been a lot of controversy surrounding the Best Director category, way beyond just the Oscars. The lack of a female nominee across a few award shows raised some discontent, and most considered Gerwig's work to be more than enough to warrant more nominations, especially at the Academy Awards. Now, I'm going to be as polite, respectful, and fair as I can. While I do agree that Gerwig does a great job in directing this movie, I still believe that the five male directors nominated for the respective Oscar did an even better one. Even removing Todd Phillips (Joker) out of the equation (which I entirely accept), I would definitely choose Noah Baumbach (Marriage Story) as his replacement.\r\n\r\nWith that said, do I suddenly become a misogynist? Do I always favor men when I send my own ballots to the OFTA Awards, for example? I don't think so. It's just a humble opinion. Putting that discussion aside, let's focus on the positive aspects of Little Women because there are many! Usually, romance isn't a genre I tend to love, but I really enjoyed this adaptation of Alcott's famous novel. I'll start with the cast because how can't I?\r\n\r\nWith such a stellar team of actors, I knew I was going to receive some amazing performances. Every character gets a lot of screentime, but Saoirse Ronan is definitely the lead as Jo. She's the odd sister, the one that doesn't really want to follow the \"rules\" of being a woman in the XIX century. She wants to do what she loves for a living and be independent without having to be this housewife that simply married a rich man. She wants to be remembered. Saoirse incorporates this personality like it's her own, and adds another brilliant display to her acting career.\r\n\r\nHowever, Florence Pugh gives the standout performance as Amy. Undoubtedly, Pugh is the breakthrough actress of this last year. Fantastic physical display in Fighting with my Family, one of the best performances of 2019 in Midsommar, and the most complex role of her career in Little Women. Since the story is continuously going back and forward in time, everyone has to portray two versions of the same character, but Amy is the one that changes the most. As a childish, immature, silly, young Amy, Pugh delivers some of the funniest moments of the film. Truly hilarious at some points. Then, as an adult Amy, she's more grounded, responsible, and about to follow one of the \"rules\" of society regarding women: marrying a rich man.\r\n\r\nEliza Scanlen carries an emotional arc as Beth, and the best past-present sequence is due to her. Emma Watson is Meg, the older sister who everyone looks up to since she seems to be perfect, so her arc goes through some demonstrations of how her imperfections make her a role model to her sisters. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is also one of the standouts as Laurie, a neighbor who gets close to the March family, but I won't delve into too many details regarding his story. Laura Dern (Marmee March) and Meryl Streep (Aunt March) are perfect as always. Every character arc is exceptionally developed. With a runtime slightly over two hours, it's remarkable the level of detail, complexity, and depth that the characters possess.\r\n\r\nI can't address every single one in detail since there are so many, but I tried my best to give an overview of each of the main ones. Clearly, Jo, Laurie, and Amy's arcs are the absolute best. However, Emma Watson's character story is the one that feels too superficial and too simple compared with her sisters'. It doesn't really feel like she went through any change throughout the years, and part of her story feels a bit forced. Beth's arc might also be straightforward, but since it's associated with an emotionally powerful plot point, one can understand her little screentime.\r\n\r\nThe past-present storytelling method works for the most part. There are a couple of moments beautifully and seamlessly \"stitched\" together, giving the viewer a sense of fulfillment by witnessing the start and end of a little story that happened in the past and later in the present under other circumstances. Nevertheless, some sequences either drag too much or lack emotional investment. Since the movie crosses the two-hour mark, I found myself bored during certain storylines that failed to captivate me.\r\n\r\nIn a film with so many characters, it's very common to give more focus to only a few of them. It's impossible to call someone a protagonist if half a dozen characters have the same or more screentime or plot relevance. However, this always brings the issue of not being able to fascinate the audience with every character arc. Also, some past-present transitions are so abrupt that they disrupt the overall pacing by being a bit confusing. Nevertheless, Greta Gerwig does an excellent job in balancing these timelines, and an even better one by opposing the contrasting tones of each period and still make them consistent.\r\n\r\nTechnically, Yorick Le Saux offers gorgeous cinematography, Alexandre Desplat provides a subtle yet efficient score, but the costume design steals the show by being extremely period-accurate. The colors of the whole movie tell a story on their own, as well as the set design, so be sure to look around on each wide shot because there is much to see behind the actors.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Little Women doesn't do enough to warrant a spot in my 2019's Top10, but Greta Gerwig's adaptation of the classic graphic novel deserves all of the screenplay awards it has been receiving so far. As expected, the whole cast is phenomenal, but Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet not only deliver the best performances of the film, but their characters carry the most compelling arcs. With so many people, it's remarkable the level of detail, complexity, and depth that each character has. However, some storylines are not as captivating as others, and the pacing suffers from these less exciting stories, which bring the movie down for some moments. The past-present transitions are mostly well-handled but a few are too confusing and abrupt. The contrasting tones of each timeline are consistent throughout the runtime, and the costume design steals the \"technical spotlight\". Overall, it's a pretty good romance, so if you enjoy the genre, I can't see why you shouldn't enjoy this one.\r\n\r\nRating: B+","id":"5e3327184ca67600174ecd74","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e3327184ca67600174ecd74","movie_id":331482}

{"author":"Luis_989","content":"Opinions are opinions. Subjective or objective, but I find quite interesting the positive response Greta Gerwig's second feature film has received, considering the so self-complacent film she created.\r\nI personally believe that.\r\n\r\nDo not confuse that feeling with me saying this is a misdone film. There's talent in her direction but Gerwig instead of looking for a challenge having the doors as open as she has them at the moment, she sat in the conformism and made a film that feels totally built as a ''For Your Consideration '' And be afraid if she's not considered.\r\n\r\nI don't deny that Gerwig loves the novel, she shows it and certainly this version is her personal vision but despite the nice attempt, there's nothing new or fresh in her take.\r\nI have to admit and emphasize that at this point it's completely stupid and naive to ask for a radical change in a story which has already been told a lot of times in film, however, it also cannot help feeling like a cheap mean of exploiting the story considering our current times, where feminism is now a driving force in the industry.\r\nLike I said, she went for the safe bet. \r\n\r\nAnd yet despite Gerwig's attempt to increase that specific plot weight, she also avoids going to issues that wouldn't work for the story she was trying to tell, because although they're not girls with money, they have the privilege of being protected from the civil war. \r\n\r\nJo is a young woman aware of herself and her mind, which in those times wasn't something positive but obviously the external world is not a concern for her, only her personal interests. And that's ok, we get to be that way, especially when we're young, but how do you try to make woke characters, if it's only in the things that suits them?\r\nThat's where the pertinent questions should be asked about what it was decided to take in order to make this new version work according to the director's perspective.\r\n\r\nIn the end, despite the production quality, Little Women is just a conventional and ordinary repetition of a literary classic that I personally think has already been too used.\r\nBut the proposal works both to be loved and to be hated and that depends a lot on the mentality you carry with you when you go to see it.\r\nAs always the rest depends on what you get from the film.","id":"5e0b9581d5dbc20018fdd1b4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e0b9581d5dbc20018fdd1b4","movie_id":331482}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"_**Consistently funny and very heart-felt, anchored by yet another superb Lupita Nyong'o performance**_\r\n\r\n>_Zombies weren't the catalyst. The catalyst was my son, and my son's first year of kindergarten, in particular. He has very severe food allergies, the same allergies as the character of Felix. It was a terrifying thing, for me, his first day of school. He had never been out of my care before the first day of school. I was so scared of having to give responsibility for his health responsibilities to someone else. He was so lucky that his kindie teacher was amazing. She really knew what to_ _do to allay my fears, and not in a perfunctory way. I knew she was actually really taking it seriously, among 24 or 25 other kids. Seeing her manage everything and, in particular, look after my son, and how she opened up the world outside of me to my son, it made me realize how important teachers are. I knew how important teachers are, but kindergarten teachers, in particular, I hadn't really considered that, and to have direct experience of it. I was on a school excursion with her, my son, and 24 of his classmates. We went to a petting zoo, which is where the film is set. It's actually the same petting zoo that we filmed the movie. Something happened on that school excursion where I thought, what if there was a zombie? How would we defend a class of kids from a zombie attack, and how would you stop their minds from being corrupted, as well? That seemed, for me, like a metaphor for zombies, in a fun way, to represent the horrors of the world. Whatever you want those horrors to be, whatever they mean to you, it's easy to look at an instance of a child and the thing that's going to corrupt and destroy them. It was the best way of telling that story and that idea in a fun way, to make them zombies. I never went, \"Oh, I want to make my version of a zombie movie.\" No, it was my son, and everything he's taught me, I can put into something and say it in a way that feels surprising. I think I can say it in a more profound way than if I made it as a drama._\r\n\r\n- Abe Forsythe; \"Writer\/Director Abe Forsythe Interview: _Little Monsters_\" (Zak Wojnar); _Screen Rant_ (October 14, 2019)\r\n\r\nKind of like a cross between Ivan Reitman's _Kindergarten Cop_ (1990) and Edgar Wright's _Shaun of the Dead_ (2004), _Little Monsters_ is a hilarious and unexpectedly moving piece of work, which accomplishes something rather unexpected \u2013 it shows there's still life in the zom-com subgenre. The storyline is unquestionably clich\u00e9d \u2013 a loser who cares only about himself is forced to protect others, discovering his inner strength and realising he's a douche and has to change his ways (with the help of a good woman, of course). We've seen this narrative template countless times before. But what's extraordinary about writer\/director Abe Forsythe's film is how he's able to create likeable characters and elicit genuine emotion from an archetypal structure that seemed to be in its death throes. I attended a screening at the 2019 IFI Horrorthon in Dublin, and the sold-out crowd gave it a standing ovation, even though none of the cast or crew were present, so it's definitely a feel-good movie, and a successful one. Anchored by yet another exceptional performance from Lupita Nyong'o (building on her astonishing, Oscar-worthy work in Jordan Peele's _Us_), _Little Monsters_ is heartfelt, light-hearted, and consistently hilarious, with a very well-modulated comedy\/character ratio. And although the core is rooted in childlike innocence, it's very much for adults \u2013 there's nudity, graphic violence, a hell of a lot of swearing, and ukulele-based Taylor Swift covers. The horror. The horror.\r\n\r\nDave (Alexander England) is a man-child whose life is going nowhere. Unemployed and recently separated from his long-term girlfriend Sara (Nadia Townsend), who rebounds very quickly, with hilarious results, he moves in with his sister Tess (Kat Stewart) and her tractor-obsessed (yes, it is important for the plot) son Felix (Diesel La Torraca). Taking Felix to kindergarten one day, Dave becomes infatuated with his teacher, Miss. Caroline (the always radiant Lupita Nyong'o), and when a school trip to Pleasant Valley Farm petting zoo requires an additional chaperone, Dave leaps at the chance, planning to woo Caroline. The visit is going well \u2013 helped in no small part by the presence of US children's entertainer Teddy McGiggle (a wonderfully over the top Josh Gad) \u2013 until an accident at a nearby US army base releases a horde of zombies, whose first port of call is the petting zoo. And so, trapped in the zoo and determined not to upset the children, Caroline must try to convince them that everything they see is part of an elaborate game.\r\n\r\nThe thing that struck me most about _Little Monsters_ wasn't the zombies or the comedy, but the emotion. In the hands of a lesser director, the whole film would be utter schlock, but Forsythe never allows the humour to dissipate, constantly tempering the sentimentality. And it does get very sentimental at times, but it's a sentimentality that feels authentic, grounded in something real, and, most importantly, it feels earned, particularly in relation to Dave's arc, which could easily have turned into turgid melodrama. Speaking of emotional authenticity, it's worth noting that, bizarrely, Forsythe was inspired by personal experience \u2013 his five-year-old son has a lot of food allergies and had never been out of his care, so when he started in kindergarten, Forsythe was understandably anxious. However, the teacher was able to allay his fears, making him realise just how important kindergarten teachers are. The visit to the petting zoo was also inspired by a real-life visit to the same petting zoo as seen in the film. The zombies came later, and this is an important point, as the zombies are a means to an end, a vehicle for much of the comedy, but with no real importance _vis-\u00e0-vis_ what the film is trying to say. And what is it trying to say? That children can confer strength and, with their uniquely innocent perspective, offer a non-judgmental and often exceptionally perceptive view of the world.\r\n\r\nFrom its opening montage (scenes of Dave and Sara arguing in various locations), the film's humour is sarcastic yet reverent, and this tone is maintained for pretty much the entire runtime; it does encourage us, for example, to laugh at how much of a loser Dave is, but it always maintains an element of warmth, never crossing the line into what could be considered cruel disparagement. The comic structure definitely has a vibe of Roberto Benigni's _La vita \u00e8 bella_ (1997), with Forsythe getting a lot of mileage out of Caroline trying to keep up the illusion that everything is a game \u2013 zombies chasing people is a game of tag; the longer the children all survive, the more levels they will complete in the game; the blood all over Caroline after dispatching a group of zombies is jam. Even funnier, at one point one of the kids complains because she thinks the zombies look too fake.\r\n\r\nThe film also features one of the best sight gags I've ever seen, involving Dave and a photo of Caroline\u2026or is it? This got the biggest laugh at the screening I attended, and really, I don't see how anyone could find it unfunny. There's also a brilliant scene involving Felix and a Darth Vader outfit, which includes him trying to use the force in a really awkward situation, later telling Tess, \"_I am your father mummy_\", a line which made me laugh more than it probably deserved.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the acting, Nyong'o owns the film \u2013 her performance is physical, emotional, peppy, authentic, lived-in, and when the time comes, she's fierce, unflappable, driven, with charisma to burn and a real sense of psychological verisimilitude. I've seen her in four films thus far (Steve Mc'Queen's _12 Years a Slave_, Mira Nair's _Queen of Katwe_, _Us_, and now _Little Monsters_) and she never gives anything but 100%. I don't think she knows how to give a bad performance. Her work here is such as to render Caroline a believable, relatable person, complete with a sense of emotional interiority and human fallibility. Before filming began, Nyong'o studied the Australian education system, spending time in classrooms, and talking to real kindergarten teachers, and it shows \u2013 there's a naturalism to her performance, nothing is forced (she also learned to play the ukulele). Additionally, her comic timing is absolutely spot on, a talent never even hinted at in any of her previous work \u2013 one wonders is there any genre she can't do (she's even flawless in the film's few pseudo-action scenes, and her singing voice is pretty damn good too). I honestly just can't say enough about how good she is.\r\n\r\nAside from Nyong'o, the film's other stand-out performances are Gad and La Torraca. Gad plays McGiggle as completely over-the-top and has an absolute ball doing it. Introduced as a kind of hyperactive but generally affable Mr. Rogers, we soon learn he's a hysterical, cowardly, self-obsessed, alcoholic, sex-addicted misogynist, who hates children, and who bitterly despises his comedic companion, a hand puppet named Mr Frogsy. This ridiculously over-the-top list of character failings gives Gad huge room to ham it up, and boy does he lean into the opportunity \u2013 whether it be tearfully confessing to Dave that he's addicted to having sex with single-mothers; drinking hand sanitizer for a buzz; screaming at zombies, \"_I fucked your mother_\", before tearing out their throats (with his teeth); or telling the kids that they're all going to die. Gad captures it all perfectly, in a performance that's the inverse of Nyong'o's grounded realism. La Torraca, for his part, is given a lot to do, and he performs excellently throughout. He's especially good in the early scenes as he bonds with Dave whilst playing expletive-laden, hyper-violent VR games. Bringing a real sense of innocent wonderment to the role, he's consistently likeable, sweet, and real.\r\n\r\nIf the film has a problem, it's probably the character of Dave. We're asked to like him from the get-go, but his introductory scenes don't make it easy, as he comes across as a self-important and lazy slob, who believes in his own magnificence so much, he's lost sight of everything else (Sara leaves him because he's not ready to have children). Of course, that's how he's supposed to come across, as it sets up his redemption arc later in the film. Some people, however, will undoubtedly sour to him to the point where that arc seems perfunctory, even cynically fake, which would undermine pretty much the entire second and third act. Personally, I didn't dislike him to the point where I couldn't get on board with his narrative, but I'd understand people who did.\r\n\r\n_Little Monsters_ is an absolutely deranged movie, in the best possible sense of the word. Graphically violent and extremely funny, where its greatest merit lies is in its heart \u2013 rarely have I seen a film so sentimental that avoids becoming turgid, with Forsythe sidestepping the pitfall of overwhelming everything with jaded syrupy nonsense. Nyong'o grounds the whole thing, Gad chews the scenery magnificently, La Torraca brings genuine innocence to proceedings, and Forsythe nails the comedy\/zombie balance, with virtually every joke and sight gag landing to one degree or another. The personal nature of the story's origin seeps through at every moment, and it's this sense of genuine emotional attachment which makes the film so good \u2013 it's a classic example of something being greater than the sum of its parts. The zom-com subgenre is almost completely in the rearview mirror, but Forsythe has been able to craft an emotionally genuine (and genuinely emotional) film that actually has something to say, and that has fun saying it.","id":"5dc24ad8a9b9a400111b413c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dc24ad8a9b9a400111b413c","movie_id":503125}

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"Official Secrets leaks its thrills and political deceit through an accurate whistleblowing docudrama. Governments. A democratic selection of individuals to govern a nation with the public\u2019s best interest taken into consideration. Providing foreign communications, budget monitoring and defensive security. Essentially, attempting to make the country more sustainable for its future endeavours. Yet, here we are in the UK, squabbling endlessly over Brexit for months on end with not one single MP physically listening to the voices of the nation. A recurring distractive technique that acts as a vivid reminder of the toxic deceit that the Blair\/Bush administration fabricated. Illegally, might I add.\r\n\r\nThe 2003 Iraq Invasion was a preventable war. An unnecessary crime against humanity. Hood\u2019s docudrama prompts us to relive the political agendas of socialist manipulation, by recounting GCHQ employee Katharine Gun\u2019s life, but more specifically her intent on preventing a war. She leaked a sensitive memo that would expose illegal spy operations by the United States, as Bush attempted to blackmail the UN Security Council into voting for a war he deemed was inevitable. The deaths of millions of Iraqis, military forces and other officials as a result of his dictatorial administration. \u201cBush\u2019s World\u201d states the placards of London protests. Their blood, on his hands. And whilst the recounting of Gun\u2019s \u201ctraitor\u201d-like behaviour is formally structured as with most mechanically inclined political thrillers, Hood manages to competently evoke an emotional response.\r\n\r\nSee, not all films have to be entertaining. Not all films have to include fictionalised strands for the sake of mainstream enjoyment. Films can be informative. And most of all, they can make you feel. Perhaps the most microscopic output of wonderment or fear. But Official Secrets is another beast. Official Secrets categorically boiled my blood. Shaking my head in disbelief by the events that happened, the overwhelming sense of betrayal flooded my soul. \u201c9\/11\u201d was the most dreadful terrorist attack to ever take place. Fact. But Bush\u2019s response was questionable at best, and the events depicted here act as a window into the political deceit that unfolded. Socialist propaganda. I shan\u2019t force my own political viewpoints through, but suffice to say I loathe the Iraq Invasion with a passion. Quite frankly, it was disgusting.\r\n\r\nHood maintains a semi-neutral perspective throughout, allowing audiences to question Gun\u2019s motives as either inspiring or traitorous. Knightley commands every scene with a touch of naivety that progressed Gun into being a representative of the people. Fully acknowledging the infringement the Official Secrets Act, she took it upon herself to clear her conscious. Incredibly inspiring, and well documented by Hood who intricately ramped up the tension when required. Smith, portraying a reporter from The Observer, managed to break away from his infamous sci-fi character and delivered a nuanced yet emergent performance. Fiennes, Ifans and Goode also leading the charge for the excellent British cast.\r\n\r\nThe Bernstein\u2019s screenplay was tight, taut and tense. Many scenes, particularly when Gun is questioned by Scotland Yard detectives, evoked pure morality and bravery through the concise vocabulary used. Frequently referring to the governmental lies bestowed upon the nation. The various narrative time shifts did produce some inconsistent pacing, but manages to efficiently smooth out the wrinkles shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nHood never cloaks the story. He attacked Labour\u2019s political agenda head on, without inferring his own perspective. By simply documenting the events, he has created one of the best thrillers of the year that really must be watched. There are no secrets left to hide anymore.","id":"5e21da20cf4b8b0017f1996f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e21da20cf4b8b0017f1996f","movie_id":393624}
{"author":"ekaterinats","content":"I was surprised to learn that \u201cPerdiendo el Este\u201d is the second chapter of the film \u201cPerdiendo el Norte\u201d. Both of these chapters are outstanding and amazing. This comedy is directed by Paco Caballero, he has made a film which is truly humorous and fascinating due to it is based on cultural contrasts and language confusion. \u201cPerdiendo el Este\u201d was filmed in 2019, the action takes place in Spain and China in very picturesque locations. By the way, one amazing fact is that this comedy is shown on the trip in train AVE (Sevilla-Valencia), therefore it is considered as an appropriate film for all the passengers.\r\n\r\nThe writers have created a script which is thrilling and it includes a lot of embarrassment situations which are close to everyone who has ever tried to live and study abroad. The exotic country of ancient culture has become a modern and vibrant country where everything is possible. That\u2019s why thousands of young people in the world decide to pack their bags and set their course to China. Braulio (Juli\u00e1n L\u00f3pez) moved to Hong Kong with Rafa (Miki Esparb\u00e9) and Hakan (Younes Bachir) in search of new opportunities. However, it is not easy to succeed in a county where language, culture and customs are totally different from those of Europe. It's about the new adventures of a generation lost in search of fortune. But in their search three members find themselves more lost than ever. For Braulio, his experience in China is miserable until he accidentally meets Xiao (Chacha Huang), a different and modern girl with future expectations. They support each other to achieve their goals: the young woman uses him to frighten the suitors that her father seeks for her, while he tries to marry her to obtain residence. \r\n\r\nI did really like this film because it shows us a bunch of traditions and customs of Spain and China. One of the brightest episodes took place in Pamplona during the festival of San Ferm\u00edn, I consider that it is the most interesting scene for Spanish culture lovers. And speaking about the actors of this film, they are truly well selected. One of the actors is Leo Harlem. Last two years he became famous by acting in Spanish comedies such as \u201cEl mejor verano de mi vida\u201d and \u201cPadre no hay m\u00e1s que uno\u201d. His acting is really brilliant and heartfelt. The protagonist of this film is Juli\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, he acts accurately, every his scene is full of various emotions.\r\n \r\nThe definitely curious thing about this comedy is how people learn foreign languages while living in foreign countries and mingle with the local population. I would recommend watching this comedy for all people whose life is connected with travelling and especially with studying languages. And do remember that \u201cto travel is to come back\u201d, how Gabriel Garcia M\u00e1rquez wrote in his poem, this film also reminds us that concept.","id":"5da7f2bbe6d3cc0013aea23d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5da7f2bbe6d3cc0013aea23d","movie_id":542931}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_A slightly repetitive, but nonetheless fascinating societal drama that rewards concentration_**\r\n\r\n>_One of my key concerns with_ Luce_, and intertwined with exploring identity, is exploring power \u2013 who has it, who doesn't, and how our institutions uphold the rigid systems of power that disadvantage certain demographics. So much of the dialogue in our culture right now is about confronting systems of power that disenfranchise women, the LGBTQIA community, people of colour, people with disabilities, and a myriad of other marginalised groups. Luce explores how life can be experienced by those_ _on the receiving end of exploitative and unfair power dynamics._\r\n\r\n- Julius Onah; Press Notes\r\n\r\nTrump's America, such as it is, is a place where the intolerance, xenophobia, and hatred that once existed in the shadows, now proudly parades around in daylight, a red baseball cap on its head, an American flag draped around its shoulders. As a result, issues such as race, gender, and class have become more incendiary topics than they've been in years. It's a house divided against itself, and it's the setting for _Luce_, a film which examines a myriad of these issues. Adapted from the play of the same name by J.C. Lee, _Luce_ was written for the screen by Lee and Julius Onah, and directed by Onah. Tackling all manner of hot-button issues, including race, class, gender, power, privilege, #MeToo, academic achievement, stereotypes, liberal elitism, even revolutionary rhetoric and the importance of language in encoding societal\/political power structures, it also works as a thriller about a young man who may, or may not, be a dangerous sociopath posing as the embodiment of the American Dream. Without question it asks a lot of the audience, not just in terms of meeting it halfway in an ideological sense, but also in more fundamental narrative terms \u2013 the film's core is a puzzle that can only be fully resolved by reading between the lines. And there are a hell of a lot of lines, meaning some audiences simply won't want to put in the effort. It's by no means perfect \u2013 it's too long and lapses into repetition on occasion, and it spread itself too thin thematically \u2013 but, by and large, this is strong work, brilliantly acted, subtly directed, and with plenty to say to those willing to listen.\r\n\r\nIn Arlington, VA, 17-year-old Luce Edgar (Kelvin Harrison, Jr.) is the adopted son of Peter (Tim Roth) and Amy (Naomi Watts), a middle-class liberal couple. Born in Eritrea, Luce spent the first seven years of his life as a child soldier. However, with the love of his adopted parents and a lot of therapy, he has grown into an exceptional young man; all-star athlete, captain of the debating team, all-round honour student, celebrated by his school as destined for greatness. However, when his history teacher Harriet Wilson (Octavia Spencer), who has a reputation for being harder on black students and in whose class Luce's grades are lower than in his others, gives an assignment to write from the perspective of a revolutionary, Luce chooses Frantz Fanon, the Pan-Africanist writer who argued in his 1961 book _Les Damn\u00e9s de la Terre_ that colonialism could only be defeated by violence. Disturbed by Luce's apparent endorsement of Fanon's theories, Wilson searches his locker without his permission (something she has also done to other students), finding powerful fireworks, and so sets out to convince the Edgars that their son may be dangerous. However, when Luce learns what Wilson is doing, he embarks on his own course of action.\r\n\r\nIn a film which takes in countless themes, one of the most prevalent is race, especially the notion of differences in black identity \u2013 both Wilson and Luce are black, but Luce is also an immigrant with a vastly different frame of socio-political reference. Sure, he has experienced great hardships, but since arriving in the US, he's been relatively sheltered (to quote Onah, \"_Luce's proximity to whiteness affords him certain privileges that other black characters don't enjoy_\", and when Wilson asks him if anyone has ever called him the n-word, he admits they have not). Wilson, for her part, is a child of the 60s, with direct experience of the Civil Rights Movement and the racism that made it necessary. However, perhaps because of this, she subscribes to the theories of respectability politics, seeing all black people as brethren and sharing a common bond. This is one of the things against which Luce pushes back most strongly \u2013 he disagrees that there's such a thing as a monolithic black identity, insisting he's more than a symbol for minorities and refusing to conform to Wilson's conception of what a successful black student should be. He argues that if the point of the Civil Rights Movement was to give people the freedom to be whomever they want, then he too should be afforded that same freedom. To conform to preconceived and idealised notions would be to define himself on other peoples' terms, in a manner not entirely dissimilar from the very inequalities against which the Civil Rights Movement was a reaction.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, it's important not to forget that amidst all the ideological differences between Luce and Wilson, their initial conflict is a more tangible one \u2013 after writing a paper about violence, he's profiled in a way that a white student would not be. The fact that Wilson herself is black is irrelevant to this \u2013 she reads what he says about violence and she assumes he shares Fanon's sentiments, and hence could very well be dangerous, although he maintains he did only what the assignment called for \u2013 to write from the perspective of a revolutionary. In this way, the film deconstructs the concept of the \"model immigrant\" \u2013 the immigrant who must prove their harmlessness and demonstrate their potential to contribute before they can be accepted by society at large. But is such a requirement of assimilation just another form of racial profiling? This is one of the (many) fascinating and well-articulated thematic questions left relatively unanswered.\r\n\r\nOne of the things the film does especially well is toy with audience expectations. Wilson, like much of society, seems to think of Luce in binary terms \u2013 he's either a bastion of what's possible in the land of dreams or he's violent and dangerous. Cinema audiences too are conditioned to think in such binaries \u2013 we want ambiguous characters such as Luce to ultimately be revealed as one thing or the other, and that Onah resists this is built into the film's very DNA. He knows that people will scan the text to find clues to confirm this notion or that notion, and he delights in complicating that process at every turn \u2013 when a grinning Luce mentions fireworks to Wilson, is he threatening her or is it an innocent reference to the Fourth of July; when an amiable Luce meets Wilson and her drug-addict sister Rosemary (a stunning performance by Marsha Stephanie Blake) in a supermarket, is it a coincidence or did he follow them? In short, is Luce the sociopath that Wilson thinks he is or is he the perfect student and son whom everyone else believes him to be? That both are possible for almost the entire runtime is a testament to the writing, directing, and acting.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I'd be remiss if I didn't talk a little about that acting, which is universally exceptional. Harrison vacillates (often within a single scene) between playing Luce as a manipulator who uses every tool available to him to subtly attack others and an honourable and gifted young man determined to make his parents proud. And just when you think you've got him figured out, a sly glance, a slight smile, a shift in body language will completely dismantle your theory. In a part that's very, very wordy, some of Harrison's best acting concerns Luce's subtle non-verbal traits, in what is a remarkably nuanced and ambivalent performance. Spencer is equally good in the role of Wilson, whom she plays as far more on the surface than Harrison's Luce. However, so too does she exhibit a degree of ambivalence \u2013 we're often not sure if she's acting out of genuine concern for the school or is instead being vindictive towards a student whose thinking she has been unable to bend to her own.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, the audience has to do a lot of the leg work, and it's something which will be immediately distasteful to some, especially those who demand rigid binaries and clear explanations from their narratives. Personally, I loved the inherent ambiguity, but I understand that some won't. The same is true of many of the themes, which tend to be raised in something of a phenomenological vacuum, exiting almost as hypotheticals rather than prescribed answers to the issues addressed, and again asking the audience to connect some of the dots. More of a problem for me was that the film ran a good 20 minutes longer than necessary, with much of the dramatic tension slackening in the last act, when it should be at its most taut. It's also prone to repetition \u2013 seen most clearly in Peter and Amy's constant back and forths and the tense dialogue scenes between Luce and Wilson, several of which run a beat or two too long. The film also features a few too many issues, several of which are introduced and taken virtually nowhere. A subplot involving a possible sexual assault at a party, for example, pays lip-service to many of the tenets of #MeToo but does very little beyond that.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I was impressed with _Luce_. What it says about the US's (in)ability to engage in meaningful dialogue regarding important socio-political topics isn't flattering, but it is compelling. Essentially a film about pressure, as exerted by parents, by schools, by teachers, by friends, by society, by oneself, it's at least partly an expos\u00e9 on the bitter divisions inherent in Trump's America, taking in race, gender, history, truth, #MeToo, respectability politics, expectation, language, power, even some thriller beats. It does spread itself a little thin and the ambiguity won't be to everyone's taste, but this is brave filmmaking with a lot on its mind.","id":"5dd48f52e267de00139c2dc1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dd48f52e267de00139c2dc1","movie_id":492616}

Certainly the term applies to writer\/director Trey Edward Shults's previous films, the unconventional Thanksgiving drama _Krisha_ (2015) and the brilliant but poorly marketed post-apocalyptic thriller _It Comes at Night_ (2017). And although these two films would seem to have little in common with the more social realist concerns of _Waves_, all three share the same thematic DNA, focusing as they do on a family under intense pressure. And yes, all three are challenging in their own way. Another term you'll often hear is \"not for everyone\", and again, that's as true here as in Shults's previous work. Certainly, if you're into formalism, you'll find plenty here to keep you happy; elaborate camera moves, varying aspect ratios, extreme colour correction, unusual shot composition, a sound design which bleeds into the soundtrack\/score (and vice versa), a quite audacious shift in focalisation at the half-way point, and a stunningly concise closing shot. On the other hand, it's an emotionally bruising, deeply upsetting film, which takes its sweet time getting anywhere. It also asks much more of the viewer than your average Marvel movie, and some simply won't want to put in the legwork. Nothing wrong with that, of course, and if you consider cinema as entertainment only, I'd imagine Waves will leave you bored and frustrated. However, if you have the patience and are willing to take the journey on which the film wants to bring you, the cathartic rewards are many.\r\n\r\nIn a middle-class suburb in Florida, Tyler Williams (a brilliant Kelvin Harrison Jr.) is a popular high school senior and skilled wrestler, who is deeply in love with his girlfriend Alexis Lopez (Alexa Demie). At home, he has a good relationship with his sister Emily (a heartbreakingly sweet Taylor Russell) and stepmother Catherine (Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry). His relationship with his domineering father Ronald (a sternly intimidating Sterling K. Brown in full-on stare mode) is somewhat strained due to Ronald, himself a former athlete who was forced to retire due to a knee injury, constantly pushing him to succeed. As the film begins, Tyler's shoulder is causing him problems, and although he keeps it a secret, he soon learns he has a Level 5 SLAP tear, with his doctor telling him he'll need surgery and a few months off from wrestling, or the damage will become permanent. Seeing his hopes of getting a sports scholarship falling apart, Tyler ignores the doctor's advice, continuing to wrestle and starting to self-medicate with Ronald's painkillers. Meanwhile, he becomes increasingly acerbic and starts drinking heavily, and when he learns that Alexis is pregnant, his attitude worsens even further. At around the half-way point of the film, the focalisation then shifts to the shy and socially awkward Emily, looking at her burgeoning romance with Tyler's wrestling teammate Luke (a passive and pensive Lucas Hedges). Meanwhile, the Williams family must try to come to terms with a horrific act of violence that could change all of their lives.\r\n\r\nThe most noticeable thing about Waves is the aesthetic audaciousness. Shults was inspired to divide the story in two by Wong Kar-wai's _Chungking Express_ (1994), and what's especially interesting about this bifurcation is that Emily barely appears in the first half and Tyler barely appears in the second, forcing the audience to completely recalibrate themselves vis-\u00e0-vis the film's _milieu_. However, for all its narrative gymnastics, it's _Waves_'s visuals that really pop. Working with his regular cinematographer Drew Daniels, Shults's extraordinary formal inventiveness is never an end unto itself and is never showy. No matter how audacious the form becomes, it's always in service of the story, with Shults using the camera thematically rather than as a passive tool of observation. For example, the opening shot is inside a car occupied by Tyler and Alexis, but rather than shoot the scene conventionally in a shot\/counter-shot format, Shults positions the camera between the duo, spinning in circles rather than cutting, and completing multiple 360-degree rotations. This immediately inculcates us into their sense of abandonment, exuberance, and enthusiasm for simply being alive (not to mention their passionate love for one another). Before a single line of dialogue has been spoken, Shults has already started telling us who these people are. It's pure visual storytelling, showing rather telling.\r\n\r\nThis kind of form\/content correlation occurs throughout the film. For example, in the first half, which is focalised by the restless and propulsive Tyler, the handheld camera rarely stops moving, reflecting his frenetic energy. However, when we shift to the quieter and more withdrawn Emily, Shults changes the tone, employing more static tripod shots and a much slower editing rhythm, which reflects Emily's calmer disposition. Shults also has the palette reflect this ideological shift \u2013 whereas the first half is awash in garish blues, reds, and greens, the second has a more naturalistic look. A crucial part of the film's visual identity is the very unusual use of aspect ratio(s). Beginning in 1.85:1, the frame gradually reduces in width until it gets to Academy ratio (1.33:1), which is how Tyler's section ends. Then, at the start of Emily's section, it starts to widen again, eventually reaching 2.35:1. The narrowing ratio of the first half reflects how Tyler feels he's being progressively trapped as things continue to go wrong, whilst the widening ratio of the second half reflects Emily's determination to recover from tragedy and reconcile her family. In short, the first half symbolises an ever-increasing restriction, the second half a gradually discovered freedom. Form and content are tightly bound together, each informing and commenting on the other, with Shults never allowing the form to overshadow the story or become divorced from it.\r\n\r\nAnd all of this is to say nothing of the diegetic lighting, the shot compositions and camera blocking, or the blending of Johnnie Burn's immersive sound design, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's discordant score, and the exceptional 32-song soundtrack, featuring material from artists such as A$AP Rocky (\"LVL\"), Kendrick Lamar (\"Backseat Freestyle\"), H.E.R. (\"Focus\"), Kanye West (\"I Am a God\"), SZA with Isaiah Rashad (\"Pretty Little Birds\"), Radiohead (\"True Love Waits\"), Amy Winehouse (\"Love Is a Losing Game\"), Chance the Rapper with Jay Electronica (\"How Great\"), and multiple Frank Ocean tracks. Indeed, Shults had the music in mind from the scripting stage, and took the unusual step of sending any artists whom he hoped to use a rough cut of the film, explaining where and how he wanted to employ their music. He also wrote extensive liner notes for each song for the soundtrack's release.\r\n\r\nGiven the title, it should come as no surprise that the film's most common visual motif is water \u2013 the opening shot sees Tyler and Alexis driving across a bridge; they spend a lot of their free time at a bench near the seafront; Tyler falls asleep in a bath, his life seemingly in ruins as water spills and starts seeping through the floor; Emily and Ronald go fishing; Emily and Luke kiss amid lawn sprinklers and later share a bath; Emily jumps into a pond from a tree; Emily, Luke, and their friends swim with manatees; Emily and Luke jump into the ocean from a pier. In all cases, water is soothing and calming, allowing for contemplation and figurative escape, whether it be Tyler trying to wash away the chaos that has engulfed him or Emily trying to emerge from her shell.\r\n\r\nThematically, the film looks at the pressure to succeed, particularly in men. Ronald equates masculinity with strength, mocks Catherine's job, and barely acknowledges Emily. Instead, he pours all his effort into Tyler, through whom he's trying to live vicariously, pushing him to be the successful athlete that he himself could have been before injury ended his career. He's also acutely aware that as an African-American man, things won't come easy to his son, telling Tyler, \"_we are not afforded the luxury of being average_.\" However, Ronald is by no means the villain of the piece. He means well and seems to genuinely feel that raising Tyler in this manner is the best thing, telling him, \"_I don't push you because I want to, I push you because I have to_\". The problem with all of this is that neither Tyler nor Ronald have a backup plan, so when things start to go wrong, Tyler immediately falls apart. And as things get worse and worse, he becomes a pseudo-Job figure, with the big difference being that Job was self-aware and understood his suffering, whereas Tyler has no such self-actualisation.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, there are a few blatantly expositionary scenes. An especially egregious example is the scene where Ronald outlines how hard it is for a black man to get ahead in the US, using that as justification for why he pushes Tyler so hard. Whilst the sentiments are fine, it doesn't ring true that this is the first time Ronald has said this to Tyler. Surely he would have given him this talk in his youth? It's a well-acted scene in isolation, but in the context of the overall script, it's too literal and seems out of place. Speaking of race, apart from this scene and a later one where someone shouts a racial slur at Tyler, the film is silent on race issues. Instead, Shults uses the stuff of daytime soap to propel the plot \u2013 the end of a sports career, the prospect of having a child at such a young age, a family tragedy. The performers make the material work, but the film does come close to melodrama on occasion.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, although it's initially bleak, looking at loss and disintegration, _Waves_ ultimately reveals itself to be about the ability of love to conquer despair, about how life can persist no matter the circumstances, about the importance and restorative power of family. Shults uses this framework to build a quite audacious monument that celebrates the ordinary without ever overshadowing it. This is extremely strong and confident filmmaking.","id":"5e3b945143250f0019c87914","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e3b945143250f0019c87914","movie_id":533444}
{"author":"Matthew Brady","content":"I went into this blind, but as soon as it was over, I instantly knew I witnessed something special.\r\n\r\nThis is gonna be hard to talk about since the movie doesn\u2019t follow a conventional narrative. Although I believe that these type of movies will stay with you much longer, as the emotional connection you had will be remembered for years. In other words, I will try my best to keep myself collective through out.\r\n\r\n\u2018Waves\u2019 is an absolute gut punch of a movie. Incredibly unique with its film making and overall presentation.\r\n\r\nFrom \u2018It Comes At Night\u2019 to \u2018Waves\u2019, Trey Edward Shults is a director to look out for. I still haven\u2019t seen \u2018Krisha\u2019 yet. The way he crafts stories and the close examination of these characters feels so close to life. It hit me on a emotional level. I love how the aspect ratio changes whenever the mood changes in terms of tone. There\u2019s some impressive and effective use of camera work through out, but the scenes that stood out for me was every time someone drives, the camera will spin clockwise at the front - which reminded me of \u2018It Follows\u2019 clockwork-like spin. There was also some free flowing camera work that also reminded me of Terrence Malick movies.\r\n\r\nThe performances and characters were all fantastic. Sterling K. Brown delivers a fantastic performance as a strict and yet flawed father who\u2019s method of parenting is incredibly demanding. He has a son and a daughter, but in the first half we only see him hang around with his son and sculpt him to be the very best, while not realizing his putting the weight of the world on his sons shoulders. We barely see him with his daughter and when we do there\u2019s a sense of regret on his face, as if the painful realization is killing him.\r\n\r\nNewcomer Taylor Russell truly shines as the heart of the family, which you later find out was from her perspective this entire time. Alexa Demie, Kelin Harrison Jr., and Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry are all terrific, but most effectively was the characters portrayal that was both dynamic and soul crushing. Lucas Hedges is perfectly cast as a sweet young man with one of the kindest smile you could\u2019ve imagined; warm and welcoming.\r\n\r\nThere was a lot of music from Frank Ocean and Radiohead, but it's something that the characters would listen to rather than the directors own playlist. It actually sets the tone throughout. While at times it can get a bit too much music, but that didn\u2019t ruin the overall experience. I don\u2019t know why, but this entire movie reminded me of \u2018Moonlight\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe best complement I can give to this movie is how unpredictable it is, because I had no idea where it was going. Putting aside that I went into this knowing nothing, but that wasn\u2019t the reason. It's a long movie, but I was invested the whole time. What took me by surprise is how the movie is structured and how every act unfolds a new chapter. The first act was a rush of energy in terms of pace, but the second act is almost a different movie and feels almost mystical. And every action the characters make will lead a massive impact to other peoples lives...\r\n\r\nBecause when pain and tension rises, expect it to come crashing down and shatter you into million pieces.\r\n\r\n\u2018Waves\u2019 is great, but really underrated.","id":"5e2f2c5d98f1f10012fce64e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2f2c5d98f1f10012fce64e","movie_id":533444}

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"Wounds adds salt to the horrific lacerations by simply doing nothing with its premise. Metaphysical tears in a relationship, \u2018The Visible Filth\u2019, can deteriorate the mind and the soul of both individuals. The streams of sorrow and regret, taking control of thoughts and actions. An unfortunate circumstance that is experienced by the most enraptured of couples. So I\u2019m somewhat confused. No wait, I\u2019m terribly befuddled. Anvari previously directed an apparent debut horror masterpiece with \u2018Under the Shadow\u2019 (I\u2019ve yet to see it...), and decided to venture into the Hollywood mainstream with this psychological mess. Only one question overwhelmed my brain during the final cockroach-infested scene: \u201cWhat. In the actual. Heck?\u201d.\r\n\r\nA bartender breaks up a brawl and picks up a lost mobile phone that was left by some underaged students. He happens to guess the password on his second attempt based on the screen smudges and slowly becomes possessed by something from the \u201ctunnel\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe titular metaphor is one that requires little to no effort in depicting. Wounds in a relationship force the participants to become distant and more aggressive. That much is clear, and Anvari sets a melodramatic tone from the initial bar sequence that overpowers the \u201chorror\u201d elements. Then Hammer grabs the mobile phone, tests its durability by slamming it a decent six times throughout the film, and thus begins the narrative collapse.\r\n\r\nIrrefutably, without batting an eyelid, I can confidently say nothing happened in this feature. Absolutely zero progression. The final minute of filming replicated the initial minute in terms of development. Every single character was unlikeable. Every single jump scare was a bloodshot eye flashing on the screen in rapid succession accompanied by a piercing noise. The plot is near incomprehensible due to forced underdeveloped horror elements that had no resonation with the melodramatic moments. Gnostic rituals? Dimensional portal from a well-rounded man\u2019s face? Profusely sweaty armpits? Thematically and literarily, the plot is nullified by unintelligent tendencies that irritate this wounded flick.\r\n\r\nSuch a stellar cast wasted on a potboiler script. Hammer deserves better. Beetz deserves better. Johnson definitely deserves better. I\u2019m at a loss. I really am. The inexplicable character choices, from refusing to hand the phone to the police to even unlocking the device in the first place, left me facepalming on multiple occasions. Oh, and serving underaged persons. Come on! The plot conveniences that make little to no sense, from the unexplained students in this cultish circle to the entire final five minute idiocy, hampered the psychological examination of a broken relationship. Is anything actually explained? I shan\u2019t know as I drifted in and out of sleep for the conclusive thirty minutes. The amount of alcohol consumption? Adultery? Stealing?\r\n\r\nThere really is nothing to admire here. A huge misfire for Anvari that has cemented this VOD original securely as one of the worst of the year. It was over an hour and a half yet it felt like three hours. That, in itself, has wounded me.

{"author":"Sheldon Nylander","content":"This is what happens when filmmakers are more fascinated by imagery and concept but don't know how to couch them in a story.\r\n\r\nArmie Hammer is Will, a bartender in a New Orleans bar who witnesses a fight break out one night while some college kids are in the bar (seemingly unrelated). The kids leave behind one of their phones, which contains disturbing images. All the while, his girlfriend Carrie, played by Dakota Johnson, seems to be studying occult Gnosticism, which seems to be related to what the college kids are involved in.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for any kind of payoff in this film, you're going to be sorely disappointed. Literally, this film has no payoff. It\u2019s more just a bunch of stuff that happens and then, BAM!, end credits. There are times that it seems like it\u2019s going somewhere. In fact, it felt like there should have been much more interrelated stuff between different parts of the movie, such as Claire\u2019s professor, Steve, being more developed. In fact, I definitely get the impression that this was supposed to be the case, but that it either ended up on the cutting room floor or remained concept-only. It\u2019s possible that this happens in \u201cThe Visible Filth,\u201d the short novel on which this movie is based, but since I haven\u2019t read it I can\u2019t comment on it.\r\n\r\nThe film we get is not a good film, either. The acting alternates between melodramatic and completely emotionless with no inbetween. Seriously, Brad William Henke is so over-the-top, he makes Jeremy Irons look like he was on Xanax during the \u201cDungeons & Dragons\u201d movie. Dakota Johnson just sleepwalks through her entire role. Armie Hammer feels like he tries a little too hard to be the everyman. The only actor that seemed believable with genuine subtlety in their role is Zazie Beetz, but her character is pretty much superfluous to the proceedings. Her character could have been cut with little to no change to the plot.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s so terrible about this film, though, is the sheer frustration factor. It\u2019s a great idea. I would have loved to see more and have the movie cleaned up to be more cohesive and have an actual payoff. But we\u2019re denied all of this. I love the concept of basing a film around occult Gnosticism. However, it\u2019s set in such a poor movie that by the end, I found myself wringing my hands less out of fear or feelings of bugs crawling on you (which you might get) and more out of frustration for failure to realize its potential and seeing very easily how it could have been saved. When you\u2019re doing the filmmakers work for them, they\u2019ve got a problem.","id":"5dad9489b2681f001697f523","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dad9489b2681f001697f523","movie_id":505423}

More specifically, it looks at the pivotal role lies play in cultural myth-making, how every myth is a fiction, a subjective interpretation and reframing of real events, oftentimes with the goal of inflating a person's reputation, oftentimes with the goal of diminishing it. Importantly, as with the novel on which it's based, _True History_ is a work of historical fiction which invents characters and incidents, weaving such elements into what we know of the facts pertaining to Ned Kelly. Easily the best filmic depiction of the Kelly Gang, _True History_ is rugged, fierce, bleak, sexually ambiguous, and psychologically exhausting, with universally exceptional acting and some quite stunning cinematography. Acknowledging Kelly as an important symbol in Australian cultural identity, the film occupies a kind of middle ground between condemning him as a sociopathic murderer and celebrating him as a passionate freedom fighter. It takes itself very seriously, which will probably put off those looking for more casual entertainment along the lines of Gregor Jordan's rather bland _Ned Kelly_ (2003), but if you're in the mood for something complex, challenging, and esoteric, you could certainly do worse than _True History_.\r\n\r\nDivided into three sections (\"Boy\", \"Man\", and \"Monitor\"), the film features a voiceover throughout wherein Kelly is writing a memoir for his daughter, so she can know the man behind the myth. In 1867, 12-year-old Ned Kelly (an exceptional Orlando Schwerdt) lives with his mother Ellen (a ferocious Essie Davis), his perpetually drunk father, John 'Red' Kelly (Gentle Ben Corbett), and his two younger siblings. Life is hard, and things aren't helped by Sgt. O'Neill (Charlie Hunnam proving once again he can't do accents; I think he's supposed to be Welsh), who Red allows to have sex with Ellen. Although she's fiercely protective of her children, she despises Red, as does Ned himself, to whom she is extremely close (yep, there's an Oedipal undertone to the first act). When Red dies in prison, Ned steps up to become the man of the house, but Ellen sends him to travel with, Harry Power (a Falstaffian Russell Crowe), a notorious bushranger. However, when Ned discovers that Ellen sold him to Power, he runs away. Years later, Ned (a very tactile George MacKay) returns and tries to earn an honest living as a bare knuckle boxer. After meeting the hedonistic Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick (a slimy Nicolas Hoult), Ned is introduced to Mary Hearn (the always exceptional Thomasin McKenzie), with whom he begins a relationship. Although he and Fitzpatrick are friends, when the womanising Fitzpatrick sets his sights on Ned's sister, Kate (Josephine Blazier), the friendship breaks down, and Kelly finds himself on the run, accompanied by his close friend and possible lover Joe Byrne (Sean Keenan), his brother Dan (Earl Cave), and Dan's friend Steve Hart (Louis Hewison). Recruiting young men fed up with British colonialism, Ned forms the Kelly Gang, and as their reputation grows, the authorities determine to hunt them down at all costs.\r\n\r\nMuch of the detail in _True History_ is fabricated, as it was in the novel. For example, Mary is a fictitious character, and as far as we know, Kelly had no children. The film's Fitzpatrick is also quite different from the real person, whose reputation has seen some improvement in recent scholarship. Additionally, Fitzpatrick had no relationship with Kate. The depiction of Ellen is also fictitious \u2013 in the film, she's a fiercely proud pillar of the community, but in reality, she was disliked and most people shunned her. Another fabrication is the Kelly Gang's tendency to proclaim themselves, \"_The Sons of Sieve_\". This is a reference to a fictitious Irish secret society working to undermine the English occupation of Ireland. When Kelly learns he's a descendent from one of its founders, it stokes his nationalist pride, and the Gang adopt it as their battle cry.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most controversial fictional element concerns Kelly's sexuality. To the best of my knowledge, there has never been any scholarly suggestion that Kelly was anything other than heterosexual, but in both the book and the film, he's presented in a manner that seems to hint at bisexuality. The scene where we first meet Joe, for example, sees him and Kelly playfully wrestling for a book, a scene which ends with Kelly lying atop Joe, their faces only centimetres apart. Later, Kelly and Fitzpatrick sit beside one another in a brothel, Fitzpatrick completely naked, Kelly stripped down to his underwear, and the two have a very frank conversation during which the homoerotic chemistry is undeniable. And for what it's worth, while we're on this subject, it's also hinted that Fitzpatrick might be into bestiality. Whatever you want to make of the validity of these undertones, what they accomplish in the context of the film is to challenge, if not necessarily undermine, the rugged heteromasculinity of the Kelly myth.\r\n\r\nThe issue of lies, myth-making, and fabrication is introduced immediately, with the opening caption telling us, \"_nothing you are about to see is true_\". Subsequently, one of the first lines of dialogue is Kelly warning his daughter about people who will \"_confuse fiction for fact_\", saying that the only account she can accept as true is his own, because \"_every man should be the author of his own history_\". Of course, Kelly doesn't stop to consider that a first-hand account is just as susceptible to exaggeration, embellishment, and outright lying as something written by a third party. And the irony in all of this is that in real life, Kelly never wrote such a manuscript for his daughter because he never had a daughter, thus creating more layers atop the dichotomy of calling the film \"_True History_\" and immediately asserting none of it is true.\r\n\r\nThe film is well-aware how legends are propagated throughout communities, especially oppressed communities, and how such legends eventually acquire mythical and\/or symbolic status. In this process, truth is rarely a priority; as newspaper editor Maxwell Scott (Carleton Young) says in John Ford's _The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance_ (1962), \"_when the legend becomes fact, print the legend_\". _True History_ is partly about how the legend of Ned Kelly became 'fact'.\r\n\r\nOne of the points of Carey's novel, and something very much reproduced in the film, is the malleability of history, the notion that history isn't a fixed monolithic thing, but that it changes with each act of interpretation. For example, the official record states that Kelly's last words were \"_such is life_\", but historians have often questioned the veracity of this claim. In both the novel and film, Kelly doesn't say this, in fact, he doesn't say anything, maintaining a steely silence to the end. In this sense, both Carey and Kurzel reject the official record and go with a different version, illustrating the protean nature of history. Of course, this is a theme throughout the film, with the prime example being Kelly's status as a symbol, the importance of which grows and proliferates in a manner relatively divorced from actual events. As Joe says to Kelly, \"_you can fool the others into believing you're Jesus Christ, but I know that none of this is work of God_\", or as Fitzpatrick taunts him, \"_you're not the man you pretend to be_\". This is also something touched on in Mel Gibson's _Braveheart_ (1995), a film with a _very_ tenuous relationship to history. At one point, there's a montage of various people mythologising William Wallace (Gibson), in effect granting him ever more ridiculous superpowers, and later on, Wallace himself jokes about some of the things with which he's been accredited. It's the same idea in _True History_, although Kurzel handles it with a lot more gravitas.\r\n\r\nWhat's especially interesting in all of this is that the film sits somewhere between the two extremes of Kelly scholarship \u2013 a hero for the common man or a psychopathic murderer. For example, although he goes some way to explain Kelly's violent tendencies, tracing it back to a bad childhood and years of British oppression, Kurzel does not shy away from one of the most notorious incidents of Kelly's story \u2013 his 1878 murder of three policemen at Stringybark Creek, all of them unarmed, two of them in cold-blood after they'd already surrendered. This incident is depicted in all its squalor and depravity, and forms the content of the film's second-best scene, giving us a thoroughly brutal depiction, blood-soaked, barbaric, and wantonly violent. The Ned Kelly seen here is a savage \u2013 he's nothing like the mythical pseudo-Robin Hood of folktale nor the anti-establishment punk played by Mike Jagger in Tony Richardson's _Ned Kelly_ (1970) nor the charming rogue played by Heath Ledger in Jordan's film \u2013 he's a violent blood-thirsty sociopath who kills because he enjoys it. In this sense, he recalls the depiction of Dan 'Mad Dog' Morgan in Alfred Rolfe's 1911 film of the same name. Although it's now a lost film, we know from contemporary reviews that Rolfe himself played the titular character, depicting him as dangerously mercurial and possibly insane, both of which we could say about MacKay's Kelly.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, there's a lot to praise here. Alice Babidge's costumes, for example, are anachronistic, but purposefully so, engaging with the theme of the mutability of history, and in any case, there's not a single costume in the film that feels inauthentic to the tone Kurzel is going for. And Babidge works especial wonders in creating the Kelly Gang's infamous bullet-resistant armour. Karen Murphy's production design is also excellent, really capturing the squalor in which Kelly grew up, and contrasting it later on with the opulent surroundings familiar to Fitzpatrick.\r\n\r\nHowever, the film's real ace-in-the-hole is the mesmeric cinematography by the hugely talented Ari Wegner, which is some of the best I've seen in years. Having already done incredible work on William Oldroyd's _Lady Macbeth_ and Peter Strickland's _In Fabric_, her work here is in another realm entirely. Take the opening shot; a drone shot pointing directly down at a snow-covered forest, the trees of which are dead. From the bottom of the frame, a horse gallops into view, the brilliant red of the rider's cloak standing out starkly against the white of the snow and the black trees. Her real _pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance_, however, is the climactic shootout at Glenrowan, with Kelly, Joe, Dan, and Steve holed up in a small building with their hostages as an army of police move ever closer. Wegner works too many wonders to fully catalogue them here, but three moments stood out for me. The first happens as the police approach the hut, and there's a shot of them carrying torches in the pitch dark, which Wegner impressionistically renders as literally turning the men luminescent. The second is a POV shot from inside Kelly's helmet, with only a tiny slit to see through; it's chaotic, confusing, disorientating, and claustrophobic. We can hear the battle, the bullets bouncing off the armour, but we can't see much of anything, and the shot (the only one of its kind in the film) does a brilliant job of putting us in Kelly's shoes for just a moment. The third shot is a simple but beautiful image of the hut burning, the flames highlighted against the pitch-black night. I honestly can't praise Wegner's work enough. If you appreciate good cinematography that tends a little toward the impressionistic, you should definitely watch this scene. It's absolutely Oscar-worthy. Which means it has zero chance of winning Wegner an Oscar.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to problems, of which I found very few. As already mentioned, Hunnam's accent is hilariously bad, but he's only in the first act so it's not too distracting. The film is also a little slow in places, and could perhaps do with losing about 10-15 minutes. Don't get me wrong, the Glenrowan scene is worth the wait, but some viewers probably won't have the patience to get that far, and I have to admit, the narrative did start to drag in a couple of places. And, as I already said, those expecting something in the vein of Jordan's 2003 film will be sorely disappointed (although that's not the film's fault \u2013 it's not trying to be akin to previous Kelly movies).\r\n\r\nStarkly beautiful, psychologically taxing, thematically complex, this is very much a return to form for Kurzel after the debacle that was _Assassin's Creed_ (2016). Acknowledging the difficulty, perhaps the impossibility, of getting to the reality of such a widely known symbol as Ned Kelly, the film suggests that in the formation of such myths, truth is jettisoned very early. At the same time, it suggests that this may not necessarily be a bad thing \u2013 if even history itself is open to reformulation, then why not so with myths? Why not let the legend supersede the fact? Does truth matter all that much when dealing with something as significant as a national mythos?","id":"5e797613357c00001353acba","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e797613357c00001353acba","movie_id":501395}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps:\/\/www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nThis was a pretty tough review to write. I had no previous knowledge about Ned Kelly nor his gang. I don't know if this is a well-known story outside of Australia, but I can understand the reasons for its almost non-existent marketing campaign overseas. It will always feel strange when a movie with such a phenomenal cast doesn't get enough advertising. George MacKay is exponentially getting more significant roles, and he's undoubtedly the standout of this film. A genuinely remarkable performance from an actor who keeps impressing me every time I get the opportunity to watch him.\r\n\r\nRussell Crowe doesn't have much screentime, but he always commits 100% to his roles, and this one was no exception. I would even presume that he was used as bait to bring in more viewers, but as I wrote above, it doesn't seem like the studio was truly worried about that. Charlie Hunnam (Sergeant O'Neill) continues his streak of good performances, Nicholas Hoult (Constable Fitzpatrick) proves once again that he deserves a lot more chances, and Essie Davis (Ellen Kelly) is terrific as Ned's mother.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it's Thomasin McKenzie (Mary) who offers the big surprise. She was extremely funny in Jojo Rabbit, but now she shows an entirely different dramatic range. As you might have figured by now, I believe the cast is the best thing that True History of the Kelly Gang has to offer. Justin Kurzel doesn't hold back in setting up a truly realistic environment regarding the period where the movie is set, constantly placing the actors in uncomfortable scenes.\r\n\r\nIt's beautifully filmed by Ari Wegner (cinematographer), and the score (Jed Kurzel) is also really good. However, I didn't feel invested in the story nor its characters. This was a challenging film to review simply because when I finished watching it, I didn't really know how I felt. It rarely happens, but I was stuck in this place where I couldn't figure out if I enjoyed it or not. I waited a whole day to start this article because I wanted to be sure that I would write a fair review.\r\n\r\nWith all honesty, I struggled to care about a single aspect story-wise. For more than one hour, the movie feels aimless to me. Ned grows from a kid to a man, his childhood is extremely detailed (Orlando Schwerdt is also great as a young Ned), and everything that ever happened to him or his family is explicitly shown on screen. I simply couldn't find it captivating enough to hold my attention. The last thirty to forty minutes are a lot better, and the ending is impactful, as well as shocking...\r\n\r\nBut everything lacks that emotional attachment. I cared more about a certain animal dying by being shot than the actual humans. By the way, it's a visually shocking film with tons of unrestrained killing, blood, and all sorts of nudity. If you're sensitive to these aspects, you've been warned. It's a slow-burn where Ned's life is the driving force of the narrative, but I find it very difficult to be enthralled by the experience. It's horrible (and lazy) to write it, I know, but I did find it a tad boring.\r\n\r\nMaybe knowing the actual real-life story beforehand would help, I'm not entirely sure. I just want to be clear in my review that I don't feel like I'm the target audience for this movie. It genuinely feels like a film made for people who already know what they're getting into. Either that or the movie really doesn't do enough to bring Shaun Grant's screenplay to life in a compelling manner...\r\n\r\nAll in all, True History of the Kelly Gang is technically marvelous, and it boasts a phenomenal cast, who all offer amazing performances. George MacKay is a fantastic lead, proving that he deserves bigger roles in Hollywood, while Thomasin McKenzie is the main surprise. Beautifully shot, great score, outstanding production design, and visually shocking scenes create a realistic and engaging atmosphere, but all of this isn't enough to overcome the film's storytelling issues. With a slow pace and an overall lack of emotional attachment to the characters, I struggled to feel invested in any aspect story-wise. Its almost non-existent marketing overseas insinuate that it might not be a movie for someone who doesn't have any knowledge about this real-life Australian gang. I recommend it for its technical attributes, but I can't deny that I'm probably never watching it again.\r\n\r\nRating: C+","id":"5ea2c981db72c0001dbb2112","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ea2c981db72c0001dbb2112","movie_id":501395}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nOnce again, I didn\u2019t know anything going into the theater regarding this movie. In fact, Ready or Not wasn\u2019t even on my watchlist until the beginning of this week. I thought it was just going to be a passable and cheap horror flick, but the tremendously positive feedback from everyone around the world convinced me to give it a go. Fortunately, I wasn\u2019t disappointed! Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett deliver a dumb yet entertaining film with a childish yet fun concept never really explored in the gruesome and bloody way they do.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s one of those movies which the only flaw they might have has to do with the viewer\u2019s expectations. You\u2019ll only dislike this story if you don\u2019t accept its lighthearted tone. If you go in expecting a film filled with truly terrifying and scary sequences, you won\u2019t get that. If you go in expecting a movie with a dark vibe and tonally heavy scenes, you won\u2019t get that. It\u2019s one of the most common issues that audiences have all over the world: unrealistic expectations. After watching the trailers, it\u2019s clear that Ready or Not was always marketed as a horror-comedy with more emphasis on the dumb fun that the concept inevitably provides, so don\u2019t expect something the producers didn\u2019t even think of doing.\r\n\r\nHaving that in mind, the film definitely delivers what it promises. It\u2019s a fast-paced hide-and-seek game, filled with suspenseful scenes and genuinely funny moments. Its short runtime doesn\u2019t really let us care about every character, but to be fair, it\u2019s not like it truly matters in this case. Samara Weaving plays the bride who has to hide while the rest of the family tries to find her. Overall, everyone gives good performances, but Weaving completely steals the show with fantastic reactions to different situations, always making space for an extra laugh.\r\n\r\nDespite the unique exploration of a strange premise, it has a pretty generic and even formulaic development, which is a bit of a letdown. Granted, the ending is, well, unexpected in the way that it is executed, but its final result is still very predictable. There\u2019s a lot of cheesy moments, some do work, but others aren\u2019t near as effective. The score is actually one of the surprises since it\u2019s not usual for this feature to have such an impact in a rather simple movie. It provides a few chuckles with some witty lyrics, and it helps with elevating the suspense in the more tense sequences. It\u2019s also mostly well-shot and set in one-location, something I always deeply appreciate. \r\n\r\nAll in all, Ready or Not accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. It delivers a fun and entertaining 90-minute hide-and-seek game like we\u2019ve never seen before. Its R rating lets its makers do whatever they please with the amount of blood and goriness present in a scene, which ultimately culminates in a jaw-dropping, hilarious ending. Samara Weaving is brilliant as the main character, carrying the whole film on her shoulders. Is it cliche? Yes. Is it formulaic and predictable? Yes. Is it cheesy? Hell, yes. However, this movie never intended to be a groundbreaking achievement in the genre. It just wants to deliver good fun. And it does.\r\n\r\nRating: B-","id":"5d5d7b1ba3d02700160bfc08","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d5d7b1ba3d02700160bfc08","movie_id":567609}

Just over 12 hours later, Connor Betts murdered nine people and injured 17 in a mass shooting in Dayton, OH. On August 10, Universal Pictures announced they had pulled Craig Zobel's eagerly awaited film _The Hunt_ from its scheduled release date on September 27. Telling the story of 12 strangers who are hunted for the amusement of a group of wealthy elites, in the wake of the shootings, the film had been accused by hysterical conservatives of portraying liberal elites hunting Donald Trump supporters. On August 7, for example, Matt Margolis of _PJ Media_ wrote,\r\n\r\n>_in the past few days we've been hearing a lot about how Donald Trump's rhetoric is apparently to blame for the El Paso shooting, yet Hollywood apparently lacked the foresight to think that a movie promoting violence against \"deplorables\" might be in bad taste until after the shootings in El Paso and Dayton._\r\n\r\nHe also claimed, incorrectly, that the film was originally called _Red State Vs. Blue State_, before concluding,\r\n\r\n>_apparently, some in Hollywood are more than willing to promote violence against Trump supporters. Meanwhile, Democrats and liberals in the media want us to believe that it's Trump's rhetoric that needs to be toned down._\r\n\r\nOn August 9, Trump himself tweeted, \"_the movie coming out is made in order to inflame and cause chaos_\" (as opposed to his own balm-like rhetoric, which is renowned for bringing people together), saying of Hollywood in general, \"_they create their own violence, and then try to blame others. They are the true Racists, and are very bad for our Country!_\" (because responding to a mass shooting by condemning a film you haven't seen makes way more sense than, oh, I don't know, tightening gun laws and outlawing the indefensible sale of automatic weaponry to the public. Way more sense).\r\n\r\nSo, what does any of this have to do with _Ready or Not_? Well, it's just curious that _Ready or Not_ has a very similar plot (elites hunting common folk), yet it has arrived in theatres without the slightest hint of controversy. Of course, despite what right-wing commentators would have us think about _The Hunt_, the theme of elites hunting the less privileged is nothing new. As far as I'm aware, it was first explored in Richard Connell's short story \"The Most Dangerous Game\" (1924). And now in _Ready or Not_, except with tongue firmly in cheek. Written by Guy Busick and R. Christopher Murphy (aka Ryan Murphy), and directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, _Ready or Not_ is a horror-comedy and a social satire that comically exaggerates the anxieties attendant with marrying into a wealthy family and mocks the insular nature of such families, so obsessed with their wealth that they've become disconnected from the real world. And whilst it can be a tad episodic at times, and the manner in which it presents some of its violence is somewhat problematic, this is a very enjoyable and funny film that's well worth checking out.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief prologue, the film cuts to the wedding day of Grace (an exceptional Samara Weaving) and Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien). The Le Domas family started out printing playing cards but earned its fortune making board games, and the family has now become decadently wealthy, owning several sports franchises (when Grace asks Alex if they refer to themselves as an \"empire\", he half-jokingly says they prefer the term \"dominion\"). Several years previously, Alex turned his back on the family, even though he's in line to inherit the business, and it's only since he met Grace (a foster child eager to have a family to call her own) that he has started to rebuild bridges. His return to the fold has made his mother Becky (Andie McDowell) especially happy, and she makes sure Grace knows how appreciative she is. Alex's father, Tony (a barely sane Henry Czerny) is more ambivalent; he's polite and respectful to Grace, but she's convinced he doesn't like her. There's no such ambiguity with Helene (a hilariously acerbic Nicky Guadagni), Tony's sister, who makes no bones about the fact that she hates Grace. Elsewhere there's Alex's brother Daniel (Adam Brody), an alcoholic locked in a loveless marriage to Charity (Elyse Levesque), but who is deeply thankful that he has Alex back in his life. Offering Grace a get-out-of-jail card just prior to the wedding, Alex tells her if she wants to leave, he will let her go. She dismisses the offer, however, and the two are wed. Shortly thereafter, Alex and Daniel's cocaine-addicted sister Emilie (a wonderfully hapless Melanie Scrofano) and her husband Fitch Bradley (a scene-stealing Kristian Bruun) arrive at the estate, apologising for missing the ceremony. It's at this point that Alex explains a strange family tradition to Grace \u2013 whenever someone new marries into the clan, they must participate in a game, chosen at random by a mechanised box using a deck of cards (Charity got checkers when she married Daniel). Alex is worried that Grace might get the hide and seek card, but Tony assures him that's highly unlikely \u2013 stating that in his lifetime, only one person has ever gotten that card; Helene's husband (something of which we saw in the prologue). At a disturbingly austere ceremony, Grace is asked to operate the box and so the game can commence\u2026and she receives the hide and seek card, with Tony explaining that the only way for her to win is to stay hidden until dawn. And so, Grace hides in the mansion, unaware that the family (_sans_ Alex) are arming themselves with crossbows, axes, hunting rifles, and assorted antique weaponry. This is no ordinary game of hide and seek.\r\n\r\nThe film's various psychoanalytical\/satirical subtexts are fairly obvious \u2013 a lampooning of blue blood families clueless as to how the real world works, a savage deconstruction of the institution of marriage, and a gynocentric\/fempowerment celebration of a woman fighting back against old-world patriarchy. In relation to these last two themes, nowhere are they more apparent than in Grace's wedding dress, that most classic symbol of marriage, which becomes dirtier and more damaged as the film progresses, with costume designer Avery Plewes using the dress to show the stages of Grace's symbolic dismantling of the institution of marriage (to survive the night, she must make the dress more conducive to running and hiding, which involves a lot of ripping and tearing). In this sense, each time Grace evades capture or strikes back against her pursuers, she is chipping away at the foundation of everything in which the Le Domas family believe, quite literally deconstructing the very concepts of marriage and old-world patriarchy.\r\n\r\nConcerning the film's engagement with wealth, essentially it suggests that, yes, as we all know, the rich are very different from you and I, but could it be that not only are they different, maybe they're actually evil? Maybe their wealth is built on the suffering of others in a very literal sense and maybe the difficulty they have accepting it when someone who they see as their social inferior marries into their circle manifests itself in actual violence. Of course, it's not suggesting this with anything even approaching realism, and much of the film's humour comes from the Le Domas family itself; sure, they're wealthy, evil, violent, and powerful. But so too are they hilariously incompetent. For example, it's been so long since anyone has got the hide and seek card that everyone is a little fuzzy on the rules, and they spend a good chunk of the film arguing with one another about the hunt \u2013 people like Fitch and Charity want to use modern weapons, but Tony maintains they have to use antique weaponry, nor are they allowed to use the castle's security cameras to track Grace.\r\n\r\nThis all goes back to a century-old deal made between the family's original patriarch Victor and a mysterious traveller named Mr Le Bail, who may, or may not, be Satan. Le Bail promised Victor that the family would become hugely wealthy, but only if they maintained the tradition of having new family members play a game on their wedding night, laying out the rules for what was to happen if they got the hide and seek card. Tony argues that the rules can be no different from those originally established by Le Bail, but, really, his argument never amounts to much more than \"_tradition...reasons_\". The film makes no bones about the fact that the family is comically inept, and it gets a lot of laughs out of showing characters trying to get to grips with their weapon \u2013 from Fitch taking time out from the hunt to look up \"how to use a crossbow\" videos on YouTube to Emilie accidentally dispatching several maids due to her inability to handle her weapon (more on this in a moment).\r\n\r\nAnother theme, although one not developed to the extent of the above, is religion. Le Bail, for example, is believed by the family to be a demonic figure, and his name, obviously enough, is an anagram of Belial, the demon from the Tanakh, who is described in _The War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness_, one of the Dead Sea Scrolls, as the \"King of Evil\" and the \"Prince of Darkness\", and who would later form the basis for the Christian and Jewish depiction of Satan. On the other hand, Grace's name most likely references the idea of Divine grace, which is defined by _ChristianEducation.org_ as,\r\n\r\n>_a sharing in the divine life. It is the infused presence of God, a presence that is supernatural, not merely natural. Human persons are not born in a state of grace. And there is nothing we can do ourselves to earn grace. Rather, divine grace is favour, and it is freely bestowed._\r\n\r\nElsewhere, the film depicts a pit of slaughtered goats, alluding to ritual animal sacrifice, which is a pre-Christian practice. Goats are also important in Christianity, especially in the practice of scapegoating, whereby a goat takes upon them the sins of the community and is cast into the desert, symbolically removing the taint of those sins (as per Leviticus 16:8-10; \"_Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat. And Aaron shall bring the goat on which the LORD's lot fell, and offer it as a sin offering. But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness._\") Along the same lines, Grace injures her hand on a nail, in a veiled reference to the Stigmata. However, whether or not we're supposed to interpret her as a Christ figure is hard to say as, although these references are interesting in isolation, they never really coalesce into anything concrete.\r\n\r\nLooking at some other problems, despite its themes, the film is, generally speaking, very slight; it's short and it's silly, and it's not going to change your life or lead you down the road of esoteric revolution. The violence is also (somewhat) problematic. The film maintains the stance that the rich are insane and the violence they mete out is contemptible. However, some of the biggest laughs are reserved for Emilie's accidental killing of the maids. And I have to admit, I found the way she haplessly dispatches two of them exceptionally funny (especially her comment after the second one, \"_why does this keep happening to me_\"). Also funny is that after one of the kills, the family are trying to have a conversation, which is continually interrupted by the gurgling of a mortally wounded maid; until Helene takes an axe to her head. And again, I have to admit, I laughed a lot at that scene, even though I recognised that the film was essentially asking the audience to see this violence as funny but some of the violence elsewhere as not so much.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, it kind of wants to have its cake and eat it. In _Natural Born Killers_ (1994), Oliver Stone gets away with asking the audience to laugh at horrific violence because he's fairly consistent in depicting all violence as funny (whether it's being shot by a bullet that stops in mid-air, getting drowned in a fish tank and simultaneously beaten with a tire-iron, having a perfectly circular hole shot through your hand, or having your head literally ripped off by rioting inmates). Here, the film picks and chooses when the audience should laugh; it takes Grace's stakes seriously but also encourages us to laugh at some (and only some) of the violence, which is problematically inconsistent.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as I said, these scenes did make me laugh, so make of that what you will (it may say more about me than the film). Although _Ready or Not_ is slight, its satirical ire is focused, even if the tendency towards irreverence doesn't always chime with the tone of the socio-political agenda. Is it the greatest horror-comedy of all time? Good Lord, no. Indeed, it doesn't have much in the way of scares at all. But it sure is funny, allegorically skewering inherited wealth, marriage, tradition, even religion on occasion. With atavistic rules and sense of entitlement, the Le Domas family embody the concept that old-money can lead to an insularity from modernity, preventing the work-a-day world from entering their gated estates. Offering us a match, the film suggests that perhaps the only way to deal with such irrelevancies and their sense of self-importance is to burn them to the ground. And it has a blast showing us why.","id":"5da13750b84f94001597c5d4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5da13750b84f94001597c5d4","movie_id":567609}
{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nSometimes, people ask me if I feel less motivated to write about a movie I didn\u2019t like or even simply hated. Not even close. Matter of fact, it might be the exact opposite. The only films which I find hard to write a review on are those who don\u2019t have a single aspect that is either outstanding or horrible. Those who are so \u201cin the middle\u201d that you forget about them less than 24h after you\u2019ve seen it. 47 Meters Down: Uncaged could very well be this type of flick, but its ludicrous logical issues story-wise are impossible to ignore. Even the title is just a marketing scheme to attract people who liked the 2017\u2019s original since it is entirely unrelated to it (the water depth at which the characters are is never addressed).\r\n\r\nThis is one of the worst movies of the year. It still doesn\u2019t beat Serenity, but it made me rethink about the latter\u2019s grade because I find it so incredibly difficult to acknowledge one single good thing about this terrible sequel. Had I scored Matthew McConaughey\u2019s film an F, this one would probably belong there as well. However, in the same way that a film without flaws isn\u2019t necessarily an A+, a movie with no redeeming quality isn\u2019t instantly an F. If there\u2019s one compliment I can give Uncaged is that there are two or three short sequences where a jump scare is effective, or the suspenseful vibe was accomplished \u2026 Nevertheless, these are still just a couple of minutes in an almost 90-min runtime.\r\n\r\nThe characters have no development whatsoever. The story follows the most pathetic path possible. The sharks (which are the reason people actually went to the theater) are not as visually realistic as in the original, reaching a point where the CGI was pretty awful. A fish screams \u2026 I mean, really?! Who the hell supervised this mess? Characters talk underwater seamlessly with no explanation on how they are effectively talking. I could sit here and write dozens of questions that defy the film\u2019s logic, but I\u2019ll stop here. Not because I don\u2019t want to (if this wasn\u2019t a spoiler-free review, I\u2019d go crazy), but due to the fact that the main issue with the movie isn\u2019t the atrociously illogical plot points, but the lack of entertainment.\r\n\r\nFast and Furious, Pirates of the Caribbean, Transformers \u2026 All of these are (financially) successful franchises. Audiences all over the world fill theaters and enjoy these series for what they are: popcorn entertainment. No one goes for the complex plots or layered characters. People go for the action, the explosions, the epic scores, the visual effects, and all of that stuff. Uncaged doesn\u2019t have any of that to compensate its other problems. One or two scenes here and there aren\u2019t enough to warrant the price of admission. Even the acting is mediocre. \r\n\r\nAll in all, 47 Meters Down: Uncaged is nothing more than a silly attempt at the start of a new franchise. Don\u2019t be fooled by its title since it has nothing to do with the original flick. It doesn\u2019t try to introduce compelling characters, the shark sequences fall flat for the most part, and the screenplay is filled with laughable plot points. There\u2019s no sense of logic. For an 89-minute runtime, it astounds me how it can\u2019t be slightly entertaining, to say the least. Undoubtedly, one of the worst films of the year. Skip it, so they don\u2019t have enough money to try and do a third one. Who knows?! Maybe they\u2019ll bet on original, smaller flicks from genuinely talented filmmakers who want to work hard and deliver a good movie.\r\n\r\nRating: D-","id":"5d8635d7e78e2d001874a9ac","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d8635d7e78e2d001874a9ac","movie_id":480105}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***A fuller rendition of the Jean Grey Plot of \u201cX-Men 3\u201d with Sophie Turner***\r\n\r\nThis is another take on the Jean Grey story of \u201cX-Men: The Last Stand\u201d (2006). That movie was good up until the last act with the conventional battle between the good and bad mutants at Alcatraz Island, which diverged from the more interesting core story concerning Jean. \u201cDark Phoenix\u201d (2019) has a similar problem in that Jean\u2019s inner  conflict between good and evil is the most interesting element, along with the other mutants being troubled by her transformation  and trying to figure out how to handle it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as with \u201cX-Men 3,\u201d the filmmakers insist on having everything come down to a big battle sequence that\u2019s overlong and predictable, although it\u2019s better and more moving here. A good example of predictableness is when Magneto (Michael Fassbender) utilizes many rifles to shoot Vuk (Jessica Chastain); you know very well that the bullets are going to be totally useless. The ending\u2019s not bad, just tedious and perfunctory, similar to the big battle sequence in \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d albeit less dull. The original climax of \u201cDark Phoenix\u201d took place in space and had too many similarities to \u201cCaptain Marvel,\u201d which beat \u201cDark Phoenix\u201d to the theaters. So the creators had to reshoot the ending as a battle sequence involving a train, but it didn\u2019t feel tacked on or inorganic, although the Juk\/aliens subplot did.\r\n\r\nI prefer Sophie Turner to Famke Janssen in the titular role. She\u2019s just an all-around pleasure to behold, although acting-wise she\u2019s not yet up to the caliber of Fassbender, James McAvoy (Xavier) or Jennifer Lawrence (Raven), not even close. In any case, I found the Phoenix story fascinating just as I did with \u201cThe Last Stand,\u201d but here it\u2019s more fleshed out, which makes it better in some ways. I just wish the creators would have the gonads to do something fresh rather than strap the conventional \u201cbig battle\u201d ending on what could have been a great movie.\r\n\r\nIf you liked \u201cFirst Class\u201d (2011), \u201cDays of Future Past\u201d (2014) and \u201cApocalypse\u201d (2016), \u201cDark Phoenix\u201d is cut from the same cloth in all-around quality. I prefer \u201cDays\u201d and \u201cApocalypse,\u201d but \u201cDark Phoenix\u201d ain\u2019t no slouch, despite what detractors might say; and it\u2019s superior to \u201cFirst Class.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 53 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+","id":"5d2b9d6acaab6d19c599ed24","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d2b9d6acaab6d19c599ed24","movie_id":320288}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I had seen somewhat mixed opinions of this movie and none of them were really that great so I had some doubts about it. Anyway, the other day I sat down with the kids and watched it.\r\n\r\nFar from the greatest X-Men movie but it\u2019s not that bad either. It\u2019s okayish.\r\n\r\nThe story is fairly decent and, as usual, the special effects (which is really why I watch these movies) is quite good actually. The characters are doing a decent enough job of their roles although none of them are really up to the standard Patrick Stewart brought to the franchise.\r\n\r\nThe biggest gripe I have with the movie is it\u2019s incessant whining. Jean is quite cool when she get\u2019s pissed off and shows off her powers pretty much stopping anything that gets thrown at her. However those good moments are overshadowed by both her and other characters going into whining mode every so often. And Hank is just a bloody annoying asshole.\r\n\r\nI haven\u2019t really read that many X-Men comics (didn\u2019t have them in Sweden when I grew up) so I cannot say I know much about Jean\u2019s real story in those. I noticed that a lot of people complained about the story in the movie not being \u201cthe right\u201d one. Sure, when they take a known character and remakes him for no good reason that pisses me off as well but this is NOT a one star movie by any stretch of the imagination.\r\n\r\nOverall I cannot say that I really felt disappointed having watched it.

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nHonestly, I'm going straight to the point, and I'm going to try not to waste anyone's time since that's precisely what Dark Phoenix did. Clearly, no one in the production team cared about this movie. Now, after watching the film, it's pretty easy to understand the reasons behind the constant delays, and the poor marketing campaign (I barely saw anything remotely publicizing this movie). It's not a complete disaster, it's not an absolute mess, but the third act is such a stab into the fans' hearts. Literally, one of the most abrupt endings of the last few years. It really feels like a producer entered the writers' room and said something along the lines of \"let's just hurry this up, Marvel Cinematic Universe is right around the corner, nothing of what we do here matters.\"\r\n\r\nI'm not going to lie, it's actually true. No matter how amazing or horrible this film ended up to be, it wouldn't really matter, which is probably the most negative aspect of this Disney-Fox merger. Days Of Future Past is arguably one of the better X-Men installments, but Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix feel such a waste of time because they never really explore what the time-travel event really changed, and now time's up, a complete reboot is coming. The first act of this movie is genuinely remarkable. I felt invested in both the story and characters, I was deeply captivated by what they were doing, and Hans Zimmer's score elevates a specific sequence that on IMAX really shows off both the visual and audio's phenomenal quality.\r\n\r\nUntil midway through, it's a pretty well-written, well-performed, and exciting film (with occasional minor issues). However, after a risky yet convincing plot point, Simon Kinberg annihilates everything he was working on until then. From this moment on, I can feel the famous merger being signed, and everyone working on this movie just giving up. The writing becomes atrocious, one of the most forgettable and nonsensical villains ever shows up (and I thought that comic-book adaptations were working past the cliche \"bad guys\"), characters like Quiksilver are barely in the film (why set up his relationship with his father if they never approach that subplot again?), and the ending lasts around three minutes. Three. In this amount of time, they do the equivalent of the last hour of Avengers: Endgame. Now, try to imagine that epic hour of climactic battles crushed into a couple of minutes...\r\n\r\nThe cast truly tries. Sophie Turner carries this movie with such an emotionally powerful performance that I almost feel that she alone deserved a positive review. James McAvoy (Professor Charles Xavier) continues his streak of gripping displays (if he doesn't get a freaking Oscar in the next years, I'll explode), Michael Fassbender is splendid as Magneto, and Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique) doesn't do much. Nicholas Hoult (Beast) is a pleasant surprise, but Jessica Chastain (Smith) is the only one at fault here. I never felt any interest from the actress in getting into a superhero film, and honestly, it shows. She's definitely the one that couldn't care less about what comes out of this, so she just offers a one-dimensional performance for a pretty lousy villain.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is filled with characters making uncharacteristic decisions (they feel unearned), and exposition scenes that don't really do justice to the compelling backstories. Nevertheless, I always feel the need to come back to the ending. I rather have a slow start, but a strong finish than the other way around. Dark Phoenix delivers a fast-paced, entertaining, and captivating first act, but slowly starts to degrade until it culminates with one of the saga's worst third acts. Sure, the action is great, and it's quite well-filmed actually, but it all ends so quickly that you don't have enough time even to try to enjoy it. If it wasn't for Hans Zimmer's score, which completely nailed me to the screen, my brain would have shut itself down before the wrap-up.\r\n\r\nIt's a shame that such a beloved franchise like the X-Men has to end like this. Simon Kinberg, knowing that the merger was going to happen, should have changed the last half, and risk a lot more, to be honest. If the movie really didn't matter, then they should have tried to do something that was never done before, and go all-out. If it fails, it fails, but at least it would have been remembered as a courageous and powerful film. This way, not only it's a disappointing culmination to a 20-year saga, but it's forgettable. It's not even horrible enough for people to remember how bad it was, it's just ... Meh. If they didn't care, how can they ask the audience to do it for them?\r\n\r\nAll in all, Dark Phoenix ends up being what everyone feared it would be: a movie that didn't matter, at all. One that didn't even try to pay homage to an extraordinary saga that notably influenced the comic-book genre. The worst of all is that everyone can imagine how great it could have been since the cast is perfect (Sophie Turner shines), Hans Zimmer's score is sumptuous, and the action is riveting. The worst feeling that a fan can have is that disappointment with how the film turned out to be mixed with the frustration due to how well a fan can imagine how amazing it could have been. However, a flawed narrative with a terrible villain and questionable character decisions ruins those dreams. With one of the most abrupt endings of the last years, X-Men reaches its end as an isolated franchise, and it now rests its hopes on Kevin Feige and Marvel co. that the MCU will do the mutants justice.\r\n\r\nPS: as you know, I try to avoid trailers as much as I can. After watching Dark Phoenix's ones, I can only advise you to not watch a single one. Not even the first one. Especially that first one! I can't understand how someone approves trailers so spoilery as these ones. Unbelievable.\r\n\r\nRating: C","id":"5cf92d7692514146dcbe137f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cf92d7692514146dcbe137f","movie_id":320288}
{"author":"Movie Queen41","content":"I don't think this was the disaster that the critics make it out to be, but it is one of the lesser Fox X-Men movies. Both the opening scene where the X-Men rescue astronauts stranded in space and the ending where Magneto and the X-Men fight aliens on a train were well done action scenes. It's the middle that sags a bit. The film lacks energy and emotional impact. Simon Kinberg wrote and directed this second go around of the Phoenix Saga as a way to atone for writing the mediocre The Last Stand. But this film does not really improve on that film at all. I am eager to see Kevin Feige cover the full Phoenix Saga properly in a trilogy. You cannot cram the Phoenix story into one movie. We've barely gotten to know these young versions of these characters from Apocalypse. The worst performance is from Jennifer Lawrence, whose Raven is completely smug and obnoxious towards Prof. X. I was happy when she exited the movie. You can tell she doesn't care about this franchise at all. Beast acts completely out of character and joins Magneto to kill Jean--something he would never do. Quicksilver exits the movie quickly after being injured by Jean and only returns at the very end. His relationship with his father, Magneto, is never addressed. Scott Summers takes orders from Mystique (ugh!) and never shows any leadership abilities. The villains are generic evil aliens who want to use the Phoenix Force to take over the world. They are just bargain basement Skrulls. Then there are the usual continuity errors with other X-Men movies. Apocalypse showed that Phoenix was a part of Jean, just like The Last Stand did. Now we are told that the Phoenix lives outside of Jean and comes from outer space. Also, when you see how things end for Prof. X and Jean in this movie, it's unlikely that either of them would appear at the end of Days of Future Past to greet Logan at the school. Overall, disappointing and the perfect time for Disney to reboot this property.","id":"5cfd157192514167adb97848","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cfd157192514167adb97848","movie_id":320288}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps:\/\/www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI love weird movies. The seemingly awkward moments, the apparently nonsensical ambiguity, or simply the pure WTF sequences... All of these leave me deeply captivated by what the story and its filmmaker are trying to transmit to their viewers. The Lighthouse is the most recent addition to the group of psychological horror films that will make you think, \"what the hell am I watching?\" Nevertheless, this is one of the most accessible \"weird flicks\" since most of the story is easily explainable.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I hope this Robert Eggers' movie gets a successful home release. Usually, the general public heavily dislikes ambiguous films. Nowadays, people want everything at the palm of their hands before they even watch the movie (aka trailers). So, a film about two lighthouse keepers who go crazy, where dozens of scenes apparently make no sense (they do), can fail to catch the viewers' attention. However, it found mine. Filmed in black-and-white and with a 1.19:1 aspect ratio (almost squared), Eggers delivers a gorgeous-looking piece of cinema.\r\n\r\nPeople tend to (wrongly) associate the use of black-and-white with \"old movies,\" but it's really just another color palette. For example, Blade Runner 2049 and Mad Max: Fury Road use the color yellow in such a beautiful, eyegasmic way. Color can affect us emotionally, psychologically, and even physically, often without us becoming aware. The Lighthouse's black-and-white establishes the film's mood from the very beginning. A very somber, sad, dark environment, filled with creepy seagulls, and brutal weather conditions.\r\n\r\nIf I try to imagine the movie with color, it's not going to be very different from what it actually is. There's no sun, only tons of rain, wind, and waves. It's always cloudy, and inside the house, it's still dark and cold. So, even if Eggers decided to film with color, black, grey, and white would be the predominant tones either way. That's why the decision to make this film in black-and-white is so perfect. Every shot is dripping with visual beauty. Amazing wide shots of Robert Pattinson working like a slave, getting hit by the relentless weather, all accompanied by a haunting score which elevates every sequence.\r\n\r\nIn my point of view, it's a story about how solitude can make anyone run away from reality. Lack of human contact never contributes to a good way of living. Imagining a better life or literally run away to a remote place with a non-stop job to make you forget who you are or what you did, are not going to help anyone overcome what is, in fact, a personal issue. It's a narrative given to many interpretations, so no one is right or wrong. Depending on our life experience and on our distinct personalities, each and every one of us can have a different perspective and understanding of what this movie tells through the Eggers brothers' brilliant screenplay.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain: Robert Pattinson and especially Willem Dafoe should be considered for the awards season. However, this film is too weird and ominous to be awarded any nominations, unfortunately. Dafoe is 64-years-old, and he crawls on the muddy ground, he gets hit with rain and literal sh*t in the face, besides delivering a versatile performance. Both he and Pattinson offer a dynamic range of acting, going from absurdly hilarious to intensely dramatic displays. It's probably Pattinson's best performance to date, but Dafoe shines as a crazy old ex-sailor.\r\n\r\nTheir accents are perfect, and Dafoe's ability to \"sing\" complex (linguistically speaking) sea poems for whole uncut takes is worthy of every single Oscar. That's something I wasn't expecting: there's a lot of long takes that become even more impressive due to the actors' undeniable talent. It's been a long time since I had to read subtitles to actually understand what the characters were saying, especially Dafoe. Besides the strong accents, the dialogues are extraordinarily intricate and wordy, which definitely captures my attention since I have to be twice as focused.\r\n\r\nIncredible cinematography, great editing, and a subtle but powerful score. It's a shame if people ignore this movie's existence. It's not getting released in my country, so I'll try my best to make people see it. Unfortunately, it's being ignored by every major award ceremony, which is pretty unfair, having in mind it's one of the best films of 2019. I don't have a single issue with it. Some people might not enjoy its ambiguity or its slow pacing. Still, I genuinely love how everything falls into place, culminating in a shocking, suspenseful, and tense third act that makes the massive build-up worthy of merit.\r\n\r\nAll in all, The Lighthouse is one of my favorite movies of 2019. It's definitely going into my Top10, and way up there. Filmed in beautiful black-and-white with a claustrophobic aspect ratio, Robert Eggers delivers a story about loneliness and isolation that takes the weirdest, craziest route. It's one of those WTF films that will leave everyone thinking about it. I love its ambiguity, even if most of its story is pretty accessible. Packed with suspense and tension, mostly due to the excellent cinematography and the brilliant decision to use black-and-white to set the dark, cold environment. Robert Pattinson delivers his career-best performance, but Willem Dafoe steals the spotlight with an Oscar-worthy crazy display that will be ignored due to the known genre bias. It's tear-inducing hilarious at times, but powerfully dramatic as well. I have not a single complaint, and I love it more the more I think about it. Please, watch this at home if you get a chance. Don't miss it!\r\n\r\nRating: A+","id":"5e1c63820e29a20015f7c024","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e1c63820e29a20015f7c024","movie_id":503919}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Tracking down Bonnie & Clyde***\r\n\r\nBased on the real story, two renowned retired Texas Rangers (Kevin Costner & Woody Harrelson) are commissioned to track down and execute Bonnie & Clyde in 1934 after other authorities have failed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Highwaymen\u201d (1983) is a great counterbalance to the 1967 movie with Beatty & Dunaway, which painted the thugs more sympathetically, as well as the excellent \u201cBonnie & Clyde: The True Story\u201d (1992). \r\n\r\nThe filmmakers shoot for realism rather than the thrills of, say, James Bond or Batman. And by \"realism\" I don't mean exact historical accuracy; movies never are for many reasons. For instance, Frank Hamer never approached Bonnie & Clyde from the front of their vehicle. Hamer & co. just blew them to smithereens as soon as it was determined it was the rogue couple. \r\n\r\nThe picture is a reverent period piece about life in the Great Depression and the pursuit & execution of the infamous duo by a couple of aged, but experienced men. The film has the confidence to take its time, unlike say \"Aquaman,\u201d which anxiously jumped to a wild action scene just when a dramatic part was getting interesting. If \"The Highwaymen\" is sometimes slow & boring it's because the actual pursuit was also slow and often boring. This is not a flick for people with ADHD who demand an explosion every 5-7 minutes.

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"The Aeronauts ascends through the weathering clouds to deliver a beautifully panoramic adventure. The sky is our limit. Our ambitious endeavours, boundless by the mysterious stars that plague the night. Eloquent diamonds dancing on a twinkled canvas. The infallible lust for discovery, eternally motivated to make the world and ourselves more habitable. Safer. Predictable.\r\n\r\nHarper\u2019s loose adaptation of Holmes\u2019 novel, for better or worse, takes the capabilities of artistic licence and alters history for the sake of entertainment. Whilst unnecessary in depicting the scientific discoveries and world-shattering record at the time, Harper\u2019s daring adventurous thrill-ride passes through the stratosphere with vivid colours. Meteorologist Glaisher and balloon pilot Rennes attempt to break the world-record height of 23,000ft, but soon encounter a battle for survival when their minds become deluded from the insufficient oxygen.\r\n\r\nAs I was saying, artistic licence is a powerful element to filmmaking. In the wrong hands, an irresponsible change in history could be produced, tarnishing the events that actually occurred. Conversely, it could be used to elevate a vital moral that, whilst enhances entertainment, retains the delicacy of history without diminishing its achievements. Harper and Thorne teeter on the two halves, precariously floating through thunderous clouds of inaccuracy. The removal of Glaisher\u2019s scientific partner Coxwell, replaced by the fictional Rennes, was haphazard. With no acknowledgement of his existence, The Aeronauts clearly rains down upon the realms of light entertainment, and that\u2019s absolutely fine. But to utilise Glaisher\u2019s real persona instead of fictionalising his character whilst retaining his discoveries, felt deflating for Coxwell.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, the addition of Rennes and surprisingly making her story at the forefront of the narrative, inspired a bountiful amount of female empowerment during the repressed Victorian era. Her lack of knowledge in Glaisher\u2019s area of expertise resulted in an accessible screenplay that allowed audiences to instantly connect with her. As the human component to the aeronautical adventure, Rennes seamlessly moves forward in being the main protagonist. A refreshing change that juxtaposes Redmayne and Jones\u2019 previous partnership in \u2018The Theory of Everything\u2019. It allowed Jones, who absolutely captivated with her buoyant performance, to showcase a physically demanding and emotionally vulnerable journey.\r\n\r\nThe tragic personal loss that plagues Rennes\u2019 stability, testing her ornate instinct in survivability. Riding in thunderous clouds, battling oxygen deficiency and climbing a freezing balloon whilst combating frostbite at 36,000ft. Just a shame that Redmayne rarely changes up his usual bumbling performance that we\u2019ve seen time and time again. Harper\u2019s intent focus on teamwork and partnership, allows the film\u2019s moral to come shining through. Some reach for the stars, others push others towards them.\r\n\r\nThe flashback structure prevents a completely linear experience for occurring, and adds appropriate drips of backstory without diminishing the excitement of their gradual ascent. The abrupt cuts do produce an irregular pace, especially when the two barely survive a raincloud only for the editing to splice a societal debate back in London, but the outstanding visuals and Price\u2019s intense score (as to be expected...) instantly regulate the taste for adventure again. Simply the best panoramic visuals of the year. The endless blanket of cumulus clouds envelope you in an overwhelming horizon, conveying the solidarity of these two daredevils. Then, when they reach the summit of their ascent, well, I was on the edge of my seat. Superbly thrilling!\r\n\r\nThe Aeronauts, despite the historical inaccuracy and fictionalised strands for the sake of entertainment, floats through the atmosphere in a gloriously thrilling adventure that remains both grounded in narration and afloat in excitement. No hot air balloon rides for me...","id":"5e206f85b3316b0013034df3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e206f85b3316b0013034df3","movie_id":514921}
{"author":"Shani Harris","content":"\u2018The Cave\u2019 Film Review : Syrian War Documentary from Oscar Nominated Director of \u2018The Last Men in Aleppo\u2019 by Shani Harris\r\n\r\nFeras Fayyad made history as the first Syrian filmmaker to earn an Academy Award nomination for his documentary \u201cThe Last Men In Aleppo.\u201d Director Feras Fayyad immediately submerges the audience in the midst of the Syrian conflict with the opening shots of \u2018\u201dThe Cave.\u201d The imagery of war feels even more jarring, when a viewer watches the bombastic imagery of bombs pummeling the landscape. The sonic tapestry makes us hear the rumble of crumbling buildings. We immediately realize that innocent civilians are dying down below. Aerial drones show the devastating crisis that has arisen from the rule of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. \u201cThe Cave\u201d was shot from 2016 to 2018 and was awarded the People\u2019s Choice Documentary prize at the 2019 Toronto Film Festival.The film also won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance when Fayyad examined the renegade civilians in Aleppo who were affectionately called the \u201cWhite Helmets.\u201d  \r\n\r\n\u201cLast Men in Aleppo\u201d is a verite film showing how volunteers Khaled, Mahomoud and Subhi risked their lives daily while walking over ground. We watch in awe as the men listen for Russian war planes over head and search through the wreckage of buildings to rescue helpless victims. There is a very touching scene in \u201cLast Men of Aleppo\u201d, when one of the reluctant heroes, decides to visit the home of a young boy that he saved. The boy is enamored with his rescuer and looks at the genial \u201cWhite Helmet\u201d like he is his own personal superhero who possesses magical powers. The boy constantly hugs his Superman and asks him how did he save him. The \u201cWhite Helmet\u201d wants to stay humble and merely reassures the child that he was saved because God wants him to grow up to be a man someday. Once he leaves the boy\u2019s home he tells his colleague that he felt bad about the visit, because he did not want to appear boastful. He felt that he seemed too arrogant and was deliberately seeking praise. \r\n\r\nFayyad is a gifted storyteller with the ability to balance the dramatic tragedy, with tender moments that show the humanity of his subjects. \u201cThe Cave\u201d takes us underground in Al Ghouta during a different point in the war when a young pediatrician named Dr. Amani Ballor is trying desperately to save lives in a makeshift hospital located in a cave. Dr. Ballor is a valiant leader of the medical team, which includes both men and other women working together in the operating room. This is a feminist statement in itself for women to be working in the elite medical profession in a devout Muslim country. Dr. Ballor dotes on her young subjects making sure to leave girls with the mantra that they should strive to do work that helps people. Dr. Amani Ballor wants her patients to use their head and their heart to make the world a better place for others.  She is also very active in offering women opportunities to work with her so they can help their families. She is often met with opposition by many who say they can\u2019t work because according to tradition the men in their lives do not approve of women working. Dr. Ballor can\u2019t hold back her frustrations to vent amongst her female colleagues  Dr. Alaa and nurse Samaher, whenever she is met with resistance by strict Muslim women that she encounters in the field. There is one moment when she talks about how religion is used to oppress women, while riding in a car driven by women. This is another act of independence and defiance when some regions of the world don\u2019t allow women to drive a vehicle. It was captivating to see a strong female protagonist on the screen who shed tears, when her patients were injured or died. Her compassion and strength showed that anything was possible. \r\n\r\nThere are other tender and nuanced moments that Fayyad captures in the film. One touching scene shows Dr. Salim Namour, who is the most senior doctor in the hospital. Namour tries his best to ease the pain of his patients by playing classical music to distract them from noisy missiles. Another scene stands out when a grateful chef balances a hot meal, through the minefield of destruction outside to deliver food to Dr. Ballor. She later breaks down in a poignant scene and confesses that she feels so guilty that she is well fed, while her patients are starving from malnutrition. We are horrified by seeing shocking scenes of death when Dr. Ballor and her team try to grapple with a mysterious nerve gas attack. The devastating loss is even more unbearable to see after we are shown innocent children having fun playing in an underground amusement park in a rare moment of peace. Feras Fayyad explained during a Q&A for the film that it took a while for his subjects to feel comfortable with filming. The movie was shot handheld on DSLRS by a team of three cinematographers. At one point the director had to communicate with his DP\u2019s remotely, because the area was too dangerous for him to navigate. The sound designer Peter Albrechtsen who has worked on Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oscar winning film \u201cDunkirk\u201d helped transform the Skywalker Dolby Atmos sound mix into another three dimensional element of the movie. The supervising sound editor brings viewers closer to experiencing the war zone induced PTSD that the characters are feeling. Your heart will skip a beat, while tuning in to the Russian warplanes and dreading where they will strike next. \u201c Some people come to me and say we understand the Syrian war now,\u201d Fayaad told attendees at a Q&A. \u201cYou feel this is the mission of the cinema. To make people understand the emotions, the mind and to make people understand a different way.\u201d \u201cThe Cave\u201d is a must see because it leaves you with a connection to a war that is still making headlines and devastating so many people around the world.   \r\n\r\n\u2018The Cave\u2019 is a National Geographic documentary films release and is currently playing in theaters. \u2018The Last Men In Aleppo\u2019 is  available on Kanopy VOD and other streaming services.","id":"5dfd28f5d236e600108ad5e3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dfd28f5d236e600108ad5e3","movie_id":621729}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @ https:\/\/www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI've always been a fan of Guy Ritchie's style. While I do admit that he tends to overuse his own techniques (like he does in this movie), he always manages to bring something unique to his projects. He delivered a pretty good live-action remake of Aladdin while offering his own take (Jasmine has more compelling motivations). I surprisingly enjoyed King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword, but the ending is disappointing. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and the Sherlock Holmes films are entertaining and fun, to say the least. So, yes, I was sort of excited to watch The Gentlemen.\r\n\r\nWith such a stellar cast, how can someone not be interested in an old-fashioned crime-thriller? First of all, I want to get this out right away: it's a movie that anyone can enjoy, sure, but for people who know how films usually work, Ritchie applies a storytelling method that's going to make every \"filmmaking nerd\" lose their minds. Hugh Grant (Fletcher) is mostly the narrator of the entire story, and he's basically interpreting a \"version\" of Guy Ritchie telling the story of his own \"flick\".\r\n\r\nThis means Fletcher goes on and on about film specs like aspect ratios and film gauges but also helping the audience understand what's happening, by announcing if the story is near its climax or if \"the plot thickens\". It's a captivating and funny way of using exposition without it being lazy or forced. Grant also makes sure to ask the questions the audience should be asking. This way, even people who don't like to think when they go to the cinema (yes, they exist) will be able to follow the mystery unraveling.\r\n\r\nObviously, the unbelievable cast makes this movie so much fun. Matthew McConaughey is a masterful actor when it comes to carrying long dialogues. Everything he says is always engaging, either by the way he says it, his expressions, or the physical intensity he puts into his own words. Charlie Hunnam (Ray) probably delivers his most amusing performance to date. Ray is definitely going to be a fan-favorite character, and his interactions with Fletcher (with who he spends most of the runtime) are hilarious.\r\n\r\nHenry Golding (Dry Eye), Michelle Dockery (Rosalind Pearson), and Jeremy Strong (Matthew) all give excellent performances, but Colin Farrell is the best of this group of characters as Coach. His scenes are some of the funniest sequences of the entire year so far. From his accent to the action he eventually gets into, he's one of those characters who will leave everyone wanting more. As for the story, it's undoubtedly one of the most complex screenplays I've seen in a while. Comparing with Knives Out, the narrative structure ends up being a bit similar.\r\n\r\nBoth possess tons of twists and turns that will make everyone scratch their heads for quite some time. Both show different events of the story, featuring a specific character at a particular time in a distinct manner (flashback, flashforward, simple exposition). However, The Gentlemen abuses from its own trick a bit too much, especially during the first half. Something entertaining can quickly turn into something pretty annoying if the storytelling isn't well-balanced. Can't have too much of anything, right?\r\n\r\nThis is my overall issue with the film. Guy Ritchie brings something cool and fresh to escape heavy exposition, but it's still a lot of information to transmit, and it doesn't always work smoothly. Some subplots didn't need to go so deep, which takes time away from more emotionally investing storylines. Nevertheless, in the end, Ritchie stitches every story together seamlessly to create a very well-written flick. With so many intricate layers, it's extremely difficult to bring it all together to make a cohesive finale, but Ritchie does it superbly.\r\n\r\nAll in all, The Gentlemen is another hit for Guy Ritchie, and it might even be his best movie yet. With one of the most complex screenplays in a while, the phenomenal cast elevates this crime-thriller into one of the best films of 2020, so far. Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, and Colin Farrell stand out, but every actor delivers excellent performances. Extremely funny and captivating storytelling through Grant's narration, which ironic or not, it's both the best and worst component of the movie. When used in excess, it can be a bit bothersome and lengthy, but for most of the runtime, this alternative to substantial exposition works brilliantly. Interesting characters, intriguing mystery, and hilarious bits of comedy make this feature very entertaining. Technically, great editing keeps a well-paced flow, but it's Ritchie's layered narrative that steals the show.\r\n\r\nRating: B+","id":"5e57e78235811d001960e7bd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e57e78235811d001960e7bd","movie_id":522627}

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"The Silence mutes any and all brain activity, sending viewers into a quiet sleep. \u201cShhhh! Be vewy vewy quiet! I\u2019m hunting carnivewous ancient bats!\u201d. For even the most minuscule of noises will send a swarm of \u2018Pitch Black\u2019 \u2018Doctor Who\u2019-esque bat demons that will scratch, bite and gnaw at your flesh. Based on a novel apparently, however any and all originality was tossed out of the family car window when both the superior \u2018A Quiet Place\u2019 and hugely popular \u2018Bird Box\u2019 were capitalising on the whole \u201csense prevention\u201d horror schtick. Basically, it\u2019s both those films put together. Ancient bat creatures are released from an uncharted cave system and are terrorising the continent of North America, where we follow a family trying to survive and reach a refuge.\r\n\r\nProblem is, this family is so chilled and relaxed during this heightened state of emergency, that any and all threat is relinquished from the nonchalant acting and careless attitudes. Urgh, honestly! Leonetti is doing his absolute best in unimaginatively mimicking other similar films, where veteran and all-round talent Tucci is waltzing around the countryside showing a face of \u201cI can\u2019t be bothered, release me from this torturous nightmare\u201d.\r\n\r\nPlagued by infuriatingly stupid plot conveniences and character choices, the severe lack of tension halts the momentum entirely. Heck, it\u2019s not even in neutral anymore. It\u2019s reversing! Examples include (brace yourself...): handing a handgun to the uncle who is then left to die, ginger son conveniently switching cars before one of them veers over a verge, iPhones instantly muting themselves when submerged in water for a total of three seconds and bringing an obviously loud dog with you. That last example, accompanied with an unnecessary scene involving members of the public banishing a mother and her baby due to generating far too much noise, are simply utilised to showcase the destructive nature of humanity. Yup. Humans suck, and this film wants you to know that. You shan\u2019t be scared by the horrifically visualised bat demons that look smoother than Tucci\u2019s bald head. It\u2019s the characters that\u2019ll get under your skin and infuriate you.\r\n\r\nNeed more proof? The entire third act. Father and daughter wander off to the nearest pharmacy, surprisingly making zero noise whatsoever on the way there, and encounter a mentally unstable reverend who yearns to fertilise young girls to maintain the population and chop their tongues off (after the foreplay, obviously...). What. The. Hell? That was so left field that even the flying angels didn\u2019t see that coming. The narrative focus shifts constantly, making an already boring premise even more tediously mundane.\r\n\r\nAside from one sacrifice towards the conclusion that had some emotional gravitas, The Silence offers nothing more than another forced extraction of this now dull horror concept. Actors weren\u2019t trying, direction was unstable and the insufficient amount of scares were, well, insufficient. Oh wait, I forgot! It literally ends on the daughter becoming survivalist-styled Lara Croft and hunting these winged menaces down. Oh no no! I\u2019m done! Just watch \u2018A Quiet Place\u2019 instead...","id":"5e2066f9b3316b0013032932","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2066f9b3316b0013032932","movie_id":527261}

When asked about the value of detainee information and whether he missed the intelligence from it, one senior CIA operator told members, \"I miss it every day.\" We understand why._\r\n\r\n- _Report of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: Committee Study of the Central Intelligence Agency's Detention and Interrogation Program \u2013 Minority Views of Vice Chairman Chambliss, joined by Senators Burr, Risch, Coats, Rubio, and Coburn_ (December 9, 2014)\r\n\r\nAnyone who has read even a little history knows that as a method of extracting useful intel, torture doesn't work. It didn't work for the Spanish Inquisition, it didn't work in Salem, it didn't work in Vietnam, it didn't work during the 800 years of English occupation or the War of Independence here in Ireland. It has never worked and it never will, a fact known since at least the 17th century (although the Ancient Romans also had their suspicions).\r\n\r\nWritten and directed by Scott Z. Burns, _The Report_ tells the story of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's $40m, five-year investigation into the CIA's illegal use of torture in the years after 9\/11, and the subsequent attempts to cover it up. From 2002-2008, the Detention and Interrogation Program (to give it its official title), saw the CIA employing \"Enhanced Interrogation Techniques\" (EIT), at a cost of $80m to the American taxpayer, with detainees held in secret locations around the world (known as \"black sites\"). Completed in 2012, the Committee's findings were detailed in the 6,700-page _Report of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: Committee Study of the Central Intelligence Agency's Detention and Interrogation Program_, which remains classified, although a heavily redacted 525-page Executive Summary was published in 2014. What the film does exceptionally well is to condense this vast quantity of information down into a relatively easy-to-digest narrative (to give you an idea of the scale we're talking about here, the complete _Report_ has over 35,000 footnotes, and is based on over 6.5 million pages of classified material). More of a procedural drama than a political thriller, _The Report_ could do with a little emotion, and there's no denying that it's very, very talky, perhaps to the extent of being more suited to the stage than the screen. However, irrespective of this, it's a brilliantly acted, unflinching, and insightful look at one of the most shameful moments in US history.\r\n\r\nThe film opens in 2012 as Daniel J. Jones (Adam Driver), a Senate investigator and the primary author of the recently completed _Report_, is meeting with his (fictional) lawyer Cyrus Clifford (Corey Stoll). When Clifford asks him, \"_so, you did steal the document?_\", Jones is quick to reply, \"_I did not steal it. I relocated it._\" The film then cuts to 2007, when Senator Dianne Feinstein (Annette Benning), Chair of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, appoints Jones to the investigation into the CIA's 2005 destruction of videotapes showing the interrogation of al-Qaeda suspects Abu Zubaydah (Zuhdi Boueri) and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri at a CIA black site in Thailand (known as \"Detention Site Green\") in 2002. After the investigation concludes in 2008, finding that the CIA had destroyed 92 videotapes, Feinstein launches a larger investigation into the Agency's general conduct when interrogating suspected terrorists. Jones is appointed head of a bipartisan six-person team (three Democrats, three Republicans), operating out of a tiny windowless office in an offsite CIA building, to which even the Director of the Agency has no access. The rest of the film takes us (often achronologically) from the commencement of the investigation in early 2009 to Jones's meeting with Clifford in 2012, and on up to the fight to have the _Report_ made public in 2013\/2014, with both the CIA and the Obama Administration throwing up multiple obstacles.\r\n\r\nAlong the way we're introduced to a plethora of characters, embodied by an exceptional cast with not a weak link amongst them \u2013 there's John Brennan (the always superb Ted Levine), Acting Director of the National Counterterrorism Center (2004-2005), Deputy Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism (2005-2013), Director of the CIA (2013-2017); Bernadette (an excellent Maura Tierney playing against type) a thinly-veiled fictionalisation of Gina Haspel, Base Chief at Detention Site Green (2002-2004), Deputy Director of the CIA (2017-2018), Director of the CIA (2018-); Denis McDonough (Jon Hamm), Senior Foreign Policy Adviser to Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD) (1999-2004), Legislative Director for Senator Ken Salazar (D-CO) (2004-2007), Acting Senior Foreign Policy Advisor to Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) (2007-2008), Deputy National Security Advisor (2010-2013), White House Chief of Staff (2013-2017); Marcy Morris (Linda Powell), Feinstein's PA; Caroline D. Krauss (Jennifer Morrison), General Counsel of the CIA (2013-2017); Thomas Eastman (Michael C. Hall), CIA counsel (2013-2017); Alice (Sarah Goldberg), one of Jones's investigative team; Raymond Nathan (Tim Blake Nelson), a fictional composite representing the members of the CIA's Office of Medical Services stationed at Detention Site Green, who raised early concerns about EIT; James Mitchell (Douglas Hodge) and Bruce Jessen (T. Ryder Smith), the psychologists who developed and implemented the program; Senator Mark Udall (D-CO) (Scott Shepherd), a member of the Intelligence Committee; Ali Soufan (Fajer Al-Kaisi), an FBI agent assigned to the Bureau's Osama bin Laden unit, \"I-49\", and who was initially interrogating Zubaydah, until the CIA took over; an unnamed _New York Times_ reporter (Matthew Rhys), to whom Jones considers leaking classified material; George Tenet (Dominic Fumusa), Director of the CIA (1996-2004); Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) (Guy Boyd), the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee; Cofer Black (Ian Blackman), Director of the Counterterrorism Center (1999-2002), Coordinator for Counterterrorism (2002-2004); Jose Rodriguez (Carlos G\u00f3mez), Director of the Counterterrorism Center (2002-2004), Director of the National Clandestine Service (2004-2007); John A. Rizzo (Joseph Siravo), Deputy Counsel for the CIA (2001-2010); and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (Ratnesh Dubey), a high-ranking member of al-Qaeda and the main architect of 9\/11.\r\n\r\nYou may notice that there are several crossover characters with _The Looming Tower_ and _Vice_ (both 2018). Although _The Report_ doesn't repeat anything specifically depicted elsewhere, it does cover some of the same general narrative ground \u2013 so, for example, Dick Cheney and George W. Bush are central characters in _Vice_, and although neither make an appearance in _The Report_, they hover constantly on the margins, like puppet masters hidden from sight but everywhere apparent. Similarly, Ali Soufan, who appears in two scenes here, is a central character in _The Looming Tower_, which focuses on the pre-9\/11 conflict between the CIA and the FBI. It's also worth mentioning that, as with both _The Looming Tower_ and _Vice_, _The Report_ is very much a left-centric narrative, especially in terms of its depiction of EIT and how the CIA lied and falsified data, misrepresenting the effectiveness of the program. \r\n\r\nTaking this into consideration, the film is unquestionably angry. We're all familiar, of course, with Dilawar, the innocent Afghan taxi-driver who was tortured to death by the US Army at Bagram Collection Point in 2002. But whereas that incident resulted in criminal trials (albeit without much in the way of convictions), the torture meted out by the CIA had no such consequences. Indeed, many of the most significant players received promotions (one even became the Agency's director), something about which the film displays significant indignation. It's also made very clear that had Soufan been allowed to continue building a rapport with Zubaydah (the first detainee subjected to EIT), it would have resulted in far more useful intelligence than the CIA was able to get from him (which was precisely nothing). However, that kind of interrogation takes time and requires patience, and the CIA is shown as having neither.\r\n\r\nThe depiction of Mitchell and Jessen is particularly condemning (we know from the get-go that Mitchell is a dick because he refers to himself in the third-person). If the film has any villains, it's these two; snake-oil salesmen with psychology degrees but no experience of actual interrogations and no data whatsoever to back up their claims that torture works (because no such data exists). Indeed, this element of the film was deeply personal to Burns, both of whose parents are psychologists. As he explains to PBS, he found it abhorrent that \"_people had figured out a way to weaponise psychology_\", which he believes is a tool that \"_exists to help people_\". Employing techniques such as the abdominal slap, the attention grasp, cramped confinement, dietary manipulation, the facial hold, the facial slap\/insult slap, forced nudity, forced shaving, rectal hydration, sleep deprivation, stress positions, wall standing, walling, waterboarding, and water dousing, Mitchell and Jessen are shown as enjoying the experience of hurting these people \u2013 their justification for doing so (that such interrogation will save lives) exposed as utterly fabricated. At one point, Jones reports to Feinstein that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had been waterboarded 183 times without any results, prompting her to ask, \"_if it works, why did they need to do it 183 times?_\" Why indeed.\r\n\r\nThe film makes no bones about just how ineffective EIT actually was, and how full of crap Mitchell and Jessen were, despite Republicans such as Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), Richard Burn (R-NC), Jim Risch (R-ID), Dan Coats (R-IN), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Tom Coburn (R-OK) maintaining that it saved lives and rejecting the findings in the Report. In this sense, the audience is made privy to all the useful and accurate information gleaned from EIT \u2013 nothing, zero, nada, no thing, not even one thing. As per the _Panetta Review_ (2009), the CIA's _own_ classified internal inquiry, the findings of which were controversially made public by Udall during an Intelligence Committee hearing in 2013 (a terrific scene in the film), not a single piece of solid intel was ever extracted from any detainee in the program. Indeed, the contrary was true \u2013 EIT led to detainees shutting down or providing false information, or information they knew the CIA already possessed. As Jones states, \"_all they did was make it impossible to prosecute mass murderers._\"\r\n\r\nAlso emphasised is the CIA's attempts to make EIT legal, with the so-called Torture Memos cropping up a few times. A set of legal documents drawn up by Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo and signed off by Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee in 2002, the Memos essentially tried to provide legal justification for EIT, but were so flawed that the head of the Office of Legal Counsel, Jack Goldsmith, had withdrawn them by 2004. Perhaps the most significant rationale in the Memos is that the program can only be legal if it resulted in \"_unique, otherwise unavailable_\" intelligence. Or, as Bernadette says in the film, \"_it's only legal if it works_\", thus creating an illogical self-sustaining circular justification that has no basis in law. With this in mind, the film depicts the CIA as hedging their bets \u2013 people won't care how the information was obtained if such information leads to the capture or death of bin Laden (which it didn't \u2013 the CIA was first made aware of bin Laden's courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, by a detainee interrogated by another government via standard techniques).\r\n\r\nThematically, although the film examines multiple politically charged themes, for the most part, its thematic concerns are understated. For example, the Republicans who oppose the Report are shown as adopting a stance of \"_admit nothing, deny everything, make counter accusations_\" (a phrase coined by bastion of morality and honour, Roger Stone). The filmmakers, of course, had no idea that their movie would be in cinemas concurrently with a House Intelligence Committee impeachment inquiry into the actions of the current president, Donald Trump. However, it's impossible to ignore the similarities between the Republican position in 2012 and the tactics used today by Trump and his enablers\/apologists \u2013 Republicans refused to admit anything regarding torture\/Trump seems pathologically incapable of admitting wrongdoing; Republicans swore up and down that the CIA's activities were justifiable\/Trump urges us all to \"_read the transcript_\"; of his \"_perfect call_\"; Republicans accused Democrats of undermining national security\/Trump has accused pretty much every Democrat in the country of something or other. This parallel is never explicitly addressed, but it's right there for those willing to see it. It's also important insofar as one of the film's most salient themes is that the CIA's flagrant disregard for the rule of law, the Constitution, and basic human rights must never be allowed to happen again. This is not to suggest that Trump has sanctioned torture (although at this point, would it surprise anyone if he had), rather to illustrate how quickly we forget the lessons of yesterday.\r\n\r\nAlthough it's mentioned on several occasions that Jones's team and the _Report_ itself must avoid partisan politics, like so many aspects of life in the US, the investigation and debate regarding publication split along partisan lines; Democrats accepted the findings in the _Report_ and wanted it made public, Republicans dismissed the _Report_ and argued against publication (although one has to wonder that if everything in the Report was untrue, why would they be against publication). Of course, this isn't true across the board \u2013 the Intelligence Committee voted to publish the Executive Summary by a vote of 9-6; the eight Democrats and Olympia Snowe (R-ME) against the six Republicans. John McCain (R-AZ) was a member of the Committee _ex officio_, and so didn't have a vote, but he made it known he agreed with the Democrats and Snowe. On the other hand, neither Obama nor Secretary of State John Kerry were overjoyed about releasing even a redacted version, and McDonagh wanted far more redactions than were ultimately used. Also in service of a balanced depiction, the film makes sure to reference Feinstein's disdain for Edward Snowden and whistle-blowers in general \u2013 as righteous as her involvement with the _Report_ may be, she remains a part of the establishment that necessitated the _Report_ in the first place. It's to the film's credit that it doesn't shy away from such opinions, thus avoiding a glib and overly neat dichotomy of Democrats=good\/Republicans=bad.\r\n\r\nDespite its importance, however, I can't see _The Report_ packing them in at the multiplex. For one, it's exceptionally talky. In fact, it's pretty much wall-to-wall talking, except for the scenes depicting EIT itself. I would argue that this simply positions the film in the theatrical tradition, but I can certainly understand people regarding it as one step removed from an audio recording of the actual _Report_. There's also a distinct lack of emotion \u2013 every time Jones begins to emote, somebody shuts him down, reminding him that he must be objective. Along the same lines, there's no character development \u2013 we learn nothing about who Jones is when he's not working on the _Report_. Similarly, everyone else is depicted only in terms of their involvement or connection with EIT and the _Report_; we never see where they live, we never see family members, we're not made privy to who they are as people. This is by design of course, with Burns wanting to focus on the facts and nothing more, but again, I can understand people finding it unsatisfactory. All of this results in an exceptionally dry and sterile film that leans entirely on its procedural elements, with Burns gambling that this structuring will stimulate the requisite indignation, thus his shunning of pathos and relatability.\r\n\r\n_The Report_ is a straightforward and restrained film, with not a hint of any aesthetic gymnastics. Burns matches the form to the content, and his focus on the facts is razor-sharp and unwavering. Depicting how EIT shamed the nation, turned each individual who was tortured into a powerful jihadist recruitment tool, and betrayed the very values that were supposedly being fought for in the first place, the film excoriates both the Bush administration for letting it happen and the Obama administration for its reluctance to make the _Report_ public. It's not exactly exciting in a traditional sense, but it sure is compelling; a story that's infuriating insofar as it actually happened, horrifying insofar as, given the clown currently in the Oval Office, it could easily happen again.","id":"5de9d5383faba00015183b17","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5de9d5383faba00015183b17","movie_id":524348}
{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Nothing too unexpected here, but it's funny and hugely entertaining_**\r\n\r\n>_You don't crucify people! Not on Good Friday!_\r\n\r\n- Harold Shand; _The Long Good Friday_ (1980)\r\n\r\nThe Gentlemen is a return to the London gangster milieu where writer\/director Guy Ritchie first made his name with films such as _Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels_ (1998) and _snatch._ (2000). His first foray into this territory since the disappointing _RocknRolla_ (2008), _The Gentlemen_ comes at the end of over a decade making big-budget studio-backed crimes against cinema such as _Sherlock Holmes_ (2009), _Sherlo__ck Holmes: A Game of Shadows_ (2011), _The Man from U.N.C.L.E_. (2015), _King Arthur: Legend of the Sword_ (2017), and _Aladdin_ (2019). Granted, the film seems stuck in the last decade in more ways than one, it's highly questionable that the only gay character is a slimy man-whore into S&M, its token female character barely even manages to rise to the level of tokenism, and Ritchie does absolutely nothing new here \u2013 if you've seen _Lock, Stock_ or _snatch._, you'll know pretty much exactly what to expect \u2013 but _The Gentlemen_ is still hugely entertaining. Most of the jokes land, the dialogue is as sharp and expletive-laden as ever, the cast are having a ball, and the self-reflexivity, although a little forced in places, works well for the most part. And yes, the plot is as derivative as it gets, but there's no denying Ritchie has injected real verve into what looks on paper like an inconsequential C-movie. _The Gentlemen_ definitely won't change your life, but it will make you laugh.\r\n\r\nThe film begins as sleazy private eye Fletcher (Hugh Grant) arrives unannounced at the home of Ray (Charlie Hunnam), right-hand man to Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a suave Oxford-educated American ex-pat who controls a huge marijuana empire in London, valued at around \u00a3400 million. Several months prior, Fletcher was hired by tabloid editor Big Dave (the great Eddie Marsen) to dig up dirt on Pearson with the aim to ruin him \u2013 Dave's revenge for Pearson blanking him at a gala. Fletcher has written a screenplay based on his investigation (titled _Bush_) and tells Ray that unless Pearson pays him \u00a320 million, he will hand over everything he has to Dave. Meanwhile, Pearson has decided to sell his whole operation, but when word gets out, all hell breaks loose, as the various interested parties vie for advantage. Most of the subsequent film takes the form of Fletcher narrating his exploits to Ray, explaining how he learned so much about Pearson and what he does. Along the way, we meet characters such as Rosalind (Michelle Dockery), Pearson's ruthless and unflappable \"_cockney Cleopatra_\" wife, who runs a garage with an all-female staff; Berger (Jeremy Strong), Pearson's preferred buyer; Dry Eye (Henry Golding), the ambitious but brutal scion of a Chinese syndicate, who hopes to undermine Berger; Coach (a scene-stealing Colin Farrell), who runs a boxing gym for troubled youths and who inadvertently finds himself in the middle of everything; a plethora of property-rich-but-cash-poor landed gentry who are essential to Pearson's empire; a Russian oligarch; and a street gang called The Toddlers.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, _The Gentlemen_ is very much in the mould of Ritchie's previous gangster movies. Because Fletcher frames his narration as a screenplay, it allows Ritchie to employ a multitude of self-reflexive devices \u2013 a smash cut coinciding with Fletcher asking Ray to visualise a smash cut; voiceover transitioning into spoken dialogue; on-screen captions telling us who's who; animated maps; YouTube fight porn (don't ask); freeze-frames; rewinds; a shot of film running through a projector etc. At one point, Fletcher is discussing the merits of anamorphic (2.39:1) over 1.78:1, and the film's aspect ratio changes accordingly. At another, he's arguing for the merits of 35mm celluloid over digital, saying he likes the grain of celluloid photography, and the film duly switches formats. Such playfulness means that it never for a second takes itself too seriously, with probably the most self-reflexive moment coming towards the end, when we visit Miramax's offices in London (Miramax produced the movie), and we see a poster for Ritchie's _The Man From U.N.C.L.E._. All of this is immensely fun, with the more you know about the mechanics of assembling a film, the more humorously\r\nself-reflexive the film becomes \u2013 Fletcher even acknowledges his own role as an unreliable narrator, and a discussion of the importance of sound leads to his dismissal of Francis Ford Coppola's _The Conversation_ (1974) as \"_a bit boring._\"\r\n\r\nIn terms of themes, the most obvious is something Ritchie has examined before \u2013 the idea that the economic divide between gangsters and aristocrats masks their practical similarities. Pearson straddles this divide; he's a gangster, but so too is he an aristocrat (in all but name), and the smooth running of his business depends on both classes \u2013 the aristocrats who he needs to grow his product (for reasons that constitute a bit of a spoiler, so I'm not going to get into it) and the gangsters who distribute that product. The clash between the pompous insularity of the English upper class and the perceived uncouthness of the lower class has been done to death in both literature (Emily Bront\u00eb's _Wuthering Heights_ (1847) springs to mind) and film (Nicolas Roeg and Donald Cammell's _Performance_ (1970), for example), and although Ritchie doesn't say anything even remotely new about it, it still forms an interesting textural background \u2013 gentrification is ever present; there are ironic references to the posh areas of Croydon; Ray, a working-class Newcastle native, is a cleanliness freak who eats wagyu steak and lives in a mansion, and when he's dispatched on a mission to an uncivilised working-class area, he explains he \"_just hates them junkies_,\" seeing them as very much his social inferiors.\r\n\r\nOne of the most central scenes sees a group of obnoxious privileged teens holed up in a council flat, whilst on the street below, a gang of machete-wielding delinquents terrorise the neighbourhood. As Ray and his men clash with the gang, there's a real sense of old vs. new \u2013 traditional gangsters fighting it out with internet-savvy hoodlums who don't give a damn about tradition or respect. There are a lot of laughs to be had with these issues, such as Ray and Coach having problems pronouncing the name Phuc, or Coach debating with one of his boxers whether it's racist to call someone \"_a black c**t_\", even though they are black and they are a c**t. And again, none of this is presented as even remotely serious.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problems with the film are probably its lack of depth, and the familiarity of the presentation, characters, and _milieu_ \u2013 there's nothing here you haven't seen in previous Ritchie films. And as you would expect, there isn't much in the way of emotional maturity or narrative complexity. It's all very surface-level, and it makes no apologies for such.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed _The Gentlemen_. It's a funny as hell caper and the actors are clearly having terrific fun. It might be formulaic and overly familiar, but it's also immensely enjoyable.","id":"5e1d348b95c0af00131150b6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e1d348b95c0af00131150b6","movie_id":522627}

{"author":"Sheldon Nylander","content":"Remember the Panama Papers? Those leaked documents that detailed how various people and companies created off-shore shell companies in order to avoid paying billions if not trillions in taxes around the world? No?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not surprised. It was a huge story that seemed to become a flash in the pan and many people forgot about it after the coverage dried up because, very likely, the corporations that run the news media tried to bury it. But these folks didn\u2019t forget.\r\n\r\nThe film\u2019s title refers to the whole operation as generally being a money laundering scheme. Featuring an ensemble cast of Hollywood who\u2019s who as well as who\u2019s that, this Steven Soderbergh film invariably draws comparisons to Adam McKay\u2019s \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d both in subject matter and style. The narrators, played by Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas, frequently address the camera directly. Usually, this has the effect of making the audience feel like they\u2019re in on the scheme, but it\u2019s not as effective as when it was used in, say, \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d Why? I can\u2019t quite put my finger on it, but it likely has to do with the complexity of the scheme. Their characters are more than just narrators, but are actual players in the overall story, lawyers who created the paperwork and did the legwork to get these schemes off the ground. As such, they actually try to explain it, both simplified and with a certain complexity that leaves one a little unsure of the truth. Maybe that was the idea, but from a storytelling perspective, it didn\u2019t quite work.\r\n\r\nAnd effect is part of the problem with this film. Aside from being done as a comedy for what is in fact a very serious subject (the reporter who exposed this story was later killed by a car bomb), this film doesn\u2019t feel very effective in conveying outrage. In fact, it feels less like outrage and more like being impotently miffed. The film doesn\u2019t feel like it conveys the gravity of the situation. Which is very disappointing given the talent involved and the chance to really bring this subject back into the public eye. While I have to give the filmmakers credit with trying to make the complex money laundering scheme in the Panama Papers digestible to a general audience and keeping this visible, ultimately it feels like it\u2019s too little too late.","id":"5db179c45be00e00159610d7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5db179c45be00e00159610d7","movie_id":517909}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Me and my kids where shopping for other stuff at FNAC in Geneva, our go to store for not too advanced stuff in audio, video and computer gadgets, when we found this movie.\r\n\r\nI made a quick search on IMDb and it looked like it might, finally, be a good French made movie. Apart from Louis de Fun\u00e8s comedies that is, I really love most of those.\r\n\r\nWell, it turned out to be a huge disappointment. I guess I should have checked a bit more. For instance the fact that the oxygen wasting \u201ccritics\u201d at Rotten SJW Tomatoes gave it a 100% rating should have been a red flag. Or maybe the ludicrous non-descriptive one liner description of the movie. I mean, it\u2019s like buying a car from a dealer that says \u201cIt\u2019s a cool car\u201d.\r\n\r\nWell, in my gaming days I was a great fan of submarine simulators, especially WW2 ones, so I guess I got suckered.\r\n\r\nFor starters, the premise of the movie itself, once you start watching that is, is nonsensical. One, I say ONE, missile is fired against French territory, it is assumed to be nuclear, no real evidence, and France decides to retaliate while said missile is still in flight. Seriously?\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s something that North Korea would do. Not a civilized country and despite the fact that France right now has the worst president in modern history I would still say France counts as a civilized country.\r\n\r\nThe the movie starts with some \u201caction\u201d and here we are immediately shown that the writer is totally clueless as far as any form of military procedures, strategy or \u2026 well.. whatever. A nuclear submarine surfaces, the captain, the CAPTAIN, goes up in the conning tower and fires a hand held SAM on a chopper sent from a destroyer nearby. Oh, by the way, he forgot to remove the safety on the first try. The destroyer does absolutely nothing during this exchange. You\u2019re fucking kidding me ???\r\n\r\nThen the movie spends a shitload of time with the hero moping and moaning and being unfairly treated by the hierarchy. The film got really boring at this point. The one good part is that the superior officers, at the end, is actually the most competent characters in the movie.\r\n\r\nWhen the action finally starts again it\u2019s \u2026 well the same crap as before. Utterly unbelievable and totally unrealistic. Even the dumbass president Macron would, hopefully, known that a nuclear strike cannot be called off just like that. And when it finally comes to blows, for some reason, the \u201cenemy\u201d submarine has all kinds of countermeasures while the \u201cgood guys\u201d never launches any. As I wrote before, the writer is clueless.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s just a incredibly bad movie.

{"author":"SWITCH.","content":"Even in the writing of this review, I continue to toss \u2018The Souvenir\u2019 around in my mind. I left the cinema disappointed and frustrated by it, wishing it had let me in more instead of simply presenting itself to me, but a friend had told me that it is a film that grows on you. I think they may have been right. The more I interrogate Joanna Hogg\u2019s film, just as Joanna Hogg interrogates her own life, the more fascinating questions and provocations I find. Right now, I like the film more than love it, but I said the same a year ago about Chang-dong Lee\u2019s <a href=\u201c\/article\/review-burning-one-of-the-best-films-of-the-decade\u201c>\u2018Burning\u2019<\/a>, and on my second viewing realised that was actually a masterpiece. I\u2019m not sure the same will happen with \u2018The Souvenir\u2019, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if, when you ask me my thoughts on it in a year, my answer may be different from what it is now. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of \u2018The Souvenir' is that Hogg always intended for it to be a two-part film, with Part II currently filming. Maybe it\u2019s just that we haven\u2019t seen where else she intends to go, what is next in Julie\u2019s development as an artist, how tragedy will shape her as an artist and as a human being. In that sense, despite its flaws, \u2018The Souvenir\u2019 may be one of the most interesting provocations in independent cinema in the last few years. The more I think about it, the more I\u2019m keen to try it again, and the more I\u2019m keen to see where Julie\u2019s story goes next.\r\n- Daniel Lammin\r\n\r\nRead Daniel's full article...\r\nhttps:\/\/www.maketheswitch.com.au\/article\/review-the-souvenir-a-flawed-but-fascinating-act-of-autobiography","id":"5d4e86727c6de30011a6b29d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d4e86727c6de30011a6b29d","movie_id":473019}

{"author":"Splinter","content":"Just finished The King, a modern interpretation of parts of Shakespeare's Henry IV and Henry V, seemingly targeted at millennials.\r\n\r\nIt's common knowledge that much of Shakespeare's Henry V is based on hearsay, yet his pre-battle speeches at Barfleur ('Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more.') and Agincourt ('We band of brothers') have become the stuff of legend and remain the most stirring battle speeches of our time. In The King, Henry's pre-battle speech at Agincourt is neither stirring or inspirational due to being a watered-down, 21st-century, politically correct rendition, which I found hard to stomach.\r\n\r\nThe King portrays Henry (Hal) as a pacifist and reluctant leader, a fop to Catherine of Valois and I found Timothee Chalomet's (an American) performance as Hal to be too 21st century and not in the slightest bit convincing. In fact, he seemed reluctant to carry out any of the deeds that the real Henry V actually carried out.\r\n\r\nThe battle scenes were very realistic and the cinematography was superb, but...\r\n\r\nThis is yet another nod to the PC millennials, diluting and revising both Shakespeare and history into easily digestible snack bites for the sensitive of our era.","id":"5dc93d28470ead001598b83d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dc93d28470ead001598b83d","movie_id":504949}
{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_From a narrative perspective, there's nothing you haven't seen done before, but it's very well-made and genuinely moving_**\r\n\r\n>_Some states have been trying to reduce their recidivism rates through animal training programs. One such program, the Wild Horse Inmate Program (WHIP), is based in Florence, Arizona, a state that spends over $25,000 per inmate per year. Developed in the 1980s in Colorado, WHIP has expanded across the western United States_ [...] _Of the 50 inmate graduates of the program, only two returned to prison, a desistance rate of 96%. In other areas, such as New Mexico, th__e recidivism rate in the past for prisons offering animal training programs was 25% as compared to the state average of 38%._\r\n\r\n- \"Saddling Horses Can Tame Recidivism and Rein Spending\" (Emily Tap); _Economics21_ (May 18, 2018)\r\n\r\n> _There is something about the outside of a horse that is good for the inside of a man._\r\n\r\n- Winston Churchill\r\n\r\n> _Horse sense is the thing a horse has which keeps it from betting on people._\r\n\r\n- W.C. Fields\r\n\r\n> _How strange a thing it is that so huge and powerful and intelligent an animal as a horse should allow another, and far more feeble animal, to ride upon his back._\r\n\r\n- Peter Gray\r\n\r\nThe pitch for _The Mustang_ is about as hackneyed as it gets \u2013 a dangerous convict who hits out at everything and everyone is given a shot at redemption by working with a dangerous horse who hits out at everything and everyone, and as the man starts to tame the animal, the animal starts to tame the man. So far, so Hallmark Channel movie of the week; a story so familiar, it seems impossible it could communicate anything of value or interest. Except, despite its derivative underpinnings, _The Mustang_ has been made with such craft that it transcends the clich\u00e9s and works exceptionally well on its own terms, concluding with a scene that should be melodramatically insincere and manipulative, but which instead taps into some unexpectedly genuine emotion. Tonally similar to recent equine-related films such as Andrew Haigh's _Lean on Pete_ (2017) and Chlo\u00e9 Zhao's masterful _The Rider_ (2018), whilst also covering some of the same narrative ground as Michael Mann and David Milch's criminally underappreciated TV show _Luck_ (2011-2012), _The Mustang_ touches on issues such as masculine guilt, penitentiary stoicism, and human-animal trust, but really, this is a character study. And yes, chances are everything you think might happen does happen, but the acting, the cinematography, the characters' emotional beats, and the all-pervading sense of authenticity and respect all contribute to the whole, wherein it turns out the familiarity of the destination doesn't matter that much when the journey to get there is so well executed.\r\n\r\nNorthern Nevada Correctional Center; Roman Coleman (Matthias Schoenaerts) is serving a 12-year bit and has just been released from a long stint in solitary. Emotionally shut down and prone to violent outbursts, with no interest in being reintegrated back into society and little faith in the possibility of rehabilitation, the prison's psychologist (Connie Britton) can barely get him to confirm his name, let alone open up about his feelings (literally, his only full sentence in the first twenty minutes of the film is \"_I'm not good around people_\"). However, as part of his sentence, he's required to work, and for the safety of others, he's assigned to \"outdoor maintenance\", where his job is to clean up the horse dung from the mustangs used in the Wild Horse Inmate Program (WHIP), which sees a select few inmates \"gentle\" the animals \u2013 essentially, tame them so they can be sold at auction. As his estranged daughter Martha (Gideon Adlon) tells him she's pregnant and wants him to agree to sell the family home, Coleman keeps to himself, but is drawn to a barn in which a single horse repeatedly kicks the door. Seeing Coleman's fascination, head trainer Myles (Bruce Dern doing his Bruce Dern thing) decides to give him a chance to work with the horse, although he warns him that it's considered unbreakable, and will likely be euthanized. Naming him Marquis (although he mispronounces it as Marcus), and working under the tutelage of Henry (Jason Mitchell), Coleman sets about attempting to connect with Marquis in a way in which he hasn't connected with anyone or anything in many years.\r\n\r\nExecutive produced by Robert Redford, _The Mustang_ was initially developed through the Sundance Institute. Written by Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre and Mona Fastvold (_The Childhood of a Leader_; _Vox Lux_), with assistance from Brock Norman Brock (_Bronson_; _Yardie_) and based on an idea by de Clermont-Tonnerre (the film was inspired by her 2014 short _Rabbit_), _The Mustang_ is her feature directorial debut. As the opening and closing legends tell us, WHIP is real, with prisons across 13 states adopting it, and research showing there is a significant dip in recidivist rates amongst inmates who have worked with the horses (the rehabilitative potential of WHIP was also an important plot point in the aforementioned _Luck_).\r\n\r\nDespite the narrative outline suggesting otherwise, _The Mustang_ is not a sentimental film, but is instead rather gritty, with the prison _milieu_ having a sense of lived-in authenticity. With no qualms in telling us that Coleman deserved to go to jail (the nature of his crime is held back until very late in the story), de Clermont-Tonnerre even avoids romanticising the relationship between Coleman and Marquis; they don't have some kind of profound psychic bond, rather they connect emotionally, nothing more, nothing less. Their relationship is not an opportunity for glib esotericism regarding the human condition, it's a simple friendship. \r\n\r\nBelying her directorial inexperience, de Clermont-Tonnerre shows a terrific instinct regarding how close or how removed the audience should be at any given moment; at times, she stands back and allows the characters room to breathe, whilst at others, she muscles into the centre of the action. This is especially important when we get to the emotional high points in the third act, as she shows remarkable (almost documentarian) directorial restraint, shooting the film's last few scenes, where the potential for melodrama is at its strongest, in such a way that such melodrama is never allowed to overwhelm the smaller more realistic character beats, with the tone of the _d\u00e9nouement_ ringing as emotionally true as you could want.\r\n\r\nIn terms of acting, this is Schoenaerts's film through and through, tapping into the quiet brooding intensity of performances in films such as Jacques Audiard's _De rouille et d'os_ (2012), Alice Winocour's _Maryland_ (2015), and David Oelhoffen's _Fr\u00e8res ennemis_ (2018). The most obvious reference point, however, is his portrayal of Jacky Vanmarsenille in Micha\u00ebl R. Roskam's stunning _Rundskop_ (2011). Coleman shares a lot of characteristics with Vanmarsenille, and Schoenaerts hits many of the same beats, particularly a barely controlled temper that could erupt at any moment, in much the same manner as Benicio del Toro in Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's _21 Grams_ (2003). Indeed, the performance is all the more impressive when you consider how little dialogue Schoenaerts has. I can't think of a recent film in which the protagonist speaks as little as Coleman, but the flip side is that every gesture means something, precisely because there are so few gestures to interpret. Pay attention, for example, to his gait, which subtly changes over the course of the film in tandem with his developing arc.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most obvious similarity between Coleman and Vanmarsenille, however, is their connection with animals. In _Rundskop_, Vanmarsenille is repeatedly compared to the bulls his family rear, whether through shot composition or editing. This comparative vein is even more pronounced in _The Mustang_. For example, the film opens on a tight close-up of a mustang's eye, and the first time we see Coleman, it's a BCU of him opening his eyes as horse hooves play on the soundtrack. Later, there's a shot in which Coleman is reflected in Marquis's eye and a scene where both he and Marquis are pinned to the ground, facing one another, with the film cutting back and forth multiple times. Another fascinating composition has a pseudo-split screen effect, with Coleman on one side of the frame and Marquis on the other. When Coleman is confined to his cell, we see him pacing back and forth and punching the wall, recalling Marquis's behaviour in the stall where Coleman first met him. Sure, none of this is exactly subtle, but it is effective, with de Clermont-Tonnerre showing a surprising ability to communicate emotions and themes in a purely visual sense, a talent many directors lack, falling back on dialogue rather than visual language.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, to a certain extent, Coleman isn't so much a clearly delineated character as an archetype, but Schoenaerts leans into the lack of nuance and subtext, giving a layered performance wherein everything means something. His threatening demeanour, for example, is really a shield to prevent others from engaging with him and to suppress his feelings of guilt. However, it's a shield which Marquis has little trouble penetrating. Coleman knows total redemption is beyond him and is unrealistic, and Schoenaerts portrays this not as tragedy, but as something justified. He's helped immeasurably here by de Clermont-Tonnerre withholding of the nature of his crime, so when we find out what he did, it undermines the empathy we've already developed for him, forcing us to question our own instincts and morally relocate ourselves _via \u00e0 vis_ the character.\r\n\r\nThematically, of course, the main theme is the similarity between man and beast \u2013 Coleman and Marquis are both wild and unruly, and both must be brought to a condition of amiability. Their relationship grants de Clermont-Tonnerre a pathway into looking at issues such as masculine guilt and stoicism. However, unlike so many prison movies, _The Mustang_ is not a piece of socio-political criticism; Coleman is not an innocent wrongly convicted, and rehabilitation holds no interest for him. In this, the film reminded me a little of Michael Mann's superb directorial debut, _The Jericho Mile_ (1979), in which Rain Murphy (Peter Strauss) completely accepts his life sentence, and refuses to even entertain the possibility of release. Like Coleman, he keeps to himself, and like Coleman, he has no interest in prison politics.\r\n\r\nThe other big theme is the danger of losing self-control. Coleman is not a monster, but he is someone who finds it difficult to control his violent tendencies; that's what landed him in prison, that's what got him put in solitary, and that's why he's the only man capable of working with Marquis, who also lacks self-control. A crucial scene in this respect, and one of the best in the film is an anger management class with the psychologist, who asks each prisoner how long passed between the thought of their crime and its execution, and how long have they been in jail. None of the men say there was anything more than a few seconds between thought and deed. The point is clear; a split-second decision has landed then in prison for years. It could be a scene out of any number of prison documentaries (it would have fit right into Jairus McLeary's _The Work_ (2017), a superb documentary about the Inside Circle program in Folsom), and it's a good example of de Clermont-Tonnerre hanging back when she needs to, allowing the actors space in which to work.\r\n\r\nOf course, the film is not perfect. For a start, it doesn't matter how well it's put together, for some people, the narrative beats, particularly the penitentiary redemption arc, will just be too familiar. The fact is that we've all seen pretty much everything of which _The Mustang_ is composed, and for some, that aspect will simply be off-putting (this goes double if you've seen _The Rider_). De Clermont-Tonnerre does a fine job of sidestepping almost all of the clich\u00e9s inherent in this kind of story, but the mere fact that there are so many clich\u00e9s to avoid in the first place will discourage some people. A bigger issue is a subplot involving Dan (Josh Stewart), Coleman's untrustworthy cellmate. Blackmailing Henry into smuggling ketamine from Myles's storage into the prison, the subplot feels like it's been imported from another film entirely, but in incomplete form \u2013 the plot is introduced quite late in proceedings, is only half-heartedly explored, and ends without much in the way of resolution. These scenes are the weakest and the most inauthentic in the film, and really, it's a means to an end; the narrative needs Coleman to be at a certain place at a certain time, and de Clermont-Tonnerre uses this storyline to facilitate that. But, perhaps speaking to her directorial inexperience, there were far more organic ways to have accomplished this without resorting to a subplot that is so tonally divorced from everything around it.\r\n\r\nThese few issues notwithstanding, I thoroughly enjoyed _The Mustang_. On paper, this is a clich\u00e9d social protest film with a classic (i.e. overly familiar) redemption arc, but de Clermont-Tonnerre fashions it into something far more emotionally authentic. Without playing down the nature of Coleman's crime, the film finds a bittersweet groove, with de Clermont-Tonnerre embracing, for the most part, non-judgmental restraint, simplicity, and sincerity, relying on her excellent cast to hit the emotional beats, and more than once communicating meaning via purely visual statements. She's working perilously close to derivative clich\u00e9, but she never succumbs, with her intimate direction and Schoenaerts's committed performance allowing the film to remain always authentic, genuine, and respectful. Basing the drama around the real-world WHIP, de Clermont-Tonnerre suggests that, as in other restorative therapies, when you treat someone like a human being, oftentimes, you will find their humanity. And the irony of the film, and its most fascinating and beautifully handled trope, is that Coleman's humanity could only be found, drawn-out, and nurtured by an animal.","id":"5d992a0b8c40f700197a23d5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d992a0b8c40f700197a23d5","movie_id":500860}
{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how I should start, but I guess I\u2019ll address something that people might ask: yes, it\u2019s a SPOILER-FREE review. Why? Well, the story might follow the same essential plot points, and the characters might have similar narrative paths, but there are so many details that make this movie stand on its own. From tiny little improvements to moments of the original that wouldn\u2019t make sense in a realistic environment to adjustments to character\u2019s backstory, musical moments or other significant parts. With that said, I need to discuss the controversy surrounding this remake, but I won\u2019t take longer than one paragraph.\r\n\r\nPeople need to understand that these Disney\u2019s remakes aren\u2019t here to replace the originals. They\u2019re here to honor them, and bring their stories and characters to this new century so that new generations can have an additional look at something they love, and 90s kids can remember why they love these films so much. Emphasis on the \u201cadditional\u201d part of that sentence. Then, people also need to get their preferences right: would you want to watch a shot-for-shot remake or something entirely different? Or a blend of these two? If you don\u2019t know what you want, you might be in danger of turning into a hypocrite if your speech goes from \u201cI don\u2019t want these copy-paste remakes\u201d to \u201cthey changed that specific moment, why didn\u2019t they keep it the same?\u201d Just be clear on what you wish. If you simply don\u2019t want Disney to do these remakes, then just don\u2019t watch them. Don\u2019t go online try to beat it to the ground with negative comments if you haven\u2019t seen the movie. Moving on \u2026\r\n\r\nI love it. I absolutely love it. I cried the exact same 4 times as I did in the 1994\u2019s original. My whole body got chills during the opening sequence, which is one of a few things I love more about the remake than in the original. It\u2019s NOT a shot-for-shot remake! I don\u2019t understand how so many critics are calling it so. Either people\u2019s memory of the original faded or someone clearly didn\u2019t watch the same film. I can write a whole review of 1000+ words just describing the new stuff. Of course, the story goes through the same iconic moments in the same way, and some dialogues are extensively repeated, which was something that I was hoping they developed more. Despite that, I still feel that the scripts have a different take on it from the voice actors, even James Earl Jones.\r\n\r\nOne proof would be that I cried on a scene that I never felt like it in the original. I don\u2019t know if it was how it was shot (one of the various different angles that the remake provides of known scenes) or if the dialogue just has more impact this time around, but the point here is that this remake is NOT a cheap copy-paste. I always look forward to seeing what they come up with to solve or adjust some questions that the originals leave us with. Let me just write that Jeff Nathanson has some truly brilliant changes\/additions. Remember people criticizing Scar\u2019s look when the first teaser came out? With just ONE WORD, its entire physical shape, scar, and past are explained. One word. Imagine that. There are little elements like adding a word or a sentence here and there, and it makes so much more sense with the character or the story in question.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Scar, Chiwetel Ejiofor is astonishing. Scar might be my favorite character of the remake. He\u2019s more menacing and scarier, his voice is darker, and his arc is better explored. Jeremy Irons will always have that iconic voice associated with the character, but Ejiofor did a crazily good job in replacing him. However, if there\u2019s one voice that I could never watch another actor do is Mufasa\u2019s. I have no words to express how emotionally powerful James Earl Jones\u2019 voice is. As soon as he says \u201cSimba\u201d in the reflection scene, my eyes drop waterfalls. His voice is an emotional trigger, let\u2019s call it that. I love Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) even more this time around. Their scenes are hilarious, and the characters\u2019 relationship keeps being a standout. Oh, and if you were worried that the hula scene would never be as good let alone surpassed \u2026 You might need to rethink that. Also, I enjoyed the stretched last act (I found the original\u2019s final battle too abrupt), and I would advise parents to be careful showing this remake to (very) young kids since the violence on display feels much more real (duh).\r\n\r\nJD McCrary and Shahadi Wright-Joseph (young Nala) are amazing, and their voices are crystal clear while singing. Donald Glover and Beyonc\u00e9 (adult Nala) are also terrific, and their voices are even better. The new music Spirit fits better in this remake than Speechless in Aladdin. Moving on to the music, it\u2019s another aspect that I genuinely think the remake does better. Hans Zimmer proves that he can bring an old score of his back to life in a much more robust, epic, and passionate way. Every song feels more prominent, every soundtrack feels a lot more impactful and stronger. Be Prepared is the only one that goes through a significant change, and while it might sound a bit strange at first, I love it more each time I listen to it. It\u2019s a score that will never be forgotten, and this remake just helped people remember how great it is. Oscar-winning score.\r\n\r\nI left the best to last: the visuals. I can\u2019t possibly describe how impressive and eyegasmic the CGI is. Animals talking was never an issue (people keep sharing GIFs or short clips and immediately started complaining that it looked awkward \u2026 a 30-seconds video without context watched on a laptop will never give you a hint of how the movie will actually be). Yes, the expressiveness of the original animation can\u2019t be achieved, but going as far as saying that the film lacks soul or that the characters don\u2019t emote is just inaccurate. You don\u2019t need a PhD to understand that a lion with its ears down or up means different things. There are tiny little movements in the animals that are so complex that I\u2019m still astounded how they were able to do it. If a bug flies near their faces, they flinch or move in such a characteristic way that I felt like I was truly watching real animals. Once again, Oscar-winning VFX.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t really have major problems with it. Minor gripes with a few things, but the biggest one would be the lack of more uniqueness. There\u2019s no element of surprise in regards to the story or the character\u2019s decisions. We always know what\u2019s coming, so we\u2019re prepared (no pun intended) for anything they through at us because, well, we\u2019ve seen it before (with the exception of one particular scene that made me jump out of my chair and I think not a single person will be able to avoid it). I find the \u201canimals don\u2019t emote\u201d argument one of the biggest nitpicks in the history of cinema. It might be true that they lack the emotion of the original animation, but going as far as saying that they show absolutely no emotion is just hating for the sake of hate. Same goes for people criticizing the fact that Can You Feel the Love Tonight is sung during broad daylight \u2026 In the original, it isn\u2019t nighttime as well.\r\n\r\nFinally, I just want to address the \u201cthese remakes aren\u2019t necessary \/ no one asked for these\u201d discussion. No one asked for the 1994\u2019s movie until it came out. People didn\u2019t know they needed it. Seriously, everyone needs to realize that these remakes aren\u2019t here to replace the originals. How many of you have watched The Lion King (1994) or showed it to someone in the past 10 years? How many times have you heard its score in the same period? I bet that most of the answers are simply \u201cnone\u201d. That\u2019s how important this remake is then! It makes you go back, it makes everyone remember how incredible the 1994\u2019s film is, by keeping its essence while being able to stand on its own. Jon Favreau did a tremendous job, and I hope he gets recognized for it.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it doesn\u2019t matter if the story is identical if we cry all the same. It doesn\u2019t matter if we know what\u2019s coming if we still feel nervous and worried about the characters. The Lion King (2019) is one of Disney\u2019s best remakes so far, on par with The Jungle Book. Its VFX are game-changing, its score is more powerful and emotional than in the original, and the story carries the same heartfelt impact. James Earl Jones\u2019 voice is everything. Timon and Pumbaa are even funnier. Ejiofor\u2019s Scar is the best character in this remake. I have no flaws to point out, except that it follows the exact same path that the original\u2019s story does. I wish it would be more distinct, but I can\u2019t lie to myself, I love it deeply. One of 2019\u2019s best movies. My #1 spot will be hard to decide\u2026 Go watch it! I can\u2019t wait to see it again!\r\n\r\nRating: A","id":"5d31d3991d78f2000ee0b492","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d31d3991d78f2000ee0b492","movie_id":420818}
{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps:\/\/www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nNetflix has been supporting small, independent filmmaking for a while now. In 2018, Roma (re)opened a Best Picture nomination path to foreign films. Last year, Martin Scorsese's epic The Irishman could only come to life via streaming since no major studio wanted a three-and-a-half-hour runtime for a theater release. Between these two, dozens of other indie flicks got Netflix's (or other streaming networks) support. 2020 brings us a Spanish horror-thriller from a first-time director (Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia): The Platform (or El Hoyo).\r\n\r\nSince its showing at TIFF, this movie has been receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback. So, obviously, I needed to add it to my list. I watched it a couple of days ago, and I wanted to take time to think about it because it's definitely going to become a divisive film, especially among general audiences. The Platform carries an extremely abstract narrative, filled with symbolism, metaphors, analogies, and allegories to our political-social-economic situation. It's not a straightforward thriller at all.\r\n\r\nIt's a tremendously intriguing concept, developed through captivating storytelling and a very dark tone. It's a prison that resembles our society of today. Filled with hypocrisy and selfishness. One month, you're the king of the world on a level where food comes in excess, but you still want it all for yourself, ignoring desperate requests from down below. As soon as in the next day, you're a miserable human being, fighting for scraps with your \"cellmate\", and on the exact same position those desperate people were before... And now you want their help?!\r\n\r\nThat last narrative analogy to the real world is undoubtedly my favorite. I was never a fan of politics (who is?), so analogies and symbolism regarding that part of our life don't really impact me. However, it's clear that the screenwriters put a lot of effort into making such a meaningful story. If the ambiguousness is removed from the screenplay, there's still plenty to enjoy. Goreng's arc goes from just trying to get a diploma to actually save the people from lower levels. His story takes the viewer through tons of violence, blood, gore, and genuinely disgusting sequences.\r\n\r\nTherefore, people who want straight-up popcorn-action instead of a more philosophical take as the filmmakers intended, there's a lot to be entertained by. The Platform is also another proof that you don't need a massive budget to build an immersive atmosphere. The set and production design are as simple as they could be, but it's especially due to that simplicity that the claustrophobic prison works so well. For a directorial debut, Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia does an excellent job of controlling the pacing and applying the right shots to each situation.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my main issue is the same as most people: the ending. I will restrain myself from giving away any minor spoilers, so I'll just write that it doesn't work at all levels, at least not for me. As expected, it's as ambiguous as the rest of the movie. As soon as I finished the film, I was frustrated by so many unanswered (logical) questions, and after a couple of days of thinking about it, these questions still exist. You'll never find an answer to everything, but that was never the main goal. There has to be a balance between reality and fiction. Between what's real and what's just a metaphoric symbol. No one can justify *everything* with \"oh, it's just a representation of something else\".\r\n\r\nFor me, there are two ways of interpreting the ending: I could either take everything literally, which would raise tons of questions without an answer, or I could try and solely look at the story through Goreng's perspective. I do believe the latter approach is the best one, even if it still carries other issues regarding secondary characters. It doesn't answer everything, but it's the perspective I find to make more sense with the movie. It makes the screenplay more cohesive and congruent.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the problem I can't seem to avoid is the abrupt break in tone. For such a brutal, raw, bloody display of human behavior in a situation of survival (the way colors are used is very clever), the climax feels detached from everything that comes before. The underlying themes are there from the get-go, but these are precisely what they are: secondary messages lying under a pretty real story. Going from horrible murders, sacrifices, and God knows what else, to such a philosophical, soulful ending in the way the film does... it's far from a seamless transition.\r\n\r\nBasically, if you go in expecting definite answers about whatever this prison is, who controls it, and how it truly works, you'll probably leave disappointed and frustrated. It's one of those movies that heavily relies on how people perceive its ending and how much impact does it cause on an overall opinion. Looking at the conclusion solely from Goreng's perspective works the best for me, even if some unanswered (logical) questions still exist. The abrupt break in tone transitioning to the film's climax is my main problem, but The Platform has plenty of positives. An extremely intriguing premise is developed through remarkably captivating storytelling, and an exceptional cast elevates the well-written screenplay. First-time director Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia and his team do an excellent job. Set and production design prove how a small budget can still create an immersive, claustrophobic atmosphere. Even if the ending only works partially, the symbolism and allegories of our world's politics and social-economic situation are a brilliant, thought-provoking piece of a screenplay. I like more it the more I think about it.\r\n\r\nRating: B+","id":"5e80cd7c4e67420014d96b26","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e80cd7c4e67420014d96b26","movie_id":619264}

I loved loved loved loved it! I loved every minute of it. One of my favorite movies of 2019 and I honestly don\u2019t think anything can top it. A slow descent into madness that creeps into your subconscious and won\u2019t be leaving anytime soon.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first frame, I immediately knew this was going to be special. I was hooked throughout until the end credits. \r\n\r\nWillem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson both deliver career defining performances. They play off each others insanity beautifully. I could tell just from the accents and dialect that plenty of homework went into making an authentic portrayal of the time.\r\n\r\nRobert Pattinson is fantastic as a quiet and private lighthouse keeper that witness the madness slowly unfolding, but also feeds the audiences curiosity on revealing the strange happenings on the island. Pattinson is a chameleon when it comes to portraying characters. \r\n\r\nWillem Dafoe, on the other hand, was mesmerizing as the old sea dog captain with a love for farting. His long and insane monologues are the main highlights, because it was so electrifying to watch it was hard not be captivated. He\u2019s strict and often unpredictable, but once you see it, you won\u2019t forget it. \r\n\r\nI hope Robert Eggers continues making horror movies in the future, because right now he\u2019s one of the best living directors working today. The slow-burn tension and lack of conventional scares seems to be his trademark so far. Every choice he made was so carefully thought out and the results is masterful. According to Eggers, they actually built a lighthouse from scratch and everything we see, including the weather, is genuine. Even if some tricky was used, it was so seamless I couldn\u2019t tell what was fake.\r\n\r\nI loved how the movie was shot; the dim black-and-white with the claustrophobic aspect ratio, giving it the appearance of a silent film born like a German expressionism - something you would\u2019ve mistaken for a 1920\/30\u2019s horror folklore. Perfectly captures the time period and the overall dread. You really do feel cut off from the outside world and abandoned on this spectral-like island, and this black sheet of cloud strongly looming over the two men. A dark force in all directions, unseen but very eerie. The cold and heartless weather is a character itself. A big bully with salty intentions. \r\n\r\nI adored the use of lighting through out, as the only light source is either natural light during daytime or candle lit lanterns, which cast many shadows that adds to the unease. There\u2019s some gorgeous looking cinematography on display here. Seriously, even as am writing this right now I can memorize every single frame of this strange nightmare of a film. Absolutely breathtaking.\r\n\r\nWhile the movie is mainly horror, but there is comedy sprinkled throughout that was actually pretty hilarious. Everything from Dafoe farting and some creative insults the characters would often spit at each other, which would later expand into long monologues that I sat back and watch in awe with a stupid grin on my face, because how something so silly can be so poetic. Never have I seen a movie that perfectly balances more than one genre so fluently. You can laugh at the moments where it\u2019s suppose to be funny, but also take it seriously whenever it\u2019s suppose to be taken seriously, which is sometimes all in one scene. The writing from Eggers is so excellent. \r\n\r\nAfter only one viewing there was a lot I could easily dissect in terms of interpretation. There's masculinity and Greek mythology imagery that demonstrates a striking sense of power. There\u2019s also a certain idea of sexuality being a sacred thing and the frustration it may bring. Or maybe it\u2019s just a simple story about two guys on a rock getting drunk and then getting even drunker while holding each other until they drift off to sleep. \r\n\r\nOverall rating: One of the best looking horror comedies of 2019.","id":"5e2f28c0326c1900181bcd45","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2f28c0326c1900181bcd45","movie_id":503919}

Stedman; _The Light Between Oceans_ (2012)\r\n\r\nA manic fever dream fusing Greek mythology, Jungian psychology, and German Expressionism with Herman Melville and H.P. Lovecraft, by way of George Kuchar, Mike Kuchar, and Guy Maddin, _The Lighthouse_ is about isolation, insanity, competitive masculinity, alcoholism, and farting. The second film from writer\/director Robert Eggers, who exploded onto the scene with the masterful _The VVitch: A New England Folktale_ (2015), _The Lighthouse_ was co-written with his brother, Max Eggers, and is very loosely based on the \"Smalls Lighthouse Tragedy\" (1801), in which one of the two assigned keepers died, and it was over four months before relief could be sent. By the time someone did land, the still-living keeper had been driven completely insane. A bizarre film in just about every way, from its glorious visual and aural design to its grandiose acting to its jet black humour to its wonderful ambiguity to its avenging angels\/seagulls, if you thought _The VVitch_ was somewhat inaccessible, then you'll most likely despise every second of _The Lighthouse_, insofar as its subtlety, slow pace, and narrative abstruseness will surely frustrate those who prefer their horror in the mould of jump-scares and chainsaw-wielding escaped mental patients. However, if you favour the cerebral, difficult-to-define, and always slightly off-camera terror that was the foundational principal of _The VVitch_ and films such as Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S\u00e1nchez's _The Blair Witch Project_ (1999), Jennifer Kent's _The Babadook_ (2014), and Emma Tammi's _The Wind_ (2018), or if you enjoy the oppressive dread of classic German Expressionist films such as Robert Wiene's _Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari_ (1920), Fritz Lang's _Der m\u00fcde Tod: ein deutsches volkslied in 6 versen_ (1921), and F.W. Murnau's _Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens_ (1922), then you'll find much here to appreciate.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1890s, Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) and Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) arrive on an outcropping off the coast of New England to begin their four-week rotation manning the lighthouse. Bombastic, spirited, and flatulent, Wake is a veteran \u2013 a former sailor who's been a wickie for the last fifteen years. Withdrawn and taciturn, Winslow is new to the job, having previously worked as a logger in Canada. Wake assigns Winslow the menial tasks \u2013 cleaning the floors, emptying the chamber pots, carrying kerosene containers, repairing the exteriors, oiling the gears in the basement \u2013 whilst he himself attends to the Fresnel lens, telling Winslow that he is never, ever to approach it, and not to concern himself with its maintenance. And so things go for a while. However, soon enough, Winslow begins to have strange experiences \u2013 a one-eyed seagull starts pestering him; he has visions of a mermaid washing up on the shore; he thinks he sees Wake standing in front of the light, completely naked; he has dreams of erotic tentacles; he has a vision of Wake as a barnacle-encrusted titan; he imagines wading out into the water amidst hundreds of logs, which close over top of him and drown him. Although he's unnerved, the four weeks pass without too much incident, but on the night before their relief is due, the wind suddenly changes, and the island is hit by a violent storm. The following morning, their ferry doesn't arrive, and with no way of contacting the mainland, the duo attempt to pass the time attending to their duties, whilst their drinking becomes ever more excessive, their loathing of one another ever more pronounced, and their hold on sanity ever more tenuous.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that jumps out at you in _The Lighthouse_ is the aesthetic. _The VVitch_ was a good-looking movie, no doubt, but _The Lighthouse_ is a rarefied masterclass in visual and aural design. Opening with the old monochrome Universal logo, the importance of Damian Volpe's incredible sound design is indicated immediately, as before we see anything, we hear the wind blowing and a foghorn rumbling in the distance. That horn is omnipresent throughout the film, and to say it gets under your skin is an understatement. You know the siren from the _Silent Hill_ games that sounds right before the town transitions from the Real World to the Otherworld? Well, imagine that sound bellowing out every minute or so for an entire film. It's unsettling, it's disturbing, and it makes it impossible to ever really acclimate yourself to this strange _milieu_. There's only one sequence in which we don't hear the foghorn, the pivotal opening scene of the third act, and the silence is oppressive \u2013 it's one of those instances where you don't realise how loud something was until it suddenly goes quiet and you're left with a ringing in your ears.\r\n\r\nThe sound design is matched by the stunning monochrome visuals. Working with cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, who also photographed _The VVitch_, Eggers shot _The Lighthouse_ on 35mm black & white Eastman Double-X 5222 celluloid in the relatively unheard format of 1.19:1. Usually, if a filmmaker shoots in a non-widescreen format, they use Academy ratio (1.37:1), as seen in films such as David Lowery's _A Ghost Story_ (2017), Paul Schrader's _First Reformed_ (2017), and Jennifer Kent's _The Nightingale_ (2018). On the other hand, the use of 1.19:1 (sometimes called Movietone) is extremely rare, especially in modern films, and for good reason \u2013 it was a transitional format that was only used briefly during the shift from silent cinema to sound (1926-1932). And that is exactly why Eggers and Blaschke chose it. Yes, they do match form to content insofar as the nearly square format traps the characters within the frame to an even greater degree than 1.37:1 would have, thus enhancing the already oppressive claustrophobia of the lighthouse itself. But where the genius in choosing this format really comes to light is when one considers to what the film aspires. This is a folktale, a fable from a by-gone age, so what better way to present that fable than by replicating the way the film would have looked had it been made during the early years of sound filmmaking? At the same time, although shot with modern cameras, Blaschke used period-specific Baltar lenses and an off-cyan filter custom-made by Schneider Filters to more accurately emulate the look of late 19th-century photography. Taken together, the black & white images, the square frame, the lens design, the patina, and the haunting sound design all work in glorious tandem to create the sense that the film is a disturbing artefact, an antique vestige from a different era, into whose very DNA dread has burrowed.\r\n\r\nOne also has to praise Craig Lathrop's production design. The lighthouse used in the film wasn't an existing structure, but was custom-built to scale on Cape Forchu, an outcropping off the coast of Nova Scotia. However, you'd never know it. Most of the interiors were shot on soundstages, but all exteriors were shot on Forchu. And Lathrop has imbued every inch of the building, both inside and out, with an existentialist dread \u2013 from the industrial hell of the gears in the basement to the almost Eden like peace of the lantern room high above, from the cramped and crude bedroom to the squalid kitchen. Malevolence stalks every nook and cranny.\r\n\r\nEggers also does something interesting with the narrative itself. I've seen some critics refer to Winslow and Wake as unreliable narrators, and whilst such critics are on the right track, to call the characters narrators is, in strict narratological terms, inaccurate. Both characters are, in fact, focalisers, to use the term coined by G\u00e9rard Genette \u2013 the world is filtered entirely through their perspective, but they don't narrate. Indeed, although we shift from one character to the other, meaning there is a narrative presence at the extradigetic level, Eggers never leaves their perspective, nor does he present any kind of omniscient or overt heterodiegetic narration; we're imprisoned within their perspective for the duration of the film. Also important here is the use of what Seymour Chatman refers to as \"fallible focalisation\" (he actually uses the term \"fallible filtration\", but filtration and focalisation are the same thing). The story is one of madness, and it's abundantly clear from early on that neither man is a reliable witness, so everything filtered through their perspective (i.e. the whole film) could be tainted or unreliable (which is why critics erroneously refer to the duo as unreliable narrators). As things begin to fall apart, this sense becomes ever more prevalent \u2013 for example, in an important scene near the end, we see Wake do something, and in the next scene, when Winslow confronts him about it, a confused Wake points out it was actually Winslow who did it. Is Wake lying? Is Winslow projecting his own actions onto his companion? Who exactly is misleading who here? And if there's madness in this tale, where does it land \u2013 Winslow, Wake, the audience, or all three of us? It's a wonderful use of a defamiliarising technique which works to keep the audience constantly on edge and constantly second-guessing everything they see insofar as we know that some, none, or all of it could be the figment of a failing mind.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is also beautifully written. Whereas in _The VVitch_, Eggers used pre-colonial Early Modern English lifted from court transcripts of actual witch trials, here he doesn't take the dialogue from anywhere specifically, but there's an obvious debt to writers such as Sarah Orne Jewett, who often wrote about whalers working off the southern Maine coast. Winslow's accent is based on a Maine farming dialect, while Wake's is based on that of Atlantic fishermen, and although their idiolects are more recognisable to our modern ears than those used in _The VVitch_, inflections and sentence structure ensure we never forget this is a tale of the past \u2013 for example, Wake declares, \"_I'm a wickie, and a wickie I is_\" and during an argument about his cooking, he asks Winslow, \"_Ye is fond of me lobster ain't ye?_\" And needless to say, the acting is immense, with both men turning in career-best work. Whilst Pattinson slowly morphs from a docile and subservient worker into something more assertive, aggressive, and altogether more sinister, Dafoe goes as big as he can, in a performance that wouldn't be out of place in classic German Expressionism.\r\n\r\nThe film's storyline is slight enough as to suggest several themes without really going too heavily into any of them. For example, one could certainly read Winslow and Wake's relationship as homoerotic, maybe a study of the suppression of desire. Paranoia is also never far from the surface, nor is the societal construct of masculinity, particularly as manifested in competitiveness, with Eggers mocking male bravado and posturing. Another reading would be that the film is an allegory for class struggle _\u00e1 la_ J.G. Ballard's _High Rise_ (1975) \u2013 the lighthouse represents society; the lantern room high above is the upper class, with Wake doggedly protecting the room, literally locking Winslow out; meanwhile, the bowels of the lighthouse is the working class, with Winslow spending much of the film performing menial tasks assigned him by Wake. Alcoholism is also omnipresent \u2013 from Wake telling Winslow that \"_boredom makes men into villains_\", and that alcohol is the only medicine for it, to the duo progressively drinking more and more each night, until they run out of rum, and so try to mix turpentine and honey, so dependent have they become on the numbing effects of drink.\r\n\r\n_The Lighthouse_ definitely isn't for everyone. It's challenging and rewarding in equal measure, but it does ask much of the audience, with meaning to be found between the lines, rather than within them. Eggers does some of the legwork, but he still leaves the audience with a distance to go. Personally, I loved every crazy minute of it \u2013 whether it be the rising sense of dread, the unrelenting tension, the oppressive suspense, the fierce battle of wills, the consuming paranoia, the descent into insanity etc. There's a lot that has gone into making this film what it is, both in terms of crafting the folkloric story and in the more mechanical sense of putting the finished film together \u2013 it's an aesthetic marvel in pretty much every way. Thick with mood and atmosphere, _The Lighthouse_ proves that _The VVitch_ was no fluke.","id":"5e48b7022d93750019a7bdc9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e48b7022d93750019a7bdc9","movie_id":503919}

Kennedy and Jimmy Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; the election of John F. Kennedy as President in 1960; the Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961; the assassination of JFK in 1963; the election of Richard Nixon as President in 1968; the Watergate scandal from 1972 to 1974; and Nixon's resignation in 1974. All of this historical context, however, is mere window dressing, and at no time is it where the film's focus lies. Instead, _The Irishman_ is about aging, loss, taking stock, regret. To a certain extent, it is to the gangster genre what John Ford's _The Searchers_ (1956) was to the classic western.\r\n\r\nBased on the 2004 book by Charles Brandt, _\"I Heard You Paint Houses\": Frank \"The Irishman\" Sheeran and the Inside Story of the Mafia, the Teamsters, and the Last Ride of Jimmy Hoffa_, _The Irishman_ was written for the screen by Steven Zaillian (_Schindler's List_; _A Civil Action_; _American Gangster_) and directed by Martin Scorsese (_Taxi Driver_; _The Last Temptation of Christ_; _The Aviator_), whose _GoodFellas_ (1990) and _Casino_ (1995) are two of the most celebrated gangster movies ever made (although, I think I'm the only person on the planet who dislikes _GoodFellas_; I love _Casino_ though). An old-school auteur in the mould of filmmakers such as Francis Ford Coppola, Brian De Palma, Michael Mann, Terrence Malick, and Oliver Stone, Scorsese, Malick, and Mann are three of the very few such filmmakers who remain as relevant today as they were when they first broke into the business. I personally haven't really liked much of what he's done in the last couple of decades, but there's no denying Scorsese is a filmmaker who still seems to have a lot to say.\r\n\r\n_The Irishman_ has received a rapturous reception, with critics and audiences proclaiming it as one of Scorsese's best movies. And although I certainly don't disagree that it has (many) masterful elements, but it's just too blooming long, taking far too much time to get to the last act (which is superb). Shorten it by 20 minutes in the mid-section, and you have a masterpiece. Now, don't get me wrong, I have no problem with long films \u2013 Coppola's _The Godfather Part II_ (202 minutes) is one of the finest films ever made; three of my all-time favourite movies are the Director's Cuts of Sergio Leone's _Once Upon a Time in America_ (250), Kevin Costner's _Dances with Wolves_ (236), and Malick's _The Tree of Life_ (190); I adore Kenneth Branagh's _Hamlet_ (242), and I'm a big fan of films such as Jerzy Hoffman's _Potop_ (315), Bernardo Bertolucci's _1900_ (317) and B\u00e9la Tarr's _S\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3_ (442...yep, 442). However, such length has to be narratively justified, and I just felt that in _The Irishman_, it wasn't. A runtime of around 170-180 minutes would have been perfect, but as it stands, the film's 206 minutes occasionally feel padded and (dare I say it) self-indulgent. Nevertheless, the acting is universally superb, the directing is more contemplative than we've seen from Scorsese in a while, Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is predictably awesome, and Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is flawless. If only it was 20 minutes shorter.\r\n\r\nThe film opens in 2003 as we meet an elderly Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro). A World War II veteran who was stationed in Italy, Sheeran now lives in a nursing home and is close to death. Wanting to die with something of a clear conscience, he decides to speak about his time as the go-to hitman for the Northeastern Pennsylvania-based Bufalino crime family. We then cut to 1975 as Sheeran, family patriarch Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), and their wives are embarking on a three-day drive to attend a wedding. As they pass by the spot where Sheeran and Bufalino first met, we cut to 1954, with Sheeran working as a truck driver for a slaughterhouse. Although, he has a reputation for reliability, on the side, he's selling more than a little of the meat to Felix \"Skinny Razor\" DiTullio (Bobby Cannavale), a wiseguy working for the Philadelphia and New Jersey-based Bruno crime family led by Angelo Bruno (Harvey Keitel), an ally and friend of Russell. When Sheeran sells the entire contents of his truck, however, turning up at the delivery location with an empty storage, the company charge him with theft, but he's successfully represented by Bill Bufalino (Ray Romano), Russell's cousin. Sheeran and Russell become good friends, and soon, Russell has Sheeran carrying out various hits. Loyal to the Bruno and Bufalino families, and adept at his job, Sheeran quickly moves up the underworld ladder, and Bufalino introduces him to Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). The president of the Mob-funded Teamsters union, Hoffa is facing investigation by the United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management and is struggling to deal with rising teamster Anthony \"Pro\" Provenzano (Stephen Graham). Hoffa is volatile, unpredictable, confrontational, and believes himself untouchable, so Bufalino wants Sheeran to babysit him and try to keep him out of trouble. Hoffa and Sheeran hit it off, and soon Sheeran is Hoffa's unofficial bodyguard. However, despite Sheeran's best efforts, as the years go by, Hoffa continues to antagonise his Mob backers, and some of them soon come to see him as more of a liability than an asset.\r\n\r\nOriginally set at Paramount, when _The Irishman_'s budget started pushing $150m before shooting had even begun, the studio deemed the project too expensive and dropped it. Then came Netflix, who not only put up the money, but they also offered Scorsese a near unheard-of degree of creative control \u2013 the kind of control that almost no one person has been given over a project this big since Michael Cimino pissed away $44m ($115m in today's money) of United Artists' money on Heaven's Gate (1980), a film originally budgeted at $11.6m, and which earned back only $3m at the box office, ending the _auteur_-driven New Hollywood era, nearly bankrupting UA, and fundamentally altering the way movie studios did business. Netflix's involvement with _The Irishman_ is an interesting situation because here you have a film that simply could not have been made through the modern studio system (at least not in its current form). Netflix is usually derided for their purchase of movies originally intended for theatrical release, which are then packaged as \"Netflix Originals\", with many predicting that streaming services will ultimately destroy the cinema industry entirely. As with many such films, _The Irishman_ was given a limited theatrical release to ensure it qualified for Oscar consideration (Netflix _really_ to have a Best Picture winner in their catalogue). However, disgruntled about there being only a three week gap between theatrical release and streaming debut, major cinema chains such as AMC, Cinemark, Regal, and Cineplex all refused to carry it, with AMC's Adam Aron stating they would only be open to showing the film if Netflix \"_respects the decades-old theatrical window, that suggests that movies come to theatres first for a couple of months, and then go to the home._\" For all that, however, it's hard for a lover of cinema not to celebrate Netflix stepping in to save such an ambitious and artistic film, to say nothing of the unprecedented control they gave Scorsese. It was a great PR move, sure, but it was also a massive financial risk, so you really can't condemn their involvement.\r\n\r\nLooking very briefly at the real-life background of the film's narrative, most historians today dismiss Sheeran's account of how important he was to the Bufalino family, and several of his claims have been proven as fabrications (for more information on this, see Bill Tonelli's August 2019 article \"The Lies of the Irishman\" for _Slate_ and Jack Goldsmith's September 2019 article \"Jimmy Hoffa and The Irishman: A True Crime Story?\" for _The New York Review_). Nevertheless, the film uses Sheeran's book as the main source for the story, so it's best just to put the many historical embellishments to the back of your mind. Aside from killing Hoffa, some of Sheeran's most flamboyant claims include killing Joe Gallo, delivering a truckload of weaponry to soldiers preparing for the Bay of Pigs Invasion (handing the truck over to E. Howard Hunt, no less), giving a bag containing three rifles to a pilot days before Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy, and delivering a suitcase containing a $500,000 bribe to Attorney General John N. Mitchell to pass on to Nixon. Historians, however, tell us he did none of these things, maintaining that he was a low-level goon with a drinking problem who was never assigned to any important task. This has been corroborated by several former Mob bosses who knew Sheeran. According to Tonelli,\r\n\r\n>_not a single person I spoke with who knew Sheeran from Philly \u2013 and I interviewed cops and criminals and prosecutors and reporters \u2013 could remember even a suspicion that he had ever killed anyone._\r\n\r\nSo, either he was the greatest and most clandestine Mob hitman of all time, or he was full of shit.\r\n\r\nIrrespective of this, however, _The Irishman_ is a film written in regret. Scorsese has often been accused of making Mob recruitment films, and it's well-known that real-life gangsters love _GoodFellas_ and _Casino_. In _The Irishman_, however, there's a thematic maturity not present in those films \u2013 the violence is presented with a degree more solemnity, the emotional fallout of such a life with a degree more finality. Much of this is tied up in Sheeran's daughter Peggy (played by Lucy Gallina as a child and Anna Paquin as an adult). An almost completely wordless role, Peggy is introduced in a scene in which she watches her father viciously beat the grocer for whom she works because he pushed her. The impression of him which this gives her is something Sheeran spends much of the rest of the film trying to ameliorate.\r\n\r\nAnother important element in the film's thematic complexity, particularly the theme of death, is that as each gangster appears for the first time, a subtitle tells us who they are, but also lists the date of their deaths and how they were murdered (which almost all were). There's no better illustration of just how concerned the film is with the nature of transience \u2013 every single one of these guys is a colossus in their own mind, and each deems themselves invincible (as do we all when young). Yet none of them make it out of life alive. In the film's last act, this theme is distilled down to its very essence, essentially positing that the only important thing you leave behind is your relationships with other people, and Sheeran has badly mismanaged his, resulting in him sitting alone in a nursing home at Christmas, waiting to die. In _GoodFellas_ and _Casino_, the protagonists lose their wealth, possessions, status, and so on, but in _The Irishman_, the loss is more existential \u2013 Sheeran loses his soul. Telling himself for much of the film that he's an inherently decent person insofar as he loves his family and is loyal to his friends, it's only at the very end that he comes to realise he was a monster. Scorsese is here showing us that men like Sheeran and Bufalino must erase their humanity to function effectively in this world (or conversely, that they can function effectively because they have no humanity to begin with), suggesting that men with no conscience are not only not men, they're not even alive.\r\n\r\nThis issue comes to a head in a remarkably well-acted scene towards the end of the film in which Sheeran calls the widow of a man he has recently murdered (all the man's wife knows at the time of the call is that her husband is missing). Assuring her that he's there for her should she need anything, Sheeran urges her to try to think positive, explaining that he believes the man will turn up eventually. It clearly causes him a degree of pain, but the fact that he can do it at all speaks to his sociopathy if not necessarily his psychopathology. The last act, as the violence settles and the zingers and insults dry up, is remarkably bleak in a way that the last acts of _GoodFellas_ and _Casino_ aren't, and as we watch Sheeran sitting in that nursing home, taking stock, spelling out his regrets, reminiscing about his actions as a young man, it's impossible not to see the meta dimension \u2013 Scorsese himself looking back on his career, remembering the classics of yesteryear, keenly aware that old-age is beginning to creep up on him.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the acting, the closest we get to a poor performance is Pacino, who portrays Hoffa as if he was playing, well, Al Pacino. This is arguably the biggest he's gone since Taylor Hackford's _Devil's Advocate_ (1997), a film in which he quite literally played Satan. But in terms of portraying Hoffa, look at footage of the real Hoffa, then watch both The Irishman and Danny DeVito's _Hoffa_ (1992) in which Jack Nicholson plays the character, and tell me who gives the more authentic performance. Don't get me wrong, Pacino is fun to watch (I would gladly see an entire film composed of nothing but him and Stephen Graham insulting one another), and most of the laughs come from his over-the-top antics, but it's not an especially accurate depiction of the real man. As for De Niro, this is his first not-phoned-in performance in decades, possibly since _Casino_ and Mann's _Heat_ (1995), and he imbues the character with real interiority and complex psychology, without diluting Sheeran's inherent inhumanity. However, the real standout performance is Pesci. Nine years since his last live-action film, Pesci falls back into the groove without missing a beat. However, those looking for the fireworks of Tommy DeVito or Nicky Santoro will be disappointed \u2013 this is literally the inverse of such performances. Pesci's Bufalino is quiet, calm, considered, highly intelligent, but cold and sociopathic, the kind of man who wouldn't so much beat your head in, but would order someone else to do so without giving it a second thought.\r\n\r\nIf the film has a single problem, it's the runtime. Depending on your perspective, 206 minutes is either too long or, ironically, not long enough. I could certainly see this story working well as a six-hour miniseries, but as a film, it needs trimming. As mentioned above, the last act is devastating; there's little tension as such, but there sure is pathos. However, by the time we got to this point, I was starting to feel the film had outstayed its welcome, when I should have been the most heavily invested in the story. This has been a recurrent problem in recent Scorsese films, most notably _The Aviator_ (2004), _The Wolf of Wallstreet_ (2013), and the horrendous _Silence_ (2016), but this is the first time he's strayed from over-long into self-indulgence. The film simply doesn't warrant this length; whole scenes could easily be removed without compromising the story, the character beats, or the emotion. This is mostly felt in the long middle section in which Scorsese broadens the story to take in the Kennedy and Nixon presidencies, without ever really tying the historical material to Sheeran's narration. Presumably, he's trying to show the interconnectedness between the underworld and politics, but given the time he spends on it, that isn't especially clear.\r\n\r\nAnother problem, albeit a smaller one, is the digital de-aging. Apart from a scene showing a 20-something Sheeran, in which De Niro looks like he's made of (cheap) wax, I thought the technology was deployed pretty successfully; it's a little jolting at first, but easy to get used to. What stood out, however, was the tired bodies beneath those de-aged faces. This is most notable in the scene where Sheeran beats up Peggy's boss \u2013 a pivotal moment that drives a permanent wedge between the two as she witnesses for the first time his savagery. Except the beating is pathetic \u2013 the kicks are about five miles away from the man's face and De Niro's exhausted stomps wouldn't flatten a wet cardboard box. It's a shame as, it's a good scene, but the lack of correlation between face and body is undeniably jarring. Another issue is one that has cropped up in all of Scorsese's Mob films \u2013 glorification. Obviously, _The Irishman_ is about the toxic masculinity of this world and the lonely endgame (if one even gets to the endgame), but much as was the case with his (frankly stomach-churning) softening of Jordan Belfort in _Wolf of Wall Street_, Scorsese runs a very real risk of glamorising what he claims to be condemning.\r\n\r\nWith 20 minutes shaved off, this could have been one of the best films of the century thus far. For me, _The Irishman_ was a very good movie, but certainly not the masterpiece many others have felt it to be. But that's just me, and I can certainly recognise and celebrate such ambitious and _auteur_-driven filmmaking, especially coming, as it does, at a time when more and more it feels like films are being made by committees rather than by artists. Arguably Scorsese's most eschatological film, certainly since _Kundun_ (1997), _The Irishman_ is essentially a story of how one man lost his soul, and, by extension how the world for which he lost it dehumanises and degrades those who participate in its rites. Although brought down by old-age, abandonment, and the merciless nature of human existence, Scorsese refuses to afford these men an easy out \u2013 they made their choices, and they must now live, and die, with the consequences.","id":"5dd9fd4812aabc0011928329","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dd9fd4812aabc0011928329","movie_id":398978}

{"author":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","content":"\u201cThe Assistant,\u201d a timely story about abuse of power in the workplace, left me shaken and angry. This quietly devastating film about a young assistant (Julia Garner) to a prominent entertainment executive is inspired by the Me Too movement (and clearly, the bad actions of Harvey Weinstein). The story accurately portrays the weighty emotional toll that stems from knowing something isn\u2019t quite right, but you are powerless to do anything about it.\r\n\r\nJane (Garner) is just starting out in her career. She puts in long hours at the New York office of a powerful film exec, and she takes continual emotional and verbal abuse from her boss (whom we never see). There\u2019s nothing glamorous or rewarding about her job, but those around her give constant reminders that she is the lucky one simply because she is employed there. Jane is faced with hostile, degrading comments from almost everyone she comes in contact with, but she quietly goes about her business and tries her best to ignore it.\r\n\r\nWriter \/ director Kitty Green chooses to center her methodical, orderly narrative around a female assistant, which makes the film all the more powerful. She uses point of view shots that make it feel as if you\u2019re right there in the office, stepping directly into the character\u2019s shoes. The story takes place over one day in a drab office as Jane begins to see a pattern of events that don\u2019t add up. She\u2019s someone who doesn\u2019t quite know enough to have a clear, undeniable picture of what\u2019s going on, yet she still knows something definitely isn\u2019t quite right. It\u2019s unsettling and effective, and it something to which young women (and some young men) everywhere will sadly relate.\r\n\r\nWhen Jane tries to do the right thing, she\u2019s stonewalled by a Hollywood culture where abuse is tolerated, joked about, and covered up \u2014 in other words, it\u2019s accepted. She watches as her colleagues joke about these escapades while laughing off her concerns. An unhelpful HR director (the terrific Matthew Macfadyen) dismisses her complaints as \u201cbullshit\u201d and a product of \u201cjealousy,\u201d which is infuriating to watch because it feels so steeped in truth.\r\n\r\nEven more disturbing is that while eyes have been opened thanks to the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement, this gross misconduct is still going on in offices all over the world. Newsflash to those working in the entertainment industry (and elsewhere): if you don\u2019t speak up, or if you laugh about or shrug off bad behavior, you\u2019re part of the problem. \u201cThe Assistant\u201d is a sobering reminder that just because \u201cthat\u2019s the way it is\u201d doesn\u2019t make it right.","id":"5e7d57a16c849200166ab671","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e7d57a16c849200166ab671","movie_id":627463}

There\u2019s nothing new or exciting in an \u201curban legend turned true.\u201d Fortunately, the backstory is simple, it isn\u2019t filled with explicit exposition every two minutes, and the short runtime helps the film to develop through a fast pacing. Sadly, it\u2019s just another common horror screenplay that the writers took from the scripts cabinet.\r\n\r\nLinda Cardellini gives a strong performance as the protagonist. Even though every character in this movie makes questionable decisions that lead to avoidable events (something inevitable in horror films), Anna is a compelling and courageous woman, who only wants to do what\u2019s best for any children, not only their own. Raymond Cruz portrays Rafael, a priest who sort of almost is a deus ex machina. He barely has any kind of decent character development, but he works well enough as comic relief to lighten up an otherwise too dark tone. The kids are good, but Patricia Velasquez (Patricia Alvarez) is way over-the-top, which doesn\u2019t help her already not-so-good script.\r\n\r\nAll in all, The Curse of La Llorona is \u2026 okay. It\u2019s not near as horrible as The Nun, and honestly, that\u2019s a good compliment for such a typical and cliche horror flick. Michael Chaves truly saves what could have been a disaster with another director. Wonderfully handled one-take sequences, which elevate the suspense levels, and he also produced some imaginative jump scares, even if most of them still lack actual scariness. Linda Cardellini is great as the lead, but every character is compelled to make dumb decisions to move the plot forward. Some characters needed more care in their scripts, and more focus on the story to tell instead of just creating scares after scares.\r\n\r\nClose, but not close enough \u2026\r\n\r\nRating: C+","id":"5cb88fa9c3a3683abf837c29","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cb88fa9c3a3683abf837c29","movie_id":480414}

The right-wing has organised and manipulated such anger and resentment, turned it away from corporations, and directed it against the government, decrying high taxes and the inability of the state to solve problems such as soc__ial deterioration, homelessness, crime, and violence.

Grynbaum); _The New York Times_ (January 26, 2017)\r\n\r\nTaking as its subject Steve Bannon, the so-called \"Kingmaker\" behind Donald Trump's unexpected 2016 election victory, Alison Klayman's documentary _The Brink_ attempts to portray and engage with the controversial alt-right figure without necessarily crossing the line into hagiography or giving a platform to his hateful and divisive rhetoric. Dubbed \"The Great Manipulator\" by _TIME_, Bannon's official position in the Trump administration was Chief White House Strategist, an extraordinary rise to power for the former naval officer better known as Vice President of Goldman Sachs and chief executive of _Breitbart News_ than for anything in his capacity as a politician. Seeing himself as spearheading a global alt-right populist movement, called The Movement (and they say the right has no imagination), the film follows Bannon as he travels around Europe preaching nationalism, decrying immigration and Islam, claiming to represent the concerns of the average working man, and attempting to unite the various European nationalist-populist groups, before returning to the US for the November 2018 midterm elections. A heroic truth-teller to some, a personification of a hateful, discriminatory, racist ideology to others, in Bannon's worldview, the only good American is a white Christian heterosexual American. And whilst _The Brink_ is perfectly adequate as a documentary, it's limited by its identity as a left-leaning film made by a left-leaning filmmaker for a left-leaning audience. Very few people on the right will see it, and those that do will find nothing therein to stimulate any kind of reassessment of their ideology and\/or political affiliations. On the contrary, they'll most likely find it validating. In short, _The Brink_ encapsulates perhaps the most fundamental problem in contemporary political discourse in the US; everyone is preaching to the already converted and no one is listening to what the other side is saying.\r\n\r\nBefore looking at the film, a little background is necessary. On August 11, 2017, the white supremacist-organised Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia descended into violence when James Alex Fields Jr. drove a car into a group of counter-protestors, killing Heather Heyer and wounding eight others. Every major politician across both political parties in the US condemned the violence, placing blame solely on the rally \u2013 every major politician except one; the President. At an infamous press conference, Trump chose to spread the blame across both those at the rally and the counter-protestors, arguing that there were \"_very fine people on both sides._\" According to _The New York Times_, the decision to take this approach was Bannon's, and the following day, the NAACP issued a statement calling for Bannon's termination, citing him as \"_a well-known white supremacist_\" and \"_symbol of white nationalism_\". Less than a week later, Bannon was fired (although he has since claimed he had actually handed in a two-week resignation notice on August 4).\r\n\r\nBannon's first engagement in his post-White House career was championing Roy Moore in his victory over incumbent Senator Luther Strange in the Republican U.S. Senate primary in Alabama, despite Trump endorsing Strange. However, after nine women accused Moore of sexual assault and child molestation, he lost the December Senate election to Democrat Doug Jones. As the election was initially considered a sure-fire Republican victory, the incident seriously damaged Bannon's reputation as a political strategist. Worse was to follow. In January 2018, Michael Wolff's book _Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House_ was published, featuring numerous statements from Bannon criticising the Trump family, including calling Ivanka \"_as dumb as a brick_\", saying that the June 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort, and Russian agents was \"_treasonous_\", and speculating that Special Counsel Robert Mueller would make Trump Jr. \"_crack like an egg_\". He also intimated that Kushner was involved in money laundering. Trump reacted as he reacts to most adverse situations \u2013 he threw a tantrum, Tweeting that Bannon \"_cried when he got fired_\", and claiming in an official statement that Bannon \"_lost his mind_\" when he lost his White House job, also downplaying Bannon's role in the 2016 election, stating he was \"_a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination_\" and \"_he had very little to do with our historic victory_\". Bannon, for his part, refused to fire back, saying he still had \"_unwavering_\" support for Trump and that the \"_treasonous_\" comment was intended to refer only to Manafort.\r\n\r\nBannon subsequently went to Europe, where he spent the next seven months attempting to establish \"_a united populist agenda_\", aka The Movement. In the years previously, right-wing nationalist parties, almost all subscribing to either a hard or soft Euroscepticism, had already made significant inroads in places such as Austria (in the 2017 legislative election, the national conservative\/social conservative\/anti-immigration _Freiheitliche Partei \u00d6sterreichs_ formed a coalition goverment with the conservative\/Christian-democratic _\u00d6sterreichische Volkspartei_), Belgium (the far-right\/national and social conservative _Vlaams Belang_ currently lead the opposition), Denmark (the national and social conservative\/anti-Islam _Dansk Folkeparti_ has been the country's second largest party since 2015), Finland (until this year, there was a coalition between the national conservative\/economic liberalist _Sininen tulevaisuus_, the liberal conservative _Kansallinen Kokoomus_, and the agrarian\/liberal conservative _Suomen Keskusta_), France (the national and social conservative\/economic nationalist\/anti-immigration\/protectionist _Rassemblement national_ (formerly the _Front national_) is the largest right-wing political party on the continent and currently leads the opposition), Germany (in the 2017 federal election, the far-right _Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland_ became the first right-wing populist party in the country's history to win seats in the _Bundestag_, coming third on a platform of national and social conservatism, anti-immigration, anti-Islam, anti-feminism, and economic liberalism), Greece (in the 2015 legislative election, the national and social conservative _Anexartitoi Ellines_ formed a coalition with the economic nationalist\/democratic socialist _Synaspism\u00f3s Rizospastik\u00eds Arister\u00e1s_), Hungary (the 2010 parliamentary election saw a landslide victory for the national and social conservative\/anti-immigration\/Christian democratic _Fidesz_, who retained their supermajority in 2014 and again in 2018), Netherlands (the national liberalist\/anti-immigration\/anti-Islam _Partij voor de Vrijheid_ have led the opposition since 2017), Poland (the national and social conservative\/Christian-democratic\/economic nationalist _Prawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107_ have been in power since 2015), Switzerland (in the 2015 federal election, the national and social conservative\/economic liberalist\/anti-immigration\/isolationist Swiss People's Party received 29.4% of the vote, the highest ever recorded for a single party in Swiss history), and the United Kingdom (in 2016, the nationalist\/anti-Islam UK Independence Party successfully campaigned for the UK to leave the EU, and in the years since, the Conservative Party has seen numerous defections to UKIP. The recently elected Conservative Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, was also a major supporter of Brexit, and has close ties with former UKIP leader, and current Brexit Party leader, Nigel Farage). \r\n\r\nBannon returned to the US for the 2018 midterm elections in November, hoping that the Republicans would retain control of the House and the Senate. Although they held the Senate, they lost 41 seats in the House, losing control to the Democrats in an election which saw a sizable number of firsts for women and minorities, including the first gay governor (Jared Polis of Colorado), the first bisexual senator (Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona), and the first Muslim women (Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan) and Native American women (Sharice Davids of Kansas and Deb Haaland of New Mexico) elected to the House.\r\n\r\nSo much for background. Whereas Errol Morris's _American Dharma_, which made the rounds on the festival circuit in 2018 but has yet to be picked up for distribution in North America, is essentially an extended interview with Bannon, focusing on how he got to where he is, _The Brink_ is more concerned with what Bannon did after he was fired. The film begins in August 2017, a few weeks after he was let go as Chief Strategist, with Bannon, perhaps doing damage limitation, talking about how much he hated working at the White House. The film then traces his involvement with Moore, the reaction to _Fire and Fury_, the break with Trump, his time in Europe, and his campaigning during the 2018 midterms. Klayman focuses on his European activities, where his aim is nothing less than to unify and centralise the various right-wing populist groups under an overarching banner of national and social conservatism, anti-Islam, anti-immigration, counter-globalism, and Euroscepticism (although the film never addresses the inherent contradictions of a global movement built on counter-globalism or a centralised movement made up of groups whose main aims are nationalist). Ultimately, Bannon was hoping for a landslide right-wing victory in the 2019 European Parliamentary elections (although it's not covered in the film, he was partially successful \u2013 right-wing groups did make substantial gains compared to previous elections, although not quite to the degree he had hoped). Klayman accompanied Bannon for the duration of his European travels, embedding herself in his inner circle, where she was granted extraordinary access (partly because she didn't have a crew; it was just her and a camera). Upon his return to the US, she remained with him until just after the midterms.\r\n\r\nAs you would probably expect, Bannon is at pains throughout the film to stress that neither he nor Trump are racists, nor is he a white nationalist, although he does acknowledge that he's an \"_economic nationalist_\". In this vein, at a fundraiser early in the film, Bannon tells a group of Republicans that Trump doesn't care about skin colour, religion, or sexuality, he \"cares only that you're a citizen of the United States of America\". Seeing the film two days after Trump told three non-Caucasian American-born senators and one non-Caucasian naturalised American senator to \"_go back where you came from_\", the audience at the screening I attended had a good laugh at the unintended irony of Bannon's claim. And really, it's not hard to see why accusations of racism and white supremacy follow him around, as he spends his time in Europe meeting such controversial far-right figures as Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, Belgium's Filip Dewinter, Sweden's Kent Ekeroth, the UK's Nigel Farage, France's Marine Le Pen, Italy's Giorgia Meloni, Hungary's Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and the Netherlands' Geert Wilders, as well as conservative billionaires like Erik Prince and Guo Wengui. Somewhat amusingly, although we literally see him warmly meeting these people, when his connection to them is later questioned, he unashamedly uses the one-size-fits-all \"_we were just at the same dinner_\" defence.\r\n\r\nKlayman shoots the film in a _cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9_ fly-on-the-wall style, letting events play out without really commenting on them (although she does question Bannon directly a couple of times). And this non-intrusive style makes sense, allowing some of Bannon's more outrageous comments to speak for themselves, without the need for qualificatory commentary. For example, he tells Farage, \"_we're on the right side of history_\", referring to The Movement as \"_a global revolt_\"; at a rally in Hungary, he states that The Movement will be built on \"_old school Christian democracy rooted in the European tradition_\" (so plenty of room for Muslims); he asserts that \"_divine providence is about human action_\" (no, he doesn't seem aware of the oxymoron); he repeatedly claims that \"_hate is energising_\" and \"_hate is a motivator_\", seemingly proud of how politically divided society has become in the last few years; and in perhaps his most interesting, if perplexing, claim, he refers to China, Iran, and Turkey as the \"_new Axis_\".\r\n\r\nHis tendency to say abhorrent, but fascinating things is introduced in the opening scene. Telling Klayman about his visit to Auschwitz, he says that he found Auschwitz II-Birkenau more haunting than the more infamous Auschwitz I, and couldn't understand why until it was explained to him that whilst Auschwitz I was a converted army barracks, Birkenau was built from scratch specifically as a death camp. Imagining the designers working on the plans, he speculates that they must have \"_totally detached themselves from the moral horror of it_\". This, he goes on to say, is a reminder that \"_humans can do this - humans that are not devils, but humans that are just humans_\". Which is a pretty chilling thing for someone with the ear of the American President to say. Another scene sees him visiting Edgware Road, the so-called \"Arab street\" in London. Traditionally (going back at least 40 years), the Road has been the home of various Middle East businesses, which Bannon somehow manages to interpret as evidence of a \"_recent_\" turn to Islam in the city (parroting the opinion of that most odious of sub-humans Katie Hopkins, who was thoroughly embarrassed when she tried to make a racist point on Twitter concerning the Road, leading to a spike in people visiting the shops and restaurants).\r\n\r\nBannon's opinions on the mainstream media are also interesting, and on this particular point, I don't actually disagree with him. He believes that because trust in the media is at such a low ebb, the more obsessed they become with people like him, with right-wing policy in general, with criticising Trump, the better it is, as it simply drives their base further into their camp and gives them a free platform. This was seen especially clearly in the 2016 election when all the celebrity endorsements of Hilary Clinton and all the condemnations of Trump seemed only to galvanise his base, with the media inadvertently doing much of the ground-work for the very people they were speaking out against. Bannon himself seems to thrive on the outrage he can elicit from the left-wing media, relying on their emotionalism to trip them up. We do see him challenged a couple of times, but only a couple; Paul Lewis of _The Guardian_ has a contentious, although always polite, interview about whether or not some of his statements can be seen as incitements to racism, whilst Susanna Reid of _Good Morning Britain_ doesn't let him away with anything in relation to the Unite the Right rally (throughout the interview, Piers Morgan sits silently, happily dreaming about what hat to give Trump the next time they meet). There's also a great moment in Toronto when he is debating populism with David Frum, and he references the brilliance of Trump's Electoral College win in 2016, promtping the audience to burst out laughing, briefly throwing him off his game. \r\n\r\nIn terms of aesthetics, as mentioned, Klayman shoots the film in the style of _cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9_ and rarely comments on events directly. Her editing style, however, offers its own rejoinders to Bannon's claims. For example, she intercuts news reports on Cesar Sayoc (the Trump fan who sent pipe bombs to George Soros and various Democrats) and the Tree of Life synagogue shooting with Bannon arguing that he's not bigoted or racist, and simply wants to represent the ordinary working-class people (who, he claims at one point, almost universally support Trump). Later, she intercuts scenes of fascist rallies in Europe and migrants being attacked in Germany with Bannon's five-star hotel meetings with right-wing politicians, showing the practical trickle-down consequences of their ideology. In another scene, when he insists that he would never take any non-American money because he's too much of a patriot, Klayman immediately cuts to him meeting Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui, with whom he subsequently has a behind-closed-doors meeting. Perhaps most powerfully, however, after the disastrous 2018 midterms, over scenes of Bannon raging at his underlings and trying to figure out what could possibly have gone wrong, Klayman plays an audio montage of newly-elected Democrat women speaking about their policies and plans and condemning the kind of hatred upon which Bannon thrives.\r\n\r\nFor all that, however, I felt the film had some significant flaws. Klayman can certainly be commended insofar as she never crosses the line from depiction to endorsement. Her fly-on-the-wall approach, although it cedes the floor to Bannon, never affords him the opportunity of an uninterrupted formal platform, with the _verit\u00e9_ style working to expose the flaws, contradictions, falsehoods, and hatred in his ideology even as he espouses that same ideology. The problem is that Klayman assumes her audience is in complete and total agreement with her before she's even said anything \u2013 that Bannon is a dangerous purveyor of racial-based hatred and prejudice. Because of this, the documentary remains all surface; she doesn't offer a deep dive into his psychology because why would she when the audience already thinks the same way as her? So, there's a real lack of probing and interrogation. For example, his European tour could be interpreted as nothing more than a no longer relevant man fighting to avoid obscurity, and there are several times when this reading is crying out for attention. Klayman, however, never touches on it.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, it's hard to know what anyone will glean from the film. The very few on the right who see it, will read it as yet more evidence of a left-leaning elitist media determined to crush the right and run Trump out of office; those on the left will simply have their opinions about Bannon reaffirmed; and those in the middle will be unlikely to see it at all \u2013 an arthouse documentary about a political figure isn't exactly multiplex friendly. This is especially pronounced just after Bannon meets with members of the _Rassemblement national_ in Paris. Barely bothering to hide their white supremacist tendencies, after the meeting is over, Klayman asks \"_What did I just watch?_\" However, as Bannon is her only interviewee, he is allowed to downplay the meeting without really being called out, leaving the left to shake its head at his lies (\"_is he seriously trying to deny he just had a meeting with a bunch of neo-Nazis_\"), and the right to shake its head at the left over-reacting (\"_it was just a dinner guys, calm down_\").\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, it's kind of hard to pinpoint exactly what Klayman accomplishes with the film \u2013 it doesn't tell us anything about Bannon that you can't find online, and although it does give us access to his workaday world, it doesn't actually reveal much about his thought processes or private ideology. In the same sense, it isn't going to change anyone's way of thinking about him. So what was the point? Why give such a hateful and dangerous individual so much attention when you don't have anything in mind other than having your audience nod along with you? At best, the film seems to be suggesting that Bannon is a good example of the banality of evil \u2013 he's not an evil genius or a political mastermind, he's just a man who believes in hate. So, clearly, Klayman is trying to demystify him, painting him as kind of a slick used car salesman, successfully selling cars which he knows are defective. But really, did he need demystifying? How many people honestly thought he was anything special, or somehow more nefarious than we could ever have imagined? Additionally, at the end of over a year of spending every day with him, is the only thing that Klayman came away with that he is demonstrably human? That seems somewhat anticlimactic to say the least.\r\n\r\nThe film also makes some baffling decisions. For example, after the Roy Moore debacle, a subtitle tells us that Bannon was fired from _Breitbart_, kicked off his own radio show, and cut off by his billionaire donors Robert Mercer and Rebekah Mercer. However, if Klayman ever asked him about any of this, it doesn't make the final cut. Indeed, we learn next to nothing of his time at _Breitbart_, what kind of material he wrote, what he stood for, why he was so controversial, or why so many people argue that Andrew Breitbart himself would have hated what Bannon did to the site. On the other hand, we do get a scene where he is shown looking at old college photos and remarking on how handsome he used to be. Explosive stuff indeed.\r\n\r\n_The Brink_ is a perfectly watchable film, but so too is it perfectly forgettable, which, given the subject and the extraordinary access, is hugely disappointing, and must go down as a missed opportunity. Indeed, as the film ended, the only thought I really had in my head was \"_Bannon would have loved that_\". Which is not exactly a good thing.","id":"5d8bf9d2172d7f001f51394d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d8bf9d2172d7f001f51394d","movie_id":576334}

{"author":"Sheldon Nylander","content":"When a Chinese family finds out that the family\u2019s matriarch is dying of lung cancer, complications arise. In Chinese culture, there is a saying that when you get cancer, you die. This actually boils down to the belief that it\u2019s not the cancer that leads to the person\u2019s death, but rather the fear of dying. As such, the family orchestrates an elaborate ruse to get everyone together for a wedding, but in reality the gathering is for everyone to be able to say goodbye to the grandmother without actually letting her know the truth.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a fascinating premise and based on a true story (or based on an actual lie, as the film puts it). Showing aspects of Chinese culture we rarely get to see, the film takes us on a journey to China as we see modern life and urban development. How accurate it really is, I can\u2019t attest to, and there are times that it feels like there should be more or that something is more complex and we\u2019re being given the fortune cookie version, so to speak. The film does steer clear of politics, so that is not a factor here.\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful film not just through visual aesthetics but also on a character level. We see how each character faces the impending death of the grandmother differently, such as the daughter-in-law being very matter of fact about it while her husband (the grandmother\u2019s son) is being torn up inside, all while the wise and experienced grandmother continues to dispense advice, oblivious to her diagnosis. It details the variety of relationships we can develop in our life as no two relationships are the same, but they all still love each other despite some distance between certain relatives.

The film lends an insider\u2019s look at life in modern-day Saudi Arabia and the changing role of women in a country known for its restrictive gender customs.\r\n\r\nMaryam (Mila Al Zahrani) is an ambitious young doctor working in a small town medical clinic. She\u2019s well-educated and smart, yet she gets daily pushback from many of her male patients and has to work twice as hard to earn the respect of her male colleagues. After she is prevented from traveling to Dubai in search of a better job, a paperwork mix-up leads Maryam to become a candidate for her local city election. Since she wants to make her town a better place, including her major platform of getting the road to the hospital paved, Maryam and her sisters (Dae Al Hilali, Nora Al Awadh) begin planning fundraising and campaign events while their widowed musician father is away on tour. Her candidacy is as challenging as you\u2019d expect, but the woman never loses her sense of determination to move her traditional society forward.\r\n\r\nAl-Mansour\u2019s film, which she also co-wrote, is appropriately serious but filled with lighthearted moments. It\u2019s impossible not to root for Maryam to succeed when she\u2019s challenging the patriarchy of a society that continues to marginalize women. Saudi Arabia\u2019s customs still seem outdated and oppressive by most of the world\u2019s standards, but it\u2019s also sobering to realize that women in every corner of the planet can still face similar pushback when they\u2019re seen as trying to rock the boat.\r\n\r\nThis feature would\u2019ve worked much better as a short film, as it only becomes truly interesting once Maryam announces her candidacy. Everything else is painfully slow going up until that point, and the pacing is too sluggish. The story stalls even further with random, stagnant interludes that feature traditional music (be it a music lesson, a band concert, or a simple song shared between two sisters).\r\n\r\nIn the end, the film is inspirational and shows the ability we all have to change attitudes, one person at a time. A modest act of defiance may start on the local level, but those small steps eventually add up for the greater good.","id":"5e7d58c2f794ad0011ef3124","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e7d58c2f794ad0011ef3124","movie_id":618214}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Not a patch on_ Four Lions_, but you can never go too far wrong with Chris Morris_**\r\n\r\n>_Americans are always at the mercy of the evil doers everywhere, including those distinctly in our midst with mayhem in mind. Our military is an under financed wreck, our Navy practically a set of dinghies, a Muslim is even in the White House, a malign climate-change movement is eager to destroy capitalism as we know it, women's bodies are enough of a danger to shut the government down, immigrants are potential terrorists or rapists, and so on and so forth through a litany of strangely woven fantasies a__nd factoids._\r\n\r\n>[...]\r\n\r\n>_In this context, while the US military pursues its failing wars, interventions, and raids abroad, while the national security state develops ever more mechanisms for snooping, surveilling, and controlling populaces at home (as in the recent essentially unprecedented security lockdowns of major American cities \"for\" the pope), many of the country's citizens are increasingly living inside a fact-challenged fantasy of a country, a victimized superpower. Boogiemen lurk around every corner, as do high crimes and dark conspiracies, and any sense of responsibility for what the United States has done in the world in these last years is missing in action._\r\n\r\n- Tom Engelhardt; \"The Most Exceptional Thing About America Is Our Paranoia\"; _The Nation_ (September 29, 2015)\r\n\r\n> _It sort of works like this \u2013 you're freaked out by 9\/11, you have to cover yourself because you're implicated in some of the sloppy procedures that led to 9\/11, so you talk the threat up, you say there's a sleeper cell in every city and then you go and find it. Now, you don't know what you're looking for, and classically in the FBI, you talk about other people, the Other, you look at brown and black people because they are more likely, you think, to be a problem. And if somebody sticks their head up in one of those communities, then you surround them with 'false friends', informants who will offer them money and friendship to try to lure them along a carefully scripted program of self-incrimination, which results in that person going to jail. And you'll say to the court, as a prosecutor, \"_is it better that this person go to jail, or should we let them back out on the streets?\" And the juries always say, \"better put them in jail_.\"_\r\n\r\n>[...]\r\n\r\n>_In real life, what happened was there was a story on British TV news about supposedly the biggest plot since 9\/11, about an army planning to launch a full ground war on the US, based in Miami. And it turned out, three years later I bumped into somebody involved with the trial, who said that ground war was actually seven construction workers who were going to ride into Chicago on horses \u2013 this was not a really serious terrorist plot. They had just been wound up by an FBI informant. They had no money, and the informant was offering a lot of cash and so they riffed a crazy scheme to try to get this guy to give them money. So that true story, along with loads of others, informs the story which is in the film, and in that case, in the Liberty City Seven case, six out of seven of them were Haitian Catholics._\r\n\r\n- Chris Morris; _Channel 4 News_ (October 2, 2019)\r\n\r\nIt can't be easy to write effective political satire at a time when the headlines of _The Onion_ and _Waterford Whispers_ don't read that differently from the headlines of _The New York Times_ and _The Guardian_. Truly, we are in an epoch where many public figures have become the satirical apotheoses of themselves, making it difficult to satirise either them or the institutions that enable them. Difficult, but not impossible, certainly not for a satirist as talented as the legendary Chris Morris (_The Day Today_; _Brass Eye_; _Nathan Barley_; _Four Lions_), who was pedalling 'fake news' long before Donald Trump decided to destabilise the entire geopolitical sphere, all the while claiming he won the popular and that the people of France were chanting his name during protests against Emmanuel Macron.\r\n\r\nWritten by Morris and Jesse Armstrong and directed by Morris, _The Day Shall Come_ is inspired by real-life incidents such as the Liberty City Seven and the Newburgh Sting, and aims its satirical ire at the FBI and how they conduct themselves in relation to terrorist cells within the US. And as one would expect from Morris, it's darkly comic until it turns deadly series, a transition that drives home the concept that, yes, what the FBI is doing is farcical and satire-worthy, but so too is it destroying lives, and that isn't especially funny. It's a very delicate balancing act, but Morris pulls it off for the most part. As politicians, journalists, and law enforcement scramble to turn the entire planet into a Harold Pinter play, Morris's is a voice that deserves to be heard, and although _The Day Shall Come_ isn't a patch on the superb _Four Lions_, it's still a bitingly funny study of institutionalised paranoia, garnished with some good old-fashioned racism.\r\n\r\nMiami, FL; poverty, racial disparity, and gentrification have created an underlying tension in the city, as the gap between rich and poor continues to widen. Moses Al Shabaz (a superb debut performance from March\u00e1nt Davis) is a self-proclaimed preacher and the leader of Star of Six, a revolutionary group that worships Allah, \"Black Santa\", and Toussaint L'Ouverture, and that aims to overthrow the \"_accidental dominance of the white people_\". However, there are significant problems; Moses and his wife Venus (the always eye-catching Danielle Brooks) are close to being evicted, Star of Six has no money and only four members, and Moses refuses to use guns. He also has mental health problems, and his plan to overthrow white dominance is to call upon the dinosaurs held in stasis by the CIA. When he doesn't take his medication, he's also prone to hallucinations \u2013 evidenced insofar as he's convinced that his horse can talk and that both God and Satan are speaking to him through a duck. However, despite having the \"_threat signature of a hot dog_\", Star of Six end up on the FBI radar, monitored by the idealistic Agent Kendra Glack (Anna Kendricks). With Glack's superior, Agent Andy Mudd (the always fantastic Denis O'Hare), determined to uncover \"_the next 9\/11_\", he orders Glack to find evidence that Star of Six is engaged in terrorist activity, and if no such evidence exists, then she should fabricate some, because it's easier to manufacture a fake terrorist than it is to find a real one. And so begins a farcical series of events, involving an air horn, a sheikh affiliated with al-Qaeda, a group of Neo-Nazis, weapon-grade uranium, ray-guns, a lot of beans and urine, a nuclear emergency in Miami, another nuclear emergency in Miami, a donut shop, a toy crossbow, and a rocket launcher.\r\n\r\n_The Day Shall Come_ was inspired by real-life incidents such as the Liberty City Seven (where seven men were convicted of terrorist activities after a sting operation in which the FBI persuaded them to begin planning for an attack on Chicago) and the Newburgh Sting (where the FBI manipulated four Muslims to become more militant, with the aim of shooting down American aircraft flying out of Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, NY. All four were convicted of terrorist activity). After the initial arrest of the Liberty City Seven, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales announced that the group, who called themselves the Universal Divine Saviors, were jihadi terrorists who had been preparing for \"_a full ground war against the United States_\". His comments, however, weren't even a little accurate. In actual fact, the Saviors planned to ride into Chicago on horseback, meeting any resistance by charging at them cavalry-style. They also planned to blow up Willis Tower, which would fall into nearby Lake Michigan, with the resulting tidal wave flooding the city. So, you know, very practical stuff. Morris heard about the case and Gonzales's claims in a UK news report, and three years later, he met someone who'd been involved with the Saviors' trial. This person told him the truth about the case \u2013 that the people supposedly planning \"_a full ground war_\" were a group of seven unemployed construction workers, who had been offered $50,000 by an FBI informant to begin planning for an attack on Chicago. As they were broke, they accepted the cash, subsequently riffing ideas until they came up with their Willis Tower ideas. Additionally, despite Gonzalez intimating that the Savors were jihadis, they were, in fact, Haitian Catholics. As Morris began to research, he learned that such absurdities were not confined to the Liberty City Seven case. Straying dangerously close to entrapment, since 9\/11 it had become standard operating procedure for FBI informants to actively encourage persons of interest to engage in terrorist activities. And when they do, the FBI arrest them. This utterly insane manner of business forms the spine of the film.\r\n\r\nLike most of Morris's work, _The Day Shall Come_ is a Juvenalian satire. Is it as funny as _Four Lions_? No. Is it as funny as _The Day Today_ or _Brass Eye_? God in heaven, no (what is?). However, you simply can't go too wrong with Chris Morris, and there are plenty of laughs to be found here. For example, there's the terror suspect who an FBI informant is trying to get to dial a number to detonate a nearby bomb, but who refuses to press the number five, proclaiming, \"_I'm scared of fives. Five is evil_\", to which Mudd, who's listening in on the conversation, reacts by screaming, \"_did we know he was a pentaphobe?_\" Because that's a thing.\r\nEspecially funny is the exchange between Mudd and Glack as Mudd explains that to diffuse the nuclear emergency declared by the Miami PD, she must also declare a nuclear emergency;\r\n\r\n> **Glack**: _What do you need from me, sir?_\r\n\r\n>**Mudd**: _Right, well, we know this emergency is groundless._\r\n\r\n>**Glack**: _Correct. Right._\r\n\r\n>**Mudd**: _But the emergency exists. And you can't take control of something if you're saying it doesn't exist._\r\n\r\n>**Glack**: _Okay._\r\n\r\n>**Mudd**: _So we have to acknowledge that the emergency exists._\r\n\r\n>**Glack**: _Eh...yeah, well, no. Sorry, if we say, \"Yes, it exists\" isn't that the same as declaring a nuclear emergency ourselves?_\r\n\r\n>**Mudd**: _Technically yourself, but, yeah._\r\n\r\n>**Glack**: _So...to stop a nuclear emergency I have to declare a nuclear emergency?_\r\n\r\n>**Mudd**: _Yes. The logic only works if you say it slowly. Keep the contradictory elements apart._\r\n\r\n>**Glack**: _I'd look insane._\r\n\r\n>**Mudd**: _Only if you say it fast._\r\n\r\nThis exchange is a pretty good example of the type of comedy featured throughout the film, layering the ridiculous on top of the farcical. There's also a very definitive Armando Iannucci vibe, recalling some of the more irreverent conversations in _In the Loop_ (2009) and the criminally underrated _The Death of Stalin_ (2017). This shouldn't come as a surprise given that Iannucci co-created _The Day Today_ with Morris (amongst others) and the two also worked together on Veep.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, Miami Chief of Police Settmonk (James Adomian) gives us another good example of Morris's use of absurdity when he argues, \"_unarmed white man, unarmed black man. Which one is more likely to have the gun?_\", a line that's hilarious on its own, but profoundly troubling when applied to a real-world context (as all good satire should be). Another line worth mentioning is when Mudd and Glack are debating the merits of what they're doing \u2013 Glack feels they're straying perilously close to entrapment, but Mudd argues that they have to employ such extreme measures, or their entire way of life would be in jeopardy and \"_the next thing you know, the Statue of Liberty's wearing a burqa and we've beheaded Bruce Springsteen._\" Again, a funny line, but given the irrational hysteria and baseless paranoia that forms the basis of how so many Americans feel about Muslims, once again, we can see Morris alluding to very troubling aspects of the American psyche without coming right out and saying, \"_you guys are nuts._\"\r\n\r\nOn the film's official website, Morris writes, \"The Day Shall Come _reflects how institutionalised paranoia corrupts our thinking._\" The line about the Statue of Liberty is a good example of this, but the theme is peppered throughout the film, with no less than five references to a \"_black jihad_\" (a concept that seems laughable to sane ears, but is not so far-fetched when one realises that 31% of Americans believe a race war is imminent). However, despite the heavyweight theme, Morris never allows the film to become didactic \u2013 the truths he espouses are always subtly layered with the comedy beats. Again, the Statue of Liberty line is a good example, as is the \"_unarmed black man_\" line \u2013 lines in which Morris is addressing hugely important issues, but without ever giving the impression of talking down to the audience; he's certainly being irreverent and sarcastic, but at no point does he become condescending or patronising. This is a very difficult line to walk, but anyone familiar with _The Day Today_ or _Brass Eye_ will recognise Morris's ability to viciously critique social ills without sounding preachy. Indeed, towards the end of the film (and like _Four Lions_, _The Day Shall Come_ gets extremely dark and devastatingly serious as it approaches its _d\u00e9nouement_), Morris distils everything down to a very simple maxim \u2013 the conduct of the FBI may be absurd, but it has a very real human cost. Yes, we can (and probably should) laugh at the bureaucratic nonsense, general ineptitude, and shocking amorality, but that does not imply we should laugh at the results. The FBI's operational norms may be the stuff of farce, but those farcical norms are putting real people (who are almost exclusively poor and black or brown) in jail for a very long time. Which turns out to be a not especially funny punchline.\r\n\r\n_The Day Shall Come_ isn't Morris's best, but it is still Chris Morris, and so it deserves attention. Irreverent, sarcastic, condemnatory, and politically incendiary, the film posits that the FBI is doing more harm than good as they target poor communities in the hopes of finding someone (anyone) planning the next 9\/11. And if they can't find someone, they'll create that someone themselves. All in the name of good optics. As funny as it is, the film is also bracing and, by the time the end credits roll, sobering. And perhaps Morris's greatest achievement here is to present something comical to the audience, encourage us to laugh at it, and then pull the rug out from under us, showing us that it may not have been all that funny to begin with.","id":"5dba3c0edbf144001150a0b0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dba3c0edbf144001150a0b0","movie_id":492190}

The pacing allows for the setting and the mood to breathe, and the cinematography showcases the Texas backdrop beautifully.  The direction and acting allow the sparse humorous moments to be all that more impactful, as well as the more dramatic moments.  A bar fight in any other movie would be commonplace.  When one of the few moments of violence in this film happens, it hits like a freight train... not because of the scale, but because of the audience's empathy for the lead character by that point.  The score is also noteworthy, perfectly complementing the reflective nature of the film and its characters.

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***One of the most entertaining music biopics ever made (but also nastiest)***  \r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2019, \"The Dirt\" is a biography of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce from their inception in the early 80s to the mid-90s. Along with GnR, the band was the cream of the crop of 80\u2019s hair metal. They were notorious for their childish, debauched antics and the movie depicts this from the get-go with an off-putting bit o\u2019 raunch at a party. There\u2019s also an amusing pool sequence that gets pretty repellent with Ozzy pathetically trying to prove how \u201ccrazy\u201d he was (I heard the curious story long ago so I was prepared for it).\r\n\r\nIf you can handle that, this is one of the best band biopics in cinema; and more so if you favor Cr\u00fce\u2019s music. The movie has a sense of humor and includes a little parody; it\u2019s fun, dynamic, stirring and sometimes vile, but also dramatic and even moving, especially in the last act. A plus is that most of the characters have a story arc wherein they learn from their misdeeds and mature. \r\n\r\nThe flick was based on drummer Tommy Lee\u2019s autobiography \u201cThe Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band,\u201d as well as the biographies of other band members & Co. So, while there\u2019s an over-the-top feel here and there, the events really happened with minor alterations for dramatic effect.\r\n\r\nThe best way to rate a biopic is to compare it to others, including fictional ones loosely based on real-life characters, like \u201cRock Star\u201d (2001) and \u201cThe Rose\u201d (1979). As decent as those two are, \u201cThe Dirt\u201d is all-around more entertaining. It\u2019s also superior to \u201cWalk the Line\u201d (2005), the slanderous \u201cThe Doors\u201d (1991), the underrated \u201cThe Perfect Age of Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll\u201d (2009), \"Eddie and the Cruisers\u201d (1983) and \"The Runaways\" (2010). I\u2019d put it on par with \u201cCoal Miner\u2019s Daughter\u201d (1980), but it\u2019s very different because the style of music and subculture is so radically different. Content-wise, it\u2019s closest to \u201cRock Star,\u201d \"The Runaways\" and \u201cThe Perfect Age of Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll,\u201d but funner than the brooding latter.\r\n\r\nDouglas Booth is convincing as Nikki Sixx, the band leader\/bassist\/composer and so is Machine Gun Kelly as the hyperactive, but genial Tommy Lee. Iwan Rheon is also effective as the more mature and subdued guitarist Mick Mars. Daniel Webber unfortunately lacks the looks of singer Vince Neil, but is otherwise effective.    \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 47 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles and New Orleans.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A","id":"5c96824c9251416b36f36866","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c96824c9251416b36f36866","movie_id":327331}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps:\/\/www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nAs you probably know by now, I'm a huge horror fan. An outstanding horror movie is almost always one of the best films of the year for me. I find it frustrating that so many people don't value this genre as much as the others, especially since the general public usually tends to like the more generic narratives, filled with predictable jump scares, and dull stories. Nothing against that, obviously, anyone can like whatever they want! However, when comparing with other genres, horror feels like an outsider, only truly followed by a specific group of people, even though it's been admittedly growing in the last few years.\r\n\r\nI didn't expect much from The Lodge, which probably helped me enjoy it as much as I did since it's one of the favorite movies of 2020 so far. It's undoubtedly the least formulaic horror flick in quite a while. It features ingredients that, however, audiences are not that fond of: visual storytelling, slow pace, and almost zero jump scares. The first is incredibly captivating not only due to the clever framing and mise-en-sc\u00e8ne but also because the dark atmosphere fills the house in a very ominous manner. Its lack of dialogue throughout the runtime might be a no-go for some people, but I love when films \"show, don't tell\".\r\n\r\nThe purposefully slow pace is very well-balanced. With the exception of a short period during the second act, where nothing really happens (no new information about story or characters is given to the viewer), every other scene is meaningful either to develop characters or forward the story. The screenplay is structured in a way that never stops being entertaining: something impactful occurs, characters react to it, something important is discovered, and so on. Between the events, the atmosphere never stops being creepy, and the minimal (but efficient) dialogue is remarkably intriguing.\r\n\r\nIt's a movie that undoubtedly gains a lot from its notable technical attributes. From the astonishing cinematography (Thimios Bakatakis, who has worked with Yorgos Lanthimos in four films) to the exceptional production design, this one-location movie offers a claustrophobic environment elevated by brilliant performances. Riley Keough delivers one of the best performances I've seen from her, creating that perfect balance that makes the viewer question if her character is sane or crazy. The mystery surrounding Grace is partially due to Riley's fantastic interpretation.\r\n\r\nJaeden Martell is really good, and I'm happy that he continues to get great projects to be part of. However, Lia McHugh is the undeniable standout, in my opinion. With just twelve-years-old, Lia gives such a phenomenal display. Her last scene of the film, which she shares with Jaeden, is award-worthy. Both are mind-blowingly compelling during that moment. Impressive performances across the board.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I do have a few issues regarding the characters. Grace's past is the biggest question mark of the story, and it's left unsatisfyingly ambiguous. The Lodge relies a lot on its visual storytelling, something I absolutely love, but in this particular aspect, I believe a more explicit explanation would have helped the viewer better understand Grace's development. My other problem is related to the kids' motivations, but I have to be very vague due to possible spoilers.\r\n\r\nBasically, their actions throughout the movie are justified by something that, while I can partially understand where they're coming from, I can't honestly believe that young children would be able to even think about it, let alone actually doing it seamlessly. This last sentence is the best I can do to describe my issue with these characters. In the end, I have some problems with the characters, but the story boasts some genuinely shocking moments (the first act is brilliant), and an extremely impactful, bold ending.\r\n\r\nThe Lodge is one of my favorite films of 2020 so far. However, it possesses features that usually don't conquer the general public. For some people, its visual storytelling might be too ambiguous, its slow pace might be too boring, and the lack of jump scares might cause damage entertainment-wise. Fortunately, I love every single one of these aspects. This atmospheric horror flick is elevated by its outstanding technical attributes, especially Thimios Bakatakis' bizarre cinematography, as well as the claustrophobic production design. Boasting an impressive lead performance from Riley Keough and incredible displays from Jaeden Martell and Lia McHugh (standout with just twelve-years-old), the Austrian directing duo (Severin Fiala, Veronika Franz) delivers one of the least generic horror movies in quite some time. Still, the three main characters deserved better development and more transparent motivations. I recommend it for true horror fans, but if you prefer a more \"active\" horror flick (and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that), maybe it's better to skip this one.\r\n\r\nRating: A-","id":"5eb71beebbe1dd0020817a0d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5eb71beebbe1dd0020817a0d","movie_id":474764}

It's not agitprop. It definitely has a sociopolitical thread in it, which is reflective and therefore dark. But hey, everyone, wake up! We're in the sixth mass extinction on this planet. To not have that darkness would have been a little superficial. There is a sadness in human behaviour for me, and zombies are the most obvious metaphor you could employ. We were also trying to make a kind of extension or homage to George Romero because of his postmodern reinvention of zombies, and those sociopolitical threads are evident in his films. Romero does a lot of fascinating things. The zombies are monsters, but they're not Godzilla. They don't come from outside the social order. They come from within a collapsing social order. They're us, or any of us who have died, so they are also victims because they don't choose to be undead. It's because of some stupid shit humans did that caused them to become undead. The problems of mass consumerism, the things that are woven into Romero's films, have only gotten worse. They haven't changed. We're at a crisis because of what his films were warning. And now we're at the endgame of that. What is more terrifying than having 1 million species going extinct in the last decade?_\r\n\r\n- Jim Jarmusch; \"Jim Jarmusch Believes in the Teens, But Not Joe Biden\" (Bilge Ebiri); _Vulture_ (June 17, 2019)\r\n\r\n_The Dead Don't Die_ is such an unexpected film that when the trailer first dropped, a lot of people assumed it to be a joke of some kind; that the film purportedly being advertised couldn't possibly be real. And there's a good reason for that, as who could have predicted that celebrated indie writer\/director Jim Jarmusch would have any interest in making an ensemble zombie comedy? Well, the thing about that is that, as it turns out, he doesn't. Jarmusch has certainly made genre films in the past \u2013 _Down By Law_ (1986) is a prison break film, _Dead Man_ (1995) is a western, _Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai_ (1999) is a samurai film, _The Limits of Control_ (2009) is the story of an assassin, _Only Lovers Left Alive _(2013) is about vampires. Usually, he is exceptionally successful at grafting his worldview onto the generic tropes, often to such an extent that it can be difficult to separate the two \u2013 these films are undeniably genre pieces, but so too are they undeniably Jim Jarmusch films. With _The Dead Don't Die_, however, he's not quite as successful; this is very much a Jarmusch film before it's a zombie movie, with these two components often rubbing awkwardly up against one another.\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly chosen as the opening film at Cannes 2019, the film has met with mixed responses from both critics and audiences, and it's not hard to see why \u2013 glib socio-political commentary is introduced without really going anywhere; heavily promoted performers have nothing more than one or two-scene cameos; some of the characters know they're in a movie, even referring to Jarmusch himself, whilst others do not; a lot of the humour is of the flippant self-congratulatory kind; things become very preachy towards the end as Jarmusch abandons all semblance of narrative progression and shifts gears into a pseudo-TED talk. However, for all that, I enjoyed it. A zombie apocalypse movie set very much in Trump's America, it embraces all the weirdness that such a scenario suggests; the awkward humour works well for the most part, the meta elements are intriguing but not too distracting, and as for the didacticism? Well, nothing that Jarmusch says is incorrect; we _are_ a culture ruled by materialism and we _are_ sticking our collective heads in the sand regarding the fact that we're destroying the only home we have. So it might be inelegant (and Jarmusch has never been a satirist of Swiftian pedigree), but it's not wrong.\r\n\r\nSet in the fictional town of Centerville (pop. 738), the film begins as Chief Cliff Robertson (Bill Murray) and Officer Ronnie Peterson (Adam Driver) are following up a complaint from farmer Frank Miller (Steve Buscemi), who claims that a local vagrant, Hermit Bob (Tom Waits), has stolen one of his chickens. Issuing Bob with a warning, the duo are returning to the station when they realise that despite it being 8pm, the sun is still shining brightly, also noticing that their watches have stopped and they can't get any signal on their phones. Meanwhile, at the local diner, Frank and hardware store owner Hank Thompson (Danny Glover) watch a news report about recent \"polar fracking\", which some believe has knocked the earth off its axis. Returning to the police station, Cliff and Ronnie discuss the situation with Officer Mindy Morrison (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny), also talking about the town's strange new undertaker, Zelda Winston (Tilda Swinton), a white-haired Scottish woman with a collection of samurai swords and a statue of Buddha. Ronnie and Mindy head home for the night, leaving Cliff with the body of Mallory O'Brien (Carol Kane), a local drunk who recently died. As the sun finally sets on Centerville, however, two zombies (Sara Driver and Iggy Pop) rise from the dead and set out in pursuit of the one thing all zombies crave...eh, coffee. \r\n\r\nVery much an ensemble piece, aside from the above characters, we're also introduced to a litany of additional Centerville residents - diner waitress Fern (Eszter Balint); detainees at a juvenile detention facility Stella (Maya Delmont), Olivia (Taliyah Whitaker), and Geronimo (Jahi Di'Allo Winston); gas station owner Bobby Wiggins (Caleb Landry Jones); delivery man Dean (RZA); motel owner Danny Perkins (Larry Fessenden); journalist Posie Juarez (Rosie Perez); cleaner Lily (Rosal Colon); and out-of-towners Zoe (Selena Gomez), Jack (Austin Butler) and Zack (Luka Sabbat).\r\n\r\nIf _The Dead Don't Die_ has a salient theme, it's apathy, suggesting that humanity is sleepwalking its way towards its own extinction. The zombie apocalypse is depicted as initially slow and distant, not something about which to be overly concerned, until, without us realising how it has happened, there's no escape or chance of salvation. In this sense, Jarmusch uses zombies as double signifiers \u2013 they not only represent the apocalypse towards which we are moving, they also represent us, indifferently shuffling our way to an oblivion we know is coming, but which we choose to ignore (at one point, Cliff literally falls into an open grave because he isn't looking where he's going). Targeting rampant materialism, capitalist greed, and moral idiocy in elected officials, the film does provide a narrative explanation for why the dead are rising from the grave (the oft-discussed polar fracking), but really, Jarmusch isn't as interested in the \"why\" as he is in the \"how\", castigating a moribund and materialist society which has become blind to everything but trivial consumerist gratification.\r\n\r\nIn short, Jarmusch is suggesting that as a society, we've become zombified; lazy, instinctual, addicted to things that don't matter (whilst the first zombies we meet want coffee, others are on the hunt for WiFi, Siri, Chardonnay, Xanax, and \"Fashion\"). Indeed, in this sense, one of the film's more subtle (and interesting) points is that the best way to remain outside such societal calcification is to avoid conformism and remain on the edges of the social contract \u2013 the characters who do best against the zombies are the socially ostracised Zelda, the three kids in the detention centre, and the philosophical Hermit Bob, who suggests that \"_hunger for more stuff_\" has become society's primary motivator. Indeed, the way most of the characters react to the zombies is itself part of the critique \u2013 the vast majority respond in a blas\u00e9 manner, suggesting that in these insane times, when so many people are falling all over themselves to normalise the rantings of the racist, misogynistic, incoherent manchild in the Oval Office, even something like the dead rising from the ground is no big deal.\r\n\r\nOf course, using zombies as vehicles for social satire isn't exactly new; George A. Romero did it as far back as _Night of the Living Dead_ (1968), which is more about endemic racism than zombies. He did it to even greater effect in _Dawn of the Dead_ (1978), where he targeted materialistic vapidity. Later, he looked at issues such as Reagan-era militarism in _Day of the Dead_ (1985), economic disparity in _Land of the Dead_ (2005), media impartiality in _Diary of the Dead_ (2007), and tribalism in _Survival of the Dead_ (2009). In this tradition, _The Dead Don't Die_ has its eye very much on the climate change-denying administration in Washington; Frank is introduced wearing a MAGA-style baseball cap with a \"Keep America White Again\" logo, whilst his dog is called Rumsfeld. Indeed, Centerville itself is very much a quintessential Heartland town, the kind where Trump so successfully mobilised his blue collar base. And whilst it remains a comedy, much of what _The Dead Don't Die_ says is deadly serious \u2013 the current xenophobic American government is incompetent to an almost surrealistic degree; facts are no longer considered irrefutable, vying for space with blatant lies, amidst paranoid accusations of \"Fake News\"; the planet _is_ dying; the polar ice caps _are_ melting, and with them, the future of our species; universal scientific guarantees of impending extinction _are_ largely ignored, whilst the idiots in power discard the warnings of their own people, strip away environmental protections, and continually confuse weather and climate.\r\n\r\nOne element of the film that's especially interesting is the Pirandellian self-reflexivity, with some of the characters aware that they're in a movie, but the rest seemingly oblivious. For example, the opening credits are scored to Sturgill Simpson's \"The Dead Don't Die\", and only a few minutes later, the song begins playing on the radio in Cliff and Ronnie's car. When Cliff asks why the song sounds so familiar, Ronnie explains that it's probably because \"_it's the theme song_\". In another scene, Ronnie is shown wearing a _Star Wars_ key-ring, alluding to his portrayal of Kylo Ren in that franchise. Later, after Ronnie has declared about a million times that \"_this isn't going to end well_\", an exasperated Cliff asks him how he can be so certain, and Ronnie says it's because he's read the script. This upsets Cliff because he was only allowed to read the scenes in which he appeared, prompting him to complain that he's helped \"Jim\" out many times in the past and this is the thanks he gets. A few minutes later, when something especially bizarre happens with Zelda (like, really bizarre), an incredulous Cliff asks Ronnie \"_was that in the script?_\" (according to Ronnie, it was not). And the point of all this self-reflexivity? Honestly, I'm not entirely sure. The fact that only Cliff and Ronnie seem to know they're in a movie is, in and of itself, a little strange, and the fact that it only comes up a few times means that it never really gels as a motif. If I was to guess, I'd say that Jarmusch may be using it in the Brechtian sense to ensure the audience remains a consciously critical observer, more engaged with the narrative on an intellectual level than an emotional level.\r\n\r\nFor all its positives, however, the film does have some problems. For one thing, the last ten minutes or so will irritate a lot of people, as Jarmusch abandons all semblance of narrative, and gives us a scene over which Hermit Bob delivers a dire assessment of who we are as a species. It's very preachy, it's very didactic, and it will rub some people up the wrong way. Another issue is the humour, which is best described as Jarmuschian \u2013 all awkward stilted dialogue, deadpan one-liners, people repeating things other people have said, and subtle winking at the audience. It definitely isn't the kind of broad stroke humour one finds in zombie comedies such as Edgar Wright's _Shaun of the Dead_ (2004) or Ruben Fleischer's _Zombieland_ (2009). Some of the political themes are also underexplored. For example, Frank's MAGA hat is a pointed critique of Trump and those who blindly vote for him and excuse his behaviour, but to what end? Aside from introducing the hat, Jarmusch doesn't really say anything more on the subject. The trio of kids from the detention centre are also introduced as if they will be major players, but they're gradually forgotten about, and ultimately don't play much of a role the story. Also, as Jarmusch himself is well aware, the film isn't really saying anything that Romero hasn't already said.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I enjoyed _The Dead Don't Die_. It's certainly nowhere near Jarmusch's best, and I can totally understand people who dislike it; a lot of the themes have been explored before, a lot of the jokes have been made before, and the film ends up as neither a terrifying thriller nor a self-conscious meta-comedy, instead occupying a strange middle ground between the two. In this sense, it doesn't do a huge amount to stand out in a crowded field. Having said that, however, the socio-political commentary is undeniably relevant and the cast is universally impressive. And ultimately, you may have a problem with the cynical manner with which the film communicates its message, but that doesn't alter the fact that that message is absolutely legitimate.","id":"5d89529d79b3d4001782e01d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d89529d79b3d4001782e01d","movie_id":535581}

If nothing else, this film makes it abundantly clear that Disney has no interest in making great cinema or honouring its own legacy. They don\u2019t care whether the film is good or whether you enjoy it. All they care about is using nostalgia to trick you into buying your ticket so they can make as much money off you as they can, and maybe if they throw some recognisable iconic moments from your childhood on the screen, they may even be able to fool you into thinking you\u2019d had a good time. \u2018The Lion King\u2019 is the ultimate diabolical apex of the commercialisation of nostalgia, and its inevitable box office success will just prove how easily we continue to be duped and how thoroughly they have trained us to not care about the quality of what we see.

Not his relationship with C. S. Lewis. Not even about going to codebreaking school.

{"author":"Sheldon Nylander","content":"Since I already knew that I wouldn\u2019t be seeing \u201cJoker\u201d on opening weekend, I figured I could watch a documentary about a real-life creepy clown opening opposite. It doesn\u2019t disappoint, although at the same time it might not be entirely what you expected. It\u2019s very difficult to fully analyze this film without talking spoilers, but I\u2019m going to try.\r\n\r\nDo you remember all the real-life creepy clown sightings that were reported a little while ago? This film argues that they were inspired by the legend of Wrinkles the Clown, which is where this film becomes relevant and (sort of) timely.\r\n\r\n\u201cWrinkles the Clown\u201d follows the exploits of a real-life urban legend. Wrinkles is a guy in a creepy clown costume who lives in Florida and hires himself out to scare children. Parents call him to scare their misbehaving children straight, threatening them that if they don\u2019t start behaving that Wrinkles will come and get them. What started as a guy finding something to do turned into a viral phenomenon after a video of him hiding under a little girl\u2019s bed. It takes off from there. He\u2019s become a hero to some, a villain to others, and gets compared to other viral legends like Slenderman.\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t give too much away, but there\u2019s a twist to the story about two-thirds of the way through that adds a whole new dimension to the story, but at the same time does feel a bit like they may have been trolling the audience through the first part of the film, which while being part of the point, may still put some people off and likely result in some hate. At the same time, it was pretty clear that this was where it was going if you just do a little research.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not quite as in depth as some might like. There\u2019s some touches on the history of clowning, why we react to them the way we do, and some interviews with psychologists and other clowns critical of Wrinkles activity. There\u2019s also some short profiles of kids who are fans of Wrinkles. I think we might want to keep an eye on those kids. It gets deeper in the final third of the movie after the aforementioned twist, which causes the audience to turn a mirror on themselves and their preconceptions. It\u2019s actually a great look at how urban legends take off and inspire others in unexpected ways. Worth a watch.","id":"5d9a5ef181a7fc0010c5907f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d9a5ef181a7fc0010c5907f","movie_id":619262}

Every time I didn\u2019t think the film could possibly get any better, C\u00e9line Sciamma elevated it to even greater, more incomprehensible heights, culminating in one of the most extraordinary moments in 21st-century cinema. This is a rare and precious film, breathtaking in its craft and intensely honest in its passions. This is a film that aches, that longs, that dances in ecstasy and raises its hands to the sky, angelic and ferocious and perfect.

{"author":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","content":"C\u00e9line Sciamma, writer and director of \u201cPortrait of a Lady on Fire,\u201d calls her period film a \u201cmanifesto on the male gaze.\u201d This is the most accurate, elegant description of her story of a romance between two French women in the late 1700s. This is an impeccably detailed, beautifully acted, refined drama with a strong feminist angle that\u2019s as stirring as it is thought-provoking.\r\n\r\nMarianne (No\u00e9mie Merlant) is commissioned to paint the wedding portrait of H\u00e9lo\u00efse (Ad\u00e8le Haenel), a young woman who has just left the convent. Because H\u00e9lo\u00efse is a very reluctant bride-to-be, Marianne arrives under the guise of companionship, observing the smallest of details about the woman by day and secretly painting her by firelight at night. As the two women spend their days with one another, intimacy and attraction grow, and the portrait becomes a symbol of the intensity of their love.\r\n\r\nThe lead performances are mannered and structured in the most effective way. The strong desire between the two women is manifested in a gaze or careful examination of a wisp of hair or the way H\u00e9lo\u00efse crosses her hands. There\u2019s a quiet intensity to the emotional and physical intimacy between these two women, making this love story\u2019s end feel all the more heartbreaking.\r\n\r\nThis is mostly an all-female film, and the men briefly seen on screen play little importance. Rounding out the characters are H\u00e9lo\u00efse\u2019s mother (Valeria Golino) and housekeeper Sophie (Lu\u00e0na Bajrami), who both fill critical roles in the story as the film explores issues affecting women at the time, including arranged marriages, career expectations, and health concerns.\r\n\r\nThe film itself is absolutely stunning, with gorgeously romantic and lush cinematography by Claire Mathon setting a sensual tone that complements the story. The artistry is outstanding, making \u201cPortrait of a Lady on Fire\u201d one of the most powerful, intellectual dramas of the year.","id":"5e7d573b6c849200126ac199","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e7d573b6c849200126ac199","movie_id":531428}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nI\u2019m going to write it straight away: I didn\u2019t enjoy Pok\u00e9mon Detective Pikachu as much as I wanted to. In some ways, it disappointed me. Now, you\u2019re probably thinking \u201coh, he\u2019s one of those people who never saw or played Pok\u00e9mon in his life, and now he\u2019s going to destroy the film because he never understood it\u201d. Not even close. There are always three groups of people when it comes to these famous franchises that have massive fandoms: the hardcore fans who follow the respective saga since it was created and never once stopped supporting it; the fans who like or even love it, but either skipped or gave up at a certain point in time; the non-fans who never really got into it and don\u2019t relate to any of what the previous two groups do.\r\n\r\nI belong to the second group. I\u2019m a fan of Pok\u00e9mon, but since the end of the last decade that I stopped playing its video games and watching any series or movies about it. Nevertheless, I\u2019m always as fair and impartial as possible to films and to the people who gave their all to deliver a great story. For hardcore fans, this movie might have everything you\u2019ve ever wished for. Even I was able to understand that some scenes are filled (and I mean literally the whole screen) with references and Easter Eggs that the most dedicated fans will absolutely love. These moments alone can make you enjoy this film way more than fans like me.\r\n\r\nHowever, we all know that while these sequences look fantastic and offer a lot of excitement, they are not enough to hold a narrative together or make it captivating. The Pok\u00e9mons are gorgeous, and I found myself constantly in awe! Live-action will always have that crowd of haters that think the animated versions should stay animated, no matter what. There will always be people hating on these type of movies solely by the fact that they\u2019re live-action. Honestly, I try very hard, but I can\u2019t understand how people find an incredibly realistic Pikachu ugly or disgusting when it looks absolutely adorable and visually impressive. This will be such a long and exhausting debate throughout the 2020s, every time a live-action remake or adaptation is released, but I have faith people will come to accept it or even love it eventually.\r\n\r\nDetective Pikachu main issues are the screenplay and most of the characters, no doubt about it. I understand that the production team had to shift the primary focus to the VFX regarding the actual Pok\u00e9mons since a lot of the viewers will buy the ticket only to watch a beautiful real world filled with them, but the two pillars of any film should never be kept aside for too long: story and characters. Justice Smith portrays the only human character that has a compelling backstory and a likable personality. Yes, Kathryn Newton (Lucy Stevens) delivers a good performance, and she also might interpret a character that a lot of people can relate to, but from the moment Lucy has more to do in the movie, it\u2019s like her development stagnated. However, Smith is brilliant as Tim and he showed a great range of emotions, making me not only laugh but also feel a bit emotional.\r\n\r\nSadly, these two are the only human characters that aren\u2019t either a cliche villain who wants to rule the world or a paper-thin police or scientist who only serve as exposition devices. Honestly, this might be one of the most exposition-driven films of 2019. The amount of cheap and lazy information dumps spread across the runtime is too much to handle, especially when the same info is repeated several times. It unbalances the pacing and even the tone of the movie, making it dull during some periods. I\u2019m rarely the guy who \u201cwants more action\u201d, but Detective Pikachu really needed more thrilling moments, preferably involving Pok\u00e9mon. Of the few action sequences, most are just our protagonists running from something and jumping from cliffs. Very rarely we see actual Pok\u00e9mons doing anything until the last act.\r\n\r\nRob Letterman shows that he has a lot of great qualities that a director should have, but he needs to work on his flaws and leave the screenwriting role to more experienced people. For such a mystery-driven story, the \u201cmystery\u201d part is pretty evident from the get-go, with a notable exception at the very end that I didn\u2019t saw coming and ended the film on a high note. Pikachu is beautifully voiced by Ryan Reynolds and if you were worried that his voice wouldn\u2019t blend with the yellow fellow, don\u2019t be. Pikachu is extremely funny and charming, carrying the whole show on its shoulders with a little help of Psyduck. Cubone and Ditto also have some great moments, but Mewtwo is a beauty to behold, as expected. Even though I\u2019m not a hardcore fan, I felt the \u201cimmersiveness\u201d of the incredible Pok\u00e9mon world that Warner Bros. built and that\u2019s the best compliment I can give: I felt like I was in a real Pok\u00e9mon universe.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Pok\u00e9mon Detective Pikachu is fine. For hardcore fans, it might be everything you\u2019ve ever wished for, but for fans of the 2000s Pok\u00e9mon, who stopped following the franchise after the beginning of the new decade, the numerous Easter Eggs and references might not be enough to overcome the undeniable narrative issues. Justice Smith delivers an outstanding performance, and Ryan Reynolds nails Pikachu\u2018s voice, being extremely funny and unbelievably adorable. The CGI is ground-breaking, making the Pok\u00e9mons astonishingly realistic and their world remarkably immersive. However, even if the movie ends with a terrific touch, the shallow characters, the heavy exposition dumps, and the not-that-mysterious mystery bring the pacing down and turn this live-action adaptation into just an okay one.\r\n\r\nPS: regarding the curse of the video games cinematic adaptations, I already believe that Tomb Raider broke it with a good margin, but both Warcraft and Pok\u00e9mon Detective Pikachu managed to just scratch the positive side of my reviews. You\u2019re on the right track, but step up Hollywood!\r\n\r\nRating: B-","id":"5cd40f4d0e0a265dee60ddde","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cd40f4d0e0a265dee60ddde","movie_id":447404}
{"author":"Sheldon Nylander","content":"Having never played the \"Detective Pikachu\" game, I can't attest as to the film's faithfulness to the source material. As a movie on its own merits and with a passing knowledge of Pokemon, I found that I enjoyed this more than I thought I would going in. It has a decent narrative structure (although the villain reveal is a little out-of-left-field; they probably could have used a little more buildup) and likable if somewhat cookie -cutter characters. But, WOW, is the tone inconsistent! Most of the movie gets surprisingly serious and dark early on, and for parts of the film Ryan Reynolds feels more like comic relief. Expect emotional whiplash from this one. Still, it's a fair movie that at least fans of Pokemon will likely enjoy.","id":"5d60fd2154f6eb00159b1c03","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d60fd2154f6eb00159b1c03","movie_id":447404}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is a bit of a strange movie. Part of it feels like a pretty good, dark and gritty thriller, part of it feels like a wannabe Tarantino movie and part of it feels like a comedy. Overall I would classify it as a B-movie but a pretty good B-movie. As strange as the movie is I have to say that I liked it.\r\n\r\nI kind of watched this movie on a whim. It popped up on my Netflix home screen and I kind of liked the blurb. A type of story that I like. Then I saw that Mads Mikkelsen played the lead role and this sold me on it. I quite like Mads Mikkelsen in these kind of roles.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts off in a fairly normal way for this kind of movie. You know, some assassinations, introduction of the hero, the bad guys, the even badder guys and all that. It is fairly clear already from the start that there will be blood splatter. That it would reach the levels it did towards the end of the movie was a bit of a surprise though.\r\n\r\nI did like Mads Mikkelsen in his role as Duncan, the somewhat brooding and grim assassin starting his retirement. But then I\u2019m not really surprised. It\u2019s a perfect role for him. The rest of the actors, well let\u2019s just say that their acting was for the most part forgettable. Maybe with the exception of Matt Lucas as Blut. But then, his role was so comical and wacky so one wonders if it required acting skills or just a good dose of insanity (or some chemical products).\r\n\r\nThe blurb states that he is deemed a liability. Well, that is not exactly the truth actually. It is more that his overly wacky boss is trying to screw him. This is where it starts to get into comedy land. Already in the first couple of scenes it is clear that this guy is a nut job. Then he let\u2019s loose his assassins and at that point the movie escalates in a orgy of blood, violence and comedy.\r\n\r\nI cannot really make up my mind if it would have been a better movie if the violence would have been less comical or not. With the comedy this movie becomes a bit unusual and sticks out. Without it it would risk becoming just another thirteen on a dozen assassin thrillers. Also, as comical as it is, it is fairly well done.\r\n\r\nAnyway, there is of course a pretty dramatic and violent fight as the movie draws to a close. I quite liked that one. There is also a little twist that I actually did not see coming at the end.\r\n\r\nOverall, it was a fun movie to watch.","id":"5c4ee4310e0a2662a4c8f743","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c4ee4310e0a2662a4c8f743","movie_id":483906}

{"author":"tmdb39513728","content":"errbnb\r\n\r\nNews that Adam McCay is collaborating with Bong Joon Ho to retool Parasite as a Netflix series makes me positively giddy. Parasite is easily the best movie I've seen since the Big Short. Joon Ho's compelling ease of execution alongside the effortless lure of the plot's trappings had me hooked in an instant. I would have been happy watching this family fold pizza boxes for two hours. The story, like the family, takes on a life of its own, rapidly elevating to a setup impossible to sustain. The Bunuelesque occupy-the-rich scheme gleefully, blissfully ascends to lofty heights only, inevitably, to hit the fatal fan. The poor buggers ultimately find themselves literally chin deep in their own sh*t. The hotsy-totsy aristocrats, meanwhile, host a lovely garden party that flips into a tragic Shakespearean bloodbath. It's all fun and games till someone loses a daughter. (Note to the rich: Check the references of new hires and think twice before inviting riffraff to your afternoon functions). Decades in the making, the implosion of a middle income buffer and a widening disparity between social classes make Parasite a must-see for all income brackets. You don't have to be rich or detest or envy the rich to enjoy this instant classic. But please, whatever you do, don't try this a home, folks.

Though he is often juggling a mosaic of characters, themes and social issues, Bong never eschews his anarchic impulses and dark humour.

{"author":"Sheldon Nylander","content":"The working class and down on their luck Kim family struggle to make ends meet. When a friend of the son, Ki-Woo\u2019s, who is an English tutor for the daughter in the wealthy Park family, has to leave his position, he recommends Ki-Woo for the job. Now having an \"in\" with the wealthy family, the Kims begin plotting the downfall of the current household servants and inserting themselves into those vacant positions, making them all gainfully employed and with money finally flowing into the household. But not everything is as it seems in the Park house or with their previous servants.\r\n\r\nThis movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary, pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family. The differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the well-to-do having what usually gets termed as first-world-problems, while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood. It doesn\u2019t shy away or try to be subtle about it, but interestingly enough, we don\u2019t feel beaten over the head with it either, which is a major change from the ham-fisted approach taken by most filmmakers. Couching this in a comedy is a good approach, as well, as the audience\u2019s guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do say it\u2019s MOSTLY a comedy. The third act takes a dark, dark turn, and the contrast, not to mention general disdain and even indifference, between the classes becomes much more severe. This gets into some hard territory, and characters that we\u2019ve found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves. At the same time, it doesn\u2019t feel unexpected, almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it, but aren\u2019t surprised by it when it does show up. This is some masterful characterization!\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor. It\u2019s a smart film, yet at the same time the filmmakers are not condescending about it. They give the audience credit for being able to understand the symbolism and don\u2019t spoon feed you everything, which is a refreshing change from the usual head-beating most filmmakers go for. At the same time, they understand that not every audience member will understand or immediately pick up on every symbol, but they have crafted this so carefully and so perfectly that you don\u2019t have to understand each and every one. That understanding merely enriches the experience, but isn\u2019t essential to it.\r\n\r\nThis film has gotten some recognition, and deservedly so. It is rich, intelligent, and polished to a degree that we sadly don\u2019t see as often as we should nowadays, showing the filmmakers are masters of their craft. This is easily one of the best films I\u2019ve seen in 2019.

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps:\/\/www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nYes, I know. I'm late as hell. I don't really have anything to offer you besides my personal opinion. Theses and video essays are breaking down Parasite at such a deep level that I can't really write anything new. Nevertheless, I'll share my thoughts on it because it would be a massive miss from someone who considers himself as a film critic. I had this movie on my watchlist since last summer, but I kept delaying it, underestimating my time. So, no, I'm not just watching Parasite because it won Best Picture at the Oscars, I always planned on it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, yes, I also love it like most people, and no, I'm not writing this because I'm \"following the pack\". Bong Joon Ho simply delivered one of 2019's best films, and it's definitely cracking a spot in my Top10. I really enjoyed what Bong did with Okja, and I'm a massive fan of Snowpiercer. Therefore, this isn't just another South Korean flick. It's directed and co-written by someone who has been proving himself for quite some time. Even though I still defend that Sam Mendes deserved to win Best Director for his work on 1917, I'm more than happy that a foreign movie finally won Best Picture, and what a film to do it!\r\n\r\nIt can be described as a dark dramedy, but I think social satire is more adequate. The differences between the rich and the poor are beautifully shown on-screen exclusively through visuals. There's so little exposition, which is one of the reasons why Parasite has one of 2019's best screenplays. The balance between explaining something and leaving it ambiguous is perfect. Throughout the runtime, Bong Joon Ho leans on an actor's face so that the audience can understand what that character is feeling through its expressions, which will explain its actions later on.\r\n\r\nThere's a sequence that surely has been heavily discussed for the past months. It's raining, and Bong cleverly divides the screen with how the wealthy family is dealing with it against the poor neighborhood where the Kim family comes from. The gorgeous cinematography, the unforgettable musical score, the seamless editing... Everything about this sequence is technically flawless, and it carries such an emotionally powerful message. Something astonishing and beautiful to look at for some can be a horrible disaster for others.\r\n\r\nIt's a movie that balances a lot of tones. In ten minutes, the tone goes from funny to dramatic to suspenseful to scary to absolute tragedy... and it all feels incredibly realistic. That's one of my major compliments to Parasite: I never felt like it was fiction. I never thought \"this is too much, this would never occur\". Even in the third act, where the narrative takes some bold decisions, everything makes sense with what had been shown until then. From shocking character actions to surprising plot points, Bong and Han Jin-won's screenplay is excellent.\r\n\r\nEveryone in the cast is fantastic, but Song Kang-ho is the standout, in my opinion. His role as the father of the Kim family is brilliant. I'm actually surprised he wasn't nominated for Best Actor in more award shows. I created a connection with this family in such a way that the ending truly impacted me. It's tough to deny that the writing is what makes Parasite the phenomenon that so many people fell in love with, myself included.\r\n\r\nTechnically, I don't have any defects to point out. It's one of those films that I firmly believe in having virtually no flaws. I'm in love with the score, I gasped several times at the impressive cinematography, and the editing is perfect. Whatever genre the story decides to go to, it's always entertaining and extremely captivating. Its comedy is very smart, and it made me laugh a lot of times. Its dramatic storylines kept my eyes always focused on what was happening. Even when it briefly delves into the horror territory, it's more suspenseful and scary than most of that genre's flicks nowadays.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Parasite genuinely surprised me. With so many people hyping it to a ridiculously high level, my expectations were very moderate. Nevertheless, I love it as much or more as everyone else. I know that watching it this late can make some people question my opinion\/rating, but I would never love a movie because I \"should\" or because other people do. It deserves every award it received, especially the ones concerning the screenplay. It's one of the best original stories of the last few years, and it's written in such a brilliant manner, with beautiful visual storytelling instead of the overused exposition. An emotionally resonant message is present throughout the whole runtime, and the various tones are balanced seamlessly. Technically flawless: cinematography, score, editing... everything's absolutely perfect. Nothing is placed without purpose. Not a single line of dialogue is wasted. Bong Joon Ho is a phenomenal filmmaker, one that cares about the art and everything that comes with it. He truly put his heart and soul into this, and it would be a shame if anyone fails to watch this magnificent movie just because it's in a foreign language. Please, don't make such an awful mistake...\r\n\r\nRating: A+","id":"5e497b4a676ce20018001b8c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e497b4a676ce20018001b8c","movie_id":496243}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_An uncategorisable masterpiece_**\r\n\r\n>_We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service \u2013 two dishes, but to one table._\r\n\r\n- William Shakespeare; _The Tragicall Historie of Hamlet Prince of Denmarke_, 4.iii.23-24 (1599-1601)\r\n\r\nWhat is one to make of the utterly uncategorisable and impossible-to-define _Gisaengchung_ [_Parasite_]? Only the third film to win both the Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Picture, after Billy Wilder's _The Lost Weekend_ (1945) and Delbert Mann's _Marty_ (1955), _Parasite_ is one of the best-reviewed films of the century thus far and caused huge waves when it became the first non-English language film to win Best Picture. Co-writer and director Bong Joon-ho also tied with Walt Disney for the most Oscars awarded to one person in one night \u2013 four (Best Picture, Best Foreign Language Film, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay). On top of that, he became the first person in history to win more than three Oscars for a single film. In short, Parasite has had a significant, and relatively unexpected, impact.\r\n\r\nBut what exactly is _Parasite_? Described on its official website as a \"_pitch-black modern fairy-tale_\", even a comprehensive plot summary wouldn't adequately delineate its real nature \u2013 part comedy of manners, part social satire, part heist film, part thriller, part horror, part family drama, part farce, part economic treatise, part social realism, part tragedy, part allegory. And that's just the opening scene! It's the _Ulysses_ of cinema, adopting and shedding genres so often and so seamlessly that it effectively becomes its own genre. And, like _Ulysses_, it's exceptional in just about every way \u2013 screenplay (co-written by Bong and Han Jin-won), directing, cinematography, _mise en sc\u00e8ne_, editing, production design, sound design, score, acting. There's not a weak link here, in a film that achieves that rarest of things \u2013 it lives up to the hype.\r\n\r\nThe Kim family are down on their luck. Father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) reside in a tiny basement apartment, with their only window looking out onto a popular urination spot in a back alley. With all four unemployed, they eke out a meagre living folding pizza boxes for a nearby restaurant. However, their fortunes change when Ki-Woo meets Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon), a childhood friend who is now at university. Min-hyuk works as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family, but he's soon to leave Korea, and so suggests that Ki-Woo take over. Armed with a fake diploma created by Ki-jeong on Photoshop, Ki-Woo successfully applies for the job. The Park family, father Dong-ik, (Lee Sun-kyun), mother Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), and son Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun), welcomes Ki-woo into their lavish home, and upon discovering just how wealthy the Parks are, the Kims hatch an elaborate scheme to oust the Park's current domestic staff and take their places. And so, hiding the fact that they're all related, Ki-taek is hired as a chauffeur, Chung-Sook as a housekeeper, and Ki-jeong as an art therapist for Da-song. However, it doesn't take long before things start to go very, very awry for both families, in ways none of them (or the audience) could ever have imagined.\r\n\r\nWe live in an era where wealth is distributed upwards and the gap between the haves and have-nots is wider than ever. According to inequality.org, the richest 1% of the world's population controls 45% of global wealth. At the same time, adults with less than $10,000 capital make up 64% of the population and control less than 1% of the wealth. In 2018, Oxfam reported that the wealth of the 26 richest people in the world was equal to the combined wealth of the 3.5 billion poorest people. This is the _milieu_ of _Parasite_, a film which taps into some of the same ideological thinking as gave rise to \"_Hell Joseon_\" sentiments, wherein up to 75% of Koreans aged 19-34 want to leave the country. \r\n\r\nObviously enough, Bong's main themes are class division and class conflict, the artificiality of societal hierarchy, and the concomitant social inequality and differentiation in status that makes such a hierarchy possible in the first place. As thoroughly entertaining (and funny) as the film is, it remains, in essence, an economic treatise, albeit with a savagely satirical quality. However, make no mistake, this is a satire with teeth \u2013 the hilarity and playfulness of the long first act give way to a darker political vibe in the second, before Bong violently deconstructs his own allegory in the emotionally draining and batshit insane third act, ultimately driving the knife home in an epilogue that's about as different from the film's early scenes as you could imagine. Of course, this is far from the first time Bong has dealt with issues of class, touching obliquely on similar themes in _Sarinui Chueok_ [_Memories of Murder_] (2003), _Gwoemul_ [_The Host_] (2006), and _Madeo_ [_Mother_] (2009). _Parasite_'s engagement with class and economics, however, is far more overt, aligning it with Bong's English-language work, _Snowpiercer_ (2013) and _Okja_ (2015). Never before, however, has he been this caustic, this acerbic, but so too this compassionate, this witty. Indeed, _Parasite_ feels like a culmination, the film to which he's been building for his entire career.\r\n\r\nIn the film's press notes, Bong states;\r\n\r\n>_I think that one way to portray the continuing polarisation and inequality of our society is as a sad comedy. We are living in an era when capitalism is the reigning order, and we have no other alternative. It's not just in Korea, but the entire world faces a situation where the tenets of capitalism cannot be ignored. In the real world, the paths of families like our four unemployed protagonists and the Park family are unlikely ever to cross. The only instance is in matters of employment between classes, as when someone is hired as a tutor or a domestic worker. In such cases there are moments when the two classes come into close enough proximity to feel each other's breath. In this film, even though there is no malevolent intention either side, the two classes are pulled into a situation where the slightest slip can lead to fissures and eruptions. In today's capitalistic society there are ranks and castes that are invisible to the eye. We keep them disguised and out of sight, and superficially look down on class hierarchies as a relic of the past, but the reality is that there are class lines that cannot be crossed._\r\n\r\nIn this manner, the film works as a literalisation of the theory that co-existence between the various classes is becoming increasingly difficult; the Kims and the Parks aren't simply differentiated due to wealth, rather they live in completely different worlds and have vastly different, and largely incompatible, ideologies.\r\n\r\nOne of the most deftly-handled elements of the film is Bong's avoidance of the clich\u00e9s one so often finds in films dealing with economics \u2013 the Kims are by no means the default protagonists, a victimised family immediately worthy of sympathy, whilst the Parks are by no means the default antagonists, a callous family immediately worthy of scorn. Rather, the Parks are depicted as perfectly friendly and pleasant whilst the Kims are shown to be liars and scoundrels. Indeed, it's the Kims who are the more crassly materialistic of the two families \u2013 obsessed with their mobile phones and WhatsApp, we first meet them as they're wandering around their apartment, phones held aloft, trying to pick up their neighbour's WiFi signal. Later, as they ingratiate themselves with the Parks and acquire more and more access to a wealthy lifestyle, all four Kims start to carry themselves differently, as if being in such proximity to wealth has had a physiological effect. \r\n\r\nThere are no heroes and villains here \u2013 Bong is uninterested in trucking in black and white oppositions because such rigid diametrics aren't the norm in the real world. For all their scheming and lying, the Kims merely con their way into menial jobs, trying to earn enough to make survival a little easier. As for the Parks, their wealth has insulated them from the world of families such as the Kims, but their greatest crimes are disconnection and ignorance, nothing more. At the same time, the Kims are depicted as a far more unified and loving family than the Parks. Although all four Kims regularly occupy the same frame, to the best of my recollection, we never see the four Parks together in the same shot; Da-hye and Da-song rarely leave their rooms, Yeon-gyo spends most of her time in the kitchen and living room, and Dong-ik is seen most regularly in his car. It's a wonderful bit of cinematic shorthand to convey a thematic point, with Bong utilising the visual component of the medium to maximum effect \u2013 this is a filmmaker who knows precisely what he's doing.\r\n\r\nIt's in relation to the two family's status as heroes or villains that the film's title is so important. Strictly speaking, the Korean title, \"_\uae30\uc0dd\ucda9_\" (\"gisaengchung\"), means \"helminth\" rather than \"parasite\", but as a helminth is a parasitic worm, the slight difference in the translation isn't a big deal. In any case, a parasitic organism such as a helminth lives in or on a host and takes its nourishment from that host. A simple reading of this is that the Kims are the parasites and the Parks are the hosts, with the Kims feeding off the Parks' wealth and status. However, in a film where nothing is as it seems, things aren't that simple. Bong depicts the Parks as parasites as well \u2013 they've been rendered relatively helpless by their wealth, unable to complete basic tasks such as driving or cleaning without the assistant of working-class employees; i.e. they sustain themselves based off of the labour of their servants. And so, just as the Kims feed off the Parks, the Parks feed off the Kims, in what quickly becomes a symbiotic relationship. Concerning this issue, in his Director's Statement, Bong says,\r\n\r\n>_it is increasingly the case in this sad world that humane relationships based on co-existence or symbiosis cannot hold, and one group is pushed into a parasitic relationship with another. In the midst of such a world, who can point their finger at a struggling family, locked in a fight for survival, and call them parasites? It's not that they were parasites from the start. They are our neighbours, friends and colleagues, who have merely been pushed to the edge of a precipice._\r\n\r\nHowever, as strong as the film is narratively and thematically, it also has an aesthetic design to die for. Hong Kyung-pyo's cinematography, for example, is magnificent. Hong also shot Lee Chang-dong's superb _Beoning_ (2018), and the camerawork here has a similar smoothness and restlessness, gliding through the Parks house like it's a fifth member of the Kim family. Lee Ha-jun's production design is also praise-worthy, with the Kims' and Parks' living conditions contrasted in every way; the Parks live in a pristine post-modernist semi-open plan house, accessible only by an electronically controlled gate, and hidden from the street by tall trees and dense shrubs; the Kims, on the other hand, live in a cluttered and dilapidated apartment with barely any room, their toilet situated beside the aforementioned window looking into an alley.\r\n\r\nIt's also in relation to production design wherein one of the film's best metaphors is to be found, which is also a great example of just how much of a masterwork this is, how completely Bong is in control of his craft. As a film at least partly in the tradition of the \"upstairs\/downstairs\" subgenre (think James Ivory's _The Remains of the Day_ or Robert Altman's _Gosford Park_), Bong literalises the separation between those above and those below insofar as stairways are a recurring motif. The Kims live in a basement apartment without stairs, mirroring their stagnation and inability to rise in a socio-economic sense. On the other hand, the Parks' lavish home has two main stairways \u2013 one going up, the other going down into the cellar. As Ki-jeong and Ki-woo gain more access to Da-song and Da-hye, they start to spend most of their time upstairs. Ki-taek and Chung-sook, however, along with Dong-ik and Yeon-gyo, spend most of their time downstairs, indicating a fissure between the adults and their children. The stairway to the cellar is its own unique animal, with Bong shooting it like he's suddenly directing a horror film (there's a thematic reason for this that I can't go into without spoilers). In this way, he bestows upon it an ominousness that, at first, makes little sense, but ultimately reveals itself to be a spectacular bit of foreshadowing. There's also a third stairway in the Park home, one not revealed until late in the second act, but one which has huge narrative and thematic importance.\r\n\r\n_Parasite_ is a masterpiece, with Bong, operating at the peak of his abilities, never putting a foot wrong. It could have been a self-serving and didactic message-movie \u2013 a homily to the honour of the poor or a deconstruction of the unhappiness of the rich \u2013 but Bong is far too talented for that, avoiding rhetorical cant, and allowing the film to find its own space. Quite unlike anything I've ever seen, it works as allegory just as well as it works as social realism just as well as it works as comedy just as well as it works as tragedy, and so on. This is cinema as art; it's the best Palme d'Or winner since Terrence Malick's _The Tree of Life_ in 2011 and the best Best Picture winner since Kevin Costner's _Dances with Wolves_ in 1990. Bong is currently working with HBO to develop a limited series English-language adaptation, which fills me with dread, but no matter what happens with that project, no matter how good (or bad) it may be, here in 2020, Parasite has proven itself very much a game-changer, a film that deserves every bit of praise it's received.","id":"5e4df6d89b86160018699c80","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e4df6d89b86160018699c80","movie_id":496243}

You know, this summer I was starting to get a little worn out with the endless sequels, remakes and soulless crash grabs, so I find it refreshing we get movies like this once awhile.\r\n\r\nI admire Bong Joon-Ho as a director, especially his Korean movies. Not to say I dislike his English language films like 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja', but in my personal opinion those don't match the same quality as his Korean movies and there isn't a sex pest trying to control his work.

And an extra effort made by Kumararaja to hyperlink those stories along With Idiosyncratic and Palpable characters.\r\n\r\nAnd our very own Makkal Selvan Vijay Sethupathi playing the transgender women Shilpa, the episodes between him and his son Rasukutty (Ashwanth Ashokkumar) Was so pure, for sure you will fall in love with that kid.

Some of them burn slow and long, like red dwarfs. Others \u2013 blue giants \u2013 burn their fuel so fast they shine across great distances, and are easy to see. As they start to run out of fuel, they burn helium, grow even hotter, and explode in a supernova. Supernovas, they're brighter than the brightest galaxies. They die, but everyone watches them go._\r\n\r\n- Jodi Picoult; _My Sister's Keeper_ (2004)\r\n\r\n>_There are patterns b__ecause we try to find them. A desperate attempt at order because we can't face the terror that it might all be random._\r\n\r\n- Lauren Beukes; _The Shining Girls_ (2013)\r\n\r\nThe debut feature from writer\/director Bartosz Kruhlik, _Supernova_ is an excellently made and thematically fascinating film that manages to pack a lot into its 78 minutes; multiple well-rounded characters, several well-developed plot strands, socio-political commentary, existential musing, and a _d\u00e9nouement_ that throws everything we've seen into relief.\r\n\r\nThe film opens on a Sunday morning in an unspecified area in rural Poland. On a quiet country road, we're introduced to Iwona Matys (Agnieszka Skibicka) and her two young children, Pawe\u0142ek (Borys Bart\u0142omiejczyk) and Piotru\u015b (Iwo Rajski), who emerge from their home, pursued by her husband, Micha\u0142 (Marcin Zarzeczny). Even at this early hour, Micha\u0142 is already drunk, and it quickly becomes apparent that Iwona is in the process of leaving him, taking the children with her. As he loses pace with them, he hails down a passing car driven by Adam Nowak (Marcin Hycnar), an arrogant politician. As Micha\u0142 leans into the car, he throws up, causing Adam to speed away. However, in his disgust Adam takes his eyes off the road, resulting in a horrifying crash from which he immediately flees. Completely unaware of the collision, however, Micha\u0142 passes out in a ditch. Meanwhile, two policemen \u2013 S\u0142awek (Marek Braun) a veteran known for his calm demeanour, and his young, enthusiastic-to-a-fault partner M\u0142ody (Micha\u0142 Pawlik) \u2013 receive the call to attend the crash. Arriving at the location, they find an ambulance and fire-brigade already in attendance, but when he surveys the scene, the usually unflappable S\u0142awek reacts in utter horror. Soon thereafter Zygmunt (Dariusz Dluzewski), the acerbic but efficient Komendant of the force, arrives with explicit orders to minimise the fall-out for Adam, who has by now returned to the scene. However, as word spreads through the local community, a crowd gathers, and as Adam's role in the crash becomes apparent, the locals' thoughts turn to vengeance. As the police attempt to contain the situation, Micha\u0142, Adam, and S\u0142awek find themselves in a situation from which none of them will emerge unscathed.\r\n\r\nKruhlik uses the site of the crash as a kind of representative microcosm, an allegorical melting pot wherein he examines issues such as group mentality, political arrogance, the abuse of law, alcoholism, the difficulties of police work, and the ghoulish curiosity which leads people to take out their phones to record a tragedy before they think to offer assistance. The two main themes, however, are the dissemination of communal anger (the \"Supernova\" of the title refers to the build-up of emotion that seems like it can only result in a devastating explosion) and the idea that a life-altering event for one person is nothing more than a traffic jam for another. Whilst Micha\u0142, Adam, and S\u0142awek are having their entire existence ripped out from under them, others find the situation a mild inconvenience that necessities a slight change in travel plans. Meanwhile, the crowd of onlookers, at first morbidly curious, soon turn aggressive as word of Adam's actions percolate through their number and they realise that he may use his position to worm his way out of culpability. And so the feeling of anger rapidly spreads like a kind of emotional Chinese whisper, with each member of the group influencing the thinking of those around them. It's all very interesting and maturely handled by Kruhlik as we find ourselves getting drawn into this increasingly dangerous and unpredictable situation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most impressive aspects of the film is how much character development Kruhlik packs in. We learn a lot more about the three main characters than you might expect in such a short film, but others are fleshed out too; M\u0142ody and Zygmunt, for example, both receive some backstory, as does Magda (Anna Mrozowska), a nervous young policewoman unsure how to react to three youths aggressively hitting on her. The screenplay is structurally very simple (it was purposely written to be shot on a shoestring budget), but this simplicity does not preclude thematic complexity or character interiority. The film is also aesthetically impressive, with cinematographer Micha\u0142 Dymek employing long takes that make use of the geography of the single location. The opening shot, for example, begins on the Matys home, follows Iwona and Micha\u0142 some way down the road, pauses to show Micha\u0142 trying to get into Adam's car, and then finally comes to rest on Micha\u0142 as he falls asleep in a ditch. With the film also taking place in something close to real-time, this creates a strong sense of almost documentarian immediacy.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, I thought _Supernova_ was an impressive debut. It's fairly slight, but it's very competently made, and it has some interesting things to say about fate and how we are all, naturally enough, each at the centre of our own conception of reality.","id":"5e6ef648459ad60013669baf","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e6ef648459ad60013669baf","movie_id":632455}
{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nAs you probably know by now, since I posted the original film's review a few hours ago, I loved the first Zombieland. I defend that it's a zombie cult classic, and I was genuinely pumped for its sequel. It didn't go through any external controversy (something quite rare nowadays), the cast didn't say anything wrong in the interviews (haters didn't have enough words to twist this time around), Ruben Fleischer returns as the director, as well as Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (plus a new member, Dave Callaham) as the screenwriters. If a studio wants to do a 10-year sequel, it might as well get the creators and original cast back together, right?!\r\n\r\nThat's what I love the most about Double Tap. It didn't lose the original's essence, and it didn't forget what made it so successful. The cast's chemistry can be felt thousands of miles away, but the new additions also fit in seamlessly. Zoey Deutch portrays Madison, a purposefully stereotypical \"dumb blonde girl\" who has some of the funniest scenes as well as some of the most cringe-worthy (Deutch gives an excellent performance, though). And Rosario Dawson plays Nevada, basically a women version of Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), which means she has a bunch of badass action sequences. As for the old gang, well\u2026\r\n\r\nEveryone delivers great performances, but this time, Harrelson really elevated his character. Not only does he have the expected awesome kickass moments, but he also offers some emotionally compelling displays. Emma Stone (Wichita) and Abigail Breslin (Little Rock) keep being amazing as their characters, and Jesse Eisenberg (Columbus) does get a bit too \u2026 Jesse Eisenberg, but it never stops feeling natural, having in mind how his character acts. These four are the heart of the whole show. Hence, getting the original cast back together is halfway through success, even more than in the first movie. Story-wise is where I do have some complaints, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's due to the fact that I watched 2009's Zombieland just a couple of hours before Double Tap's screening, but I wish that Fleischer and his team were more creative. Sure, the original was 10 years ago, and not everyone is going to rewatch the original (especially not right before), so it's expected that a lot of classic moments are recreated in some shape or form. However, for an extended period, I felt that I was watching the exact same film, just with older characters. I know I'm going to hear some of Columbus' original famous rules, but there's a surprising lack of new ones. I know Tal is going to repeat some of his catchphrases, but he's an imaginative guy, he can think of fresh ones (which he does say in the last minutes, but still).\r\n\r\nTo move the plot forward or actually make the story happen, a lot of questionable things occur, and not in the sense of them not being rational (it's not like Zombieland is a groundbreaking piece of storytelling). It's the apparent lack of character development through all of the years that have passed, and I'm not addressing their personalities being the same (it's pretty normal). To create this movie, characters make decisions that don't feel right, having in mind they spent so much time together. It's impossible for love, trust, and emotional attachment not to be developed throughout such a long time. So, while Little Rock's arc is understandable and relatable, Wichita and Columbus' lacks convincing arguments, in my opinion. Both make decisions too dumb for such intelligent characters, but I guess \"that's love\".\r\n\r\nOnce again, the technical features that defined the original so clearly are seamlessly employed in its sequel. Beautiful production design, cool soundtrack, fantastic application of practical effects and real sets, which nowadays are getting rarer. The slightly longer runtime still manages to carry a fast pace, which is always a good attribute, and it's packed with thrilling, hilarious, bloody action sequences. Amusing pop culture references, and the most significant moment of all: Double Tap has one of the best, if not THE best, mid-credits scene of the year! Don't you dare leave the theater, it's right at the beginning of the credits, so stay in your seat!\r\n\r\nAll in all, Zombieland: Double Tap pays a decent homage to the original zombie cult classic by getting everyone (cast and crew) back together, and delivering yet another entertaining flick. By maintaining the essence of the first film, Ruben Fleischer is able to capture the outstanding cast's chemistry, as well as present those amazingly entertaining action sequences. Even though the central narrative isn't as straightforward and interesting as in the original, it's still captivating enough for the audience to care about. There is an excessive amount of callbacks to classic catchphrases, rules, or moments, which shows a bit of a lack of imagination to create new material. While it's not as funny or entertaining as the 2009's movie, it's still a good time. If you're a fan of Zombieland, definitely watch it! If not, well\u2026 Nut up and watch it or shut up and let others enjoy it.\r\n\r\nRating: B","id":"5db485a2f056d500120ef77e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5db485a2f056d500120ef77e","movie_id":338967}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"_**Just as funny and irreverent as the original, even if it hits all the same beats**_\r\n\r\n> _I'd rather die while I'm living than live while I'm dead._\r\n\r\n- Jimmy Buffett; \"Growing Older But Not Up\" (1981)\r\n\r\nThe original _Zombieland_ (2009) was something of a sleeper hit, earning over $100 million against a $24 million budget, becoming the most financially successful zombie movie ever made, until it was surpassed by Marc Forster's asinine _World War Z_ (2013). Smart, funny, and self-aware, it didn't take itself too seriously, and it had bucket-loads of heart, but it was hardly a film crying out for a sequel. And as time passed, it seemed more and more unlikely such a sequel would happen. However, after a decade in development hell, _Zombieland: Double Tap_ has arrived, and boy is it one of the most unnecessary sequels I've seen in quite some time. However, as unnecessary as it is, it's also extremely enjoyable. It doesn't do a whole lot that wasn't in the original, but the irreverent sense of humour, fourth wall breaks, sharp character interactions, and, most importantly, shedloads of charm are all present and accounted for. Directed by Ruben Fleischer (who helmed the original) and written by Rhett Rees and Paul Wernick (who wrote the original), along with Dave Callaham, _Double Tap_ may not take too many risks, but it's a fine companion piece.\r\n\r\n10 years after the events in the first film, the quartet is still together and still getting on one another's nerves \u2013 there's the neurotic but sweet Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg doing his Jessie Eisenberg thing), the crass but caring Tallahassee (a wonderfully acerbic Woody Harrelson), the sarcastic Wichita (a dead-pan Emma Stone) and the laidback Little Rock (Abigail Breslin doing a lot with the little she's given). As we meet them, they're in the process of taking up residence in the White House \u2013 Columbus and Wichita are still a couple, but recently, she's started to wonder if perhaps their relationship is more important to him than it is to her; Little Rock is now a young woman who resents the fact that Tallahassee still treats her like she's 11; and Tallahassee, for his part, hasn't changed an iota. After Columbus proposes to Wichita (using the Hope Diamond), she and Little Rock skip town, but she returns a month later, telling the others that Little Rock ditched her and headed to a supposed zombie-free commune. And so the trio reluctantly set out to find her. Along the way, we're introduced to Madison (Zoey Deutch, who completely steals the film), a millennial bimbo who's been holed up in walk-in freezer; Berkeley (Avan Jogia), a peace-loving hippie; Nevada (Rosario Dawson), a tough-as-nails Elvis aficionado; and Albuquerque (Luke Wilson) and Flagstaff (Thomas Middleditch), who are eerily similar to Tallahassee and Columbus (the reveal of which was spoiled by the trailer). There's also a new breed of zombie, which is faster, stronger, and more intelligent than the regular kind, and which can only be killed with multiple head-shots.\r\n\r\nAnd that's about it as far as the plot goes. The original film came at a time when the zombie genre was just starting to be taken more seriously \u2013 Danny Boyle's _28 Days Later_ and Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's _28 Weeks Later_ were released in 2002 and 2007, respectively, introducing all manner of innovations and turning many of the genre tropes on their head; Jaume Balaguer\u00f3 and Paco Plaza's _[\u2022REC]_ films were released in 2007 and 2009, setting a new standard for found footage films; _The Walking Dead_ debuted in 2010, and for the first few seasons it was as well-reviewed a show as you could find (until it turned into repetitive self-parody). Zombies also featured heavily in video game franchises of the era, such as _Siren_ (2003), _Dead Rising_ (2006), _Dead Space_ (2008), and _Dead Island_ (2011). _Zombieland_ cared about none of that \u2013 it was, in fact, the inverse of such titles, a film that didn't take anything seriously, least of all itself. \r\n\r\nWith this in mind, although 10 years have passed and the landscape is very different, one of the sequel's most successful elements is that next to nothing has changed; in essence, it acknowledges the gap precisely by ignoring it. So, Columbus's opening voiceover specifically refers to the long break as he thanks us for choosing _Double Tap_ when there is such \"_a wide choice of zombie entertainment_\" and Madison tells Tallahassee his catchphrase is \"_very 2009_\", but the film as a whole feels as if it was shot immediately after the original. Of course, this is important insofar as in the universe of the franchise, the last decade has been very different to the last decade of our reality, so the filmmakers can't layer in too many contemporary references \u2013 although Columbus does mention how \"_unrealistic_\" _The Walking Dead_ comics are, there's a hilarious deconstruction of the concept of Uber, and there's a subtle allusion to Trump when Wichita sarcastically tells Tallassee he'd have brought \"a real dignity\" to the office of the presidency.\r\n\r\nThis factors into the performances as well, insofar as Columbus, Tallahassee, and Wichita are all broadly similar to how they were 10 years ago. Little Rock has changed significantly, but that's as much to do with the fact that she was a child in the original and is now a young woman. This lack of character development may sound like a bad thing, but really, the familiarity of the characters and their group dynamic has its own inherent charm, we welcome it because it's familiar, with the cast essentially doing the same things they did in the original. Speaking of performances, Zoey Deutch completely owns every scene she's in. Sure, the character is clich\u00e9d as all hell and, on paper, she should be all kinds of annoying, but that she isn't, is a testament to Deutch's warm performance, finding genuine pathos amidst the perpetually peppy and cheerful high-energy ditz. She also has great chemistry with the original cast, especially Harrelson. In fact, all of the new actors have terrific chemistry, which is nice to see insofar as effortless chemistry was one of the hallmarks of the original.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, as mentioned, the film doesn't do a whole lot that wasn't in the original \u2013 the characters are the same, the narrative beats are the same, the group dynamic is the same, the sense of humour is the same \u2013 and for some, this will certainly be an issue. Indeed, as much as I enjoyed the film, I would have liked to see it take more risks (there's certainly nothing here to rival the inspired Bill Murray cameo). Because of this blanket similarity, there is a sense in which the sequel isn't really its own thing, it's defined primarily by what the original did rather than forging its own path, and a lot of the meta-humour only works if you know the original. Another problem is that it fails to do much with an interesting set-up, which sees women chaffing against traditional gender roles and the identities conferred on them by men. Once the gang end up on the road, this theme is pretty much forgotten (even with the introduction of Nevada, who seems more like a man's idea of what a tough woman should be than her own person). There are also more than a few clich\u00e9s, primarily in relation to Madison (as blond a character as you'll ever meet) and the one-note Berkeley (a weed-smoking gun-hating hippie, who is literally introduced by way of a sitar on the soundtrack).\r\n\r\n_Zombieland: Double Tap_ is undemanding and doesn't completely justify its existence, but it also does justice to the original, and never for one second does it take itself seriously. The effortlessness with which it slots into the original's groove is either funny in its own right or poor writing, depending on your perspective, but the film is smart enough to know and acknowledge that it feels slightly out of place in 2019, in a way the 2009 original did not. And if a little of the spark has been lost, the warmth, the characters, the jokes, and the playfulness more than make up for it.","id":"5dbf9442f1b5710013e7de25","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dbf9442f1b5710013e7de25","movie_id":338967}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I didn\u2019t know anything about Shazam. What his powers were, what story did he have \u2026 Basically, I didn\u2019t know who he was. This is what David F. Sandberg\u2018s movie does best: introduce the audience to a new DC superhero, by delivering an uncommonly well-structured comic-book screenplay, packed with laughter and entertaining action. Zachary Levi is undoubtedly the standout! Not only is he hilarious, but he perfectly captures the childlike personality that a kid-turned-adult would have. His expressions of absolute surprise and awe of his powers are extremely precious, and he effortlessly carries the more lighthearted tone on his shoulders.\r\n\r\nAsher Angel is brilliant as Billy Batson. His character has a notably well-written and well-explored backstory, which eventually justifies the person he has become. It\u2019s the most emotional and heartfelt subplot of the film (probably the only one, really), and Henry Gayden did a fantastic job writing its script. It doesn\u2019t feel cliche or over-the-top, it actually feels grounded and quite realistic. Jack Dylan Grazer plays his best friend, Freddy Freeman, and he\u2019s the primary source of self-aware comedy. He knows all the cliches regarding superheroes and supervillains, so his jokes constantly land and play seamlessly into the last act.\r\n\r\nUsually, villains tend to be hollow characters with paper-thin motivations, but since a few years ago, this issue has gradually been corrected. The latest comic-book movies have incredibly well-developed villains, who carry a compelling backstory that entirely supports their beliefs, but not their actions. This type of villains work because not only the audience can understand where they come from, but in some cases, they can even connect with and care about them. Dr. Thaddeus Sivana is not exactly someone the audience ends up caring about, but his backstory is emotionally powerful enough for us to understand where his motivations originate from. Mark Strong delivers a menacing performance, and his costume\/make-up looks pretty badass.\r\n\r\nThe first act is kind of a mixed bag. It starts in a very captivating way, and once you understand who\u2019s the character at the center, it gets even better. However, the film\u2019s tone takes long to establish itself, and the beginning of the movie struggles to find which jokes land and which don\u2019t. The humor is on-point throughout the rest of the runtime, but those first few jokes not so much, which threw me off a little bit. The action sequences are amazing, and the sound design allows the audience to feel every punch, kick, a fall on the ground or a Superman-ish take-off. The fight sequences are seamlessly edited, and you know how much I love well-choreographed or well-edited action scenes.\r\n\r\nShazam\u2018s search for his powers provides the funniest and most entertaining moments of the film. Each test that he puts himself through is both hilarious and informative. This is another aspect of the screenplay I love so much: they had several ideas of how to approach this segment, and they nailed every single execution. From the pop-culture references to the hero-villain cliches, Sandberg did a terrific job exploring those concepts, and he executed them flawlessly. The best jokes are the ones that can be funny on different levels for different people. If people can laugh at a particular scene solely due to it, but other people can laugh even more because that moment means so much more to them, that\u2019s when you know a joke is perfect. Shazam is not only funny for comic-book fans, everyone can leave the theater entertained and jolly.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s still a straightforward superhero movie. There\u2019s still a villain to defeat, and the film goes through all of the cliches that it makes so much fun of. Everyone knows how it\u2019s going to develop, plot point by plot point, a few minutes in. Not that I consider this a flaw, it\u2019s just \u2026 It is what it is. The final battle drags too much, and it keeps ending and restarting every five minutes. It does have a pretty cool conclusion, but it takes a bit too long to get there. Also, and I know that this is one of those logical nitpicks that CinemaSins are known for digging, but the flashbacks and time-jumps could have received better treatment concerning the age of the characters. One thing is to think that the characters would look much older\/younger than what they display on-screen, but when they make them look exactly the same in the span of 30\/40 years \u2026 Not so acceptable.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Shazam is a blast! It\u2019s the most entertaining movie I\u2019ve seen so far this year, and it\u2019s freaking hilarious. It continues the comic-book films trend to change how villains are written, by delivering a well-developed bad guy, menacingly portrayed by Mark Strong. Every member of the cast gives a strong performance, but Zachary Levi steals the show. His whimsical attitude, reckless personality, and rich facial expressions are guaranteed to entertain you for most of the runtime. Asher Angel and Jack Dylan Grazer are outstanding as the young kids, and the former\u2019s backstory carries emotional impact which passes on to the big guy he transforms himself into.\r\n\r\nThe action is packed with beautifully-edited sequences, powerful sound design, and cool, unique moments, but the supposedly climactic final battle drags too much. The first act struggles to find its rhythm and its tone, but once it gets going, it\u2019s an exceptional journey. The best praise I can give Sandberg\u2018s movie is that I didn\u2019t know anything about Shazam before entering the theater, and now I can\u2019t wait for its sequel. Well-directed, well-written and remarkably entertaining. What more can I ask? Go see it!\r\n\r\nRating: B+","id":"5ca624e20e0a2657cc9fd65b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ca624e20e0a2657cc9fd65b","movie_id":287947}

{"author":"garethmb","content":"Growing up I was a regular viewer of the Shazam and Isis \u201cSuper Power Hour\u201d on television. Back before the days of mega-budgeted Super Hero movies; we had to content ourselves with cartoons and low budget television offerings which did their best to capture the look and action of comic characters within the budget and technology limits they had to deal with.\r\nWarner Bros. has brought their latest DC hero to the big screen with \u201cShazam!\u201d and it looks to launch a new franchise for the studio and build on the success of \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and \u201cAquaman\u201d following some earlier disappointments with their planned hero franchise films.\r\nThe film follows the story of young Billy Batson (Asher Angel), who has grown up in and fled several Foster Homes after being lost at a Carnival years earlier and unable to find his mother. Billy has never stopped trying to find her and even takes extreme measures to try to find her that has gotten him in trouble with the law.\r\nWhile trying to stick up for a family member at his latest Foster Home; Billy is forced to flee from some local goons and finds himself facing an ancient Wizard (Djimon Honsou; who tells him he will now have superior powers when he speaks his name as he is now a guardian against the forces of evil.\r\nBilly does not believe this but upon uttering the name; he transforms into a powerful hero in adult form. Zach Levi plays the title hero and soon finds himself eager to test his new powers and his Super Hero obsessed Foster Brother is more than happy to mentor him and make all sorts of viral videos of his efforts and training.\r\nTheir efforts soon draw the attention of an evil individual (Mark Strong), who covets the power Billy has for himself as along with the Seven Deadly Sins; he looks to become an unstoppable force for evil and sets out to destroy all that stands in his way.\r\nThe film is aimed more for a younger audience as much of the humor is squarely focused on Middle School level jokes. There are more than a few references to \u201cBig\u201d along the way which does sum up a good portion of the backstory as when he is in hero form; the young boy without a family is a popular and dynamic adult.\r\nIn many ways this was one of the more odd aspects of the film. Billy is a dour and untrusting individual most of the time; however when he is hero form he is a jovial and goofy individual who acts like a teenager. I could see an increase in confidence but it is odd considering that they are the same person.\r\nLevi is very energetic in the part and goes all in and he does a great job of conveying a kid in a man\u2019s body. The biggest issue with the film is that there is mostly a lot of humor aimed at a much younger audience and large gaps with minimal action which made sitting through numerous childish antics a bit tedious at times.\r\nDespite this; the film was entertaining and one of the better adaptions of a comic. The door is wide open for future adventures and I look forward to seeing what they come up with next.\r\n3.5 stars out of 5","id":"5c9cfb4792514124dc3145be","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c9cfb4792514124dc3145be","movie_id":287947}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Emotionally ambiguous, thematically complex, aesthetically daring \u2013 an exceptionally accomplished directorial debut_**\r\n\r\n>_Qui est en droit de vous rendre absurde est en droit de vous rendre injuste._ [_Anyone who has the power to make you believe absurdities has the power to make you commit injustices._]\r\n\r\n- Voltaire; _Questions sur les miracles_ (1765)\r\n\r\n> _We all have a tendency to think that the world must conform to our prejudices.

Certainly the \"Four Horsemen\" of New Atheism (Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Christopher Hitchens, and Sam Harris) would argue it is. However, from the perspective of the fanatic, such fanaticism is often not only logical and justified, but unavoidable; they don't choose to be fanatical, they are compelled to be fanatical, no matter how insane their behaviour may seem. The disparity between what a fanatic believes and what other people believe is the main issue examined in _Saint Maud_, the stunning debut feature from writer\/director Rose Glass. Part-horror, part-psychological thriller, part-character drama, part-ecclesiastical treatise, _Saint Maud_ can be read in a variety of ways \u2013 an analysis of the interaction between faith and self; a threnody for the life of a young woman suffering a mental breakdown; a drama about loneliness; a study of the importance of friendship; a tale of possession; a tragedy about the frailty of the human body. Told mainly (although not entirely) from the perspective of a fanatical Christian, the story makes room for the possibility that, however unlikely, such fanaticism isn't mental illness at all and that God really is communicating with this person. And this magnificently handled ambiguity is the film's trump card. Disturbing, horrifying, challenging, unpredictable, emotional, and occasionally very funny, this is a film that forges a path entirely its own, and is as impressive and daring a directorial debut as you're ever likely to find.\r\n\r\nThe film takes place in a thoroughly depressing English seaside town (it was shot in Scarborough, but the town in the film is unnamed). There we're introduced to Maud (an incredibly physical performance from Morfydd Clark), a recent convert to Roman Catholicism. Exceptionally devout, Maud believes that all of mankind is amoral, lustful, and wicked, and that only by way of a true saviour can we be saved. Is she that saviour? It's possible, because God has explicitly told her that he has very special plans for her in the near future. Before being called upon to save humanity, however, Maud is working as a private palliative care nurse, explaining to God (we hear her prayers in voiceover) that she feels tending to a dying person and treating them with kindness and dignity in their last days is akin to saving their soul. The story begins as Maud arrives for her first day with Amanda K\u00f6hl (the always brilliant Jennifer Ehle); a formerly world-famous American dancer and choreographer suffering from end-stage spinal lymphoma. Amanda has a reputation for being acerbic, but she and Maud get on well \u2013 Maud admires her strength of character and zest for life, whilst she wants to help Maud let her hair down a little. However, there are certain elements of Amanda's life of which Maud does not approve \u2013 her smoking and drinking, for example, or the frequent visits from Carol (Lily Frazer), Amanda's much younger lover, and as time goes by, Maud starts to exert more and more control over Amanda's life. Meanwhile, although God continues to promise Maud that the time is coming when she will be called upon, she's started to get a little frustrated waiting. And so, facing the possibility that something hideous from her past could resurface, Maud decides to prove to Amanda, God, and everyone else just how far mankind has fallen and just how sanctified she really is.\r\n\r\nAlthough Maud is a hard-line fundamentalist, Glass refuses to dismiss her as an irredeemable monster, arguing instead that such individuals genuinely believe they really are communicating with the Divine. It's the old thing about how a crazy person doesn't know they're crazy, but manifested in a more complex form \u2013 Maud may be mentally ill, but even if that is the case (and the film is in no rush to confirm that it is), then surely she deserves compassion and kindness, so completely has her mind bent reality to support her delusion. As will be discussed in a moment, Glass tells much of the story from Maud's subjective perspective, and in this sense, it's almost understandable when she sees signs of God's presence in everyday things (an inexplicable whirlpool in a glass of beer, for example) and when she's occasionally rendered almost catatonic as the Holy Spirit flows through her. As the subjective perspective communicates brilliantly, this may be delusion, but if it is, it's a total delusion that she is powerless against. In a very real sense, she cannot be held accountable for her actions.\r\n\r\nEven irrespective of mental health issues, however, Maud is all-in on the whole Catholic thing. She tells God about how important her work is, as it allows her to \"_save souls_\", which is the greatest task she can imagine; she credits her recent conversion to Catholicism as reversing the downward spiral of her life, explaining that she always felt \"_there was more than this_\", but it was only when she became a Catholic that she was allowed to see what that \"more\" was. She's also a firm adherent of the Job school of faith-by-suffering, cheerfully telling a beggar, \"_never waste your pain_\" and later engaging in some truly gnarly DIY shoemaking.\r\n\r\nAlong the same lines, she tolerates Amanda's little digs about her life and how lonely she seems, but when Amanda turns her caustic wit to Catholicism, Maud is unable to let that stand without offering rebuke. Of course, her relationship with Amanda forms much of the film's narrative backbone, and is deeply nuanced and layered, with neither woman allowed to occupy the moral high-ground. Ehle plays Amanda as profoundly bored with her failing body, whose isolation and inability to leave the house mean she must find amusement where she can, and so she seizes on this strange, ultra-serious young woman who has come to look after her. Amanda is never portrayed as a villain, but she does regard Maud as something of a plaything and Maud's reverential and humourless attitude as something to be joked about, not with the intention of hurting Maud, but with the intention of amusing herself. Amanda, however, fails to understand that these are not mutually exclusive intentions.\r\n\r\nAs strong as _Saint Maud_ is thematically, however, where it really excels is in its aesthetic design. Glass directs the hell out of it and there's not a weak link amongst her crew \u2013 from Ben Fordesman's murky cinematography to Paulina Rzeszowska's detailed production design to Paul Davies's oppressive sound design to Adam Janota Bzowski's creepy score to Mark Towns's ambiguous editing (including a shocking slam cut right at the end that's as brilliantly jarring and thematically crucial as anything in the work of Nicolas Roeg). \r\n\r\nCrucial to the overall aesthetic is how Glass handles perspective; most (although, crucially, not all) of the film is told from Maud's perspective, so we encounter her visions not as an objective third-party would, but as she herself does. So, for example, when she sees a small whirlpool spontaneously appear in a glass of beer, we see the same thing, and there's no cutaway to show us Maud staring at a normal glass, _sans_ whirlpool; when a towel placed near a crucifix falls to the ground for no obvious reason, we see it fall just as she does, and there's nothing to objectively suggest why it may have fallen; when God talks to her (in Welsh, no less), we hear His voice as she does, and there's no portion of the scene where we see Maud answering a voice we cannot hear.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, is it just a coincidence that so many shots of Maud are blocked with windows or lights in the background that create a halo effect, and is the shot of her walking on the beach, with a thin layer of water covering the sand, intentionally framed in such a way that it looks like she's walking on water? One particular scene near the end of the film, which I won't go into as it would be a spoiler, is especially important in the construction of a subjective point of view \u2013 what we're seeing couldn't possibly be anything other than psychosis, and yet the film has given us very little to confirm such a reading. Could it be that what Maud is experiencing is real? Is this scene confirmation that her mind has irreparably snapped, or is it confirmation that she was completely sane all along? Constructing a scene based on two literally inverse interpretations can't be easy, yet Glass does it so smoothly, you won't even realise the sharp dichotomy until it's all over. At the very least, even if we don't accept Maud's view of things, the film encourages us to sympathise with a woman undergoing a mental breakdown. There's no cynicism here \u2013 either Maud is truly in contact with God or she isn't, and if she isn't then her story is as much of a tragedy as Amanda's, and she deserves help, not condescension or ridicule.\r\n\r\nRunning only 84 minutes, it's extraordinary how much Glass squeezes into her debut feature; from the arresting performances by Clark and Ehle to the thematic complexity to the extraordinarily well-handled perspectival ambiguity to the haunting aesthetic design. Looking at issues such as trauma, faith, fundamentalism, sexuality, and human impermanence, the film has much more going on than the generic horror elements one might expect. Either a depiction of the mental collapse of a young woman or a study of the supernatural, the ambiguity might frustrate those who prefer their narratives with solid answers, but for the rest of us, there's much to embrace and celebrate here. One of the best directorial debuts I've seen in a long time, I was only half-way through the movie and I was already looking forward to whatever Glass might do next. _Saint Maud_ probably won't break any box-office records, but as a calling card, it's second-to-none, and we are going to be hearing a lot from Rose Glass in the future.","id":"5e69975755c9260013671144","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e69975755c9260013671144","movie_id":575776}

I kind of wish they'd let Sadako haunt her well in peace and let her be at this point. \r\n\r\nWith a slightly underwhelming ninth film, it's definitely time to exorcise Sadako, let her move on from her cursed state, and throw the towel in with this one.

{"author":"nicholuswahome96@gmail.com","content":"Directed by Adolf El Assal, Sawah is a classic film that features Samir (Karim Kassem), a DJ with no papers but with sheer determination to soar higher heights in the music industry. Propelled by the rising protests in Egypt, his home country, the complicated social relationship in his family as well as his passion for music, Samir wins at a contest in Cairo which gives him an international platform to showcase his prowess in Brussels, Belgium. The trip to Brussels does not go as planned as he is forced to land in Luxemburg. New to this world, Samir faces the authority who takes him as an immigrant, just like other non-locals who pass by illegally. The encounters in Luxemburg opens up the inferiority complex of the law enforcement officers, the multiculturalism, and also the punitive dynasties establishing themselves as the local authorities in Luxemburg. \r\nAdolf bases Sawah on personal experience as he found himself in Luxemburg by mistake when he was no older than seven years. His ability to produce such a film with comical twists and incorporate international languages is thrilling and brilliant as he manages to take his jokes global. Difficult as it might be to find a spot in the international comedy spot, the challenge motivates Adolf to find one. His unique ability to use his personal experience and produce such a classic film portrays the level of determination, brilliance and immense prowess that he possesses. \r\nSawah serves to achieve several missions at the same time. It presents the political and social circumstances in Cairo where injustice prevails. Music, however, brings people together as seen in the first scene of the film. Talents, although sometimes underrates, propel the characters in the film to reach their heights. Samir is determined to take Cairo music international while her girlfriend Amal is determined to share with the world the history-making process in Egypt through the art of photography. The film also serves to appreciate different cultures as Samir traverses through Luxemburg. His encounters involve meeting Hebrews, Arabs, English and other people from different cultures. The fact that Adolf manages to fit the main character in all these contexts, and in a hilarious way, proves his capabilities and determination in making a spot in the international comedy world. \r\nRunning for 86 minutes, the film reveals the talent behind its creation and the determination of the director to present to the audience the life immigrants go through in Luxemburg. The film captures the real experiences of these immigrants, their encounters with the Travellers as well as the authority of the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg that is used to dealing with non-locals passing by as either refugees or immigrants. \r\nThe film, Sawah 2019, excels in its production and creation through its superb incorporation with other arts. Music is heavily employed and artistically used in different scenes to create emotions, capture attention and tension as well. Though it racks the entire film, its artistic incorporation showcases the power of art in cinema to create feelings and emotions. The lighting of the film offers the audience an awe experience as it is professionally used with the camera shots done artistically. All the aspects of this film collaborate in ensuring the audience gets a lifetime thrilling experience!","id":"5e39a411d1a8930016d04315","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e39a411d1a8930016d04315","movie_id":589518}

Hideo continues to prove he's a master of suspense and, honestly, it's the only reason I'd think about watching this again - for the few moments that Hideo provides us that makes the heart race.\r\nWith a ending worthy of the cringe-worthy award, especially with the final two moments, Sadako doesn't really hold up to the legacy that the Ring franchise has held for so long. I kind of wish they'd let Sadako haunt her well in peace and let her be at this point. \r\n\r\nWith a slightly underwhelming ninth film, it's definitely time to exorcise Sadako, let her move on from her cursed state, and throw the towel in with this one. Sadako barely holds up - a tenth would be physically incapable of holding up anything else.","id":"5df8bc6360975000123002d3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5df8bc6360975000123002d3","movie_id":583132}

{"author":"Sheldon Nylander","content":"It\u2019s hard to write a review for this film without any major spoilers, so this might seem a little vague here and there. There will be very minor spoilers, primarily what\u2019s revealed in the opening text crawl or the trailers, so not much, but if you want to go into this film completely virgin, stop here.\r\n\r\nThe film starts off with things already underway. A transmission has been sent out that contains the voice of Emperor Palpatine. Kylo Ren, now Supreme Leader of the First Order, goes to seek out Palpatine as a potential threat to his power. In the meantime, the Resistance is still in shambles after the events of \u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d and they are busy doing scouting missions and regrouping.\r\n\r\nAll of this is revealed in the opening crawl of the movie, which is where the problems begin. It violates a cardinal rule of storytelling: Show, don\u2019t tell. It wouldn\u2019t have taken much to have this done on screen in more dramatic and effective fashion. Instead, this has the effect of making it feel like we either missed something important or that we\u2019re watching an entirely different movie with a different story. This makes things confusing. It doesn\u2019t help that I was already thinking that J.J. Abrams probably needs to go back to Screenwriting 101 during the opening crawl. Not a good way to start.\r\n\r\nOther things happen during the course of the movie that make no sense. Why does Kylo Ren reforge his helmet? We never really find that out. He just does. The Knights of Ren do appear in this film finally. Who are they? If you\u2019re expecting an answer of any kind, you\u2019ll be disappointed. Why is there this strange connection between Rey and Kylo Ren? One of the mysteries of the Force, I suppose. Characters who we don\u2019t know appear from nowhere having been significant to the goings on even though we\u2019ve never seen them before. Other characters take bizarre and up to now not even hints at character arcs. It becomes a horrendously confusing mess.\r\n\r\nI liked some of the more controversial aspects of \u201cThe Last Jedi.\u201d Rey being a nobody with no significant parentage? Great idea! The galaxy is a big place. Why does everyone have to be related? Well, this is adjusted slightly. I won\u2019t go into details, but it was disappointing what they did, in my opinion. Leia\u2019s story arc in this film is...weird. I\u2019m going to allow that it\u2019s due to the loss of Carrie Fisher and having to use archival footage (one scene that shows a young Luke and Leia using computer effects is freaky at best). But it\u2019s off-putting and feels tacked on for convenience. It was nice to see Lando return, although even that felt more like throwing a bone to the fans. He could have potentially been replaced by any character with flying skills. Speaking of such, Wedge does make finally make an appearance, but it\u2019s a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it moment.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s how I would sum it up spoiler-free: As I said, I liked \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d a lot, including parts that many didn\u2019t like or found weird as I stated above, but at the same time it was not a problem-free movie for me. \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker\u201d is the exact opposite. It definitely has some really cool moments, but feels so sloppy and makes so many storytelling mistakes that, on the whole, I have to say that it\u2019s a bad movie. I\u2019ve said this about just about everything I\u2019ve seen come from J.J. Abrams, that he\u2019s great at coming up with interesting imagery. He gets these pictures in his head of something that would be really interesting to see on film, like flashes one might remember from a dream. For example, there\u2019s a great scene near the end that finally corrects what many consider a great injustice done in an earlier movie. But couching these images in a cohesive story is not his strong suit. In fact, he\u2019s downright terrible at it. This problem seemed to be going in full force in \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker.\u201d\r\n\r\nWere some of my complaints addressed in some expanded material? I don\u2019t know, but even if they were it would still make it bad storytelling. Star Wars has always been fairly good about keeping things self-contained. Expanded material adds extra background to enhance the enjoyment of the main material, like adding seasoning, but shouldn\u2019t be necessary to appreciate the meal.\r\n\r\nOverall, you need to see this movie to close out the Skywalker Saga, but that\u2019s really the only reason. Don\u2019t go into this expecting a good or even decent film, or for every question to be answered. Ultimately, it\u2019s a disappointing end to Star Wars, and I say this as a Star Wars fan.","id":"5dfcb04f65686e001390cd34","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dfcb04f65686e001390cd34","movie_id":181812}
{"author":"Vogel","content":"Well.. this was dull.\r\n\r\nLet me give you a little context to understand better how I felt during this movie. Firstly: I'm NOT a big Star Wars fan. I like the movies and see them as a \"good\" franchise, but I wouldn't put any of them on my personal top lists.\r\n\r\nI enjoy the art of the franchise way more than the story. I LOVE the music, the design of ships and the visual world building. I like some aspects of the overall story more than others of course, but none really come to mind when I think of what I like about the movies in general.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I felt \"The Force Awakens\" was really boring. Just a generic movie trying to do \"the Star Wars things\". It was fine but not in any way memorable to me.\r\n\r\n\"The Last Jedi\" on the other hand really tried ignoring the big \"Star Wars cult\" and therefore entertained me the most of all the 9 movies. I prefered the focus on using the \"Star Wars\" world to tell a story rather then to tell another \"Star Wars\"-version.\r\n\r\n\"The Rise of Skywalker\" now is at best as boring as \"The Force Awakens\" and very often a big punch in the face to everything I liked about \"The Last Jedi\". Obviously the higher ups at Disney decided to take notes on everything \"the fans\" disliked about the 8th movie and do some sort of \"damage control\" according to that feedback.\r\n\r\nThe movie hast way too much going on for reasons which are often non-existant or just plainly bad. Since the movie couldn't grab my focus I just happened to think more about the big plotholes and started nitpicking and sometimes even mocking the movie for certain decisions which I don't want to spoil here.\r\n\r\nIt's really a shame. I hope Disney will use the name in the future to do standalone movies of different genres, for example a racing movie in space would be great or a good action flick with one or two of the beloved characters.\r\n\r\nIf I had to give it a rating I would probably give the movie a 4-6\/10. I only REALLY enjoyed one scene because I hoped for it to happen most of the movie, but that didn't save the rest.","id":"5dfbc0ea26dac100145c1e4f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dfbc0ea26dac100145c1e4f","movie_id":181812}
{"author":"TheJordanFaulkner","content":"This movie is really awesome. It took me two viewings to truly cement the way I truly feel about this film. But upon second viewing this film was not just an entertaining blast from start to finish but to be honest a perfect conclusion to the Skywalker story. The film traverses the stories of the previous films in order to bring all those stories together for a culmination that is truly satisfying. The cinematography and visual effects as usual are outstanding in the film but this film seems to have a unique feel that adds to the foreboding tone kept consistent throughout. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley as Rey and Kylo truly shine in this film and are both giving their a - game and prove that they are both incredible actors and extremely emotionally flexible (particularly Ridley). The Arc of Kylo Ren is by far the highlight of this trilogy and in this film and the conclusion of said arc is immensely satisfying, Reys story also takes a surprising turn which I found immensely satisfying in hindsight. As a conclusion to my favourite series of all time I was left immensely pleased with the final sequence of the film which brings all of this lore together in a way I couldn\u2019t predict to be this poignant. This film overall was a wonderful farewell to this saga that was so satisfying and enjoyable that I will look back on this saga with great nostalgia and adoration that I hope to show my children as a whole nine part saga and I am immensely honoured to have been part of this moment in pop culture and to get to view this conclusion is a truly wonderful thing for me. It\u2019s with this i farewell the galaxy far far away with immense satisfaction.","id":"5e07d6044c1d9a0013e29638","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e07d6044c1d9a0013e29638","movie_id":181812}

Why?\", and you won't be able to answer because you won't know either.\r\n\r\nIt validates **your** blind optimism over everyone else's cool deliberation, because our so-called heroes just blunder their way through every peril imaginable without any logic, strategy or preparedness, yet they come out unscathed for [reasons].

{"author":"Matthew Brady","content":"\u201cDo it!\u201d\r\n\r\nI\u2019m surprised they added that in there despite all the memes.\r\n\r\nAnyway\u2026\r\n\r\nA long time ago...four years to be distinct; the space opera \u2018Star Wars\u2019 returned to cinemas with \u2018The Force Awakens', that brought back the bittersweet experience that fans have been craving for over 30 years. Well lets just say Christmas was magical that year. While I wasn\u2019t quite as wowed as everyone else, but I still enjoyed it otherwise and I was interested where the story will go after J.J. Abrams left his \u201cmystery box\u201d of questions for another director to answer. How exciting and epic the next years will be.\r\n\r\nAnd then the sequel and two spin-offs happened. Well lets just say my interest for these new movies has completely evaporated. Sad times indeed. And no I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m being overly negative in the heat this movie is receiving, because right now, at this very moment, my thoughts and overall feeling on this movie are genuine, and re-watching it isn\u2019t going to safe it. I\u2019m not disappointed or angry, because at this point I stopped caring.\r\n\r\n\u2018Rise of Skywalker\u2019 is a factory made movie with no heart, no soul, and no magic. Words and phrases like: bold, epic, and satisfying - are not the type of words that I would describe this final chapter in the Skywalker saga. I can\u2019t call something bold if it played things incredibly safe. Each movie exists just to shred up and apologize for what came before it.\r\n\r\nJ.J. Abrams can be hit or miss sometimes, but I must admit he had a difficult task to follow up on \u2018Last Jedi\u2019 and Rian Johnson undoing his mystery box questions. If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, the death of Carrie Fisher also had a massive effect on the story, and including her into the movie, while respecting her legacy and giving her as much screen time with the limited deleted footage they have. Abrams sadly treads on familiar ground and doesn't really handle the originals (or even the prequels) with respect. This is literally a remake of \u2018Return of The Jedi\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe story in this movie is almost nonexistent. It\u2019s so rushed that you can\u2019t catch a breather amidst the chaos. Nothing flows naturally. Characters running around and jumping from location to location. I think the quick pace easily hides the poor writing and plot holes. I also thought the title crawl is a bit off and felt it was written by a Reddit user. From the moment the movie starts until it ends nothing makes a lick of sense.\r\n\r\nI think the biggest waste of opportunity is the character of Finn, because the potential of greatness was set up in \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019, and they didn\u2019t do a single thing with it. I mean, a Stormtrooper who revolt against the corrupt and sinister empire, which is something we haven\u2019t seen before. Heck, a long time ago he held a lightsaber. Unfortunately in this movie he\u2019s a comedic buffoon that sweats and shouts a lot. What a waste of John Boyega\u2019s talent. They did him dirty.\r\n\r\nI like Daisy Ridley, not so much on Rey. I don\u2019t want to jump on any bandwagon here, but I don\u2019t understand how someone can be so over powered and skillful at the force with barely any training. Whenever there is training it\u2019s over before you know it. There was a point where I said to myself, \u201cWho taught her to do that?\u201d, or \u201chow the hell did she do that?\u201d. I really struggled to emotionally connect with Rey, because there\u2019s nothing more dull than a character with no flaws or growth.\r\n\r\nThe strongest element throughout these three movies was Kylo Ren by the magnificent Adam Driver. This guy literally carried this series on his back. At least his character as an arc, and not just wasted potential. I actually connected with his inner conflict between the dark side and the light side.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography looks beautiful and absolutely striking. The visuals and music will always be great with these movies regardless on the actual movie.\r\n\r\nEmperor Palpatine is back...for some reason. The vague explanation of why he\u2019s back made it clear to me that Disney had no plan from the start for these new movies. Still, Ian McDiarmid is fantastic as always. He oozes with evil and soaks up every wicked moment of it.\r\n\r\nThe awkward and ill-placed comedy from \u2018Last Jedi\u2019 is still present and it got worse and worse as it went along. With this being the finale, new characters still get introduce and get some development. Like, why are you introducing new characters now? Billy Dee Williams returns as the slick and classy Lando, but sadly doesn't really do much for the story. Richard E. Grant is great as the ruthless new commander of the First Oder with the small screen time he has. Dominic Monaghan, on the other hand, feels like an extra. Rose Tico has a smaller role this time around and her entire love triangle with Finn from \u2018Last Jedi\u2019 gets brush under the carpet. Kelly Marie Tran sure can\u2019t catch a break.\r\n\r\nThe action sequences with the lightsaber fights and space battles were mostly forgettable. Even the scenes that stick to mind wasn\u2019t that special. The camera fails to capture focal points with the grand scale lacking.\r\n\r\nI like how there\u2019s a lesbian couple towards the end that\u2019s on screen for about two seconds. So when the studio want to market the movie for China, they could easily edit out it to make it more \u201cmarketable\u201d. How progressive Disney.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: An unsatisfying conclusion. At least \u2018The Mandalorian\u2019 is good.","id":"5e2f275ac56d2d001a4e4868","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2f275ac56d2d001a4e4868","movie_id":181812}
{"author":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","content":"When it comes to \u201cStar Wars,\u201d being a fan comes first and a film critic comes second. I was four years old when I saw the original, and I\u2019ve been a huge devotee of all things in the galaxy for forty plus years. This isn\u2019t a review written by a disgruntled fan, as I have grown to love Rey, Poe, and BB-8 almost as much as Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and R2-D2. But when a movie is so careless with its beloved characters both past and present, it\u2019s something that can\u2019t be ignored.\r\n\r\nThe Skywalker saga comes to its disappointing end in this (supposedly) final chapter. The recycled story is basic and mostly predictable, as the surviving Resistance rallies together to face the First Order for one final battle. So much is shoved into this movie that it feels like a pressure cooker that\u2019s being forced to tell a too-rushed story. It becomes frustrating early on.\r\n\r\nI realize \u201cStar Wars\u201d is a touchy subject and fans will always be debating the films until the end of time, but \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker\u201d is one of the more mediocre entries in the series. From the reveal of Rey\u2019s (Daisy Ridley) origins to the head-scratching actions of Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) to the disappointing conclusions for Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), Finn (John Boyega), and Poe\u2019s (Oscar Isaac) stories, this thing stinks to high heaven. Almost everyone does things that are totally out of character, events happen that make absolutely no sense within the Lucas-created universe, it seems like more questions are raised than are answered, and new rules of what the Jedi can and can\u2019t do seem to be made up on the fly because they make for convenient story arcs.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not usually a literal filmgoer but this movie is so poorly plotted that its myriad problems are too abundant to ignore. Since this is a spoiler-free review I can\u2019t divulge them here, but those who\u2019ve seen the film will be able to name at least half of the dozen or so massive problems within seconds.\r\n\r\nParticularly shameful is the inexcusable way Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), who was a major character in \u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d is discarded like trash and relegated to a very minor background role in this film. Perhaps a defense could be constructed that she didn\u2019t quite fit into this part of the journey, but I say hogwash. This is absolutely a decision that feels like it was done to appease angry internet fanboys who screamed and howled about Tran and her character behind the anonymity of their keyboards. Kowtowing to bullies is a colossal setback to the very themes that root the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise.\r\n\r\nFurther aggravating to life-long fans is the sparse emotional connection that stems from the film\u2019s many fakeouts. There are zero consequences to the movie\u2019s most shocking moments. It\u2019s a crappy thing to do because it assures a near-complete loss of trust from your audience. For every gasp-inducing jolt and hold-for-tears touching moment, a sense of betrayal almost always follows.\r\n\r\nEven worse is the quality of the filmmaking. This movie is so poorly shot it\u2019s shocking, and director J.J. Abrams, who did a terrific job with \u201cThe Force Awakens,\u201d is again in the driver\u2019s seat. Only this time instead of keeping an unflappable composure behind the wheel, he\u2019s swerving in and out of traffic at such a high speed that he spins out of control and careens off the nearest cliff.\r\n\r\n\u201cRise of the Skywalker\u201d is broadly entertaining, but it\u2019s not a good movie. It\u2019s the year\u2019s biggest letdown.","id":"5e7d5b0c13a320321727b9a2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e7d5b0c13a320321727b9a2","movie_id":181812}

{"author":"Luis_989","content":"When The Force Awakens was released the vast majority of fans liked it. They were practically watching a remake of A New Hope but it was enough for them. Although they never liked Rey. That damn feminist agenda right?\r\n\r\nThe Last Jedi took that from them, it got away from the formula and they went crazy.\r\nWho was that Rian Johnson and how he dare to change the characters that only they know how they should act?\r\n\r\nThey did not give them what they wanted and that annoyed them and it's ironic because many times they have complained about the saga and its direction and if something has become clear to me it's that the great majority only want the same, like in the original trilogy. And what does that mean? Fan service. And that's what Star Wars has become.\r\n\r\nYou don't believe me? Ask fans about the scene they liked the most about Rogue One.\r\nVader's scene. A fan service scene. \r\n\r\nAnd the fear of losing the ''fans'' forced Disney to undo what they were creating, they also threw Johnson and his film under the bus and they practically announced this new film like the one that came to fix the disaster. A shame and an insult to the director's work.\r\n\r\nRise of Skywalker in my opinion represents a setback and it doesn't matter that this is supposed to be the ending. It's a setback because they decided to play it safe and submit to the whims of the audience.\r\nWhile that does not translate into poor quality, it doesn't represent something worth mentioning either. \r\n\r\nStar Wars represents pure and good entertainment but when it lacks surprises and feels so safe and predictable it means that you're sacrificing any emotional resonance and when it comes to the end of the 9 episodes, that emotion is simply not there.\r\nThat shot of Rey looking at the two suns should have felt overwhelming and thrilling and I don't know about you but I didn't feel it and that was a huge letdown. \r\n\r\nAnd that's what separates this ending from Return of The Jedi and Revenge of the Sith, even though it was known what would happen in Episode III, despite the mistakes there was emotion, here was like finishing the business. \r\n\r\nI don't consider myself a die-hard fanatic of Star Wars but I do like the saga a lot, yet in order to survive, even of its toxic fandom, they have to dare to try new stuff and forget about the original trilogy because to live in the past is to die in the present and for the saga to have a future, looking forward is the only way. \r\n\r\nIt's a very well made and entertaining film and it was a decent ending for this trilogy but quite an underwhelming conclusion for the saga as a whole.\r\n\r\nAnd the Knights of Ren? What a fucking disappointment.","id":"5dfed8b465686e0013949278","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dfed8b465686e0013949278","movie_id":181812}
{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_I enjoyed it, but I did so with a sizeable asterisk_**\r\n\r\n>_I said to Rian, \"_Jedis don't give up. I mean even if he had a problem he would maybe take a year to try and regroup, but if he made a mistake he would try and right that wrong_.\" So right there we had a fundamental difference, but it's not my story anymore. It's somebody else's story, and Rian needed me to be a certain way to make the ending effective. That's the crux of my problem. Luke would never say that, I'm sorry \u2013 well in this version. See, I'm talking about the George Lucas_ Star Wars_. This is the next generation of_ Star Wars_, so I almost had to think of Luke as another character. Maybe he's Jake Skywalker. He's not my Luke Skywalker. But I had to do what Rian wanted me to do because it served the story. But I still haven't accepted it completely._\r\n\r\n- Mark Hamill; Official Press Tour for _Star Wars: The  Last Jedi_ (December 18, 2017)\r\n\r\n>The _Force Awakens_, _I think, was the beginning of something quite solid._ The  Last Jedi_, if I'm being honest, I'd say that was feeling a bit iffy for me. I didn't necessarily agree with a lot of the choices in that and that's something that I spoke to Mark [Hamill] a lot about and we had conversations about it._\r\n\r\n- John Boyega; \"John Boyega Is on His Own Hero's Journey\" (Isaac Rouse); _HyperBeast_ (December 8, 2019)\r\n\r\n>The Last Jedi _is full of surprises and subversion and all sorts of bold choices. On the other hand, it's a bit of a meta approach to the story. I don't think that people go to_ Star Wars _to be told, \"This doesn't matter.\"_\r\n\r\n- J.J. Abrams; \"Will _Star Wars_ Stick the Landing? J.J. Abrams Will Try\" (Dave Itzkoff); _The New York Times_ (December 11, 2019)\r\n\r\nRian Johnson's _Star Wars: The Last Jedi_ (2017) was a film which divided critics and audiences to an unusual degree \u2013 on Metacritic it has a critical score of 85\/100 (the second-highest in the franchise), with 53 positive reviews against zero negative, but its audience score is only 4.4\/10 (the lowest in the franchise), with around 3,000 positive reviews against nearly 4,500 negative. In their (predominantly negative) reviews of _Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker_, many critics who championed _Last Jedi_ posit that the film was a great work of art, unfairly maligned by a toxic fanbase pissed off that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) was in a perpetual bad mood and that Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) was unacceptable because she wasn't white. And certainly, there was an element of that in the reaction some diehard fans had to the movie \u2013 the racist and sexist abuse that Tran took from such fans was shameful, and the very definition of toxicity. However, these critics essentially argue that if you didn't like _Last Jedi_, the _only_ possible explanation is that you're a racist, misogynistic, reactionary, right-wing Neanderthal \u2013 it certainly can't have anything to do with simply disliking the movie because you disliked the movie. And of course, such critics don't mention the horrid screenplay that spends 40 minutes on a side-quest that has nothing to do with the rest of the film; they don't mention how Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) withholding her plan from Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) makes not a lick of sense; they don't mention Luke throwing away his lightsaber (to hell with that scene); they don't mention how General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) was turned into comic relief; and they sure as hell don't mention resurrected flying space Jedi (to hell with that scene too). The fact is, the film is an absolute mess, and it has zero to do with skin colour or gender.\r\n\r\nAnd so, one must ask, is _Rise of Skywalker_ a course correction or a flat-out apology? I'm leaning to the former, but there can be no doubt that much of what _Last Jedi_ introduced into the canon has been unceremoniously discarded \u2013 Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is once more wearing his mask and the Knights of Ren are back; the Jedi child seen at the end of _Last Jedi_ is never mentioned; Rey's (Daisy Ridley) parentage, so casually dismissed in _Last Jedi_, is once again crucially important; Rose, that most maligned of characters, has gone the way of Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), and is barely seen. Indeed, _Rise_ is more of a sequel to J.J. Abrams's _Star Wars: The Force Awakens_ (2015) than it is to _Last Jedi_, one or two major plot points notwithstanding, and whilst _Last Jedi_ looked forward, clumsily introducing new concepts and themes to the franchise, _Rise_ follows _Force Awakens_ in doing the opposite \u2013 it looks back, and is chock-full of throwbacks and references to the previous films. And although I certainly enjoyed it as a spectacle (it looked and sounded exceptional in 3D IMAX), there's no doubt it's a deeply flawed piece of work. It's the kind of film that feels like it was created by a computer algorithm or a corporate committee trying to tick as many boxes as possible \u2013 rather than attempting something ambitious which fans _might_ not like, it's far more concerned with trying to please everyone without offending anyone. And this is only one of two impossible tasks it assigns itself.\r\n\r\nPicking up the story a few months after the events of _Last Jedi_, the war between the Resistance and the First Order is still raging. However, a recent development has altered the playing field and taken both sides by surprise \u2013 Emperor Sheev Palpatine\/Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid) has returned, having survived the events at the end of Richard Marquand's _Star Wars: The Return of the Jedi_ (1983). Revealed to have literally created Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) in a lab, Palpatine has been manipulating events from behind-the-scenes for years and now plans to harness the immense combined power of every Sith who has ever lived. As the film begins, Supreme Leader Kylo Ren, who assumed the mantle after he murdered Snoke in _Last Jedi_, is making his way to Palpatine's base on the 'hidden' planet Exegol, which can only be reached with the use of a powerful Sith Wayfinder, of which there are only two in existence. Seeing Palpatine as a threat to his leadership of the First Order, Ren is planning to kill him. However, rather than doing so, he watches in awe as Palpatine reveals a massive armada of hundreds of fearsomely powerful _Xyston_-class Star Destroyers. He then orders Ren to find and kill Rey. Meanwhile, with Luke dead, Rey is continuing her Jedi training under his sister, Leia Organa (a cobbled together 'performance' by Carrie Fisher, comprised of a combination of unused material from the previous films, body doubles, and CGI). When Poe and former First Order stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) discover that Palpatine is on Exegol, Rey learns of the necessity of the Wayfinder from Luke's notes. And so Rey, Poe, Finn, Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), and the droids C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2, BB-8, and D-O set out to find it.\r\n\r\n_Rise of Skywalker_ is directed by _Force Awakens_ director J.J. Abrams (_M:i:III_; _Super 8_; _Star Trek: Into Darkness_). Colin Trevorrow (_Safety Not Guaranteed_; _Jurassic World_; _The Book of Henry_) was originally hired as writer\/director, but he left\/was fired from the project after clashing with franchise producer Kathleen Kennedy, who seems to have a bit of a thing for firing directors, and who was dissatisfied with the script by Trevorrow and Derek Connolly (_Kong: Skull Island_; _Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_; _Pok\u00e9mon: Detective Pikachu_). In the credits for _Rise_, Abrams and Chris Terrio (_Argo_; _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_; _Justice League_) are credited with the screenplay, working from a story credited to Trevorrow, Connolly, Abrams, and Terrio, although Terrio has said in interviews that the Trevorrow\/Connolly credits were a legal requirement, and nothing of their script remains in the final film.\r\n\r\nAnd this brief bit of background chaos serves to help illuminate what is probably the biggest problem with both this film and this new trilogy as a whole \u2013 lack of narrative through-lines. At no point during _Rise_, not for one second, did it ever feel like the culmination of a nine-film arc. Hell, it barely felt like the culmination of a three-film arc. As already mentioned, _Rise_ seems more like a sequel to _Force Awakens_ than it does to _Last Jedi_, but the problem runs deeper than that; not only is there a modest disconnect between the three films in the sequel trilogy, but there's a much more important and sizable disconnect between this trilogy and the previous two \u2013 George Lucas's _A New Hope_ (1977), Irvin Kershner's _The Empire Strikes Back_ (1980), and Marquand's _Return of the Jedi_ and the Lucas-directed prequel trilogy; _Episode I: The Phantom Menace_ (1999), _Episode II: Attack of the Clones_ (2002), and _Episode III: Revenge of the Sith_ (2005). \r\n\r\nLove them or hate them, the prequels do feel like they take place in the same narrative space as the originals; they not only form a coherent and logical trilogy in and of themselves, but (Midi-chlorian foolishness aside), they also form a coherent and logical six-film arc with the original trilogy. In short, the prequel trilogy has very strong and narratively organic connective tissue to the original trilogy. Lucas himself has spoken to this connective tissue, pointing out that when you watch the originals, it's Luke's story, but when you watch the six films, it's Anakin's story. When you factor in this third trilogy, however, despite Disney dubbing the nine films the \"_Skywalker Saga_\", the overarching story essentially becomes Palpatine's, as he's the only constant in all three trilogies (apart from C-3PO and R2-D2). However, whilst Palpatine's presence in the first two trilogies is integral, woven intricately into the fabric of everything that happens, his appearance here is\u2026less so. This has the effect of making the nine-film sequence feel unbalanced, with the last three never really managing to feel like a valid continuation of the previous six. At best, they feel like a spin-off, with thematic connections and recurring characters occasionally shoehorned in to try to establish narrative continuity, but, by and large, they're their own thing \u2013 which is not how Disney has sold them at all. \r\n\r\nAll of which leaves _Rise_ with not one, but two impossible tasks \u2013 1) to somehow conclude this trilogy in such a way that it also works as the satisfying closing chapter to the nine-film _Skywalker Saga_, and 2) to somehow conclude this trilogy despite having to abandon and retcon much of what the second film did.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this trilogy's disconnection from the others was brought into relief for me by something my uncle said when we were discussing _Rise_. He's a fall-down drunk who talks to trees and may be involved in a plan to resurrect Hitler as a gay sushi chef, but he has a very interesting perspective on the _Star Wars_ films. To paraphrase, he said that to him _Force Awakens_, _Last Jedi_, and _Rise_ never felt like _Episodes VII_, _VIII_, and _IX_ \u2013 rather they felt like _Episodes X_, _XI_, and _XII_, and the \"real\" _Episode VII_, _VIII_, and _IX_ were never made. This isn't him arguing that Lucas's ideas for the third trilogy (which were rejected by Disney) should have been used and would have been awesome \u2013 rather his point is more structural; this trilogy is built on a serious of major events which take place between _Return of the Jedi_ and _Force Awakens_, which we never got to see and which fundamentally divide this trilogy from the other two. Had we been made privy to these events, however, these last three films would have had a much easier task of integrating into and ending the twelve-film _Skywalker Saga_. I have to admit, it wasn't something that had occurred to me, but the tree to whom he pitched it really sold me on the idea when it told me over the phone, and it does make a lot of narrative sense \u2013 had this been the fourth trilogy rather than the third, its connection to the first six films would have been much more organic, the story much more contiguous, and the task of bringing the entire saga to a close considerably less daunting.\r\n\r\nOf course, a big question is whether or not Disney had a specific narrative plan going into this thing, with many arguing that the lack of coherence between the three films proves that they did not. But that seems somewhat unbelievable to me. Rather (and again, I have to credit my uncle with this), it's more likely that Abrams laid groundwork for a coherent three-film arc, but Rian Johnson was more concerned with making a Rian Johnson film than a _Star Wars_ film, and ignored (if not necessarily undermined) much of Abrams's preparatory work. This also feeds into the criticism that the first hour of _Rise_ is too plot-heavy and expositionary; which could be explained if he was essentially in a position of having to do two films' worth of work in one, because plot points that should have been emphasised in _Last Jedi_, to set up the events in _Rise_, simply weren't.\r\n\r\nThe big thing here is the return of Palpatine, which has been argued to be completely arbitrary, a desperate bit of fan service from a filmmaker trying to win back fans, and which doesn't make a whole lot of narrative sense. I can certainly sympathise with those sentiments, and I agree that his return negates Vader's sacrifice at the end of _Return of the Jedi_ and makes a mockery of the whole \"_restoring balance to the Force_\" prophecy in the prequel trilogy. However (and this is the final reference to my uncle), there were a number of hints in _Force Awakens_ (that I did not pick up on) that a big bad was pulling the strings and that that big bad was Palpatine. To explain any more would constitute spoilers for _Rise_, but there are videos on YouTube posted shortly after the release of _Force Awakens_ which speculate (correctly, it turns out) that Palpatine might be involved. Taken together, it's enough to convince me that his return wasn't as arbitrary as it may seem. And although the fact that it seems that way at all is still a major problem, that's more likely the fault of Johnson rather than Abrams.\r\n\r\nThere are some smaller issues with the film, however. For example, there are far too many shots of Rey staring off into the middle-distance as she senses something (usually connected to Ren). The film also tends to treat death less than reverentially; no less than six characters die, only to return in some form or another, which cheapens and undermines both the goals of the characters and the inherent risk in attempting to achieve those goals. The quartet of main characters also remain as insipid as they were in the previous two films \u2013 Rey never gets beyond the reluctant Jedi trying to wrap her head around everything; Finn never gets beyond the token good guy who used to be bad template; Poe never gets beyond Han Solo-lite; and Ren never gets beyond the moody emo who hates his parents and so is rebelling against them by hanging out with a questionable crowd of intergalactic fascists. As you do. The structure of the plot is also poor, far too repetitive, and relying too heavily on coincidence. The biggest problem is that the whole film is built around the Resistance trying to get to Exegol. To do so they need the Wayfinder, but to get that they need this other thing, but to find that they need to go here and speak to him, but to do that they need a mystical doohickey but to get that they have to\u2026you get the picture. The whole film feels like a series of video game quests.\r\n\r\nSomething else that bothered me is a semi-spoiler, so skip this paragraph if you wish. Mimicking the scene in _A New Hope_ where the _Millennium Falcon_ swoops in to save Luke in the final battle, there's a shot towards the end of the film where a massive fleet of thousands of Resistance ships is revealed, led by Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). But where did such an armada come from? How was Lando able to assemble so many ships in such a short space of time (he has no more than a couple of days)? If such a fleet exists, why not use it before now? Visually, it's a spectacular shot, but the grandiosity is achieved by sacrificing logic.\r\n\r\nFor all that, however, I have to admit, I enjoyed _The Rise of Skywalker_ for the most part \u2013 it's a fine spectacle taken on its own terms, very loud, very over-the-top, and very entertaining. One thing that's come in for a lot in criticism is the number of callbacks to previous films. And there certainly is a lot, but, generally speaking, I thought they were fairly well-handled, logical enough and reasonably organic. For example, Palpatine tells Ren that some people consider Sith abilities to be \"unnatural\", which was exactly what Palpatine told Anakin (Hayden Christensen) in _Revenge of the Sith_; Poe and Finn are shown playing the holographic chess game on the _Falcon_; the turret gun on the _Falcon_ still has the old-school graphic readout as seen in New Hope; during her training, Rey uses the blast shield on her helmet whilst fighting a flying bot, another reference to _New Hope_; characters sink into quicksand in a scene reminiscent of the garbage compactor scene in _New Hope_; a character Force-lifts an X-Wing from a swamp just as we see Yoda doing in _Empire_; there's a scene of Palpatine and Rey watching a nearby space battle, just as Palpatine and Luke do in _Return of the Jedi_.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, as one would expect, everything looks and sounds great, particularly Palpatine's base on Exegol. Abrams and cinematographer Dan Mindel (_John Carter_; _The Amazing Spider-Man 2_; _Pacific Rim: Uprising_) shoot these scenes like it's a horror movie \u2013 deep chiaroscuro shadows, ominous caverns disappearing in the background, unnaturally powerful lightening flashing from above. This tone is helped immeasurably by the production design by Rick Carter (_Forrest Gump_; _A.I. Artificial Intelligence_; _Avatar_), which really sells the vast otherworldliness of the place. Equally important here is the sound design by David Acord (_Guardians of the Galaxy_; _Avengers: Age of Ultron_; _The Secret Life of Pets_), which features a constant chatter of unearthly and disembodied voices, like a thousand ghosts all whispering at once. \r\n\r\nThe whole thing has a dark vibe the likes of which we've never really seen in _Star Wars_, and the scenes here are probably the best in the film, from a craft perspective if nothing else. The scenes showing Rey and Ren speaking to one another via Force Dyad are also excellent. These scenes were easily the best part of _Last Jedi_, and they're just as good here, as we see the background of one character's location appearing behind the other character, with the backgrounds shifting from one to the other as the scenes play out. A lightsaber fight makes particularly good use of the Dyad, with events in one location having an unexpected effect on events in the other.\r\n\r\nSo, all things considered, although I enjoyed _The Rise of Skywalker_ and found it a vast improvement over _Last Jedi_, it never touches greatness. Everything feels workshopped and focus-grouped to within an inch of its life, and the spark of originality that was so prevalent in the original trilogy and less so in the prequels seems almost extinguished. It looks great, and it's both exciting and entertaining, but it's also safe and predictable in a way that none of the films were when Lucas was still in charge. And sure, you might say that fans rejected _Last Jedi_ because it took too many risks, and now they reject _Rise_ because it doesn't take enough, and there's probably some truth to that. But the fact is that the film never feels like a closing chapter, not because it looks like there'll be more chapters, rather because it never seems to know how to conclude the story with much in the way of satisfaction. I enjoyed it whilst I was watching it and it's a decent enough _Star Wars_ movie, with some terrific individual scenes. But as the final entry of a 42-year-old franchise (the most popular franchise in any medium in human history), the whole thing is, perhaps inevitably, a little disappointing.","id":"5e13fed59020120015b96ddc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e13fed59020120015b96ddc","movie_id":181812}
{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps:\/\/www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t know by now, I\u2019m a massive Star Wars fan. I love the original trilogy, but the prequels\u2026 not so much. However, Disney\u2019s sequel trilogy has delivered two of my favorite movies of the whole franchise, so its conclusion was obviously one of my most anticipated moments of the year. If that wasn\u2019t enough to leave everyone excited, add the fact that it also means the end of the Skywalker Saga, and the pressure suddenly becomes 10x heavier. I went in with moderately high expectations, with not even a glimpse of any trailer or TV spot, just like I did with Avengers: Endgame. The latter surpassed my expectations and delivered a near-perfect conclusion to the Infinity Saga\u2026\r\n\r\nThe Rise of Skywalker is a tremendous letdown. I won\u2019t sugarcoat it. If someone told me at the beginning of the year that J.J. Abrams wouldn\u2019t be able to offer a satisfying end to the nine-episode story, I would laugh like crazy. It disappointed me so much that I don\u2019t even want to extend this review more than the usual. I know that a lot of people hated The Last Jedi, but for better or worse, that film exists. Rian Johnson\u2019s decisions were made. Some people received them well, some didn\u2019t. But all of us got to watch and experience his narrative.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s something called artistic integrity, which J.J. Abrams and Chris Terrio completely forgot about. The lack of respect for the saga\u2019s previous installment is baffling. The structure-less screenplay is so unbelievably convoluted that it reaches a point where evident logical issues come into play. Major plot points occur due to some genuinely hard-to-believe events, and even the characters seem to have no path whatsoever. It\u2019s entertainment for the sake of entertainment.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are a lot of visually jaw-dropping action sequences. The cinematography (Dan Mindel) is some of the best I\u2019ve seen in the franchise and in this year. John Williams\u2019 score is emotionally compelling, and it definitely elevates a lot of important moments, being a big source for the chills down my body. And yes, there are a bunch of epic scenes. However, throughout the whole runtime, the frustration was always there. Major threads and character backstories were answered in The Last Jedi, but The Rise of Skywalker feels more like another sequel to The Force Awakens than to Rian Johnson\u2019s flick.\r\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one undeniable aspect about this trilogy that this last movie proves is that there was no plan. No roadmap. No overall structure. Whether you love or hate each or every installment, this is indisputable. Disney screwed up this time. Creative freedom is essential to filmmakers, but the production team behind a franchise needs to have a well-organized structure. The simple fact that J.J. Abrams directed the first film, left and returned to do the third one, is already weird and uncommon by itself.\r\n\r\nBesides the lack of artistic integrity, there\u2019s this feeling of constant disappointment throughout the movie. On several occasions, The Rise of Skywalker is so close to delivering a perfect sequence. A chill-inducing moment. An incredibly emotional scene. Almost every time, it fails at the last second, at the last line of dialogue, or at the last action movement. Some moments are still captivating, and they don\u2019t lose that much impact. Nevertheless, some are totally destroyed by the most ridiculous, cringe-worthy choices I\u2019ve witnessed in the saga.\r\n\r\nThe first act is devoid of any thought. Characters go to places to get something they need to another place so that in that place, they find something else that leads them into another place\u2026 It\u2019s frenetic, out-of-control pacing. The desperation to set up so many different side stories in time is so prominent that it\u2019s visible from another galaxy. From the second act on, things get a bit more clear, and in the third act, all the threads blend decently. It\u2019s in the last 30 minutes that the resemblances to Avengers: Endgame come into play. The only difference is that it doesn\u2019t have 1\/10 of the emotional impact due to the questionable decisions I mentioned above.\r\n\r\nOnly one character got his arc complete without detours or significant changes: Kylo Ren. J.J. set him up, Rian Johnson continued his journey, and J.J. closed his arc pretty well. Every other character either got their arcs complete with major changes throughout, or they didn\u2019t come close to finish their own story. There\u2019s one exception, though, and that\u2019s Carrie Fischer\u2019s Leia. It would be extremely disrespectful and unfair for someone to criticize the filmmakers about her. They inserted her reasonably well in the scenes (please, if someone complains about visual effects, just get lost), and they did the absolute best they could under the known circumstances. I might be extremely disappointed, but I do have to send the team my congrats for closing her arc in the most dignified way possible.\r\n\r\nAs for everyone else\u2026 well, the cast has been outstanding from the very beginning. Adam Driver, I have no words for him. He\u2019s so perfect as Kylo Ren that I even defend his character as a villain more layered and emotionally complex than Darth Vader. I love Daisy Ridley as Rey, and she does a phenomenal job in this last film, even when her dialogue doesn\u2019t entirely suit her. John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and everyone else (who I won\u2019t mention due to possible spoilers) are all brilliant, and I have to congratulate them on making every single movie a bit better.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know what more should I write. I have very mixed feelings about it. I love a lot of the epic moments, the film looks absolutely stunning, and the action sequences are genuinely jaw-dropping. However, I strongly disagree with some decisions made by J.J. Abrams and Chris Terrio, especially the ones that make The Last Jedi feel like it didn\u2019t exist. This lack of artistic integrity plus the constant disappointments regarding each big moment\u2019s climax ruins one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Despite the brilliant performances from the cast, only Kylo Ren got his arc complete without significant changes. The Force Awakens set up some mysterious questions. The Last Jedi answered them. The Rise of Skywalker\u2026 also answered them. It\u2019s one of my biggest letdowns ever, but I\u2019ll still save the Skywalker Saga close to my heart. Next time, just build a roadmap, Disney\u2026\r\n\r\nRating: C","id":"5e00e9a826dac10012644d3b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e00e9a826dac10012644d3b","movie_id":181812}

Build a campsite, create some intricate traps, slaughter the local wildlife and even murder each other. The insurance costs must\u2019ve been catastrophic!\r\n\r\nKhalfoun conceives a ridiculously contrived premise and, essentially, serves it to the demonic beast entity thing that prowls the luscious jungles of the island. What is a horror film without suspense? What is a psychological thriller without character development? What is a film without entertainment? Khalfoun irrefutably understands no element into adequate filmmaking. None! Cheap mundane jump scares that were predictable right down to the very second. More plot holes than a washed up sponge from the nearby capsized boat. Enough foreshadowing to plunge the island into everlasting darkness. Aside from Miller who atleast attempted to bypass the shoddy script he was given, the acting was weaker than a coconut branch surviving a monsoon. Expositional flashbacks, that resembled advertisements for a \u201chot rod\u201d vehicle, clumsily spliced into the main narrative through inexplicably basic editing.\r\n\r\nHowever, what truly makes Prey a bloodthirsty piece of life drainage, are the details. We are to believe that a young girl and her mother, have lived on the island for over a decade. That\u2019s fine and all, but when she looks fresher than a speared fish, something\u2019s not right. Eyebrows plucked, makeup on point, hair pristinely straight as she conditions using TRESemm\u00e9. You sure she didn\u2019t reside in a salon for a decade? Not to mention Toby transforms into Bear Grylls in a matter of days. Where the hell did that come from!?\r\n\r\nKhalfoun attempts to fool audiences by leading viewers down the path of imagination. Inferring that the protagonist is in fact fabricating all this nonsense. The five minute self-conversational scene explicitly hypothesised that his lunacy was profound. Yet whilst that would\u2019ve been clich\u00e9d and typically dull, that scenario would\u2019ve fared better than the one devised by Khalfoun. Cult rituals. Voodoo shenanigans. Cave full of multi-coloured paintings. All culminating into an ending that made me want to squish some numbing berries onto the disc and serve it to the beast itself. What was that? Seriously! I loathe endings that make the whole ordeal pointless. Detest them. Especially when there was a perfectly available boat in the middle of the film! Where did the rescue raft go that was beached by the programme manager? The CGI demonic swine could obviously swim, considering that atrocious conclusion.\r\n\r\nUrgh. No more. Atleast Robbins\u2019 cinematography made the idyllic island endurable. Prey exercises all of the worst traits found in uninspired low-budget horrors, and doesn\u2019t even attempt to hide from its predatory allurement, consequently cementing this as one of the worst of the year.","id":"5e206da80102c900163ca135","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e206da80102c900163ca135","movie_id":401410}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_An emotive family drama that will disappoint those hoping for sci-fi bombast_**\r\n\r\n>_Anyone who sits on top of the largest hydrogen-oxygen fuelled system in the world, knowing they're going to light the bottom, and doesn't get a little worried, does not fully understand the situation._\r\n\r\n- Cpt. John Young (commander of the _Columbia_ for STS-1 in 1981, the inaugural spaceflight of NASA's Space Shuttle program)\r\n\r\n> Q: _Aside from the obvious differences, how do you assess the differences in men and women astronauts?_\r\n\r\n>A: _Aside from the obvious differences, I don't think there are any._\r\n\r\n- Sally Ride (the first American woman in space) answering a question at a _Challenger_ crew press conference for STS-7 in 1983\r\n\r\nWritten by Alice Winocour and Jean-St\u00e9phane Bron, and directed by Winocour, _Proxima_ is the story of a mother and daughter trying to cope with impending separation. The fact that the mother is an astronaut and that the separation will result from a year-long mission to Mars is very much secondary. Instead, we're presented with something more universal and relatable \u2013 the often contradictory responsibilities one has to one's profession and one's family. At the same time, this (unapologetically feminist) film looks at the demands placed on a woman in a male dominated field where machoism counts for something. More akin to \"science fact\" films such as Philip Kaufman's _The Right Stuff_ (1983) and Damien Chazelle's _First Man_ (2018) than recent science-fiction work such as Pella K\u00e5german and Hugo Lilja's _Aniara_ (2018) or James Gray's _Ad Astra_ (2019), _Proxima_ is a quiet story that maps in great detail the sheer force of will it takes to get into the condition necessary to go space. And although the narrative does sag in a couple of places, and Winocour frustratingly abandons realism in a crucial scene towards the end, _Proxima_ is brilliantly acted throughout. It certainly won't appeal to those looking for the grandiosity or existentialism of classic sci-fi, but it remains a moving examination of motherhood.\r\n\r\nIn the near future, Sarah Loreau (a superb Eva Green) is a French astronaut based at the European Astronaut Centre (ESC) in Cologne. The only woman in the program, she lives with Stella (a stunning Z\u00e9lie Boulant-Lemesle), her seven-year-old daughter. Unexpectedly, Sarah is chosen as a replacement for a crew member on the _Proxima_ mission \u2013 a year-long three-person final exploratory mission to Mars before colonisation begins. Sarah begins her training at ESC, before travelling to the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Star City, Russia, and finally to the launch site at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Alongside her are mission commander Mike Shannon (an excellent Matt Dillion), an experienced, but smug loudmouth who publically welcomes Sarah to the team by noting that as she's a French woman, she's probably a good cook, and Anton Ocheivsky (Aleksey Fateev), a soft-spoken Ukrainian cosmonaut. At the same time, Sarah is attempting to transition Stella into getting used to living with her father, Thomas (Lars Eidinger), a German astrophysicist from whom Sarah is amicably separated. However, the demands of the job and the concomitant separation put a huge strain on the bond between Sarah and Stella, to the extent that Sarah starts to consider dropping out of the mission altogether.\r\n\r\nProxima is Winocour's third film after _Augustine_ (2012) and the criminally underrated _Maryland_ (2015), both of which deal with intense, highly skilled men who are torn between their professional and private lives, in a similar manner to so many Michael Mann protagonists (and antagonists). With _Proxima_, however, Winocour moves into uncharted territory \u2013 although the protagonist here faces a similar struggle, for the first time, that protagonist is female.\r\n\r\nOne way Winocour examines the theme of private vs. professional is her use of a recurring motif involving an ESC employee trying to get Sarah to sign papers stating whether or not she wants to be informed should anything happen to Stella. The knee-jerk reaction, of course, is that she should sign them immediately \u2013 what kind of person wouldn't want to know if their child was ill or even dead? However, as Winocour presents it, it's more complicated than that; think of Sarah's helplessness \u2013 she'd be stuck in space knowing that Stella is dead, but having to complete her assignment anyway. And so Sarah finds her attachment to Stella in conflict with her commitment to the longevity of the mission. \r\n\r\nHowever, this motif also taps into other thematic concerns. For example, it speaks to the complexity and profundity of what it means to leave the Earth and live in space for a year. At the same time, it's part of the feminist restructuring of a traditionally male narrative. By suggesting that a mother might choose her job over her daughter, even if only for a year, Winocour highlights that whilst it's socially acceptable for men to leave children behind (Mike speaks proudly of his young sons), it's something of a social taboo that women could do so. Another element of the film's feminine (if not necessarily feminist) quality relates to practical biological differences. For example, Sarah is told that tampons count towards her personal weight limit, whilst she has to be moulded for a smaller chair than Mike and Anton. In relation to Sarah being a sole woman in a man's world, in the film's EPK, Winocour explains,\r\n\r\n>_it's a male environment, conceived by men for men. For example, spacesuits are weighted on the shoulders because men have strong shoulders, whereas women are stronger in the hips. Women have to work twice as hard to gain entry to this man's world, but they mustn't make their presence felt either. The film pays tribute to women who have to reconcile all this._\r\n\r\nShe specifically cites Claudie Haigner\u00e9 and Samantha Cristoforetti as influences.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, in a very subtle moment, after Stella moves in with Lars, there's a scene of her going onto his balcony with a telescope, but rather than using it to look at the heavens, she uses it to watch some children playing below. The moment passes fairly quickly, and without any kind of overt commentary from Winocour, but subtle thematic moments like this occur throughout the film. Another such example is when Anton tells Sarah, \"_the hardest part isn't leaving, it's coming back to find life has continued without you_\". That's a pretty profound line, and it's at the heart of Sarah's dilemma \u2013 what will happen whilst she's away; life won't simply stop and wait for her to return, and it's the thought of the endless possibilities that she'll be powerless to influence which is eating at her resolve and commitment.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, the film adopts a realist approach which is almost documentarian in places. Clearly, Winocour and Bron did huge amounts of research, and it helps the sense of authenticity immensely that it was shot on location at the real ESC, Yuri Gagarin Centre, and Baikonur Cosmodrome; in the case of the Yuri Gagarin Centre, _Proxima_ was the first feature film granted access to shoot in the real prophylactorium, with the crew granted the same accreditation as the on-site scientists. In terms of the look of the film, Winocour states,\r\n\r\n>_with regard to space, American movies have swamped all others, and my goal was to make a European space movie. That explains our collaboration with the European Space Agency, to tether the film to a documentary base. In Hollywood pictures, the astronaut verges on superhuman, but my research with ESA showed me there was nothing more human and fragile than an astronaut. Going into space means experiencing human fragility and realising just how attached we are to the Earth._\r\n\r\nIn this way, she ties theme and aesthetic to one another; each influencing and giving rise to the other.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, certainly, if you go into this expecting sci-fi, you're going to be bitterly disappointed. Although it has to be said, I can hardly blame people, given the misleading trailer. However, the film itself makes no bones about the fact that it's the story of a mother and daughter, not a piece of science fiction, and one can only really engage with it on its own terms, not the terms of the trailer. Another issue is that the narrative does drag in places, and ten minutes or so could have been shaved off the run time. Perhaps the biggest issue I had is that Winocour abandons her rigid adherence to realism for a sequence towards the end of the film which not only strains credibility but is tonally different from everything around it. Finally, outside Sarah and Stella, and to a lesser extent Mike, none of the characters are fleshed out. Again, however, this is the story of these two characters before it is anything else.\r\n\r\n_Proxima_ is a small story of a mother and her daughter set against a vast background \u2013 the macro is simply the context for the micro. Examining the pain of separation and the clash between the professional and the private from a uniquely feminist point of view, it carries a universal message that will surely speak to any mother who has wrestled with the conflict between pursuing her own dreams and the demands placed on her by having children, a conflict which Winocour suggests is more socially acceptable for men. However, make no mistake, this is a celebration of the feminine rather than a woke attack on the masculine \u2013 men aren't the butt of the joke or the target of anger, they're simply not very important to the story Winocour is telling. A space movie about a woman that takes place entirely on Earth, _Proxima_ is another strong piece of work from a very talented director.","id":"5e65b640459ad6001159c66c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e65b640459ad6001159c66c","movie_id":478860}

{"author":"worldfilmgeek","content":"This pretty funny indie comedy definitely has found its breakout star in Allie Loukas, whose mannerisms will bring the likes of Ellie Kemper and Ashley Clements to mind.\r\n\r\nKathryn has had a rough life since her mother Elizabeth married the domineering Todd. Her work life as a fashionista has not gone so great either, with her co-worker always hounding her. Hoping she finds a change in her life someday, it all happens at a social event at home. When the toilet is clogged, her mother asks Kathryn to call a plumber. Bob O\u2019Link, the plumber who arrives, is shocked to learn that Elizabeth is the woman he met 25 years ago and had a one-night stand with and that Bob is Kathryn\u2019s biological father.\r\n\r\nKathryn, having enough of Todd\u2019s domineering ways, moves out of the house and with Bob\u2019s help, moves to an apartment with Raymundo, a friend of hers. As Bob and Kathryn slowly begin to know each other, Kathryn finds herself moving to a better place within her. However, when Kathryn shows Bob a piece she has written, he finds himself proud of her and in the midst of things, Bob and Elizabeth begin to slowly bond again, much to the chagrin of Todd. At a dinner, everything falls apart and despite his attempt to knock some sense into Kathryn, Bob finds himself at a crossroads. Will Kathryn be able to snap out of it and return to her better place?\r\n\r\nYou might not know the name Allie Loukas, but after seeing this film you will. Her big debut comes in the form of this film, which Loukas stars, directs, wrote, and produced. She proves herself here she is an upcoming tour-de-force. As the broken Kathryn, Loukas channels the likes of comediennes Ellie Kemper and Ashley Clements with her performance as someone who has a chance for a change in her life upon the meeting of her long-lost biological father.\r\n\r\nLoukas also was involved in casting and she couldn\u2019t have found a better support system with this film as the chemistry between her and Christopher M. Walsh, as her real father Bob, is great as well as her comic chemistry with Carlton G. McBeth, as the flamboyant Raymundo, is just perfect. Angela Beckefeld\u2019s Elizabeth also is a key figure in the story as like Kathryn, she slowly changes as it is clear that her husband Todd, played by David Bastian, is a total scumbag who thinks he can control her as he pleases and despises Kathryn because she is not his child.\r\n\r\nAnother comic highlight comes in the form of Matt Edmonds, whose character Gustav pops up and brings the ridiculousness to the film but in a good way. As for Bob\u2019s partner Phil, played by Darren Marlar, he and Walsh have some funny chemistry as if this is what you would expect from real-life co-workers in the field perhaps. One being level-headed and one, well, not so much. The story is what one would expect, a little predictability, but nevertheless, one that will make you want to embark on a journey to see our titular character change in such a positive manner.\r\n\r\nKathryn Upside Down will definitely make you remember the name Allie Loukas, a star in the making with her comic-style wit and emotional range, bringing to mind the likes of Ellie Kemper and Ashley Clements. Check this film out to see a wonderful debut for her. Let's hope she does more films in the future.","id":"5cdc68f50e0a262dcfcc593c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cdc68f50e0a262dcfcc593c","movie_id":602541}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nBrightburn is one of those few movies throughout the year that can grab everyone\u2019s attention solely due to its premise. In a world where the superhero genre is oversaturated with almost a comic-book-based film each month, the Gunn family delivers an unique concept that I don\u2019t think it was ever explored this way. \u201cWhat if Superman was evil?\u201d is an idea that can be developed through so many different ways, depending on the director and screenwriters\u2019 approach. David Yarovesky clearly drew inspiration from Zack Snyder\u2019s version (Man of Steel), and that\u2019s where the movie is best: in exploring the vast and interesting possibilities that a screenplay like this can pursue.\r\n\r\nUsually, when someone writes something along the lines of \u201cit felt like two movies\u201d, it\u2019s not a good sign. Brightburn is a dark, mysterious and suspenseful film during the first half, but then it pretty much transforms itself into a horror-slasher flick, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. I firmly believe that no audience member (and I would even dare write critics as well) will leave the theater completely satisfied or entirely disappointed. If you expected the Gunn family to delve deep into Superman\u2019s mythology and explore some twisty paths, they do rely on classic scenes to show how it all could have been if \u201cClark Kent\u201d wasn\u2019t a nice boy.\r\n\r\nIf you were expecting a movie closer to the horror genre, the last half of the film offers some good sequences. However, that\u2019s when the movie loses what made me go watch it in the first place. It\u2019s a very short film and it ends in a way that leaves me wanting more. The big problem here is that it\u2019s likely not going to get a sequel, and it could have easily added extra 20-30 minutes to deliver a more fulfilled story.\r\n\r\nProduction-wise, having in mind its low budget, it looks remarkably great. Some good moments of gorgeous cinematography, and beautiful wide shots. The jump scare sequences of the second half aren\u2019t nearly as effective as they could be, but at least the editing throughout the entire runtime is seamless. With a few more creative and entertaining scenes, Brightburn could have been a lot more menacing and scarier. I only remembered it was R-rated once the first bloody and quite violent moment occurs, and these specific moments are definitely eye-opening, gruesome and horrifying, even though it gets too over-the-top a couple of times.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Banks (Tori Breyer) delivers a notable performance, as well as David Denman (Kyle Breyer). Their characters have a compelling backstory, and they actually have a well-developed script. They don\u2019t make dumb or irrational decisions, like the generic horror characters that we all recognize. Jackson A. Dunn (Brandon) is pretty good as the evil Superman, even if his performance ends up being too monotonous for me. Looking at the overall feedback from both critics and audience, this seems to be part of those rare films each year which I enjoy a bit more than most people.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Brightburn doesn\u2019t take off powerfully like Superman, but it\u2019s still able to fly for a bit. With good performances, remarkable production design, and an adequate use of its R-rating, the Gunn family delivers an incredibly captivating concept which is explored through an interesting yet unfulfilling screenplay. The second half turns the movie into a pure slasher flick, which might positively affect some viewers, but for me it took away what was really entertaining. The ending is just a taste of what the film could have been and it\u2019s disappointing that it doesn\u2019t explore its fantastic idea more in-depth, but the final feeling about the movie isn\u2019t too bad either.\r\n\r\nRating: B","id":"5d5d24996743fa00156fd350","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d5d24996743fa00156fd350","movie_id":531309}

It's an extended series of disparate Melanie Martinez music videos with a wafer-thin membrane of overarching connective tissue. If you are a fan of her music, then, obviously, you should probably watch _K-12_, not even just to \"support her\" but because her music is what makes up 90% of the runtime. Personally though, I don't care for it, which I figured meant the best option I was left with was to basically ignore all that, and just judge _K-12_ on the narrative. Which is not great. Bad, even, I think I could argue. I know that that's not the point, it's not an actual story, it's a music presentation. But to watch this **as a movie** it doesn't work. I even watched _K-12_ with somebody who specifically does like Melanie Martinez's music, and even she was yelling at the screen's nonsense.

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Ugly, bleak, gritty, and enjoyable_**\r\n\r\n> _The idea was to write a western that would work as a genre film, but which would also comment on the founding of America and what that really meant (and thus, hopefully, commenting on the America of today). The film opens with a burnt American flag, so it touches on subjects such as the genocide of the Native Americans, xenophobia, the oppression and exploitation of women, the law of the \"wild west\" and capital punishment. My main inspiration when writing were the frontier photographs from the 1850s onwards. The hardship on the people's faces was_ _startlingly apparent, and when you listen to the hynms they sang at the time, they are about hardship, the misery of life, and how life will be better on the other side, in Heaven. It is a very sobering and moving view of the founding of America, and of the immigrant experience. I tried to get some of that into the film, as well as paying homage to the westerns I loved as a child._\r\n\r\n- Ivan Kavanagh; \"Ivan Kavanagh: Director of _Never Grow Old_\" (Davide Abbatescianni); _Cineuropa_ (March 15, 2019)\r\n\r\nI guarantee you've seen this story before \u2013 a good man who either abhors or has renounced violence forced to take up arms so as to protect the innocent from a villain. You can find it deployed in westerns such as John Ford's _The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance_ (1962), Vincent McEveety's _Firecreek_ (1968), and Clint Eastwood's _The Outlaw Josey Wales_ (1976), and in genre films as varied as Michael Mann's _Collateral_ (2004), James Wan's _Death Sentence_ (2007), and Sylvester Stallone's _Rambo_ (2008). Filmed in Connemara, Ireland (standing in for Oregon), this third feature from writer\/director Ivan Kavanagh (_Tin Can Man_; _The Canal_) is the latest to roll out that narrative template. And really, there are next to no surprises in _Never Grow Old_ - chances are everything you think is going to happen does happen. However, this isn't really a criticism. The film wears its predictability like a badge of honour, and Kavanagh is obviously a huge fan of violent revisionist westerns such as Sam Peckinpah's _The Wild Bunch_ (1969) and S. Craig Zahler's _Bone Tomahawk_ (2015). The script isn't going to be winning any awards for originality, but the film has been put together with undeniable craft. It's bleak, gritty, and despairing, and whilst it won't change your life, it is rather enjoyable.\r\n\r\nOregon, 1849; the town of Garlow is the last stop on the California Trail prior to reaching the Rocky Mountains. Although Sheriff Parker (Tim Ahern) is nominally in charge, Garlow is really governed by the local Methodist preacher, Pike (Danny Webb), who has forbidden alcohol, gambling, and prostitution. The town's mild-mannered undertaker, Irish immigrant Patrick Tate (Emile Hirsch with an Irish accent that wavers mid-sentence), isn't especially interested in Pike's hellfire sermons, but he converted from Catholicism because it was important to his wife, French immigrant Audrey (D\u00e9borah Fran\u00e7ois). Living on the edge of town with their two children, they plan to leave Garlow at some point but are in no major rush to do so. That plan becomes complicated when three men - Christopher 'Dutch' Albert (John Cusack, having an absolute blast), Dumb Dumb (Sam Louwyck), who carries his severed tongue with him, and Sicily (Camille Piston), an Italian immigrant who doesn't speak English - roll into town looking for Bill Crabtree (Paul Ronan), who left Garlow several months prior, although his wife (Anne Coesens) and daughter Emily (Manon Capelle) are still there. Stating that Crabtree stole from him and must be killed, Dutch browbeats Tate into bringing the trio to his home and having Audrey cook for them. Seeing Pike's decrees as an opportunity, Dutch procures a group of prostitutes and reopens the town's saloon, killing anyone who crosses him. With his undertaker business thriving because of the spike in violence, Tate stays out of the situation as best he can, although Audrey is disgusted that he's prospering because of Dutch's actions. Soon, however, Tate's family will come under threat and he'll be forced to decide what he must do.\r\n\r\nIn naming the film _Never Grow Old_ (which is a generic name if ever there was one), I'm assuming Kavanagh is referencing the Southern Gospel hymn \"Where We'll Never Grow Old\" written by James Cleveland Moore, Sr. in 1914. The song is never mentioned in the film, nor is it used on the soundtrack, but the lyrics have an unmistakable thematic relevance;\r\n\r\n_I have heard of a land_\r\n\r\n_On the faraway strand_\r\n\r\n_'Tis a beautiful home of the soul_\r\n\r\n_Built by Jesus on high_\r\n\r\n_There we never shall die_\r\n\r\n_'Tis a land where we never grow old._\r\n\r\nThe idea of paradise awaiting us in the next life, specifically the notion that the afterlife will be a lot better than our earthly existence, is alluded to throughout the film, mainly by Pike, but also by Audrey, and even Tate and Dutch on occasion (although Dutch references it ironically). And it's really not too hard to imagine a better life than the one Kavanagh presents in Garlow (more on that in a moment).\r\n\r\nThematically, _Never Grow Old_ has the structure of a morality tale or a Mystery play, looking at issues such as religious hypocrisy and self-righteousness. It even takes time to briefly address the genocide of Native American people, with Pike sermonising about how the colonists saved the land from \"_savages_\". The most obvious theme, however, is greed. Tate, for example, is complicit with Dutch's violence insofar as he accepts and ignores it, even profiting indirectly because of it. Audrey is utterly disgusted with this, and she regards their newfound financial prosperity as nothing short of evil. Several of the town's more religious folk think the same thing, and there are multiple references to Tate getting his \"_30 pieces of silver_\". Indeed, a recurring motif in the film is to cut from Dutch killing someone to Tate cleaning the body to placing two coins on their eyes to closing the coffin to burying the coffin, and finally, to hiding his payment away in a tin buried in the house. When we first see the tin, there's little in it, but as the film goes on, it becomes fuller and fuller.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the film has several visual moments like this which convey thematic points _sans_ dialogue. The opening shot, for example, shows a tattered American flag hanging on a burnt building, immediately introducing the theme of violence and how life in the Americas was very different from that which was sold to so many before they arrived. In another early shot, we see Pike preaching to a packed church. Later, however, after Dutch has reopened the saloon, we again see Pike preaching, but this time to an almost empty church, which, of course, makes reference to the dwindling church attendance that we're seeing playing out today. Another heavy theme is child prostitution and a scene where a lecherous drunken old man clambers on top of a crying girl of 14 is one of the film's most arresting images, showing us just how low some men can sink. Another nice visual touch, this time in the production design by _John Leslie_ (_The Survivalist_; _Bad Day for the Cut_; _The Devil's Doorway_) is that the saloon is directly across the road from the church, symbolising the battle between these two forces (hedonism and piety) that continues to this day. \r\n\r\nIndeed, the overall aesthetic design is quite impressive. Garlow is literally a one-road town. However, this isn't the parched, dusty environment of beige, yellow, and light browns that we're all used to seeing in westerns. Rather, it's bleak and forlorn; the buildings are dark brown, almost black, the clouds hardly ever part, it rains a lot, and the road itself is nothing but mud, with the sound design by Aza Hand (_I Am Not a Serial Killer_; _Muse_; _Cardboard Gangsters_) emphasising the squelching of the characters' steps. To compound this sense of squalor, most of the film takes place at night, with cinematographer Piers McGrail (_Let Us Prey_; _Glassland_; _The Cured_) occasionally using only one practical light to illuminate an entire scene. This necessitates that characters drift in and out of the shadows, which adds an extra element of danger to Dutch and his men. The life of a European in the Americas of the 19th century wasn't easy, and one of the film's most successful elements is in showing us some of why that was.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, the script isn't exactly original, with every character an archetype we've seen in many other films. Additionally, the slow-burn pace will put some people off. As mentioned, Emile Hirsch joins a venerable list of actors who have completely butchered the Irish accent; everyone from Tom Cruise (_Far and Away_) to Tommy Lee Jones (_Blown Away_) to Val Kilmer (_The Ghost and the Darkness_) to Brad Pitt (_The Devil's Own_). Hirsch isn't as bad as any of these, but his tendency to drop in and out of the inflections on a word-by-word basis is distracting. Another slight issue is that towards the end of the film, Dutch starts reading from the Bible, quoting Revelation 19:17 (\"_And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God_\"). It's more than a little on the nose, and really, a villain quoting _Revelations_ is itself a clich\u00e9.\r\n\r\nOverall, however, I enjoyed _Never Grow Old_ far more than I expected. It's bleak and gritty, rough-edged and nihilistic, but it's very well made, with some nicely conceived visual shorthand. An uncompromising look at the harshness of frontier life in the 19th century, the film suggests that stoic individualism is no substitute for a vibrant community, and is as thematically dark as it is practically dark. A morality tale in all but name, there's nothing here you haven't seen before, but Kavanagh handles the genre elements well and has made a rather enjoyable film.","id":"5d967b16ea426328929380ca","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d967b16ea426328929380ca","movie_id":498743}

A smartly written whodunit movie that manages to be both humorous and classy. The kind of murder mystery that never fails to entertain. Pleasing both cinephiles and mainstream audiences. Perfectly balance, as all things should be. It basically pulls a Hitchcock on us.\r\n\r\nRian Johnson is a great director, but at times has silly ideas. On the other hand, when given the right material I think he\u2019s a great director and writer. He\u2019s also a clever man, but never came off as annoying. The dialogue was so sharply written that I could tell the cast loved every minute of soaking up and delivering these lines. The cinematography was nothing short but beautiful and will often linger in rooms of the house which helps the audience immerse in the overall setting.\r\n\r\nOne of the tightest scripts of the year with raw humor and a satisfying mystery\/comedy.\r\n\r\nThe cast is stellar, but the main stand outs for me were Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, and Chris Evans. I loved Daniel Craig\u2019s Southern drawl which I didn\u2019t expect at first, but I was amazed of how far he went for it. Often times it reminded me of Frank Underwood from \u2018House of Cards\u2019. He plays detective Benoit Blanc, AKA CSI: KFC. At one point during the movie he delivers one of the funniest monologues in the entire movie, which was brilliantly delivered by Craig. He should seriously try out more comedy roles.\r\n\r\nDose anyone remember when Ana de Armas starred in Eli Roth\u2019s \u2018Knock Knock\u2019? Well look at her now. She was absolutely excellent in this movie. The running joke throughout the entire movie is her character can\u2019t lie and whenever she dose, she vomits on the spot. How ironic, yet I love the comedic irony behind it.\r\n\r\nChris Evans plays a spoiled child with a slimy grin during the worst situations. The over privilege black sheep of the family. This is very against type for Evans, especially when his character hates dogs, which I would imagine being difficult for Evans since he\u2019s a dog lover in real life. Also the different sweaters he wears in every scenes was impeccable.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the cast manage to shine individually in this crowded movie. Although at times some of them felt like background wall paper compared to others. However that never takes away from what else \u2018Knives Out\u2019 has to offer.\r\n\r\nToni Collette dose a great impression of Gwyneth Paltrow. Michael Shannon plays a wimpy son to a crime-writer Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). Despite the small screen time, Plummer is still charming as always. While Jamie Lee Curtis and her character brings the dramatic elements into play. She\u2019s uninterested in the humorous quarrel during the grim situation, as early on she reminds everyone that her father just died.\r\n\r\nJudging it as a whodunit mystery, the pay off itself is slick. The events leading to the death are revealed early into the movie, and instead Johnson remains steps ahead from the audience. There\u2019s an underlining social commentary beneath the foul play. The themes of privilege and underprivileged with the sour taste of bitterness throughout. Nothing deep or new, but at least is trying to say something rather than being one thing.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: My House. My Rules.

{"author":"ahmedaiman99","content":"\"That certainly not what I was expecting.\"\r\n\r\n- Whodunit?\r\n- Rian Johnson.\r\n- Why?\r\n- To subvert the tropes of yet another sub-genre... properly!\r\n\r\nAs divisive as it was, I neither loved nor hated the love-it-or-hate-it The Last Jedi. Maybe because I'm not a huge fan of the much-beloved saga. But I can give you a quick opinion of what I thought about it anyway. The first half almost turned me off completely: tons of lame jokes and out-of-character moments that indicate that Johnson's biggest concern was to subvert expectations and nothing but. The second half of the film was way better. It proved to me that Johnson is actually very capable of adding fresh blood to the saga, so effortlessly to such an extent that I wondered why he struggled so much in the first half.\r\n\r\nIn Knives Out, Johnson didn't add a new spin on the 'whodunit' sub-genre of detective fiction; he took it and turned it on its head. He did so not only by playing with the tropes and mechanisms of this sub-genre -and boy, he did that so exquisitely and gracefully- but he also by using a new and very effective building block: Drama. It doesn't sound new, isn't it? But, actually, relying on it here, in this kind of a story, is nothing short of revolutionary, and that's simply lies in the fact it's unprecedented to build upon it here. The result is nothing but marvellous. And although that, at some point, the main concern of the plot wasn't the murder mystery per se, the mystery didn't lose its sharpness even a tiny bit. And that's a strong proof that everything worked, and integrated, seamlessly. I said integrated because the film has a plethora of comedic bits throughout its runtime -which flies by- and, to be honest, I think every single joke landed perfectly. The film also suggest a political agenda that's exquisitely woven into the plot, and provides a sharp social commentary that's impressively subtle.\r\n\r\nNot only did Rian Johnson reinvigorate this seemingly outmoded and unfruitful sub-genre, but he also did the same thing with a couple of members of the star-studded cast: I didn't know that Chris Evans, Captain America himself, would be better as, well, an \"Anti-Captain America \"; Craig as Blanc is absolutely phenomenal, with his southern accent and caricature detective character; and Jaeden Martell (IT) is very interesting as the weirdo Jacob Thrombey. As for Curtis, Langford, Plummer, Collette and Shannon, Johnson makes an excellent use of their incredible acting abilities, and of their facial expressions and features, especially Shannon with his remarkable menacing countenance. The real standout, though, is Ana de Armas. I mean, she was good in Blade Runner 2049, but here, as she plays my new favourite version of Pinocchio, she proves she's an exceptionally talented actress who is capable of expressing emotions, and changing them readily, only with her eyes. Honestly, I think she should have been nominated for an Oscar!\r\n\r\nOverall, I'm really surprised how much I loved this film. With Johnson superb and clever direction and meticulously-nuanced and witty -albeit slightly too-structured- screenplay, I think this is my favourite - even if it's not my highest-rated - film of 2019. You know what, this film is actually terrible: it's very pretentious; its puzzle is too convoluted for its own good; it has an overabundance of plot twists; it underutilized its stellar ensemble; and it has a lot of plot holes, or -in this case- donut holes! Excuse me, I gotta leave right now!\r\n\r\n(9.5\/10)","id":"5e4cb9e71e9225001dc8298f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e4cb9e71e9225001dc8298f","movie_id":546554}
{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps:\/\/www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nKnives Out has been shown in numerous festivals, and it received massive acclaim in literally every single one of them. Therefore, its hype grew more and more until its wide release date. Before the film, I can\u2019t deny that I was indeed affected by the whole \u201ca whodunnit like you haven\u2019t seen in years.\u201d I went into the theater with high expectations, not only due to the festival praise but due to its jaw-dropping cast. It\u2019s uncommon to possess such a renowned ensemble and deliver a \u201cbad\u201d movie, especially when Rian Johnson is writing and directing it (yes, I like The Last Jedi, and even if I didn\u2019t, he did other stuff, you know?). It\u2019s one of those films everyone knows it\u2019s going to be appreciated by a considerable part of the world.\r\n\r\nEven the genre itself is a very welcome type of cinema entertainment in regards to both critics and the general public. So, does it live up to its hype, or it fails to reach such high expectations? Knives Out is one of the best movies of the year, as well as one of the best mystery-suspense stories of the millennium (everyone is doing the whole \u201cbest X of the decade,\u201d I\u2019m going one step beyond). This is a film I know I\u2019m going to rewatch countless times throughout the next years. Usually, when it comes to whodunnits, people are misled into thinking that from the moment they know who \u201cdid it,\u201d the movie loses its interest. This is rarely true, and Rian Johnson succeeds because he doesn\u2019t need the ultimate reveal to deliver a great story.\r\n\r\nThis screenplay is definitely getting tons of nominations and wins during the awards season. Every little line of dialogue means something. Every single character says or does something impactful to the narrative (except for Jaeden Martell\u2019s). It\u2019s been half-a-day since I\u2019ve seen it, and for every question that my brain comes up with, there\u2019s an answer lying on someone\u2019s words or actions. It\u2019s such an intricate, complex, extremely subtle script. One with so many tiny, little details that it\u2019s impossible to catch them all on a first viewing.\r\n\r\nI genuinely love the first act, even if it\u2019s the one where I have a minor issue. Rian Johnson doesn\u2019t waste time and puts us directly in the crime scene, interviewing each and every member of the family. It\u2019s through these interrogatories that he cleverly introduces the suspects, developing them solely through masterfully written dialogue, and outstanding performances. For example, with a single sentence and a particular body\/face expression, Toni Collette instantly creates a profile of Joni, her character. Rian plays with character-types and cliches in such an intelligent manner. He makes us think a particular character follows a specific cliche, then it doesn\u2019t, then it does again\u2026\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons I couldn\u2019t figure out the mystery until the last act reveal. Every time I was close to indeed follow the right path, new developments arise, meant to mislead, confuse, and create doubts. Some people feel better with themselves if they solve the case before the film. They feel \u201cintellectually superior\u201d just because they found out before everyone else. First of all, I prefer being fooled and end up blown away by an unexpected conclusion than solving the whole thing way before time\u2019s up and end up disappointed and bored. Then, honestly, anyone who says, \u201cI guessed it,\u201d there\u2019s a 99% chance that they\u2019re either lying or not answering correctly to the question \u201cwho killed Harlan?\u201d If you\u2019ve seen the movie, you\u2019ll understand what I\u2019m trying to express.\r\n\r\n(I don\u2019t want to sound presumptuous or hypocritical. I\u2019m not trying to say, \u201cI couldn\u2019t figure it out, so no one can.\u201d Please, if you haven\u2019t seen the film, judge the previous paragraph after your viewing.)\r\n\r\nThroughout the second and third acts, loose ends start to tie up, ending up with a brilliantly delivered reveal. From the marvelous cinematography (with those classic close-ups when a character is about to say something meaningful or tell a story through their imagination or memory) to the remarkable editing, the team behind Rian Johnson did a phenomenal job. The suspense is held at high levels, and it reaches limit-breaking points with Marta Cabrera\u2019s (Ana de Armas) narrative. Armas and Daniel Craig deliver the standout performances, with Chris Evans (Ransom) following right behind. Literally, everyone else offers excellent displays, and help carry a story filled with mystery, but also with a lot of humor.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have to emphasize how astonishing Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig are. Ana might be a bit unknown to most people. I\u2019ve been supporting her ever since Blade Runner 2049, so I\u2019m ecstatic that she finally got a major role in a big movie, especially within an ensemble of actors with legendary careers. Craig, who could have just delivered a slight variation of the character he\u2019s been playing for years, instead offers a unique take on the Detective role. Just like Evans, both have been playing iconic characters for years, so it\u2019s sort of an extra joke to everyone who watched Captain America and James Bond for the past decade or so.\r\n\r\nMy only minor issue has nothing to do with the political undertone and the social messages Rian Johnson puts in this film. Honestly, I love that aspect of it. It\u2019s like Rian knew some people would complain about it, so he made sure to have a couple of characters (Jaeden Martell\u2019s Jacob and Katherine Langford\u2019s Meg) somewhat resembling the so-called snowflakes and all that. No, my issue is related to some excessive exposition regarding the first act\u2019s interrogatories. It\u2019s great that every character gets their own motivations, but it feels like each confrontation with the detectives went on for a bit too long. Some pieces of the mystery might be a bit hard to believe that they would occur, but these are all nitpicks in a remarkable movie.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Rian Johnson is able to bounce back from the divisive The Last Jedi with one of the best whodunnits I\u2019ve ever seen, Knives Out. Rian proves that not only he\u2019s a talented filmmaker but also a phenomenal screenwriter. With a renowned and impressive ensemble cast, Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas are standouts within all of the other outstanding performances, Chris Evans being right behind. With one of the best screenplays of the year, the mystery at its center keeps everyone extremely captivated until the very end, even if you guess \u201cwho did it\u201d beforehand. Masterfully written dialogue, remarkable editing, and great use of classic cinematography techniques. It\u2019s an entertaining story with tremendous replay value and significant political\/social layers that only elevate the already complex yet subtle narrative. Don\u2019t miss it!\r\n\r\nRating: A","id":"5de52e200cd44600123b777e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5de52e200cd44600123b777e","movie_id":546554}

{"author":"deRedtube","content":"There is no dearth of 'goosebumps' moments in Jeevan Reddy's biopic of erstwhile student union leader George Reddy. With nothing out of place or blown out of proportion, Jeevan stays true to the incidents that rocked Andhra Pradesh's politics in the 60s and 70s. At no point, does he try to make the character seem larger-than-life, and keeps things real, making George Reddy a gripping watch.\r\n\r\nThe film begins when Muskaan (Muskaan Khubchandani), a research scholar based out of USA sets out on a mission to study and document George Reddy's life. Little did she realize, that she was about to embark on an enigmatic journey through the historical aspects of politics in Osmania University, and understand the man who transformed how politics became an integral part of campus life. George Reddy (Sandeep Madhav), born in rural Kerala, quenches his thirst for knowledge with genuine curiosity towards his surroundings, often explained by his mother, Leela Varghesin (Devika Daftardar). His mother encourages him to read, the first book she gives him is titled Why Am I An Atheist? written by Bhagat Singh. George cannot get enough of it. When he goes to University, George experiences first-hand, the discrimination and struggles faced by his fellow students from various socially backward communities. He then realizes that oppression by violence means can't just be countered by peaceful means. His philosophy is on point, \"Slogan for a slogan\" and \"punch for a punch.\" Soon, the 23-year-old's campaigning went beyond just university walls. Not only did he lead his party (PS) in university polls, his ideas began to inspire people outside of it, including farmers and marginalized workers. And it is at this juncture of his life when he first encounters the rotten system, built only to benefit a few, a capitalist state, in his own words. As his struggle intensifies and his movement gains momentum all over the country, things get more complicated for George Reddy.\r\n\r\nAlthough George Reddy starts on a slow note, the intensity gradually builds up and director Jeevan masterfully pulls you into the story and into the world of George Reddy. Sandeep Madhav along with Abhay Bethiganti and Muskaan shine in their respective roles. The background score by Harshavardhan Rameshwar is top-notch and elevates the drama in some of the intense scenes. The cinematography too is first rate, with Sudhakar Reddy Yakkanti ensuring the film is visually arresting.\r\n\r\nAlthough Jeevan tells a gripping story, some of the key dialogues are botched up due to a haphazard screenplay. For instance, a dialogue as powerful as 'jeena hai to marna seekho, kadam kadam par ladna seekho' brings up the intensity, but is soon shifted to more normal surrounding, thus hampering its momentum and blunting the effect of the dialogue. The story works, but Jeevan falters in its screenplay and there's often a disconnect between scenes. The character of Muskaan too doesn't really contribute much to the story.\r\n\r\nBut make no mistake, George Reddy is a bold refreshing take on a story that's yet to be explored in Telugu cinema. The film will keep you gripped, move you with its dialogues and leave an emotional, powerful impact. A trip to the theaters to watch George Reddy's journey would be worth your time.","id":"5dd81cb3b5bc210011c430c0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dd81cb3b5bc210011c430c0","movie_id":649956}

Not entirely sure why Ang Lee went in that direction, but didn't work for me.\r\n\r\nAll in all, maybe worth a rental but certainly far from a best effort from both Lee and Will Smith. **3.25\/5**","id":"5e2236148f26bc001574a4ad","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2236148f26bc001574a4ad","movie_id":453405}
{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nUsually, I leave the technical aspects to the end of my reviews since story, characters, and the critical element of each genre (action in action flicks, comedy in comedies, and so on) are way more important. However, having in mind the whole marketing campaign surrounding Gemini Man's \"groundbreaking innovations\", I'll address them now. Even after sleeping on it, my experience in high frame rate still feels very \u2026 weird. In case you need some explaining, HFR adds a lot more detail to the image since it captures more frames per second hence making the image smoother, which can be extremely distracting. I always disable motion smoothing on my TV since I hate that feeling of knowing that \"something's not right\".\r\n\r\nIt doesn't have to do with speed, which is something people are going to wrongly state regarding this film. The action isn't faster, don't make the mistake of saying this. Since there's 2.5x more detail (24 FPS is the standard frame rate), movements become easier to follow, so there's the illusion of watching something faster than normal. Truth is, it just FEELS like it. When characters are just talking, and there's no action involved, it works because it simply looks better. However, the action sequences are very hit-and-miss. Some pieces look absolutely amazing, but it's clear this technology needs a few more years of experience to reach its full potential.\r\n\r\nScenes featuring car\/motorbike chases, running, or shootings are stunningly filmed, but any hand-to-hand combat is frustratingly off-putting. Additionally, Ang Lee applies an excessive use of CGI to a lot of these moments, which makes some fights look incredibly absurd. HFR is not the only technical attribute people are going to discuss. That young version of Will Smith \u2026 Honestly, it doesn't really work for me. People who complained about The Lion King (2019) not being able to show animals emoting will surely hate this attempt of replicating a young Will Smith (if they don't, then Joker was right, society is indeed extremely hypocritical).\r\n\r\nIt's just like the action sequences with HFR: hit-and-miss. There are some genuinely mind-blowing scenes with medium shots of young Will Smith, and he looks 99.9% real. In these specific shots, it's impossible to tell the difference between the clone and a real version. However, it still fails to deliver this realism throughout the entire runtime. First of all, young Henry barely shows any emotions (except a brilliant crying moment), which is obviously meant to facilitate the VFX team's work. But even with his face completely still and empty of emotions, the eyes just look too doll-like. The eyebrows move strangely, and the forehead seems odd.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it all comes down to forgetting that it's a digital character and that almost never happens. I always felt like I was watching a blend of CGI, motion-capture, and whatever other technology they used to try to pull this off. In a few years from now, if Gemini Man gets a remake or some other movie tries to do something similar, I bet it will look near-perfect. Right now, it's more of a disturbance than an achievement. Put this together with the already not-that-good HFR, and we get a visually striking yet distracting film.\r\n\r\nAnd if you thought the story would save it\u2026 It's pretty bad. Generic, predictable, and filled with almost offensive exposition. I would have to go through my reviews, but this is definitely one of the most exposition-heavy screenplays of the year. I lost count of the number of times a character starts ranting with the purpose of explaining something evident to another character. The worst thing a screenplay can do is treat the audience like they are 5-year-old children. The whole plot revolves around people asking someone else what happened, what's happening, and what's next. We already know from the trailer Will Smith is being hunted by a young version of himself, a clone.\r\n\r\nTry to imagine how many ways you can tell someone there's an individual exactly like that person. Now, just lazily insert all of those sentences on a character's script and make it say them in a single scene. I'm sorry, but it's laughably bad. There are no surprises! It ends abruptly, utterly disregarding the only interesting plot point (still very predictable), by not developing it any further than one sequence. If it wasn't for the truly fantastic cast (Will Smith is always impeccable, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Benedict Wong deliver great performances), Gemini Man would easily be one of the absolute worst movies of the year. Shoutout to Lorne Balfe's score, which is by far the technical aspect worthy of only compliments.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Ang Lee's attempt to deliver a groundbreaking film doesn't quite hit the mark. Honestly, it's still far from it. The 60 FPS HFR and the young version of Will Smith are occasionally jaw-dropping, but both technical aspects need years of improvement to be able to work seamlessly. As of now, these only serve as a frustrating distraction. However, the biggest problem with Gemini Man is its exposition-heavy screenplay, which besides treating the audience like dumb people, doesn't carry any sort of surprise or novelty. As generic and predictable as it could be. The unbelievably talented cast, a spectacular score from Lorne Balfe, and a few notable action sequences save this technological hit-and-miss from missing its target entirely.\r\n\r\nRating: C-","id":"5d9f549e65686e001e625aa1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d9f549e65686e001e625aa1","movie_id":453405}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nJessica Rothe leads the follow-up to Blumhouse's surprise 2017 smash hit of riveting, repeating twists and comic turns. This time, our hero Tree Gelbman (Rothe) discovers that dying over and over was surprisingly easier than the dangers that lie ahead. Jason Blum once again produces, and Christopher Landon returns to write and direct this next chapter.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t have a Happy Death Day review online, but I agree with the adjectives above-mentioned. It was one of last year\u2019s surprises, and I genuinely had great fun with it. Overall, I would have rated it a B\/B+, in case you\u2019re wondering. But let\u2019s get to its sequel and find out if it stood up to the original\u2019s level\u2026  \r\n\r\nShort answer: no. Not even close. Honestly, it even diminishes what the first one accomplished. The 2017 original flick was a refreshing surprise because it took a different concept and mixed a bunch of genres in an unexpectedly entertaining way. It was funny, imaginative and Jessica Rothe proved to be a star in the making. 2U just has Rothe. That\u2019s it. Its comedy bits only worked a couple of times throughout the whole runtime, and there wasn\u2019t a single scary sequence that didn\u2019t remind me of thousands of other familiar scenes done better in other films.\r\n\r\nThis movie is simply an easy money-grab, and BlumHouse doesn\u2019t mind if it doesn\u2019t stand up to the original as long as it succeeds in the box office, which it already did. Unfortunately, that\u2019s how Hollywood and the world of cinema works nowadays. If an unique and even risky film, one that was only planned to be a single installment, becomes a box office hit, chances are that a sequel is going to be produced, even if it has to wrongly retcon what happened in the original movie, consequently taking some of its value. This rarely works quality-wise, but I can\u2019t deny that, as a marketing strategy, it\u2019s very profitable for studios.\r\n\r\nMy main issue with Happy Death Day 2U is that it risks too much with no reasonable payoff. Story-wise, it has tons of logical incongruencies, and I don\u2019t buy the ending, at all. Christopher Landon asks too much of the audience since we have to accept so much nonsense in order to actually enjoy the film. In the original movie, the only thing we needed to \u201cgo with\u201d was the actual concept, but that was pretty clear from the get-go. In 2U, there\u2019s a compelling and captivating moral dilemma at its core, but that same dilemma becomes less and less like one by the end of it. It\u2019s still a complicated situation, but it\u2019s like they forgot what was really important and went with other poorly explained route.\r\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t matter the genre from which you analyze this film. If you look at it as a comedy, you\u2019ll barely laugh. If you think of it as a scary movie, you\u2019ll never get scared. If you want to be intrigued by who the killer is this time around, you won\u2019t be because the mystery is pretty straightforward. I really don\u2019t want to rant on this film because I do love its cast and I really enjoyed the first movie, but it\u2019s really hard not to be upset since it damages an eventual second viewing of the first one now. When the original installment doesn\u2019t have an open door to other adventures, just don\u2019t try to make a sequel for the sake of it. I know, I know\u2026 Money. Bah.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to end this review on a sad note, so I left the brilliant cast to the end. Everyone is fantastic, and I hope that at least this film can catapult some of these actors into the spotlight, especially Jessica Rothe. She has a tremendous range of expressions and incredible ease in changing between emotions. She can look scared, sad and happy in a matter of seconds, with tears and all. She\u2019s a full package. I hope that she can grab either a major role on a big TV series or a supporting role in a blockbuster or Oscar-bait movie in the next couple of years. Surely, Jason Blum has some plans for her.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Happy Death Day 2U does not deserve the box office success that it is having. It\u2019s receiving a lot of credit due to the 2017 original\u2019s surprise hit, and that\u2019s unfair to the first installment. This sequel not only wrongly retcons unnecessary plot details of its predecessor, but it makes that correction its main plot, continuously reminding the audience that we just have to accept it. It\u2019s not as funny, scary, unique or surprisingly entertaining as the original, and if the returning cast didn\u2019t deliver strong performances, this would be one of the worst films of the year. Fortunately, there are a couple of good moments here and there, and Jessica Rothe alone saves the movie from a much more negative review. \r\n\r\nOh, and please, do NOT make a third one! Just leave it alone.\r\n\r\nRating: C-","id":"5c6eab2492514129d507d2a0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c6eab2492514129d507d2a0","movie_id":512196}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"A notable step down from the first _Happy Death Day_ but I was still pretty happy with this. There are some problems though. Calling it repetitive seems like a no-brainer, given the content, but it's not so much that _2U_ is doing mostly the same thing as the first one, as that it's doing the same thing as the first one, and that all of the things that are changed are **worse**. I didn't need an explanation or really much of anything that I saw in _2U_. But I guess something had to give if _Happy Death Day_ was going to get a sequel, and as I said, I didn't dislike this. I actually actively did like it. I just don't think it was up to the standard off the first, which even then, was good but not great.\r\n\r\nFinal rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole.","id":"5d109b47c3a36812811e5ae9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d109b47c3a36812811e5ae9","movie_id":512196}

But if you saw this poster and thought \"That looks like something I'm gonna have to watch\", then, yes, you do. Odd for a movie about a killer couch, but one of its problems is actually that it tries to be too much. You'd think, simple concept, but the movie introduces so many concepts, that by the time we're in the third act, it trips over itself trying (and failing) to do them all justice. The first two-thirds of _Killer Sofa_ is a great time though. It plays the concept totally straight-faced, which is actually why it works. It's hilarious because it's played seriously. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._","id":"5df9cae826dac100145890dc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5df9cae826dac100145890dc","movie_id":628446}

{"author":"JordanTasevski","content":"\"Honeyland\" and Greta Thurnberg - The new heroes of our time\r\n\r\nThe two phenomenon have been a subject to a similar bipolar division of reactions in the public where some glorified them, and others criticized them up to a point of hatred. This fact alone, proves that they have already accomplished their goal, they have had an impact on the world regarding subjects which societies, leaders, and people in general tend to persistently ignore.\r\n\r\nI hope that we are entering a new era, where we leave behind the glorification of petty subject for plain fun and diminishing current events. Our societies by now have placed the highest values on athletes, famous actors, modern aristocracy... I hope the time has come for ordinary people, \"anonymous\" like Greta Thunberg and \"Honeyland\" with the authors and the main protagonist - Hatidze will be the new driving force in societies where with their influence they will cause radical societal changes and become the new heroes of a new era.\r\n\r\nHatizde, the last beekeeper of wild bees in Europe, admires everyone with universal values which we recognize in every culture, religion, philosophical and spiritual doctrine in the world, that most likely have been passed down and perfected from one generation to another. Respect for nature, humility, moderation, and compassion are silently reflected in the background through the entire course of the movie. Hatidze enjoys the companion of the bees, simply loving them, selflessly sharing the honey with them, half for people, half for them, - an extraordinary example of sustainability.\r\n\r\nThe fact that for the first time in the history of the Oscars a documentary is entering the competition in the category of best international movie, where all of the other nominees are based on fiction, is not surprising. Thanks to the authors for the mastery of making a documentary into art, that you literary take in as a feature film.\r\n\r\nIt's also interesting to notice that an unusual moment in the movie is experienced diametrically opposite. Hatidze's call for the bees, Maat, mat, mat, mat which some viewers interpreted as quote: \"When I heard her mumbling something, I turned it off...\" While others like the Dutch movie critic Belinda van de Graf experienced that moment as, quote \"Hatidze is singing to the bees...\"\r\n\r\nI personally experienced that moment as utterly poetic, a feeling I would like to explain further. The very call from Hatidze to the bees Maaaat, mat, mat, mat has its roots in the word matica - queen bee (lat. mater, matrix). It's particularly interesting that Hatidze is usually speaking ottoman Turkish language, but the word matica is also a Macedonian term, indicating an archaic word that surpasses today's languages. It's inevitable to ask a simple question. What magic is engaged in the queen, a simple insect, recognizing those words as a friendly call from a human, where according to Darwin's Theory of evolution these two species are so profoundly different?\r\n\r\nNamely, when I first saw the trailer with awe last spring, the moment when Hatidze called the bees with the call Maaaat, mat, mat, mat is a moment that became so familiar and close to me. I suddenly remembered my childhood where in a mountain village in eastern Macedonia, a grandmother explained how they used to keep bees in woven baskets, identical like the ones Hatidze uses. In short, among other things was the recognition of the call to the queen Maaaat, mat, mat, mat quietly gathering the bees around and communicating with them. In that moment the pieces of the puzzle came together and I realized that when Hatidze is singing the \"mantra\", she is identifying herself with the queen bee, taking on her role, calling, gathering, communicating just like the queen would, Hatidze becomes the queen bee. An incredible symbiosis between human and nature.\r\n\r\nWith this story I want to express my admiration of the movie, to the authors as well as to the audience. They have acknowledged the fact that there is no successful or unsuccessful life, no important or unimportant human, no significant or insignificant story, all lives are successful, unrepeatable experiences. This movie casted a light on a seemingly simple life, and uplifted and glorified a supposedly ordinary human, which turned out to be deeply ethical, pure, loving, towards people and nature alike, and simply beautiful, just like the movie itself.","id":"5e2ca79498f1f10018fa28d3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2ca79498f1f10018fa28d3","movie_id":566213}

{"author":"Key-Si","content":"I can't really say that I enjoyed \"Hoax\", but there definitely were a few things that made this partially fun though. This is obviously low budget, but the cinematography wasn't too bad. It felt way more professional than most of the films in this category. The acting was a mixed bag though. If you are interested in this movie just because Adrienne Barbeau (\"The Fog\", \"Escape From New York\") is in it, then you should be aware, that she is only on screen around the end and also just for a few minutes. Our lead turns out to be Cheryl Texiera despite Barbeau being used as the main selling point for this film. We also have Brian Thompson, who played 'Shao Kahn' in \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation\". I haven't seen him much during the last few years, but this film proves that he's still around. Anyway... \"Hoax\" starts out as many of those Horror flicks with kids telling scary stories at a camp fire. We get some yummy nudity from M\u00e1ire Higgins, before the body count finally starts. Then we see a few news reports about the missing kids and 'Rick Paxton' (Ben Browder) sees a chance to make some money by making a TV show that proves that 'Bigfoot' is real. He puts together a team then, \"Dr. Ellen Freese\" (Cheryl Texiera) as the primate expert, 'Cooper Barnes' (Max Decker) as the guy who knows the area and whose daughter is among the missing kids, 'Bridgette Powers' (Shoshana Bush) as the journalist narrating the show, 'John Singer' (Brian Thompson) as the ex-soldier to guarantee safety and so forth... While filming their stuff for the show the body count is increased as to be expected and then the film takes a weird turn and almost gets a little \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" or \"Wrong Turn\" vibe with some neat little gore effects. Torture inclusive! Well, that being the segment with Barbeau in it. Yes, this is a bad film and I didn't expect it to be good at all. But it actually turned out to be a little better than I expected. This is like a TV movie you watch at 3 in the morning while you get drunk alone, maybe pass out even before it ends and you haven't really missed something. Next morning you remember that it was kind of OK, before you completely forget about it. This is \"Hoax\" for you.","id":"5d62c6b77f6c8d1b36ed14a6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d62c6b77f6c8d1b36ed14a6","movie_id":513372}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nYou all know how anxious I was about this movie. I\u2019m a huge fan of Shyamalan, and I know how hard it is to try to defend a director who made The Last Airbender. Every time I offer undeniable proof of masterful filmmaking, I get overwhelmed with questions about his absurd twists and his cringe-worthy dialogues. Shyamalan is a bit like Kevin, he also has different personalities, depending on the films he releases. On one side, he is a phenomenal filmmaker who knows his craft better than anyone and who once was nicknamed \u201cthe second Spielberg\u201d. A screenwriter who delivers mind-blowing plot twists and extremely captivating dialogue scenes. On the other side, there\u2019s a guy who ruins entire movies with frustrating twists that no one asked for and with arguably horrible decisions regarding his characters. So, to each side does Shyamalan tends to in Glass?\r\n\r\nThe first act is seamless. I love how David is introduced 19 years later and how his life is now. Kevin continues to abduct impure teenage girls, and after a few minutes in, we get the first confrontation between our hero and villain. I wasn't expecting an action-heavy film, and I'm glad it isn't because it would ruin the tone of the other movies. This was never intended to be a massive finale with epic CGI fights, like a Marvel or DC installment. If you're one of those people who expected Glass to be an Infinity War-ish film, I don't even know why are you reading this because you have no idea what this trilogy is about.\r\n\r\nSarah Paulson portrays Dr. Ellie Staple, and she is responsible for treating people who think they are superheroes. So, the second act revolves around a fascinatingly engaging yet overlong narrative which leaves the main characters (and the audience) doubting if everything they did was a product of their supposedly damaged minds. There is so much to love and hate throughout this act. The interactions between these characters are as captivating as they could be, and I couldn't take my eyes off screen. Then, there's James McAvoy ... I have no words to describe how astonishing his performance is. Portraying one character is hard. Portraying almost 20 characters is just outrageous! However, McAvoy nails each personality delivering himself to his roles in such an unbelievable way. Sometimes I chuckled because I couldn't understand how it was possible an actor being able to do what he did, several times, in one-take sequences.\r\n\r\nBruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson return to portray David and Mr. Glass, respectively. The former is solid, and the respect he has for his character is evident. However, David is sort of left aside in this movie, but I'll get there. SLJ, even with less screentime than the other two, has more to do, regarding moving the plot forward. He gives an extraordinary performance, as expected from such a capable actor. During this act, these four characters offer a lot of memorable scenes, but the narrative is filled with exposition, and it overextends its stay. Shyamalan wanted to show everyone that he knows what he is writing about and a lot of times he used his characters to explicitly say, well, everything the audience needed to know, without any need to.\r\n\r\nThe third act is where everyone is going to either love or hate the film. In this genre, we all know that the \"middle ground\" is non-existent. Either you're part of the group who loves it and you will defend it at all costs, or you're part of the group who hates everything about it just due to its final moments. There is more than one Shyamalan twist during this final act. Truth is, I left a bit disappointed. It doesn't matter what your expectations are, it doesn't matter your preferences, at least one of the twists is always going to upset you. What disappoints me the most is that I don't really love any of them. Unbreakable has a final plot twist that completely changes its whole story, and it comes out of nowhere. It's literally mind-blowing! Split has the 17-year twist of it being part of the former's universe, which made several audiences in festivals give it a stand ovation. Glass has ... a bunch of twists. Period. There are no OH-MY-GOD-like reactions. There are no jaws dropped.\r\n\r\nInstead, we are left with an arguably questionable decision. A couple of the twists are fine. I would even call them \"good twists\". However, the one that changes everything feels incredibly forced and most of all, it falls short for such a highly-anticipated trilogy's last installment. I can't help but wonder \"is this really the best path you could have chosen Shyamalan? Of all the endings you imagined, this is the one you think is the best to finish a 19-year-in-the-making superhero trilogy?\" Regarding the screenplay and the characters, I have the issue above and one associated with David Dunn. If Split didn't have that final twist, it would be a good thriller. Way above average, but not astounding. The link to Unbreakable's universe is what makes it a standout movie of 2017. So, I was expecting a lot of David, and I only got a small fraction of him.\r\n\r\nI'll put this way:\r\n- if you're expecting an Unbreakable sequel, you'll probably leave disappointed;\r\n- if you're expecting Split 2, you'll love McAvoy's take on almost 20 distinct personalities, and that alone is worth the price of admission;\r\n- if you're expecting a formulaic superhero epic finale, filled with massive CGI fights and tremendous visual effects, all wrapped around colossal set pieces, then you are not worthy of even watching Glass, because this means you don't have a clue what this trilogy is about.\r\n\r\nThis is NOT a conventional comic-book trilogy. If you don't know this by now and you're still waiting for that last climax, you're only setting yourself up for disappointment, when no one asked you to anticipate such unrealistic stuff. Never criticize a film for not selling you something it was never even marketed to do (it's like expecting a horror movie to have a romantic happy ending). That said, I left disappointed with its conclusion, but there's still so much to love and praise. Seeing how David accepted who he was and the life journey he took, experiencing Kevin's pain and how each personality was born, understanding what Elijah's purpose is and being blown away by his mastermind plans ... These are characters so well-developed and so well-established that I can forgive some missteps here and there.\r\n\r\nBefore diving into the technical aspects, Anya Taylor-Joy, Spencer Treat Clark (Joseph Dunn) and Charlayne Woodard (Elijah's mother) deserve appreciation for their performances, even if they don't have that much impact in the overall story. Anya has more to do as Casey since her character's bond with Kevin is an explored subplot. Regarding the last two, they only serve as exposition devices which connects to one of my problems with the second act, by not helping the plot move forward in the smoothest way possible.\r\n\r\nConcerning M. Night Shyamalan filmmaking skills, I barely have anything negative to say. The only minor issue I have is the excessive use of POV in the action scenes (a camera attached to the actor's body which provides a close-up of his face while fighting). Nevertheless, this film is yet another proof of how skillful this guy is behind the camera. There are so many memorable moments where the technique at display is worthy of awards. We will have to wait a few months to find such marvelous cinematography as in this film. Shyamalan and Mike Gioulakis (DP, director of photography) use our characters' respective colors (yellow for Kevin, green for David and purple for Mr. Glass) as the background palette of each scene in glorious fashion. The gradual change in color tells the audience so much about what our characters are going through, elevating one of the best dialogue sequences in the entire movie (the pink room).\r\n\r\nThe editing is sublime, and I love how Shyamalan uses close-ups to show how remarkable his cast is. McAvoy's performance is one of the best this year is going to give us, but part of it is even better due to the camera work. The unfocused background stunt work in a character's close-up is the art of filmmaking at his very best, and Shyamalan knows how to film it beautifully. The score is not as memorable as Unbreakable's, but the sound design is on point. Even with a low budget (compared to the other superhero movies), Shyamalan is able to produce a technical showdown of all his attributes as a sensational filmmaker. And this, my fellow readers, I will defend until the end of his career.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Glass doesn't live up to my extremely high expectations, but it does more than enough for me to enjoy it. I can't help but feel disappointed with the way everything ends and the path that Shyamalan chose, but there's still so much to love. James McAvoy offers you a performance worthy of any price of admission. Watching him portray over 15 characters is something you won't experience maybe ever again. Going through the layers of suspense, disbelief and mystery that the screenplay is structured by is itself an adventure filled with twists and turns which grabbed my attention until the very end.\r\n\r\nAn almost flawless first act delves into an overextended second act where the story lacks consistency and even logic, at times. However, the performances and the main thread of the film keeps everyone enthralled until the polarizing third and final act, where the significant plot twists occur. How can a movie be so fascinating and frustrating at the same time? Shyamalan, ladies and gentlemen. This masterful filmmaker lends all his skills to the film, and technically it\u2019s close to perfection. Disappointing? Yes. Frustrating? Yes. Does it ruin the franchise? No, not even close. This isn\u2019t The Matrix Revolutions, but it\u2019s not Return of the King, as well. It\u2019s a good ending to a superhero trilogy that might not be the best of all-time, but it\u2019s up there, and it\u2019s definitely unique, imaginative and the closest to what our real world would be like if superheroes were a real thing. \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a comic-book fan, this trilogy is mandatory. If you love Marvel or DC, don\u2019t you dare use the word \u201cgrounded\u201d without watching this saga first. Shyamalan, see you around!\r\n\r\nRating: B+","id":"5c40a607c3a368216241e59b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c40a607c3a368216241e59b","movie_id":450465}
{"author":"garethmb","content":"It is hard to believe it has been 19 years since \u201cUnbreakable\u201d arrived in cinemas as the film seemed to setup a sequel but it did not look like it would come to fruition. That all changed in 2016 when \u201cSplit\u201d arrived and shocked audiences with a late reveal that showed a connection to the film. Writer\/Director M. Night Shyamalan has wasted no time in bringing the new film to fans with the arrival of \u201cGLASS\u201d.  The film picks up soon after the events of \u201cSplit\u201d as The Horde embodied by 23 personalities in the form of Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy) continues to kidnap young girls to serve to his highly dangerous 24th personality The Beast.\r\n\r\nSecurity expert David Dunn (Bruce Willis) along with the help of his son attempts to locate the Horde as a new group of girls has gone missing.  In time David locates The Beast and the two clash; but end up captured by authorities and sent to a facility for evaluation.\r\n\r\nTheir captive Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson) believes their special abilities are in their minds and that they really do not have the special abilities they believe they do. Each of them have a special cell designed to restrain them as David is under threat of being doused with water while Kevin has a series of strobes which will halt him and trigger a new personality.\r\n\r\nAdded to the mix is Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), who has been at the facility under heavy sedation after the events of \u201cUnbreakable\u201d.\r\n\r\nAs the therapy unfolds it becomes clear that an elaborate game of cat and mouse is underway between Price and her charges as each seems to have their own agenda.  This all builds to a very unusual final act which left me pondering if I enjoyed the final result or was disappointed with it.\r\n\r\nThe film seems to slowly be building to a big finale but yet it is far more restrained than one would expect. The film has a constant theme of Super Heroes and their traditional stories and roles as well as that of their Super Villains. \r\n\r\nOne expects a massive Battle Royale complete with elaborate FX but the film takes a more restrained approach and in doing so may disappoint some fans while pleasing others. The film naturally has its twist moments and while I will not spoil it, I can say I predicted it before I even saw the film. When I saw \u201cSplit\u201d I actually told my wife my theory and low and behold it was true. I also predicted the twists for many of Shyamalan\u2019s previous films so I had hoped for a bit more in this regard. The film does offer up some interesting options for another sequel or Spin-Off and the cast was very good especially McAvoy who adds to his menagerie of characters by showing audiences a few more of the ones previously undisclosed.\r\n\r\nThe film is at times very enjoyable and at times a bit frustrating as it seems to deviate from themes and elements that were setup earlier. That being said it does very much appear that this could indeed be just the start of something much bigger in the series.\r\n\r\n3.5 stars out of 5","id":"5c3fe4d09251416e2dafec00","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c3fe4d09251416e2dafec00","movie_id":450465}

If you don't get how demeaning that is, I can't help you._\r\n\r\n- Megyn Kelly; \"Megyn Kelly Presents: A Response to _Bombshell_\" (January 9, 2020)\r\n\r\nI've seen _Bombshell_ described as a docudramedy \u2013 a portmanteau if ever there was one, that essentially refers to a true story (docu) that's half drama (dram) and half comedy (edy). It's a relatively new subgenre that a lot of critics seem to be tracing back to Adam McKay's _The Big Short_ (2015) and _Vice_ (2018). And whilst Bombshell definitely takes inspiration from McKay's work, I think the real antecedent is Oliver Stone's 90s films. Granted, Stone never made what could be called a docudramedy \u2013 _The Doors_ (1991), _JFK_ (1991), _Heaven & Earth_ (1993) and _Nixon_ (1995) are docudramas, whereas _Natural Born Killers_ (1994) and _U Turn_ (1997) are dramedies. However, what all six films have in common, and this is where they're important to the modern docudramedy subgenre, is stylistic snappiness, unrelenting energy, visual hyperactivity, and editing rhythms that could give you seizures. And so too _Bombshell_. At least initially. And although it shares a lack of subtlety with McKay's _The Big Short_, and a lack of factual insight with _Vice_, _Bombshell_ is entertaining, brilliantly acted, and paints a horrifying picture of workplace bullying and sexual harassment. Sure, it'll be yet more evidence for the right that leftist Hollywood is incapable of partiality, but really, if you're the type of person prone to believing the propaganda machine that is Fox News, what are you even doing watching the movie in the first place?\r\n\r\nThe story begins in August 2015 during the first Republican presidential debate. Co-moderating the debate is Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron completely disappearing into the role), the host of Fox News's _The Kelly File_, who asks candidate Donald Trump (then considered a highly unlikely winner), about his history of misogynistic comments. Pointing out he has called women whom he dislikes \"_fat pigs_\", \"_dogs_\", \"_slobs_\", and \"_disgusting animals_\", she asks, \"_does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president_\". The following day, Trump proves her point during an interview with CNN by throwing a tantrum and claiming, \"_she gets out there and she starts asking me all sorts of ridiculous questions, and, you know, you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever_\". And so, much to her chagrin, Kelly finds herself the focus of the headlines. Initially, Fox News president Roger Ailes (a superb John Lithgow), supports her, telling her that the exchange was \"_great TV_\", but as time goes on, and Trump's popularity continues to rise, Ailes's begins to grow concerned about Kelly's attitude. Meanwhile, in June 2016, after saying that she supports the assault rifle ban, Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman), is fired from her show _The Real Story_. Carlson had been a co-host on the highly-rated _Fox & Friends_ until 2013, when she complained about sexist treatment by her co-hosts, and was demoted to a show in a less desirable timeslot. Fully expecting to be fired, she had already contracted a legal team, with the intention of filing a suit not against Fox, but against Ailes personally, who she claims sexually harassed her for years. However, she's told that the suit can only be successful if she can find others willing to corroborate his behaviour. But with the women of Fox urged to support Ailes (including wearing t-shirts proclaiming their loyalty), will anyone stand with Carlson? Elsewhere, the young and idealistic \"_millennial evangelical_\" and \"_Jesus influencer_\" Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie playing a composite character) is hired as a research assistant for _The O'Reilly Factor_. Determined to rise through the newsroom, she engineers a private meeting with Ailes, but is horrified when she discovers exactly what he means when he says he will need evidence of her \"_loyalty_\".\r\n\r\nThe film also features Pospisil's (fictional) mentor Jess Carr (Kate McKinnon); Ailes's wife, Beth (Connie Britton); Kelly's husband Douglas Brunt (Mark Duplass); Kelly's (fictional) producer Gil Norman (Rob Delaney); Ailes's lawyers Susan Estrich (Allison Janney) and Rudy Giuliani (Richard Kind); Fox News founder and owner Rupert Murdoch (Malcolm McDowell); Murdoch's sons, Lachlan (Ben Lawson) and James (Josh Lawson); Carlson's lawyer Nancy Smith (Robin Weigert); Kelly's (fictional) research assistants Lily Balin (Liv Hewson) and Julia Clarke (Brigette Lundy-Paine); Fox general counsel Gerson Zweifach (Andy Buckley); former Fox correspondent Rudi Bakhtiar (Nazanin Boniadi), who accused anchor Brian Wilson (Brian d'Arcy James) of sexual harassment in 2007 and was subsequently fired; Ailes's (fictional) secretary Faye (Holland Taylor); and, often in the form of single scene cameos, Fox News employees Bill Shine (Mark Moses), Dianne Brandi, (Amy Landecker), Martha MacCallum (Elisabeth R\u00f6hm), Ainsley Earhardt (Alice Eve), Alisyn Camerota (Tricia Helfer), Geraldo Rivera (an unrecognisable Tony Plana), Sean Hannity (Spencer Garrett), Bret Baier (Michael Buie), Neil Cavuto (P.J. Byrne), Kimberly Guilfoyle (Bree Condon), Bill O'Reilly (Kevin Dorff), Abby Huntsman (Ashley Greene), Chris Wallace (Marc Evan Jackson), Juliet Huddy (Jennifer Morrison), Julie Roginsky (Ahna O'Reilly), Harris Faulkner (Lisa Canning), Irena Briganti (Brooke Smith), Jeanine Pirro (Alanna Ubach), and Greta Van Susteren (Anne Ramsay).\r\n\r\nWritten by Charles Randolph (_The Life of David Gale_; _The Interpreter_; _Love & Other Drugs_) and directed by Jay Roach (_Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery_; _Meet the Parents_; _Game Change_), _Bombshell_ is the third major retelling of the Ailes saga in the last couple of years, following Alexis Bloom's documentary, _Divide and Conquer: The Story of Roger Ailes_ (2018) and the Showtime miniseries _The Loudest Voice_ (2019), which might go some way to explaining the film's disappointing box office (although I'm sure some will throw around the ridiculous \"_get woke, go broke_\" phrase). None of the principal characters, including Kelly and Carlson, were involved with the filmmaking at any point, and neither Theron nor Kidman consulted either woman. Carlson has not yet seen the film, and although Kelly originally said she might not watch it, in January 2020, she posted a video to her YouTube channel featuring herself, her husband, Rudi Bakhtiar, Juliet Huddy, and former Fox News producer Julie Zann, recorded immediately after a screening. Kelly praised the film's general accuracy, although she also noted that on occasion, it veered toward victim blaming, suggesting that certain scenes screamed out they were \"_written by a man_\".\r\n\r\nThe fall of Roger Ailes preceded the first accusations against Harvey Weinstein (October 2017) and the birth of the #MeToo movement by over a year. When Carlson first files her suit, not a single woman comes forward to support her (although, ultimately over 20 would), and one imagines that had this happened _after_ Weinstein, the situation would have been markedly different. Indeed, the film shows people such as Jeanine Pirro (perhaps the most militantly insane of Fox's cabal of instability) organising a kind of reverse picket line that seeks to discourage women from accusing Ailes (or Bill O'Reilly) of anything inappropriate, and isolating them if they do so (the \"I stand with Roger\" t-shirts are her idea). This depiction of the nature of sexual harassment in a male-dominated and female-enabled corporate arena is chillingly effective. In one particularly disturbing scene, we see a young female journalist go out for dinner with her male boss, and when he offers her career advancement in return for sex, her reaction is to pretend she doesn't understand what he means, then pretend it's not happening, and finally to apologise to him (\"_I'm sorry if I've given you the impression that our relationship could be anything but professional_\"). In this environment, women are the victims whether they resist or submit \u2013 resist, and they risk their job; submit, and they lose their self-respect. A more toxic environment is hard to imagine.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, _Bombshell_ is certainly not a subtle film, but it doesn't try to be. Roach is not trying to engage in an even-handed examination of partisan politics, nor even look at the monolithic political ideology of Fox News itself. Sure, it features lines such as Ailes claiming, \"_news is like a ship, you take your hands off the wheel and it pulls hard to the left_\", whilst Carr states the main goal of Fox News is to \"_frighten and titillate_\" rather than report facts, but these are the exceptions in a reasonably apolitical film. Roach knows that 99% of his audience will already agree that Fox News is a dangerous, hate-filled, xenophobic, propaganda machine, so he makes little effort to depict the network's political leanings. Instead, the film is about self-loathing, fear, and anxiety \u2013 it's about workplace bullying and the human cost of sexual harassment.\r\n\r\nThis is a crucial point, because the three women at the film's centre (Kelly, Carlson, and Pospisil) are not a left-wing sisterhood. They're not even friends (the trio share only a single scene, and it's without dialogue); they're not a rebellious group of bra-burning feminists, they're right-wing conservatives who helped create the toxically boorish system under which they now find themselves oppressed. True, the film is probably a little too silent on their politics, especially Kelly (more on this in a moment), but the point is that politics are fairly irrelevant \u2013 sexual harassment is sexual harassment, and your politics, religious beliefs, race, and gender are all beside the point (unless, of course, you're the type of moron who believes a woman who dresses sexy is \"_asking for it_\", in which case you probably feel Carlson and women like her got what they deserved). At the same time, the film doesn't portray Ailes as an irredeemable monster, at least not at first. Indeed, when we meet him, he's commending Kelly for her handling of Trump, and the impression is that the relationship between the two is one of respect and genuine fondness, with Ailes even going as to say, in a fatherly way, \"_I'm proud of you, Megyn_\". The point is, this is not an anti-Republican diatribe. It's the expos\u00e9 of a man who was a Republican.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, _Bombshell_ is something of a strange creature. The rapidly edited, stylistically hyperactive first half-hour or so is vintage McKay; a deeply self-reflexive almost meta-comedy. For example, one of the earliest scenes sees Theron break the fourth wall and address the audience as she gives us a tour of Fox News. Another moment sees Carr telling Pospisil that some people watch the channel so much, the logo has burnt onto their TV screens, at which point the Fox logo appears in the corner of the screen, remaining there for the rest of the scene. However, once the groundwork has been laid, Roach shifts tones completely and moves into fairly standard factual drama territory, which has the effect of making the first act feel somewhat isolated and incongruous, setting us up for a film which never arrives, particularly concerning the fourth-wall break (the only scene of its kind in the film).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the film's triptych narrative structure works very well. It's not an even divide (this is Kelly's film before it is Carlson's or Pospisil's), but it does allow Roach to dramatise just how much Ailes looks on his female staff as commodities. Carlson is the washed-up former beauty queen who no longer holds his interest; Kelly is the current flavour of the month, still beautiful, still popular; Pospisil is the future, young, vital, keen, and in awe of the man himself, as all women should be \u2013 for every Carlson, there's a Kelly to replace her, and for every Kelly, there's a Pospisil waiting in the wings, ready for grooming.\r\n\r\nFrom an acting perspective, there's not a weak link, with Theron especially impressive. Normally, she looks nothing like Kelly, but through posture, mannerisms, wardrobe, a scratchy voice, and the subtle prosthetic genius of Kazu Tsuji (who turned Joseph Gordon-Levitt into a young Bruce Willis for Rian Johnson's _Looper_, and Gary Oldman into Winston Churchill for Joe Wright's _Darkest Hour_), the actress disappears into the character, who she plays as steely and often remote, but fiercely passionate and intelligent. Is it as good as her work in Patty Jenkins's _Monster_ (2003)? Not quite. But it's still a deeply impressive performance that transcends mere imitation.\r\n\r\nThe other standout is Lithgow, whose performance is fascinatingly modulated. Introduced in a scene designed to show his fatherly protective side, Lithgow initially portrays Ailes as a flawed human being \u2013 all too aware that he's losing a battle with age, but ironically resigned to his physical appearance not being what it once was. It's only later that the actor lets the monster out of the box. One particular scene, which is both his and Robie's best, and the dark heart at the centre of the film, sees him asking an increasingly uncomfortable Pospisil to hike her skirt higher and higher, to the point where her underwear becomes visible, as he becomes increasingly aroused, indicated by nothing but his breathing. It's an exceptionally well-staged and nauseating scene which gets to the film's core \u2013 the humiliation aspect of sexual harassment. Like rape, it's not about sex (at least, not entirely), it's about power, dominance, and submission. It's about ego. Ailes knows that if women like Pospisil value their job, they'll submit, just as they have done for men like him throughout history. As he sees it, ambitious women will always need powerful men, and he behaves as he deems appropriate within that paradigm.\r\n\r\nAs for problems, I mentioned earlier that the film might be too silent on some of Kelly's history. I understand where Roach is coming from on this; to feature scenes which seem designed to depict her in a less than favourable light could run perilously close to victim-blaming \u2013 kind of a \"_who cares if she was harassed, she's a racist_\" argument. So whilst I agree in principle, I think that in practice, Roach errs in the other direction. If you knew nothing about these events, you'd be forgiven for thinking the only controversy Kelly ever encountered in her time at Fox was asking Trump about misogyny. There's no mention, for example, of her infamous \"_Jesus was a white man_\" comment from 2013. Granted, it doesn't have much to do with the story at hand, but my point is a general one. The film's Kelly is almost virginal, without blemish. Making her character more rounded, more flawed, more (dare I say it) right-wing, would have served both the character and the story, and actually helped rather than hindered Roach's argument that politics don't matter in relation to sexual harassment. On the other hand, the film _does_ address the fact that Kelly knew about Ailes for years before Carlson was fired, and it takes her to task for not doing anything with that knowledge, with one character rightly pointing out that if she had done something earlier, other victims would have been spared. Interestingly enough, this was the scene Kelly herself felt crossed the line into victim-blaming \u2013 make of that what you will.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that the tonal shift at the end of the first act is very strange, as Roach abandons the hyperactivity of the opening and settles into a far more conventional style \u2013 a transition he doesn't entirely pull off. He also makes the strange decision to mix archival footage of the real Ailes with Lithgow's performance during this first act, which somewhat shatters the film's performative universe.\r\n\r\nUltimately, _Bombshell_ will probably anger some for its refusal to really comment on how Ailes's accusers were part of the problem for a long time, propping up, excusing, and validating the system behind which he operated. However, to take this route is to suggest that because they elected not to rock the boat earlier in their careers, they don't deserve much sympathy. And anyone who knows anything about feminism or #MeToo will tell you that is absolutely _not_ the case. Certainly, in the case of Kelly, the opportunity for her to explain why she stayed silent for so long is available, but is never availed of. But is that a fault of the filmmakers or a reflection on the actual person's reluctance to take that particular journey inward? Sure, the film is at pains to avoid showing either Carlson or Kelly as in any way complicit in creating the hideously outdated patriarchy at Fox (as opposed to many of the network's other female employees, who seem to be fair game). But this is by design. Were _Bombshell_ a story about Fox News, such things ought to be examined. But it isn't. It's a story about humiliation and bullying, a story that says people do not deserve such treatment, no matter their race, religion, or politics.","id":"5e379e840c2710001a72cd98","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e379e840c2710001a72cd98","movie_id":525661}

Plus I saw a lot of negative buzz on the film. I am a progressive and have been glad to see wealthy men being held accountable for sexual harassment finally, but I wasn't anxious to watch a hit job either.

I gather one of the main characters isn't a real person, but rather a sort of amalgam of many women who were sexually abused and either left Fox or were disposed of in other ways. I liked the husband who supported his famous wife so loyally, and got a kick out of the shenanigans the lesbian character had to go through to stay hidden in plain sight. I never expect a documentary with these films, so small changes and artistic freedom doesn't bother me. It is not a documentary, after all.\r\n\r\nif you are conservative and a Fox news devotee, and don't like to see anything negative about it, you might want to give it a miss.

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nLast year, I missed A Vigilante from Olivia Wilde, and I still haven\u2019t watched it. Over time, I gradually lost interest, and I might have even forgotten about its existence. However, after watching Booksmart (which arrived late as hell to my country), I\u2019m definitely watching the former soon. I was never that big of a fan of the young-adult, high-school, coming-of-age type of movies, but some of my favorite films of the last few years (Lady Bird, The Edge of Seventeen) actually belong to that genre. Why am I enjoying these low-budget flicks more than others?\r\n\r\nWell, it can\u2019t be a coincidence that every director that tackled these movies is either tremendously talented or shows incredible potential. In addition to this, all of these films (all directed by a woman) address a teenage story starring one or more female main characters. Now, hang on to your horses: no, these movies aren\u2019t good because they\u2019re made by women. No, the story isn\u2019t captivating or entertaining due to the protagonists being women. These films are great simply because they\u2019re made by filmmakers who know what to do with a camera and a story, besides starring brilliant actors\u2026 It just happens that all of these persons are women.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not part of any movement or hate group. I don\u2019t care about politics. I hate people that let their reviews be influenced by external themes, ultimately being unfair to the movie. That said, I have no doubts that these films are better because they have women producing, directing, writing, and starring in it. Booksmart is extremely funny while being as realistic as possible at the same time. Tonally, Wilde seamlessly balances her movie, flowing through each plot point with no major missteps. Although, some occasional detours unnecessarily stretch the runtime, namely a few subplots that didn\u2019t really offer anything worth the time, besides being a bit exaggerated.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the main storyline never loses its focus. Amy and Molly smoothly drive the screenplay through entertaining moments as well as grounded, pretty dramatic scenes. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever are spectacular! I can\u2019t remember the last time I watched such a phenomenal duo of protagonists, especially when it comes to young actors\/actresses. They have impeccable chemistry, and it\u2019s quite noticeable that some sequences are undoubtedly improvised. They also deliver one of the best one-on-one verbal confrontations ever put to screen. Just one long take with both giving their all. Outstanding acting, fantastic filmmaking.\r\n\r\nWith these two actresses carrying the story forward, every single scene is elevated. The comedy bits are amusing, but the romantic drama surrounding them is addressed in such a genuine manner. Kudos to each and every screenwriter that worked on the scripts. To Olivia Wilde, I leave my wish of seeing her in more features. She has her own style, and she definitely has a lot to say, so I can\u2019t wait for her next films. Booksmart carries enough sweet messages that will surely connect with audiences all over the world, whether you\u2019re young, old, men or women. It still carries some cliches from the genre (not trusting your BFF, even though it\u2019s clear you\u2019re wrong), but it\u2019s the play on stereotypes (not everyone seems what they show) that wins at the end.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Olivia Wilde places her name on the list of directors to watch closely for the next few years. Booksmart is a wonderful addition to the coming-of-age genre, one that possesses two astonishing protagonists. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever might become superstars in the future if they continue to display such remarkable performances. With the help of a great supporting cast as well, Wilde shows the exciting and entertaining side of graduating high-school, but also all of the real dramas that teenagers go through, with no restraints. It\u2019s a character-driven story, and Amy and Molly are two persons that we should learn a lot from. It\u2019s one of the best movies of the genre, even though it still contains some of its famous cliches and a few subplots that don\u2019t quite come together. Definitely, give it a watch!\r\n\r\nRating: B+","id":"5d91e36d66a7c300198cc6c5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d91e36d66a7c300198cc6c5","movie_id":505600}

I like this type of mystery once in awhile and the timing was right for me. There is some nice scenery in places, but most of the story telling occurs in one room. There are a few minor stumbles in the script, but nothing that destroys the story. Even though one lie was fairly obvious from the start, the entire story kept changing enough to make me doubt myself a little. As always, Amitabh Bachchan uses his voice to pull you in and hold your attention. The rest of the cast is good and does their part to make the movie succeed.\r\n\r\nIf you like a tale told with many sharp corners, abrupt slamming on the brakes and the suspense of seeing someone wrapped up in their own lies, you will enjoy this movie.

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nI went to this movie not expecting much, but it never crossed my mind that I would be watching a film as bad or worse than The Nun. Honestly, going back, I was too easy on the latter since I didn\u2019t exactly give it a massively negative review, which it surely deserves. However, Annabelle Comes Home really tries its best to be even worse. I hate it. I truly do. The horror genre has been exponentially growing, and it\u2019s one of the two most popular genres right now (comic-book movies are the other), but this cheap, bland, cliche, predictable, and forgettable class of horror films is genuinely starting to annoy and frustrate me. The Conjuring Universe became just a set of silly spin-offs with entities that have no interest whatsoever and filled with extremely under-developed characters.\r\n\r\nThis is the third movie about Annabelle. Three films that address the powers of a freaking doll. Three! Very few people liked the first one, the prequel was admittedly a pleasant surprise, but this one is just atrociously bad. There\u2019s not even a story. The whole movie is based on repeating almost laughable jump scares sequences. Literally, it\u2019s all some sort of variation of the following:\r\n\r\nCharacter walks down the hall -> A strange noise occurs-> Character slowly follows that noise -> Score starts to become louder -> Character checks something and camera closes in on the actor\u2019s face -> Score becomes heavier and louder with the introduction of bass -> Another noise occurs behind the character -> Camera pans with the character and nothing happens -> Character continues to check on something -> Another noise, another pan, nothing again -> Score is reaching its climax -> Character continues doing the same thing -> Final noise, pan, and then one out of the two predictable jump scares happen: BOO! or Fake! \u2026 BOO! -> These are accompanied by a ridiculously loud sound that everyone in the theater is already bracing for because, guess what, everyone knows it\u2019s coming -> Cut -> Repeat.\r\n\r\nExcept for the first 15-20 minutes, which are used to solely provide backstory to the three main characters, every single scene is an uninspired, unimaginative, anticipated, and tedious build-up to a jump scare that heavily relies on an exaggeratedly loud sound, and someone screaming. There\u2019s no real narrative besides some character backstories which also have their own issues, especially one that involves an attempt at the start of a silly romance. Gary Dauberman tried to insert comedy in order to balance an otherwise monotonous film, but he failed miserably. Every supposedly funny moment is astonishingly cringe-worthy. It was his directorial feature-debut, and it shows.\r\n\r\nIt just feels like another cheap horror flick, filled with nothing but jump scares. One after the other. Every director in Hollywood could have done this, there\u2019s no distinct style or a trademark shot. Nothing. I do believe that every movie takes a lot of work, and there are tons of people behind a film that genuinely give it their all every time. But Annabelle Comes Home feels so much like a pure cash grab, and I hate writing these words because every movie ever is ultimately an attempt to win money for the studios. However, this sequel never feels like it\u2019s actually serving any purpose for the expansion or improvement of the universe it represents. It\u2019s a horror flick filmed in just one location, something that I usually love because you can do so much with it, but this time it really seems that it was filmed entirely at a house because it was cheaper, hence more probability of profit.\r\n\r\nThere are two clear areas in the horror genre: the zone with films like Hereditary, Get Out and Us, where the story and its characters are what\u2019s more important and scarier; and the other with movies like The Nun, The Curse of La Llorona or Annabelle Comes Home, where the only goal is to cyclically produce jump scare sequences with no narrative significance or impact. If you enjoy this latter type of films (which is absolutely okay, everything is subjective to personal preferences), then you\u2019ll probably enjoy this movie. At least, people in my theater screamed and laughed pretty hard with no respect for the moviegoers that were trying to watch the actual film. However, if you\u2019re sick of watching the same thing over and over and over and over again, please, for your own sake, skip it.\r\n\r\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the truly amazing performances, this could very easily be the worst movie of the year (Serenity still holds that spot). McKenna Grace is phenomenal as Judy! Madison Iseman and Katie Sarife are also pretty good at their roles. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga barely have any screentime, but when they do show up, they definitely elevate the scene. Everything related to the production design is quite good, but technicalities will never save a film from misery if the two pillars of any movie (story and characters) are thrown down the sewer. Also, I was shocked when I discovered that this is Rated R. There\u2019s barely any blood or anything that justifies that type of rating. It\u2019s another aspect that makes this film an even bigger disappointment.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Annabelle Comes Home is as poor or worse than The Nun. I can\u2019t really decide which one I would watch instead of the other because I truly don\u2019t want to watch any of these ever again. A brilliant cast might save this movie from a completely negative review, but it\u2019s still an atrociously cheap addition to the horror genre. Everyone knows why this film doesn\u2019t work: continuously repeating predictable, loud, and hollow jump scare sequences is not a story. I can\u2019t feel invested in any of these scenes if they lack narrative impact or a minimum level of scariness. The fact that I barely even instinctively flinched (something I can\u2019t really avoid) is a sign of how horrible this movie is. My expectations for The Conjuring 3 just dropped tremendously.

The franchise as a whole is okay, but not only is has something better come out post-_The Conjuring_, furthermore, I'm gonna go ahead and say that the first _Conjuring_ movie isn't even really that good. The only entry I've given a favourable review (\"favourable\" here meaning \"more than a 5 outta 10\") iissss *dramatic pause* THIS O- no I'm kidding it's _Conjuring 2.

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Never gets past the kind of introductory material you could find online_**\r\n\r\n> _It's a very interesting and important case as we look at the metastasizing of the ideology, and whether more and more Americans are being drawn to the narrative that al-Qaeda has espoused for many years and has grown more and more popular around the world._\r\n\r\n- Juan Zarate (Senior Advisor, Center for Strategic and International Studies, Washington DC)\r\n\r\nWritten and directed by Ciaran Cassidy, _Jihad Jane_ tells the stories of Colleen LaRose (the eponymous Jihad Jane) and Jamie Paulin Ramirez (Jihad Jamie), two forty-something white American women who were separately radicalised by Islamic extremists online and brought into an al-Qaeda plot to kill artist Lars Vilks. Dubbed the \"_new face of terrorism_\" by the almost comically ill-informed and sensationalist American news media, LaRose and Ramirez were ultimately revealed as two fragile and damaged women, each of whom had a history of abuse and were more interested in finding a sense of belonging than in politics. The film is a decent enough overview of the subject, but there's very little here that you can't find on Wikipedia, with Cassidy failing to engage with the more interesting sociological themes behind LaRose and Ramirez's stories.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, LaRose and her boyfriend Kurt took a trip to Amsterdam, where she met a Muslim man in an elevator, subsequently having a brief sexual relationship with him. Returning home to Colorado, where she and Kurt lived with her mother and his father, she started to spend more and more time watching YouTube videos of Israeli air raids on the Gaza Strip. In the comments, she would often converse with a user known as Black Flag, who invited her to join a jihadi chatroom. An Algerian whose real name was Ali Charaf Damache, Black Flag soon revealed (in unencrypted conversations) that he was the leader of an al-Qaeda cell based in County Waterford in the Republic of Ireland, convincing both LaRose and Ramirez to join him. Ramirez arrived on a Sunday, and she and Damache were married on the Monday. LaRose arrived shortly thereafter and the two were tasked with killing Lars Vilk, a Swedish artist who had published a series of drawings depicting Muhammad as a rundabout dog.\r\n\r\nAlthough this overview suggests a heavily political film, _Jihad Jane_ isn't really about Islamic extremism, al-Qaeda, or even terrorism in general. Rather, it's about how radicals target damaged individuals and how easily such people can become radicalised, turning their backs on everything and everyone they've ever known. In this respect, perhaps the film's most insightful line comes from LaRose's mother, who says, \"_they came into my home through the computer and stole my daughter_\" \u2013 it was nothing less than a kidnapping, albeit ideological rather than literal.\r\n\r\nThe film also looks, rather too briefly, at the sensationalism of the American news media, with clips of anchors on both sides of the political divide speculating that LaRose and Ramirez represent the \"_new face of terrorism_\". Presenting an absurd scenario wherein white Americans would suddenly start to join al-Qaeda _en masse_, no one, it seems, ever stopped to ask why LaRose and Ramirez were specifically targeted \u2013 what was it in their lives that left them vulnerable to radicalisation. Rather than suggesting that maybe that's where the real story is, the media instead just went with the worst-case scenario, that these two women were merely the first in an oncoming tsunami that would change the face of global terrorism forever (spoiler alert: the tsunami turned out to be a very minor splash).\r\n\r\nOn the subject of LaRose and Ramirez's vulnerability, Cassidy paints a picture of abuse, neglect, and a complete absence of any self-worth \u2013 both women are depicted as yearning for an identity, a place where they could learn who they are and maybe even start to feel good about themselves. That it was Islamic extremists that got to them is almost arbitrary; they could just as easily have been indoctrinated into a book club \u2013 they were vulnerable to any group that offered them a sense of belonging. Indeed, one gets the impression that neither woman fully understood what they were getting themselves into, focusing only on the validation that Black Flag's cell seemed to offer \u2013 a validation of which they had been stripped by the abuse each had suffered. LaRose, in particular, endured horrifying abuse at the hands of her father, who began raping her when she was seven, leading to her running away at age 13, working as a prostitute at age 15, marrying one of her clients, who then proved physically abusive, and attempting suicide in 2005. Ramirez, for her part, had three failed marriages in her past, the first of which had been physically abusive.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite the incredible story and fascinating main players, _Jihad Jane_ didn't really work for me. Apart from looking at LaRose and Ramirez's vulnerability, perhaps the most interesting theme in their story is the culpability of the media in fanning the fires of paranoia and promulgating a mistaken belief that the \"War of Terror\" is an absolute necessity, because without it, an army of white American al-Qaeda soldiers would storm the White House and establish a jihadi state in Washington, DC (spoiler alert: this never happened). Instead, the film reveals the cell in Waterford to be comically inefficient and ill-prepared to do much of anything, let alone assassinate a high-profile target in another country. Nevertheless, the media would have people believe that a disorganised group of individuals who met online were, in fact, a highly-trained and lethal assassination squad (spoiler alert: they weren't). However, Cassidy disappointingly glosses over all of this, and although he does show some clips of news anchors prophesying doom, he doesn't go anywhere with it, which is a real shame, as the LaRose and Ramirez stories are tailor-made to expose the illogical grip that Islamophobia has in the US.\r\n\r\nThere are other problems as well. For example, Cassidy fails to draw much of a distinction between ordinary Muslims and Islamic fundamentalists, which is unforgivable in a documentary of this nature. Instead, the film suggests, by way of omission, that if you convert to Islam, you immediately become a terrorist. Which is obviously not the case. Cassidy also lets Vilks off the hook during his interview. Vilks is a narcissist, an empty provocateur who seems to enjoy aggravating Muslims, but Cassidy never pushes him on why. Finally, and this is a small aesthetic thing \u2013 Cassidy leaves almost every interview hanging for a good 1-3 seconds too long; after the interviewee is finished speaking, Cassidy waits to cut away, leaving an awkward 'dead air' that really started to get on my nerves as the film progressed.\r\n\r\nAll in all, _Jihad Jane_ will tell you little you can't find on Wikipedia or in the four-part Reuters article about LaRose. It's one of those documentaries that has no business being shown in the cinema, as it's visually bland and relies far too heavily on talking heads. I didn't hate it, and I suppose it is a decent starting point if you're interested in looking into the case in more detail, but it offers nothing beyond cursory introductory material.","id":"5e534616a93d2500174c06a8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e534616a93d2500174c06a8","movie_id":615154}

(And I don\u2019t mean your occupation or marital status)*** \r\n\r\nA basketball coach at a Georgia Christian school (Alex Kendrick) is devastated when the local factory shuts down and the school loses half its students, along with a decrease in pay for him and his wife, who also works at the school (Shari Rigby). The principal appoints him to coach the cross-country running team, which consists of ONE girl with asthma (Aryn Wright-Thompson) who lives with her grandmother.  \r\n\r\n\u201cOvercomer\u201d (2019) is a Christian-themed drama from the maker of \u201cWar Room\u201d (2015), one of the most inspiring films ever made and a surprise hit at the box office, which ain\u2019t bad for an indie that only cost $3 million. This one cost $2 million more, but isn\u2019t nearly as potent. Yet it\u2019s still a solid drama with some poignant Christian-themed points that smack of real life. I could relate to several of the points, e.g. feeling like your life was a mistake and the negative fallout of an absent or distant father. \r\n\r\nSome other themes are effectively driven home, like: the importance of the relationship of husband & wife to the health of a home; it\u2019s never too late for redemption; the power of the repentance\/forgiveness dynamic; and how easy it is to fall into the pretense of Christian religion, i.e. spiritual hypocrisy. Anyone who sincerely tries to walk with the LORD will relate to these kinds of elements. Meanwhile some non-Christians will likely scoff and find these aspects fake (they couldn\u2019t be more wrong). \r\n\r\nSure, some of the acting of peripherals might not be of blockbuster caliber, but that\u2019s par for the course in these kinds of indie flicks.

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_A fascinating socio-political study of proto-feminism mixed with exceptionally dark comedy_**\r\n\r\n>_Thence to see an Italian puppet play that is within the rayles there, which is very pretty, the best that ever I saw._\r\n\r\n- Samuel Pepys (May 9, 1662); _The Diary of Samuel Pepys_ (1825)\r\n\r\n>_In my opinion the street Punch is one of those extravagant reliefs from the realities of life which would lose its hold upon the people if it were made moral and instructive. I regard it as quite harmless in its influence, and as an outrageous joke which no one in existence would think of regarding as an_ _incentive to any kind of action or as a model for any kind of conduct._\r\n\r\n- Charles Dickens; Letter to Mary Tyler (November 7, 1849)\r\n\r\nThe debut feature from Australian actress turned writer\/director Mirrah Foulkes, working from an idea by English actress Lucy Punch (which, given the subject matter, seems like it's a joke, but isn't) and her brother Tom, _Judy & Punch_ is a (very) dark comedy that presents the fictional background behind the early years of the (in)famous puppet show. Essentially a study in proto-feminism, a look at #MeToo sensibilities applied to a very un-#MeToo society, it's a strange mixture of _Monty Python_-esque slapstick and serious social critique, taking in misogyny, domestic violence, witchcraft, social stratification, and the exploitation of old age, and wrapping it all up in a gleefully anachronistic and pseudo-magical realist aesthetic, not entirely dissimilar to what you might find in the work of Angela Carter. It's a curious mix that really shouldn't work, and, for many, it probably won't. I can see some finding the tonal balance too skewered towards socio-political protest for it to work as a comedy, whereas others will argue that the comic elements undermine the seriousness of the socio-political agenda. For me, although the film is a beat too long at 105 minutes, I thought Foulkes just about got away with the tonal balancing act \u2013 most of the humour lands and most of the political material is well-handled. She's also helped immeasurably by strong performances across the board and a stunning visual design, which is especially accomplished given that this is her first feature.\r\n\r\nIn the town of Seaside (which, the opening legend informs us, is nowhere near the sea) in the English countryside, Judy (Mia Wasikowska) and Punch (Damon Herriman) are a young couple with an infant child. A Seaside-native, Judy ran away with Punch some years ago, with the duo going on to create the _Punch & Judy_ puppet show. Judy is by far the more talented puppeteer, but Punch is a natural showman and a master of self-promotion, and is often called the \"_greatest puppeteer of his generation_\", despite not even being the greatest puppeteer of his marriage. However, his inability to control his drinking led to the show's reputation waning, and the two have now returned to Seaside. Although Judy is happy just getting on with life, when Punch hears that a talent-scout is in the area, he determines to curb his drinking and put on the best show he possibly can. Meanwhile, women guilty of such things as having a rash, looking at the moon for too long, and being the neighbour of a man whose chickens died, are being accused of witchcraft at such a rate that Seaside has a monthly \"stoning day\", to the apparent horror of no one except Judy and the town's meek new constable, Derrick (Benedict Hardie), who's in love with Judy (from afar). However, when Punch responds to a horrifying accident by viciously beating Judy, she embarks upon a mission of vengeance, joined by a band of women and children who have fled the town to avoid persecution.\r\n\r\nYou know from the get-go that a movie with the title _Judy & Punch_ isn't going to be thematically subtle, and so it goes with Foulkes's film. Apart from Derrick and Scaramouche (Terry Norris), the senile husband of Maude (Brenda Palmer), Judy and Punch's elderly maid, literally every man in the film is a violent misogynistic thug. I don't bring this up by way of criticism, merely to illustrate that the film wears its themes, very proudly, on its sleeve. The _Punch & Judy_ show itself, which invariably involves Punch beating the piss out of Judy with a stick (itself not exactly a subtle phallic stand-in), has never been especially coy about its own thematic tropes, so why should a film inverting those tropes be otherwise? And, boy, does Foulkes invert them \u2013 we get Punch failing spectacularly (and hilariously) to look after their baby, we get sausage-related comedy, we get a troublesome dog, we get a police constable, we get an executioner, we even get a crocodile, but we get everything in service of a feminist rethread of the original's misogyny. Indeed, the more familiar you are with the show and its history, including its _commedia dell'arte_ origins, the more fun you'll have with the film.\r\n\r\nWithout giving too much away, _Judy & Punch_ is, at least in part, another entry in a subgenre we're seeing more and more of in recent years \u2013 gynocentric revenge films directed by women; Coralie Fargeat's spectacular _Revenge_ (2017) and Jennifer Kent's haunting _The Nightingale_ (2018) both spring to mind, but you could also include something like Isabella Ekl\u00f6f's disturbing _Holiday_ (2018), which is a rape\/revenge drama without the revenge. At one point, someone watching the show asks, \"_does Punch always win?_\", and it's precisely this kind of societal assumption which Foulkes addresses \u2013 convention at the time may have been that, yes, Punch must always win, but Foulkes suggests life is far more complicated and far less predictable.\r\n\r\nOne of _Judy & Punch_'s most obvious strengths is the aesthetic, with its lush and vibrant _milieu_ \u2013 a realm that's not quite fantasy, not quite historical reality. The town of Seaside, for all its vivid Renaissance-era squalor, is that of a fairy-tale allegory \u2013 the kind you'd expect to see terrorised by a werewolf or a giant. Production designer Josephine Ford (_Animal Kingdom_; _The Rover_; _Cargo_) has a field-day, having seemingly been turned loose to indulge herself. One half-expects to see a gingerbread house in the background. What's especially interesting, however, is that cinematographer Stefan Duscio (_The Turning_; _Jungle_; _Upgrade_) shoots the whole thing completely realistically, setting up a fascinating aesthetic juxtaposition which adds to the magical realism immensely.\r\n\r\nEnhancing the surreality even more is the electronic score by Fran\u00e7ois T\u00e9taz (_Wolf Creek_; _Rogue_; _The Portal_), which has no place in a film of this time-period (aside from T\u00e9taz's score, the soundtrack also features a rocking electronic adaptation of Johann Sebastian Bach's \"Air on a G String\" and even Leonard Cohen's \"Who by Fire\"). Despite how out of place this should be, it works wonderfully with the stylistic trappings of Foulkes's weird anachronistic vibe. Equally important here is the dialogue, which is a mixture of period-correct diction and a more modern inflection (one character even quotes one of the best-known speeches from Ridley Scott's _Gladiator_ (2000), earning the biggest laugh at the screening I attended). Put it this way \u2013 at one point, we see a group of characters in Renaissance costumes doing tai chi. If that sounds like something you'd find funny, you'll love this exceptionally-realised world.\r\n\r\nI'd be remiss here if I didn't briefly mention the acting, which is universally terrific. All the supporting players do fine jobs \u2013 Norris's Scaramouche is all politeness and confusion, whilst Palmer's Maude is all loyalty and kindness. But what comes across most is their deep love \u2013 they're the kind of elderly couple that still hold hands on a walk even though they've been married for decades. Really sweet stuff. Hardie is equally good as the one good man in a town of troublemakers. But unlike the characters played by Clint Eastwood, Derrick has zero authority and no respect. However, despite his ineffectual nature, Hardie plays him as a completely straight-shooter, true, and honest, and it's a testament to his portrayal that Derrick is more than just the punchline of a few gags. He has real interiority. Obviously, Wasikowska has the meatiest role, and her performance is similar to some of her previous work, but nevertheless, her Judy isn't just a vehicle for feminist rhetoric, she's a capable and fierce woman in her own right. For me, however, Herriman steals the show. Initially, he makes Punch seem contemptible, yet somehow, as the film goes on, he makes the character even less likeable. His work in the penultimate scene is especially strong, where he has to play the part so as to communicate one thing to the other characters and something else entirely to the audience. Superb stuff.\r\n\r\nThe film does, however, have some problems. As mentioned, for some it will be too funny to work as feminist critique, and for others, too serious to work as comedy. Others still might argue it works as neither because it never fully commits to either. Without a doubt, Foulkes walks a very fine line trying to maintain such a delicate balance. I think she pulls it off, but others won't, that's just the nature of tonally ambiguous films such as this. The narrative and dialogue are also extraordinarily on the nose on occasion. As I said above, I didn't mind this, but some people will have a problem with how direct are lines such as, \"_what is a witch but a person who exists outside your blinkered view of society?_\" A few of the themes are also under-explored, including domestic violence, which seems to have been included as a plot point simply because it's an issue in the original show \u2013 Foulkes never really takes it anywhere.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I enjoyed _Judy & Punch_. A statement on oppression and female (re)assertion, it takes the best-known elements of a world-famous puppet show, and inverts them, turning an inherently misogynistic story into a celebration of early feminism.

It wasn't so much a dislike of it as I simply didn't care. I didn't care about the characters. I didn't care about the plot. I didn't care about the stakes. I just didn't care.\r\n\r\nThis probably has to do with there being little to no characterization. The new characters (Jessica Cruz, Starboy, Miss Martian, etc.) are given personality quirks instead of actual characters. Sometimes they get downright annoying. Who are these people? How did Jessica Cruz get her GL ring? Who is Mr. Terrific? Where did Miss Martian come from? All these questions and more...will not be answered and you just have to accept that they appeared out of nowhere.\r\n\r\nThe plot doesn't get much better. The motivation for the villains? Seems to be little more than twirling their mustaches. The stakes? Unconvincing at best.\r\n\r\nAll around, this had the potential to introduce new characters in interesting was, but instead trips over it's own feet coming out the door with sloppy, shallow writing.","id":"5d651798813cb60012f9bcd3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d651798813cb60012f9bcd3","movie_id":537059}

{"author":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","content":"When it comes to constructing a successful sequel, sometimes it\u2019s best not to mess with a proven formula. Such is the case with \u201cJumanji: The Next Level,\u201d an energetic, rollicking, ridiculously amusing part two to the much-loved 2017 reboot (and surprise hit), \u201cJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.\u201d The storyline is nearly identical, but with a few twists thrown in for added amusement.\r\n\r\nNow in college, buddies Spencer (Alex Wolff), Martha (Morgan Turner), Fridge (Ser\u2019Darius Blain), and Bethany (Madison Iseman) are home for the holidays and can\u2019t wait to see each other again. Spencer has been feeling a little depressed lately and, longing to feel that unbridled bravery again, decides to jump back into the game. It quickly becomes a rescue mission and the others must follow to get him out. But this time, the game has changed. Not only are the levels more challenging, the gang has unexpectedly picked up a couple of extra players \u2014 Spencer\u2019s Grandpa Eddie (Danny DeVito) and his longtime friend Milo (Danny Glover).\r\n\r\nThe film was made for fans of the reboot, and it\u2019s nearly impossible to be disappointed this second time around. It\u2019s a fun reunion with likeable characters that you love spending time with. There are appropriate and enjoyable callback references to previous movie and, something that is rarely true of sequels, the quality stands up to it as well.\r\n\r\nWhen the story adds a fun twist that mixes things up a bit, it allows the actors to really chew the scenery. All of the characters are out of whack, with only Martha going back into the game as her original character, the dance-fighting man-killer known as Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan). Fridge is now the overweight cartographer Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black), and Grandpa Eddie has taken over as the hunky and fearless Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson). Zoologist Mouse Finbar (Kevin Hart) is now Milo, while Spencer re-enters the story as a brand new character (and one of the film\u2019s best surprises).\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a given that Black will bring guaranteed laughs, but Hart and Johnson have very funny comedic timing and they play off each other so well. Their banter is consistently hilarious, especially when they are channeling their elderly avatar inhabitants. DeVito and his cantankerous shtick is a huge upgrade, as he delivers some of the biggest chortles in his all-too-brief supporting role.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of exciting action sequences that complement the fast-paced fantasy adventure. The sense of real peril serves the film well, because it ramps up the emotional factor. So does the idea that friendship can foster a family, and by the end, this one will tug on your heartstrings.\r\n\r\nThe film gets right to the good stuff without a long or boring setup, and the story is roughly the same as its predecessor. There\u2019s not much new plot-wise, but who cares when a movie is this much of a wild, entertaining ride?","id":"5e7d5ac5ab1bc75874c322f6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e7d5ac5ab1bc75874c322f6","movie_id":512200}

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"Judy clicks her heels three times to transport us to a world of melancholy and self-destruction. Somewhere over the rainbow lies Judy Garland. An innocent, fragile and talented young actress who infiltrated silver screens and rapidly shot to fame. The voice of an ethereal angel. MGM\u2019s golden girl.\r\n\r\nBut behind the lavish productions and beneath that unimpeachable smile, was an undisputed amount of pressure. A malleable marionette susceptible to the puppetry of Hollywood. A product of ruthless executives. Garland was no longer a person. Her individuality brutally reaped by higher authorities, manipulating her into believing she was physically unattractive. Starving, pill-popping and overworked. That was the cruel life of Judy Garland. The glistening glitter and the iconic voice, mere facades masquerading the suppressed pain. Unfortunately though, her repressed childhood and early stardom steered Garland into a life of alcohol and substance abuse. The yellow brick road wasn\u2019t so golden after all.\r\n\r\nGoold\u2019s biopic (and part adaptation of the Broadway play) dramatises her later career, forced to perform a sell-out tour in London due to her unreliability in the States. Her unworkable state being a consequence of substance abuse. Clumsily walking out into the spotlight that she undoubtedly adored. That inevitable lust for fame. A legendary status. Trapped, her battle for the custody of her children raged on. Torn between the natural instinct of motherhood, and the only element of her life she\u2019s ever known. Her profession. Edge\u2019s screenplay, whilst surface level on certain aspects which merely imitated a biographical article instead of further sentimentalising Judy as an individual, eloquently explored the dangers of fame at such a vulnerable age. The inability to have a voice. To be bossed around by studio executives who see her as an asset rather than a human being.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s very much a by-the-numbers biopic, and Goold\u2019s blend of light and darkness within his direction made this comparable to the equally melancholic \u2018My Week With Marilyn\u2019. Snippets of fans announcing their adoration for their idol, empowering the eponymous star even further. That joyous search for justification. But the sorrow never fades. Goold\u2019s constant tone of desolation throughout, whilst teetered on unnecessary melodrama, honed in on the impact Garland made. There\u2019s nothing more tragic than witnessing an individual undergo self-destruction, and Goold rarely distracts us from this.\r\n\r\nIt all comes down to the central performance. The actress who is in every scene, devoting her soul into the character. Ladies and gentlemen, Zellweger became Garland. Astonishingly embodying her right from the immediate title card. I\u2019ll be irrefutably disappointed if she does not garner awards for her performance. Not only is it a career best, it\u2019s quite simply the best of the year. The nuances, the voice, the erratic body movement. Rarely does a performance make me lose sight of who is actually acting. During that final rendition of \u201cOver The Rainbow\u201d, my eyes moistened. No longer was I seeing Zellweger, but Judy herself. It was cathartic. It was reincarnation. It was divine. Goold bravely shot the performances as one take sequences for the most part, which has to be applauded for artistic integrity. It did however make the lip syncing incredibly obvious which frustratingly pulled me out of the film. No fault of Zellweger\u2019s stunning performance though. Rising star herself Buckley deserves some praise for her crystal clear performance. Such delicate clarity against the chaotic Garland. Would\u2019ve liked to have seen more from Gambon and Sewell, but appreciate the film is solely focussed on Zellweger.\r\n\r\nThe film wouldn\u2019t work without her. Garland has never been depicted with such compassion before, and it's an amalgamation of quality over quantity. It\u2019s not big. It\u2019s not flashy. It\u2019s just honest. Garland herself would\u2019ve been proud, and we will never forget her. But please, do bring a box of tissues with you...","id":"5e21db46cf4b8b0017f19bd4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e21db46cf4b8b0017f19bd4","movie_id":491283}

{"author":"garethmb","content":"Nels Coxman (Liam Neeson) is a simple man who spends his days clearing the roads in a remote Colorado Ski Town and spends his days with his wife and his son. Nels is so unassuming that when he is awarded Citizen of the Year he states that there are others far more worthy and fusses over getting dressed up to accept the award and make a speech.\r\n\r\nWhen his son is found dead of a Heroin overdose; Nels is not willing to accept that his son was a user even though this puts tremendous strain on his marriage and has taken Nels to consider suicide. At his worst moment he learns that his son\u2019 co-worker was involved with some shady dealing and that his son was likely collateral damage from the criminal elements involved.\r\n\r\nWith a new found sense of purpose: Nels embarks on a quest to find the truth and avenge his son\u2019s death no matter the consequences.\r\n\r\nOne would think that \u201cCold Pursuit\u201d is a standard revenge film but it unexpectedly changes direction shortly after Nels starts exacting his revenge. The film transforms into a Dark Comedy of sorts as characters get a Title Screen when they are killed many of which have a morbid humor to them. The film even takes the bold step of moving away from Neeson for a good third of the film and putting the emphasis on other characters from rival crime organizations to the Sherriff and his eager Detective (Emmy Rossum).\r\nAs such the film is not what you expect as although there is plenty of action at times; it is a Dark Comedy with dramatic elements. It is more in line of what you might expect at a Film Festival from an Indie studio versus a major studio release.\r\nAs such fans of Neeson may be disappointed in seeing a departure from the type of films they have come to expect from him in recent years while others may embrace the quirky nature of the film.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5","id":"5c64bcdd0e0a267dfd9ae696","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c64bcdd0e0a267dfd9ae696","movie_id":438650}

{"author":"narrator56","content":"Okay, this is definitely not aimed at the typical movie goer. Colewell is a quiet movies that in my opinion rewards the patient viewer. It isn't dramatic or suspenseful and a cynical reviewer would probably blurt out that nothing happens in it. It is more of a slice of life film, a character study. It is also a gentle commentary on the changes in society as companies have become bigger and bigger and drive smaller companies out of business. Post offices don't exactly fit into that model, but comparisons can be made. If you are older like I am you may remember the phrase \"going postal.\" That was before this age of mass shootings everywhere, back when the stress and pressure of an enlarging and transforming postal service drove employees to extreme violence. Nowadays it feels like that growing trend was the canary in the coal mine, and we see that sort of stress and pressure everywhere in life.\r\n\r\nBut there is no violence in this gentle character study, except for a few raised voices by townspeople who don't want to see their local post office close down. I write novels that start at point A and go to point B, so I am not a big fan of flashbacks in movies. But there is an interesting use of flashback here, and in fact I wish they went a bit farther with it concerning the main character's personal history.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I highly recommend this film, though I suggest you not watch it when you are weary, because quiet films often require a more focused viewing, without distractions or cat naps.

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_A solid adaptation, albeit with a bit too much alpaca-based comedy_**\r\n\r\n>_This was no fruit of such worlds and suns as shine on the telescopes and photographic plates of our observatories. This was no breath from the skies whose motions and dimensions our astronomers measure or deem too vast to measure. It was just a colour out of space \u2013 a frightful messenger from unformed realms of infinity beyond all Nature as we know it; from realms whose mere existence stuns the brain and numbs us with the black extra-cosmic gulfs it throws open before our frenzied eyes._\r\n\r\n- H.P. Lovecraft; \"The Colour Out of Space\"; _Amazing Stories_ (September, 1927)\r\n\r\nMuch of the work of H.P. Lovecraft takes place in a vast shared universe, which would, by its very nature, seem to lend itself to the current vogue for cinematic long-form narratives. However, considering the size of his _oeuvre_, very little of it has been adapted for the screen, and Lovecraft in general has proved a difficult author to film (although Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna would probably beg to differ). And so we have _Colour Out of Space_, written and directed by Richard Stanley (his first film in 25 years, after he was famously fired three days into the disastrous shoot of his long-gestating dream project, _The Island of Dr. Moreau_). A modernisation but otherwise surprisingly faithful adaptation of Lovecraft's 1927 short story \"The Colour Out of Space\", _Colour_ takes a good stab at depicting one of Lovecraft's most oblique entities (essentially it exists as an indescribable colour). Mixing humour and body horror (perhaps weighed a little too much towards humour), the film gives Nicholas Cage another opportunity to go full-Cage after he recently cut loose in Brian Taylor's _Mom and Dad_ (2017) and Panos Cosmatos's _Mandy_ (2018). And boy does he lean into it \u2013 this is the most ludicrous, histrionic, and borderline farcical performance he's given since Robert Bierman's _Vampire's Kiss_ (1989), screaming about the importance of alpacas one minute (they're \"_the animal of the future_\"), calmly playing the dutiful father the next. And how you respond to this will largely dictate how you respond to the film \u2013 ridiculously camp, over the top, and vapid or ridiculously camp, over the top, and darkly compelling.\r\n\r\nJust outside the city of Arkham, MA (the fictitious setting of many Lovecraftian stories), Nathan Gardner (Cage), and his wife Theresa (Joely Richardson), teenage children Benny (Brendan Meyer) and Lavinia (Madeleine Arthur), and young son Jack (Julian Hilliard) have moved into Nathan's deceased father's property. Theresa has recently been given the all-clear after battling breast cancer, and is gradually returning to work as a commodities trader, working from home via the internet (albeit with an unreliable connection). Lavinia, a practising Wiccan, spends her time riding the family horse and performing rituals she hopes will keep her mother cancer-free. Nathan, for his part, has embraced rural life by raising alpacas on the property's farm. As the film begins, hydrologist Ward (Eliot Knight) arrives in the area to survey the water table. That night, the sky fills with pulsating light and a rock crashes onto the Gardners' land. The following day, Ward says it's probably just a meteorite, although Ezra (Tommy Chong, essentially playing himself), an ageing hippie who lives in the forest completely off the grid, believes it's a sign that something has gone wrong with the natural order of things. As time passes, the Gardners start to experience ever-more bizarre events \u2013 unnaturally localised lightning storms that seem to come from nowhere; huge fuchsia-like plants that seem to grow overnight; a horrific odour coming from the meteorite that only Nathan can smell; a gigantic purple mantis flying around; radios and the internet cutting out more than normal; the water turning strange colours; the meteorite itself mysteriously turning to dust; the family's dog, Lavinia's horse, and Nathan's alpacas starting to acting strangely; the family's produce (such as tomatoes) growing at exponential speeds; even time itself appears to be corrupted. Soon enough, the family members begin to show signs of change \u2013 Jack starts talking to someone in the well; Nathan discovers his arm is developing scales; Theresa accidentally cuts off two of her fingers and barely notices; Benny goes in and out of fugues, Lavinia becomes violently nauseous. And as the whole family finds itself in mortal danger, are any of them unaffected to the point where they're capable of saving the others?\r\n\r\nThe original \"The Colour out of Space\" tells the story of a surveyor from Boston who learns a meteorite crashed just outside Arkham several years previously in an area now known as the \"Blasted Heath\", apparently poisoning everything and causing anybody with whom it came into contact to go insane. Hoping to get more specific information, the unnamed surveyor seeks out Ammi Pierce, a hermit living in the nearby woods, who tells him the story of Nahum Gardner, on whose property the meteorite landed. As it started to shrink, the meteorite left behind globules of a colour that fell outside the visible spectrum and could only be described by analogy. Over the following year, the Gardner family experience a series of increasingly devastating traumas before eventually turning on one another.\r\n\r\nLovecraft felt that the depiction of alien species in fiction was too familiar, too defined by the range of human comprehension, and he believed that if we were ever to encounter real cosmic beings, they could be so unlike anything in our experience as to be impossible to describe, or even process in our minds. One of his aims with \"Colour\" was to create an entity that didn't fulfil the rubric of conforming to human understanding \u2013 hence the only description is by analogy, and even then, it's described only in relation to colour. In fact, it's never even determined if the entity is conscious or not, at least not in the sense that humans recognise consciousness. It may be aware, but it's just as possible that it isn't, and the negative effects experienced by the Gardners aren't a sign of aggressiveness but simply the result of two vastly different existences interacting with one another. The story has been adapted for the screen four main times \u2013 Daniel Haller's _Die, Monster, Die!_ (1965), David Keith's _The Curse_ (1987), Ivan Zuccon's _Colour from the Dark_, and Huan Vu's rather enjoyable _Die farbe_ (2010), which is in black and white, except for the colours emitted by the meteorite.\r\n\r\nThis latest version opens with Ward speaking in a contemplative sub-Malick style voiceover that's fairly unnecessary, but which doesn't distract too much (it's only used a couple of times). After some basic introductory preamble to show us the family dynamic and establish important plot points such as Theresa's cancer, Lavinia's Wiccan rituals, Nathan and his alpacas, the film then features one of the most inorganic expositionary scenes I've ever seen, as Nathan and Theresa stand on the porch, admiring the woods and spend a good five minutes telling each other things that they both already know \u2013 the property used to belong to Nathan's father, Nathan is afraid of turning into his father, Nathan used to be a painter but hasn't worked in a while, Theresa is starting to get back into work, Lavinia and Benny are finding it hard to adapt to rural life, Jack not so much. It really is a ridiculous scene, to the point where it would have been no more on-the-nose to feature captions with character info.\r\n\r\nWhere Stanley is much more successful is in how he depicts the entity itself, or rather, how he doesn't. Obviously, by choosing to adapt this story, he knew he would have to give some kind of visual representation to something that exists, to human eyes at least, only as a colour beyond the visible spectrum. Lovecraft gets around this problem by way of analogy \u2013 the entity is never explicitly described other than by comparison \u2013 but this is not a technique available to a filmmaker. With this in mind, Stanley wisely keeps everything as vague as possible \u2013 vibrant, modulating pulses of light that seem to be emanating from somewhere just outside the frame, sounds originating from something just out of sight, vaguely-defined spatial distortions, colour manipulations with no obvious source, personality changes with no obvious reasoning behind them. It's rare you see such restraint in what is, ostensibly at least, a horror story, and Stanley is to be commended for it.\r\n\r\nImportant here is the actual colour itself. Again, in the novel, Lovecraft never says, for example, that the colour is \"mainly purple\", or words to that effect, because it isn't describable in those terms, and, once again, this poses a unique problem for a filmmaker \u2013 if something on-screen has a colour, then that colour has to be shown. However, instead of attempting to create an indescribable colour, director of photography Steve Annis (_Kissing Candice_; _I Am Mother_) chooses to go the route of not settling for any one stable colour \u2013 every time we see the effects of the meteorite, the hue appears to be in a state of flux, modulating through purple, magenta, mauve, fuchsia, lavender \u2013 so although we can say the colours are recognisable, they are never identifiable as any one specific colour, which, it has to be said, is probably the best choice the filmmakers could have made.\r\n\r\nAs we get into the third act, the film abandons all sense of restraint and goes completely batshit insane, with about five different things happening at any one moment, and the body horror which has threatened to break through from the earliest moments finally unleashed, foregrounding the exceptional work of special effects supervisor\/creature designer Dan Martin (_The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)_; _ABCs of Death 2_; _High Rise_). These scenes are heavily indebted to David Cronenberg, especially his earlier work such as _Shivers_ (1975), _Rabid_ (1977), and _The Brood_ (1979), although the most obvious touchstone is Chris Walas's work on Cronenberg's masterpiece, _The Fly_ (1986), where it's not so much body horror, as body mincemeat. A lot of Martin's creature design seems inspired by the legendary work of Rob Bottin, and there's a direct visual quote of one of the best moments in John Carpenter's _The Thing_ (1982). Some of the more grotesque human-related effects also reminded me a little of Screaming Mad George's work on Brian Yuzna's _Society_ (1989), especially the orgy scene.\r\n\r\nIt's also in the last act where Cage is turned loose, signalled by an epic meltdown when he discovers Benny hasn't closed the barn door and the alpacas have gotten out. From there, it's Nicholas Cage unrestrained, figuratively amped up on amphetamines, cocaine, and coffee. There is a problem with this, however. Full-Cage has been seen in films such as _Vampire's Kiss_, John Woo's _Face\/Off_ (1997), Werner Herzog's _Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call \u2013 New Orleans_ (2009), _Mom and Dad_, and _Mandy_, but each performance has felt fairly organic, never becoming self-conscious; each performance feels like a legitimate interpretation on the part of the actor, with the character feeling like a psychologically-real person, to one degree or another. In _Colour_, however, to an even greater extent than he did in Neil LaBute's virtually unwatchable _The Wicker Man_ (2006), Cage crosses into self-parody, with his performance having as much to do with people's preconceived notions of a Nicholas Cage performance as it does with finding the character. There are a couple of scenes here were he suddenly goes full-Cage out of nowhere, with very little narrative justification, only to revert to relative normality the next scene, and these alterations don't feel like organic character development, they feel like Cage winking at the audience. \r\n\r\nWhich might be entertaining and all, but which serves neither the character nor the film especially well. For all its insanity, this is a relatively serious movie, but Cage's performance is so manically uneven and unpredictable, that it affects everything around it. Example \u2013 after the aforementioned meltdown (\"_Don't you know how expensive those alpacas were_\"), which just about fits in what we know of the character, as Nathan is walking away from Benny and Lavinia, he stops, turns, pauses, shouts, \"_ALPACAS_\", pauses again, and then walks away. This got a huge laugh at the screening I attended, and it was undoubtedly funny. But does self-reflexive humour by the leading man really serve the story well at this point? No, not in the slightest. In essence, this scene marks the point where the character ceases to be Nathan Gardner and becomes a version of Nicholas Cage. And this is driven home in the very next scene, where Cage once again portrays Gardner as a kind and caring father.\r\n\r\nThe other characters all have a kind of internal logic to their crumbling sanity; the meteorite affects each of them differently, with their minds disintegrating in different, but consistent ways. With Cage, however, it's there one minute, absent the next, and Stanley seems unwilling, or unable, to establish the parameters by which Nathan's mind is disintegrating, seemingly going for laughs rather than something more cogent.\r\n\r\nThis issue notwithstanding, I enjoyed _Colour Out of Space_ a great deal. Stanley's return to the director's chair is to be admired for its restraint and how faithful it remains to the very tricky Lovecraftian original. The body-horror in the film's last act will appeal to fans of the grotesque, whilst others will take great pleasure from Cage's insanity, as narratively unjustified as it is. The film is ridiculous on many levels, but it's extremely well realised and well made, and is to be applauded for not trying to attach an explicit meaning to a story which avoids any kind of thematic specificity.","id":"5dc8aea07d2bc1579834ece6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dc8aea07d2bc1579834ece6","movie_id":548473}

{"author":"ceefoo","content":"As a fan of Final Destination (2000) I approached the film with an air of optimism hoping to discover a similar result. The premise was interesting, ideal for the mystery horror genre. \r\nUnfortunately, 'Countdown' quickly descends into your standard cheese eg. jump scares, silly monsters that come and get you. Too much of the unknown malevolence is revealed too soon - and the mystery, suspense and most importantly scariness falls by the wayside. Fear lies in the unknown and what your own mind can conjure up. Unfortunately, not many filmmakers appear to realize this anymore... but that's not what killed this movie.\r\n\r\n**SPOILERS!**\r\nJust about every mainstream movie and TV show made nowadays is filled with political messaging; some more overt than others, but if you know what to look for you'll see it.  \r\nI was really hoping this one could just stick to telling a story, where I could sit back for 90 minutes and watch our protagonist \"Quinn\" race against the Countdown to avoid certain death, as opposed to having political messages shoved down my throat and endure yet more anti-White attacks, insults and repugnance. Shamefully, 'Countdown' joins that growing list of Cultural Marxist propaganda. That's what destroyed this movie for me.\r\n\r\nNow not all of these instances alone I'm about to provide are proof of Cultural Marxism. It's the contrast of having a false representation forcibly repeated with agenda driven consistency and how they're programming us to believe that these representations are real-world norms. \r\nGenerally observable group behaviors, patterns and actions are no longer being characterized and instead misrepresented; even inverted in media. Stereotypes are \"no longer politically correct,\" regardless whether they're accurate or fair. Alternatively, these real-life human traits and personas are being distorted not only in fiction but the real world for a political agenda.\r\n\r\nThe propaganda that's occurring throughout the majority of media now has a real-life impact and consequences. In other words; our understanding of real-world actions, events and moral standards are being corrupted and manipulated through media.\r\n\r\nSome examples:\r\n\r\n* \"Evil White man\" as doctor Sullivan the sociopath and sexual predator. [Whites with fair hair and blue eyes are increasingly portrayed as evil villains and wrongdoers; untrustworthy and treacherous. Often with English, German or Eastern European accents].\r\n* \"Good & heroic Black man.\" In contrast noble Matt is a perfect gentleman and sensitive boyfriend material. [Black and Brown performers are often now given the role of hero or good doer. Courageous and virtuous; trustworthy and loyal].\r\n* White male bashing and anti-White remarks. The line by Matt: _\"I just found out I'm gonna die and I don't mind taking a White man with me.\"_ Imagine if the roles were reversed?\r\n* Miscegenation. Predictably a blue-eyed, blonde girl with a Black man. Race-mixing propaganda is everywhere you look now. Film, TV, Advertising etc. Diversity means: 'without Whites,' particularly straight, White males. The more diversity there is, the fewer White people they'll be.\r\n* More White male bashing & conspiracy theorist attacks. A drunk at the bar becomes a test subject because he's talking about Antarctica and \"Flat Earth.\" Matt wants to get him to download the app so they can read the Terms & Conditions and Quinn doesn't feel good about it. \r\nOf course, once the drunk mentions the taboo subject you're not allowed to question, 'the Holocaust,' Quinn changes her mind and promptly tells Matt to go ahead. Bear in mind the protagonist, Quinn is supposed to be a caring, ethical nurse!\r\n* Quinn and Matt share an interracial kiss in front of her teenage sister and she looks on approvingly. [The younger the age one can start receiving programming & conditioning, the better. This has been proven with declassified mind control experiment files].\r\n* In a scene at the end credits 'Tech Nerd' Derek is on his Tinder date and acts like a complete ass and turn-off to his date. If only she'd chosen the \"more desirable\" non-White date instead?!\r\n\r\nNow that I've pointed out some examples of Cultural Marxism and anti-White propaganda you'll begin to notice them everywhere - that's if you haven't already. Hope this review helps and you got to swallow a few Red Pills in the process! Thanks for reading.\r\n\r\n**Verdict 1\/10**\r\n**'Countdown'** is more subversive Cultural Marxist anti-White propaganda with a story that could have been good if done right.","id":"5ead0abd1a934f0020e856b5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ead0abd1a934f0020e856b5","movie_id":599975}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nSo, Chapter Two is a sequel to It (2017), and my expectations were a bit high. I really enjoyed the latter to the point of considering it one of the year\u2019s best, as well as one of the best Stephen King cinematic adaptations. Andy Muschietti returning to the director\u2019s chair and having such a fantastic cast portraying the adult versions of the Losers (not only in terms of quality acting but also regarding how well the adults look like the older versions of the young actors) are two of the main reasons why I was genuinely excited. Also, the runtime (longest horror movie ever?!) definitely left me wondering how a horror flick could have the same duration of some of the most epic films in cinema\u2026\r\n\r\nWell, I got to be honest: I\u2019m disappointed. It\u2019s not a bad movie, at all, but it doesn\u2019t even come close to its predecessor\u2019s heels. I disagree with some headlines I\u2019ve read though. Some say the comedy was misplaced, taking away impact from emotional or dark moments. There\u2019s barely a moment where it was expected seriousness and laughter kicked in instead, but when it does occur, it actually works. I just think it wasn\u2019t as funny as the previous film, overall. Granted, Bill Hader as Richie Tozier is hilarious, and a perfect cast as an adult Finn Wolfhard. His chemistry with James Ransone (Eddie Kaspbrak) resembles the one Wolfhard, and Jack Dylan Grazer had, therefore this\/these duo(s) being the comedy highlight.\r\n\r\nSome say the movie is too long. Now, this is a tricky one. Usually, when people feel bored or not as entertained as they wanted to be, they tend to blame it on the film\u2019s runtime, especially if it\u2019s over 100 minutes. I agree that the movie FEELS long, but I disagree that the runtime is too long. There\u2019s more than enough story to explore, and literally, every single character from the Losers Club has an interesting arc. The problem here is that not all of them are explored in a way that\u2019s funny, scary, or just captivating enough. The fact that Jessica Chastain\u2019s (Beverly Marsh) sequence with the old lady is entirely displayed in one of the trailers (and consequently shown at every single screening) doesn\u2019t help the pacing.\r\n\r\nThe first act is pretty decent. As expected, it shows us where everyone is, what they\u2019re doing for a living, and how they get back together. During this act, it\u2019s pretty clear that Muschietti is going to give time to develop each character and follow their respective arcs to the end, hence the lengthy runtime. However, the second act falls flat. Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy \/ Jaeden Martell) has the most emotionally impactful storyline, one that affects the main plot, making the time that is spent with him worth it. Same goes for Richie\u2019s subplot. On the opposite side, the rest of the group doesn\u2019t have entertaining sequences or new developments whatsoever.\r\n\r\nBeverly continues to be affected by her childhood of abuse from her father. Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan \/ Jeremy Ray Taylor) keeps being in love with Bev. Eddie is still a whiny little \u201ckid\u201d who\u2019s scared of everything that might make him ill. Stanley Uris (Andy Bean \/ Wyatt Oleff) doesn\u2019t do anything, and Mike Hanlon is surprisingly the engine that moves the plot forward, which is a problem of its own since I never really cared for that character (he was definitely the one put aside in the 2017\u2019s movie). Honestly, he just serves as an exposition device considering he spends the whole time just explaining everything the audience needs to know to understand where the film is going.\r\n\r\nFinally, the third act is a mixed bag. While it does provide a climactic ending with a sweet message, it feels very much like its predecessor. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything, but it\u2019s incredibly repetitive comparing to the first movie. Considering all things together, it\u2019s a big letdown since it feels like the exact same film, but with older versions of the characters. Obviously, each of them has a different arc in this one, something the first didn\u2019t have the time to explore, but looking at the main story, it\u2019s pretty much the exact same thing, including how it ends (just with a minor twitch). Nevertheless, the performances are all great\u2026 \r\n\r\nJames McAvoy continues his streak of amazing displays, and Bill Hader has to be the MVP for the range he demonstrates. I wish Skarsg\u00e5rd had more time to shine as Pennywise, though. In 2017, I thought he really nailed the character and made it his own. Unfortunately, this time around, Pennywise doesn\u2019t have that much screentime (such a disappointment), and when it appears, it often looks too CGI-ish, taking away from the gripping performance of its actor. The finale has almost no Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd since there\u2019s so much CGI. Despite that, I congratulate the team(s) behind the makeup, hairstyling, costume, and production design. Derry looks terrific, and the time jumps between the young and the old gang worked seamlessly partially due to these visual achievements.\r\n\r\nAndy Muschietti knows how to work a camera, and the movie is very well-shot. However, he should have been able to come up with creative sequences to deliver a different level of entertainment, especially during the tiresome second act. Gary Dauberman\u2019s screenplay is clever, and it brings this enormous story to a fitting conclusion, but he also could have imagined some new ideas for some of the characters. There are a couple of great sequences though, especially one with Bill going through a theme park tent with illusions. \r\n\r\nIn the end, It Chapter Two fails to deliver a conclusion worthy of its epic runtime. Even with a phenomenal cast, it isn\u2019t as funny, as scary or even as captivating as its predecessor. Its runtime is appropriated having in mind that each character has a personal arc, but only a couple of them are genuinely compelling and entertaining. Therefore, the film feels too long, uneven, and it could have used a bit more creativity when it comes to its climactic finale. Its central story feels very similar to the last movie, its scary sequences are nowhere near the quality seen before, and even though the costume and production design are top-notch, there\u2019s excessive use of CGI on Pennywise. It still carries some emotionally convincing moments, as well as a couple of cool sequences. Overall, it\u2019s \u2026 okay.\r\n\r\nRating: C","id":"5d7a7a93069f0e10db322bcc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d7a7a93069f0e10db322bcc","movie_id":474350}

{"author":"SWITCH.","content":"\u2018It Chapter 2\u2019 isn\u2019t as stable or as refined a film as its predecessor, and while it feels lacking by comparison, it\u2019s still far better than most studio horror films. It\u2019s epic, ambitious, crazy, witty and unafraid to go for the heart as well as the throat. As a whole, this adaptation of maybe Stephen King\u2019s greatest work feels singular in the landscape of modern horror cinema: two films built on strong interconnected relationships spread over decades, as sentimental as they are vicious, and executed on the scale of a fantasy epic. They also may be amongst the best adaptations of King\u2019s work, understanding what makes his writing (and this novel in particular) so horrifying and so arresting, the human horror amongst the fantastical.

{"author":"Matthew Brady","content":"\u201cYou lied and I died!\u201d\r\n\r\nMaking us proud Georgie.\r\n\r\nI re-watched the 1990 mini-series and 2017 remake last month in preparation for this movie in terms of judging in quality. The 90's version had it moments, but I find some scenes unintentionally funny where it reeked of early Stephen King adaptations. 2017 was surprisingly good and a massive improvement, but laid back on cheap thrills.\r\n\r\n\u2018IT: Chapter Two\u2019 was a tough act to follow up on after the monster success of the first and with the second chapter being the hardest to adapt. I thought the movie both succeeds and stumbles in parts. Although reflecting back makes it feel more like a parody than a serious horror movie. An epic finale that ended in a over the top fashion - with themes of childhood trauma and the idea of holding on to the past despite growing up with age are sprinkled through out. The loser club are all grown up now and returning home to kill IT.\r\n\r\nWhoever cast the grow up version of the loser club deserves massive praise here, because it\u2019s pitch perfect casting and I could definitely see the child stars growing up to be the adult stars. James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Jay Ryan, and Isaiah Mustafa were all great in bringing the more dramatic aspects to the film. While Bill Hader and James Ranson bring the comedic aspects, but not to say they weren't dramatic as well, even making me tear up at one point.\r\n\r\nBill Skarsgard was truly amazing as Pennywise. The physicality in his movement has a certain silliness that you would expect to see from a clown, yet predatory with his animal-like attacks with drool running down his mouth and eyes staring in opposite directions despite looking straight at you. I find the dancing clown incredibly terrifying whenever he becomes playful and kind to deceive children.\r\n\r\nAndy Muschietti truly shines as a director when it comes to bizarre imagery and unsettling camera angles, while also capturing some real emotions through the lens. The opening scene at the bridge where a homophobic attack takes place was really brutal and starts the movie off strong - on par with the Georgie meets Pennywise scene in the first movie.\r\n\r\nDespite the run time being nearly three hours long, but I can\u2019t recall ever being bored. It moved at a even pace in my opinion. I guess a few scenes could\u2019ve been cut as most of it is unused footage from the first movie. Although it would be difficult to cut scenes as everything follows up to the next scene and that emotional punch towards the end wouldn\u2019t be earned.\r\n\r\nNow for the issues:\r\n\r\nHenry Bowers was completely pointless in this movie and was only used for jump scars. Same thing with Mike, who through out these movies has nothing to do and the important things he did in the book was given to different characters.\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t like how Stan\u2019s suicide was handle, because you find out he actually \u201csacrificed\u201d himself to save the others.\r\n\r\nSome of the humor didn\u2019t always land, especially if it\u2019s right after a tense scene where it kinda deflates the horror. At times I struggled to gasp what the film marker was going for in certain scenes. Is this scene suppose to be scary or funny? Both maybe?\r\n\r\nI wish there was more practical work for the monster scenes instead of CGI, because at times it looked really terrible. The finale battle at the end could\u2019ve been in a video game boss fight.\r\n\r\n* Overall rating: Not as strong as the first, but still enjoyed it. Still, let\u2019s kill this f**king clown.**strong text**","id":"5e2f26341685da0019e932b9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2f26341685da0019e932b9","movie_id":474350}

{"author":"SWITCH.","content":"There was surprise when France chose to submit 'Les Mis\u00e9rables' as their entry for Best International Film at the upcoming Academy Awards rather than C\u00e9line Sciamma's beloved 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire', but the decision makes a certain degree of sense. Where 'Portrait' is a timeless instant classic that speaks to the ongoing human condition, Ladj Jay's debut film is so immediate and vital for where France, and indeed Europe, find themselves now. Just as in Victor Hugo's novel, they are on the brink of a massive cultural and political collapse, a crisis that will define their future as a multicultural and economic society. Its mostly conventional structure and approach make it far more accessible than you expect, but this is never at the expense of its intelligence or intention. 'Les Mis\u00e9rables' is a remarkable, electrifying and ultimately shattering film, a stellar debut for Ladj Jay, and most importantly, a work that feels necessary - not just for France, but for those that created it and those who see it. It's a thrilling act of cinematic protest.\r\n- Daniel Lammin\r\n\r\nRead Daniel's full article...\r\nhttps:\/\/www.maketheswitch.com.au\/article\/review-les-miserables-a-remarkably-thrilling-act-of-cinematic-protest","id":"5e1824b7c267960016516bb3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e1824b7c267960016516bb3","movie_id":586863}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nAs a huge fan of the sci-fi genre, especially when it involves alien invasions of some kind, movies like this always leave me excited. It doesn\u2019t matter what the audience or critics have been saying (in fact, it never does) because it won\u2019t affect my enthusiasm (in fact, nothing does). By knowing who the cast, director, writers, and producers are, I instantly know how high or low I need to set my expectations. Having this in mind, I was hoping that Captive State could be one of 2019\u2019s surprises. It has an unusual concept that can provide a very unique story if it\u2019s well-told, so the big question is: did they execute all of their ideas successfully?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, no. Not even close. Honestly, the screenplay is so convoluted and messy that I felt \u201clost\u201d several times. I admire the amount of work that they put into this because they actually did and it shows. The overall concept and its ramifications are all there, the story is indeed interesting. It\u2019s just the way that it\u2019s told that ruins the entire thing. However, the first sentence I heard after the film\u2019s conclusion, came from someone who said: \u201chere I was expecting massive action and \u2026\u201d If you go into your movie theater expecting a straightforward, action-heavy, alien-invasion-type flick and you leave disappointed, that\u2019s on you! From the trailers to its marketing, there was never a message of \u201chey, this is pure action, humans vs. aliens!\u201d \r\n\r\nIt tried its best to give the world a different take on this \u201csub-genre\u201d, let\u2019s call it that. I mean, they had it all: a good cast with the always astonishing John Goodman (William Mulligan) as one of the protagonists, beautiful visual effects that elevated the set design, and the aliens actually have an intriguing physical shape. Sadly, there\u2019s barely any aliens throughout the runtime. There\u2019s hardly \u2026 anything. I don\u2019t know what happened post-production, but it feels like they were pushed to deliver something different, so they cut all of the other scenes with extra-terrestrial stuff (I\u2019m certain that they had more to show).\r\n\r\nThe main issue here is that you can never have a 100% ambiguous story. Arrival is probably the best non-typical alien-invasion movie ever, not because it scarcely shows any aliens or action, but due to its twistful and thought-provoking script. Nevertheless, it still shows a lot! You don\u2019t leave that film disappointed because you didn\u2019t see the inside of a spaceship or an actual alien. You leave perplexed and with your mind blown. Captive State just leaves you confused and wishing for more. A lot more. There\u2019s really not that much more to say on this review without getting into spoiler territory.\r\n\r\nSadly, this is one of those movies that come out every year showing tremendous potential, an innovative and intriguing premise, but that in the end, it just isn\u2019t able to succeed. It doesn\u2019t structure its story and ideas in the most efficient way possible. Its execution is sloppy, filled with hollow characters, no real flow (it feels like it\u2019s just a scene after another scene), too vague, and it profoundly hopes that you didn\u2019t figure out a pretty obvious twist so they can shock you seconds away from the end. It\u2019s not horrible, but it\u2019s definitely frustrating and disappointing.\r\n\r\nJohn Goodman delivers a great performance as always, and the visual effects are striking, to say the least. The production quality is undeniable, they really worked hard to provide the audience with an environment that actually feels real. The first act is pretty good, but it\u2019s downhill from there. Ashton Sanders shares the lead with Goodman, and he\u2019s also pretty good, no doubt about it. However, and this sums up the film pretty well: if I have to check online what the name of the main character was (Gabriel Drummond), then something went terribly wrong. It\u2019s not going to end up being one of the worst movies of the year, but so far, it\u2019s the biggest letdown.\r\n\r\nRating: C-","id":"5c9cfa5292514124d43134b6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c9cfa5292514124d43134b6","movie_id":429471}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nAs a fair and impartial film critic, I need to state this: I don't care about the controversy surrounding Brie Larson or the agendas this movie is trying to push or not. I'm not part of any hate group or factions that hate those hate groups. I just want to watch a good superhero origin film, that introduces me to a new character that I'm supposed to care about and root for. Read my review, sure, but make up your own mind. Go see the movie and be honest. Since that's out of the way, let's keep going ...\r\n\r\nIt was always going to be a huge risk trying to introduce such an important and powerful character like Carol Danvers into the end of Phase Three. Not only she comes from nowhere (as far as I remember, she was barely mentioned in previous films or even not mentioned at all before Infinity War), but it's the last movie before the climactic, era-ending Avengers: Endgame. She is the one who is going to take our heroes to victory against Thanos, the bad guy who I dare say easily defeated on his own pretty much every superhero we knew until that moment. So, while I was not expecting an outstanding story packed with phenomenal action, I was also hoping for more than just a simple origin film like it came from Phase One.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that's exactly what I got. Everything is fine. Just okay. There's no exceptional fight scene, but most of it is decent. There's no visual wonder, but it doesn't look bad. The characters' potential feels wasted, but they work for the plot. Everything is frustratingly balanced, which is something I would praise in a bunch of other movies, but this isn't 2008 anymore. Marvel isn't starting its cinematic universe, it is almost finishing a whole arc involving more than 20 installments! I'm going straight to the one character everyone wants to talk about: Goose ... Sorry, Captain Marvel! Jokes aside, this is one of the issues I was worried about going into the film theater. I escaped 99% of the marketing for this movie as I do with every other flick. I didn't watch a single clip\/trailer, I know as much about the controversy surrounding this installment as my dog and I kept my expectations realistic having in mind what I truly know about the film and only the film itself. The one thing I was not able to hide from were the headlines giving tremendous praise to ... a cat.\r\n\r\nNow, follow me on this: I'm going to watch a superhero origin movie. A whole new character is waiting for me at the big screen. I'm excited to know more about her, where does she come from, what her powers are and so much more. Some headlines show up on my social media feed, and I find that a CAT \"steals the show,\" \"deserves a spin-off,\" and I don't even know what more. Granted, the cat is indeed funny. It provides some chuckles here and there. That's it. I love cats, but I honestly can't figure out why everyone is so amazed by an animal doing animal things. Maybe it's because the rest of the film isn't that entertaining ... or perhaps just because people really, really love cats. Like the movie itself, I think it's a mixture of both options.\r\n\r\nBack to what matters and to who everyone should be talking about: Brie Larson. Marvel rarely misses its casting choices, and being Larson an Academy-Award winner, her talent is undeniable. She has everything she needs to consistently deliver a strong performance, so I'm surprised that she couldn't stand out from the film's overall blandness. I repeat, the movie isn't bad, at all. However, I was expecting an actress of Brie Larson's caliber to elevate, at least, her own character, but she's like everyone else: just good enough. I don't know if her performance was limited by bad direction or by her own decisions, but the potential is there, and I'm sure the Russo brothers will give her a much more thrilling arc in Endgame.\r\n\r\nThe two best attributes of the entire film are, without a single doubt, the buddy-cop relationship that Carol and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) develop, and the groundbreaking de-aging CGI. Story-wise, the interactions between these two characters are so captivating and humorous that the pacing issues of the first act gradually start to disappear. Carol's past is often approached with quick flashes and a lot of cheap exposition, so it's a breath of fresh air to have SLJ and Larson play off of each other. Nevertheless, the de-aging technology used is absolutely astounding. My fellow readers, welcome to the future of filmmaking, where any actor\/actress can portray a younger version of themselves and not be visually disturbing. I completely forgot SLJ is 70-years-old! The best visual effects\/CGI are the ones you don't even know they're there and Captain Marvel succeeds in delivering mind-blowing, realistic, younger versions of well-known actors.\r\n\r\nCharacter-wise, Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck should have done way better. So much wasted potential in such a crucial moment in the MCU. Carol Danvers has a great backstory, but the way it was explored kind of diminishes its impact. Still, as Captain Marvel, she is indeed a badass woman! There are some cool action sequences, especially in the beginning, but as the movie slowly progresses on its story, the fight scenes got more sloppy, choppy and way too dark. Jude Law (Yon-Rogg) is amazing as he always is, and Ben Mendelsohn is brilliant as Talos. Both characters have interesting subplots that come together well, which is not something that can be said for the rest of the Marvel \"villains.\"\r\n\r\nTechnically ... You guessed it, it's okay! Taking away the jaw-dropping de-aging CGI, the visuals seem to lack some sort of style. Looking back at Black Panther, Captain America or Guardians of the Galaxy, each movie has a visual aesthetic that belongs to their own stories. Captain Marvel doesn't really feel like it has its own style. I truly feel that with other directors, this film could have been way better. Boden and Fleck already proved that they are capable filmmakers, but maybe they were not ready to lead such a massive blockbuster. That said, the 90s score is awesome and quite adequate to the movie's period. There are a couple of moments where the VFX regarding Carol Danvers's powers are spectacular, but everything ultimately feels like this is a Phase One film, instead of the 21st MCU installment.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Captain Marvel achieves the minimum requirements: introduce the fans to a new superhero, who is going to be extremely important in the eventual defeat of Thanos. Carol Danvers is a fascinating character with an emotional backstory, but the screenplay isn't structured or explored in the most entertaining way possible. Brie Larson delivers a strong performance, pushing aside her haters, even if I feel that under other directors, she would have reached her character's full potential. Her scenes with Samuel L .Jackson are hilarious and the best part of the whole movie, as well as the groundbreaking de-aging CGI, which is absolutely mind-blowing. The action sequences needed better editing and some more choreography (this is MCU's Phase Three and 2019, so I want to be able to actually see what's happening), but the most prominent \"issue\" is how the story blindly obeys the superhero origin film's formula. This isn't exactly a flaw or a problem, it's just that I was expecting more. A lot more.\r\n\r\nIn the end, there's not a memorable fight scene, an emotionally overwhelming moment or even a genuinely bone-chilling, epic scene. It doesn't leave you salivating for Avengers: Endgame, but it also doesn't leave you less excited. Everything is just ... fine. And there's nothing wrong with that. But there's also nothing extraordinary.\r\n\r\nRating: B-","id":"5c823eac925141277d1c885a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c823eac925141277d1c885a","movie_id":299537}

{"author":"Luis_989","content":"Theatrical plays or musicals will not always translate well into filmic language, that's well known and will not change, because both media are very different by nature. To question it is to deceive yourself.\r\n\r\nPersonally I've never believed that Cats is a great musical but perhaps its success says something else but even so a film adaptation in my view just could not work. I didn't see how, especially considering the costumes but it was being made so the question now was how it was going to look.\r\n\r\nI know there's already a ''movie'' but that's basically a recording of the play.\r\n\r\nThen the trailers appeared and what they showed looked weird, off putting and scary, but the visual work is not always everything in a movie, yet something decisive was being played here.\r\nEventually the defeat was inevitable.\r\n\r\nCats is full of good intentions but it's a failure, not only because of terrible work in CGI and how it makes you feel but because it never manages to immerse you in the world of the story and is a bizarre world and I can have fun in bizarre worlds, it's only that this one is pretty misguided.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's that huge fiasco that a lot of film critics are saying it is and maybe eventually will find its niche and audience, after all worse films have become cults films, so that can surely happen but right now Cats is simply an idea that didn't work, that it wasn't well executed or directed and that although it's not a monumental catastrophe, it's indeed a gigantic disappointment.","id":"5e01514b26dac10014666aaa","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e01514b26dac10014666aaa","movie_id":536869}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_A charming Irish ghost story that is consistently hilarious; but Chris de Burgh is definitely going to sue_**\r\n\r\n>_There is only one way to appease a ghost. You must do the things it asks you. The ghosts of a nation sometimes ask very big things; and they must be appeased whatever the cost._\r\n\r\n- P\u00e1draig Pearse; \"Ghosts\" (1915)\r\n\r\n>_Some ghosts are so quiet you would hardly know they were there._\r\n\r\n- Bernie McGill; _The Butterfly Cabinet_ (2011)\r\n\r\nThe debut feature from writer\/directors Mike Ahern and Enda Loughman, _Extra Ordinary_ (the reason for it being two words is explained in the movie) is an unexpectedly hilarious Irish ghost story. I'm sure there are other examples in the Irish comedy\/ghost genre, but the only one I can think of off-hand is Neil Jordan's well-intentioned but poorly executed _High Spirits_ (1988), a film built almost exclusively on \"_look how weird and strange the Oorish are_\" humour. _Extra Ordinary_, on the other hand, isn't about the Irishness of the characters at all, focusing instead on their inherent decency, and, in the case of the villain, his tendency to call upon Astaroth so as to achieve musical success. As you do. It's a quant film in all the right ways, leaning into the trope of small-town people forced to deal with situations far beyond their ability, and it gets a lot of mileage out of just how completely out of their depth they find themselves. The humour is low-key and irreverent, but it doesn't rely on winking at an audience it assumes to be Irish \u2013 I would imagine most of the laughs will translate well to international markets. Some of the nuances will certainly be lost, but, by and large, the film is working with a broader palette by juxtaposing the supernatural with the utterly banal. And it works exceptionally well.\r\n\r\nIn an unspecified rural Irish town, Rose Dooley (Agatha Ellis) is a young girl with the ability to talk to ghosts, who works with her father, famed paranormal researcher Vincent Dooley (Risteard Cooper, playing the character as if he's in an ultra-serious existentialist drama). However, when an incident involving a dog, a bus, and a haunted pothole (don't ask), leaves Vincent dead, Rose swears never to use her ability again. Fast-forward 20-odd years, and the now adult Rose (stand-up comedienne Maeve Higgins, who is also credited with \"additional writing\") is a genial but lonely driving instructor whose only real friend is her sister Sailor (Terri Chandler). Rose receives calls every day from those looking for help contacting the dead, but she steadfastly refuses to get involved. Meanwhile, Martin Martin (a superb Barry Ward, whose physicality reminded me of Michael Crawford) and his daughter Sarah (Emma Coleman) are being haunted by Martin's deceased wife, Bonnie, and so Martin contacts Rose, pretending he wants a driving lesson. However, when he reveals his true intentions, although the two have really clicked, Rose refuses to help. At the same time, one-hit-wonder Christian Winter (a hilarious Will Forte in full caricature mode), living in Ireland as a tax exile, is desperate to make a comeback, and has abducted a local virgin, who he must sacrifice to Astaroth on the night of the blood moon. Which wouldn't be a problem except that his wife, Claudia (a spectacularly acerbic Claudia O'Doherty), accidentally causes the young girl to, well, explode. With the blood moon in a couple of days, Christian must find another virgin, and lands on Sarah. However, Rose has decided to relent and help Martin banish Bonnie, but upon arriving at the house, she quickly realises they have bigger problems when she finds Emma levitating (never a good sign). Deducing that she's imprisoned in a \"holding spell\", Rose tells Martin that the only way they can save her is by collecting the ectoplasm of seven ghosts, and they can only do that by letting each ghost temporarily possess Martin. And so begins a race against time as Rose and Martin try to save Sarah, and Christian attempts to stop them.\r\n\r\n_Extra Ordinary_ is one of those films that could have been distractingly sardonic if it wasn't made with such genuine warmth. Sure, the humour is, for the most part, fairly irreverent, but it's done in such a way as to endear the characters to the audience due to their imperfections rather than encourage us to laugh at their failings. For example, when Rose explains to Martin what she has to do to release Sarah, he responds, \"_oh, so like_ The Exorcist?\", to which she says, completely seriously, \"_I don't know, I've never met him._\" It's a funny moment, but so too is it a rather sweet moment, and a lot of the humour is in this vein; on the edge of being sarcastic, but never cynical.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of the humour is that the jokes come thick and fast from literally the opening few seconds. Indeed, there's rarely a scene without some element of humour somewhere in it. This isn't the type of comedy where everything gets serious at certain points, or where the characters' experiences force them to make major changes to their lives because they have learned this lesson and that lesson. Instead, from the opening voiceover to literally the last words spoken, this is wall-to-wall humour. For example, Martin is essentially a victim of \"_domestic violence by spectre_\" (his deceased wife enjoys roughing him up), but Ahern and Loughman never allow this to become an issue as so many comedy writers do, using humour as a platform to examine serious topics. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but it's just not how _Extra Ordinary_ operates. Along the same lines, there's Martin's relationship with Sarah. He's introduced as being overly protective of her (his great fear is that she'll end up \"_a homeless sex maniac living on the streets and snorting hash_\"), whilst she views him as a bit of an embarrassment. However, their relationship never leads to the clich\u00e9d old scene where [insert emotion here] they learn to value one another's flaws. Again, that's just not the film's _modus operandi_, and it's all the fresher because of it.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, the humour is introduced in the first few seconds, as the film opens with a VHS recording of Vincent Dooley's public access TV show (featuring some of the most low-rent production values you'll ever see), with Dooley explaining that the reason cheese gives people bad dreams is because cheese is made of the same stuff as ghosts, and hence, ghosts find cheese easy to inhabit. In fact, he tells us, most cheese is haunted, as we watch a montage of stock footage of cheese complete with VHS tracking lines along the bottom of the screen. And this is the tone in which the entire film takes place; it never really departs from this register (which does have the effect of letting you know almost instantly whether you're likely to enjoy it). Later on, a major plot point is Christian's \"_virgin rod_\". This is a magical staff which can point Christian towards a suitable virgin for sacrifice (although as Claudia points out, it looks like a huge wooden dildo). To avail of its services, he must hold it up, whisper an incantation, then drop it, and it will point towards a virgin. He must then walk a few feet in that direction, pick it up, and repeat. And yes, it's as absurdly ridiculous as it sounds, and the shot of him wandering across an empty field as he continually picks up and drops the stick is absolutely hilarious.\r\n\r\nThe film doesn't rely too heavily on sight-gags, but there's a moment towards the end that is side-splitting. In a climactic car chase, as Sarah floats down the road towards the sacrificial altar, she's followed by Christian and Claudia in one car and Rose and Martin in another. The first few shots are all tight interiors, but when it finally cuts to a wide shot, we realise why \u2013 the entire chase is taking place at around 10mph, as they are all moving at the speed Sarah is floating. It's one of the most slapstick moments, and even without the increasingly frustrated Claudia's solution to speed things up, it's one of the best scenes in the film \u2013 but what she does to get things moving elevate it to a whole other level. And I won't spoil anything, but the \"ginger werewolf scene\" has to be seen to be believed; suffice to say, it's pure _Father Ted_ humour, with an elaborate build-up that makes the utter mundanity of the punchline exquisite (point of fact, I'd be shocked to find that Ahern and Loughman weren't _Ted_ fans, as the film has very similar DNA).\r\n\r\nHowever, easily the single most hilarious moment is when we see a brief clip of Christian's claim to fame, a song called \"Cosmic Woman\" that is so obviously a riff on Chris de Burgh's \"A Spaceman Came Travelling By\" (1976), I'm pretty sure he could sue for royalties. Everything about it, from the cheesy special effects in the video to the instrumental refrain to the self-important lyrics, just screams out where it was taken from. At the screening I attended, the film had been getting a lot of laughs, but, much to my surprise, this scene didn't, with only a few of us finding it really funny. It was only when I was leaving the theatre I realised why \u2013 the majority of the audience was too young to be in on the joke. If you don't know the song, do yourself a favour and watch the video for \"Spaceman\" on YouTube before seeing the film. It'll enrich your viewing experience, trust me.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, there are plenty of smaller moments that really stand out. For example, right at the start, a \"_based on a true story_\" subtitle appears on screen. Perhaps getting a dig at the seemingly never-ending spate of horror films to make this claim, however tenuous, no sooner has the subtitle appeared when a garbage truck quite literally drives across the frame, erasing the words behind it. A beautiful and perfectly judged self-reflexive moment if ever there was one. Along the same lines is cinematographer James Mather's tendency to use overly dramatic crash pans (usually accompanied by a similarly overly-dramatic sound effect), especially in car scenes, with the incongruity between hyperkinetic form and utterly mundane content never failing to make me chuckle. Speaking of overly-dramatic shots, in one particular scene Mather even uses the Brian De Palma staple that is the split diopter, except he does so in the most mundane setting you could possibly imagine (in a scene in which a person holds a mop in front of their face as a disguise), with predictably hilarious results. Another shot worth mentioning is one I've seen used on a few posters, and it's \"_The Exorcist_ shot\", which sees Rose standing in Martin's garden looking up at the illuminated window. There's also Christian's truly hilarious driving lesson (his mortal fear is being behind the wheel of a car), which sees him spend more time putting on a pair of driving gloves than actually driving. Managing to go all of four feet (and somehow giving himself a bloody nose in the process), he decides he's had enough for the day, and then sits silently and motionless, until Rose realises he's waiting for her to come around and open his door. Also consistently funny is Claudia's inability to understand why the virgin must be sacrificed on a particular night, with her refrain of \"_just kill the bitch_\" one of the film's best running gags.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'd be remiss here if I didn't mention Barry Ward's performance as Martin. Due to the nature of the plot, he has to play multiple characters, but as each one still looks like Martin, he has to convey everything with tone of voice and physicality, so as he moves from leering old man to chain-smoking nagging wife, you really see his range as a performer as he differentiates from one spirit to the next.\r\n\r\n_Extra Ordinary_ is a distinctly Irish film, but it's one whose self-aware brand of Irishness should travel pretty well. Strong performances all-round, constant laughs, some terrific sight-gags, and a generally warm tone make for a fine film. For some, the highpoint will be Forte's ludicrously over-the-top Christian, for others, it will be the genuinely touching character beats between Rose and Martin. Irrespective of your preference, however, I would strongly recommend this truly charming film.","id":"5d9d183e477215004102a0d9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d9d183e477215004102a0d9","movie_id":538227}

Doing a movie about the fact that people can be in your midst and be killers is more interesting than just doing a movie about the catalogue of violence. Some people have criticised the lack of violence in the film as being disrespectful to the victims, saying we're glorifying a killer. I actually think the opposite, and I'm confused and surprised at the idea that someone showing the worst moment in somebody's existence - the moment where they're being tortured and killed \u2013 how showing that means you're not glorifying the killer. I think that's much more disrespectful to the victims of the violent crime. To me, you're glorifying the killer by showing the worst moment._\r\n\r\n- Joe Berlinger; \"Q&A: _Extremely Wicked_ Director Joe Berlinger Loves Zac Efron, Not Ted Bundy\" (Brandon Katz); _Observer_ (May 3, 2019)\r\n\r\nDirected by Joe Berlinger immediately after he completed work on _Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes_, _Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile_ is a strange beast. A serial killer film which doesn't show any serial killing, it has been advertised as told from the perspective of a single character, but that character is one who's barely in the second half of the movie. Tonally, it's also unusual insofar as it seems for about 90% of its runtime to genuinely flirt with the notion that Bundy may have been the victim of a vast conspiracy. In reality, of course, given leeway by a judge out of his depth, granted privileges by a prison system unaware of how dangerous he really was, turned into an ironic folk hero by a media unused to such a charming and humorous breed of criminal, and supported by a cadre of women who judged him too good-looking to be a killer, Bundy was the first celebrity serial killer, and remains the best-known example of such (Charles Manson doesn't count as he wasn't a serial killer). And whilst the film is worth seeing for Zac Efron's performance if nothing else, it's a strangely muted affair, neither ghoulish warts-and-all carnage nor restrained psychological treatise. Telling the story of Bundy from the perspective of a woman who was oblivious to his true nature is an undeniably interesting narrative choice, and had Berlinger stuck to this format, it could have made for a fascinating film. However, the longer it goes on, the more it seems to revel in Bundy's flamboyance, and what begins as an intriguing insider's look at living with a killer soon shifts into an underwhelming courtroom drama, only returning to its original tone in the final (entirely fictional) scene.\r\n\r\nThe film begins in 1989, with Ted Bundy (Efron) on death row in Florida, still maintaining his innocence, although his execution is imminent. Visited by his former girlfriend, Liz Kendall (Lilly Collins), aka Liz Kloepfer, she demands he confess to his crimes so she can move on with her life. The film then returns to 1969, the night Bundy and Liz first met in a Seattle bar. As a single mother with a low-paying job, Liz is surprised to find this charismatic, handsome, and intelligent law student so interested in her, but interested he is, with the duo quickly falling in love, and Bundy treating both Liz and her daughter Molly extremely well. The film then jumps forward to July 1974. When two women are abducted in broad daylight from a packed Lake Sammamish State Park in Washington, the police issue a sketch of a man who resembles Bundy, saying the suspect may drive a yellow Volkswagen Beetle (which he does). The following year, when he is stopped in Utah for a minor traffic violation, the police find a \"kidnap kit\" in his car (ropes, handcuffs, ski mask, leather gloves, crowbar etc), and take him into custody, where he is positively identified by Carol DaRonch (Grace Victoria Cox), who had narrowly avoiding being kidnapped in November 1974. Bundy vehemently protests his innocence to Liz, claiming that DaRonch was shown his picture prior to the line-up, and although concerned, she accepts his explanations. After a bench trial, Bundy is found guilty of attempted kidnapping, and sentenced to one to 15 years. When he is subsequently charged with murder in Colorado, although she still believes him to be innocent, Liz starts to drink heavily to help her deal with the stress. However, as police departments across California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, and Florida start to connect Bundy to a string of recent murders, it becomes harder and harder for Liz to shake the feeling that there's more to her boyfriend than she could ever have imagined.\r\n\r\nVery loosely based on Liz Kloepfer's memoir, _The Phantom Prince: My Life With Ted Bundy_ (1981), _Extremely Wicked_ is written by Michael Werwie, and had been on The Black List for several years before it came to the attention of Berlinger. The hook for the original script was that the audience is unaware the character they're watching is in fact Ted Bundy; the film was written as a supposedly fictional story of a young couple whose life is shattered when he is accused of multiple murders, with his real identity only coming as a final act twist. As Berlinger was completing _The Ted Bundy Tapes_, the script was offered to him, and although he found the twist distasteful, he loved the idea of looking at the Bundy story through the eyes of someone who thought him to be innocent. Known as a documentarian for films such as _Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills_ (1996), _Metallica: Some Kind of Monster_ (2004), and _Whitey: United States of America v. James J. Bulger_ (2014), _Extremely Wicked_ is only Berlinger's second scripted film, after the fascinating misfire that was _Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2_ (2000).\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest appeals of the movie, of course, is the unexpected casting of Zac Efron as Bundy (Efron also serves as executive producer). Known for his early roles in Disney films such as Kenny Ortega's original _High School Musical_ trilogy, and later comedies such as Nicholas Stoller's _Neighbors_ (2014), Dan Mazer's _Dirty Grandpa_ (2016), and Seth Gordon's _Baywatch_ (2017), aside from Lee Daniels's batshit insane _The Paperboy_ (2012) and Peter Landesman's ensemble piece _Parkland_ (2013), Efron has never really had a chance to show any dramatic chaps. And it has to be said, he's excellent here. Although he doesn't look like Bundy _per se_ (Bundy was good looking, he wasn't _that_ good looking), Efron has the mannerisms down to an absolute tee. If you watch the film after the docu-series, you'll really pick up on the depth of the performance, especially in the scene where the gloating Sheriff of Leon County, Ken Katsaris (Kevin McClatchy), indicts Bundy in front of the assembled media - Efron's every movement and gesture, every glance at the camera, the way he smiles, the way he stands, the tone of his voice, everything is perfect. Of course, Bundy's good looks and charisma were his most formidable weapons, and as a very attractive, very clean-cut, and very charming white man, Efron is able to tap into the fact that one of the most important aspects of the Bundy case was his white privilege (something which has been discussed by everyone from Robert D. Keppel to Ann Rule to Stephen G. Michaud). Bundy proved that evil could fester under an extremely attractive fa\u00e7ade, and this gives Efron room to manoeuvre, playing every scene in such a way that the subtext is always apparent even though he never ostensibly lets Bundy's mask slip. Indeed, it's the absence of any obvious monstrousness in the performance which is so unnerving. As Liz, Lily Collins makes less of an impact, but that's because she has less to work with (more on this in a moment). Having said that, however, where Collins is especially good is in conveying how the seemingly never-ending series of accusations are having a cumulative effect; every time we see her, she looks wearier than before.\r\n\r\nThe film also features a fine supporting cast, all delivering strong, if restrained, performances; Kaya Scodelario as Carole Ann Boone (an old friend of Bundy's who ultimately became his wife and mother to his child), Angela Sarafyan as Joanna (Liz's (fictional) best friend), Haley Joel Osment as Jerry Thompson (Liz's (fictional) co-worker), James Hetfield as Officer Bob Hayward (who arrested Bundy in Utah in 1975), Jeffrey Donovan as John O'Connell (Bundy's attorney in the DaRonch kidnapping case in Utah), Dylan Baker as David Yocom (prosecutor in the DaRonch kidnapping case), Terry Kinney as Det. Mike Fisher (one of the lead investigators working the Colorado murders), and Jim Parsons as Larry Simpson (prosecutor in the Florida double murder trial). The only false note from an acting perspective is John Malkovich, who's spectacularly miscast as Edward Cowart, the presiding judge at Bundy's double-murder trial. Apart from the fact that Malkovich looks nothing like Cowart, he chews every bit of scenery anywhere near him, overacting to a painful degree. He's not quite as bad as he is in _Billions_, where he has the worst Russian accent I've ever heard from an actor not named Gary Oldman, but he's not far off (and I say that as a Malkovich fan).\r\n\r\nOne of the film's most notable components is that, apart from one brief scene near the end, there is no depiction of violence. Ostensibly this is Liz's story, and although Berlinger loses sense of that in the second half, he does adhere to the principle of not just keeping the violence off-screen, but of never showing us anything leading up to any of the murders, or any of the immediate aftermath. The idea, obviously enough, is to present Bundy not with the 20-20 hindsight of history, but with the same degree of ambiguity with which Liz would have viewed him. Indeed, if by some miracle someone stumbled on the film who knew nothing about Bundy, I'd imagine they would view it as a mystery thriller about a woman whose boyfriend may or may not be a killer. It's an interesting way into the story and seems a genuine attempt to do something more than simply reproduce the salacious details of the crimes, dwelling not on Bundy's sadism and savagery, but on his manipulations of the people in his life. In this sense, I'm sure it will disappoint those hoping for gory excess, scenes of decapitation, and copious necrophilia. Prior to the end, the closest the film really gets to the details of the crimes is a sequence of Bundy and Liz in relationship bliss, with 16mm home movie-style footage playing on-screen, over which we hear news reports about the murders.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you're making a film about a serial killer which doesn't feature much in the way of serial killing, you're going to need to fill it with something, and in this sense, Berlinger focuses, at least in the first half, on how a killer can lie and manipulate, coming across as completely normal to all who know him (it's not mentioned in the film, but it is covered in the docu-series that The Church of the Latter-day Saints of Jesus Christ, which Bundy had joined shortly before his 1975 arrest, were so convinced of his innocence, they sent representatives to support him in court and publicly defended his character). With this in mind, the first half isn't really a true crime story so much as it is an examination of the lies a person capable of evil must tell to hide that capability. Berlinger himself has said that the film is about the mechanics of how a person can be \"_seduced by someone capable of evil_\", and it was his intention that the audience actually like Bundy, as he wanted them to feel disgust with themselves \u2013 just like Liz, Berlinger wanted them to be seduced by evil, and feel very uncomfortable with themselves for allowing it to happen.\r\n\r\nHowever, as admirable as this approach is, the film has a lot of problems, some of which arise directly because of the unique entry point into the story. For one thing, because the film depicts Bundy not as we now know him but as his contemporaries saw him, it means we only see the performative side, never the monstrous underbelly. Sure, this means that the film avoids exploitation, but in doing so, it could be accused of sanitisation (to be fair, this is something of a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario - show the murders and you're exploiting real-life suffering, don't show them and you're hiding the true nature of his crimes). And granted, portraying him as a possibly innocent man is part of the attempt to explain how Liz and the myriad of other women who supported him were essentially partaking in a form of mass self-delusion. However, all the good intentions in the world don't change the fact that the film's Bundy is a lovable rogue who bites his thumb at the system, not a murderer, a man who raped and butchered a 12-year-old child, and who decapitated multiple women and had sex with their corpses.\r\n\r\nI understand that Berlinger wants to dramatise the reason that Liz and others were duped, depicting how she could have been blinded by devotion to a man that she thought (correctly, as it turned out) was too good to be true. But the problem is that she herself is never characterised enough for this to work. Indeed, one gets the impression that Berlinger doesn't find her especially interesting on her own \u2013 everything we learn about her is predicated on her relationship with Bundy; there's nothing about her life prior to meeting him, and what we learn about her life after he was convicted is primarily fictional. This is true to an even greater degree for Carole Ann Boone, who is introduced out of nowhere as an \"old friend\" of Bundy's, soon becoming his lover and supporter, and conceiving a child whilst he was on death row. Again, we learn nothing beyond her relevance to his story. Additionally, the focus shift halfway through as the film transitions from Liz as subjective focaliser to a more objectively focalised courtroom drama makes very little tonal sense. It's almost as if Berlinger loses interest in Liz when the sensationalist trial begins and Bundy really comes into his own. This transition reduces Liz to a cycle of watching the trial, crying, doubting his guilt, drinking, watching the trial, crying etc, as she's effectively stripped of what little agency she had in the first half.\r\n\r\nAnother problem created by telling the story from Liz's perspective is that we learn nothing new about Bundy himself; there's nothing about his childhood, for example, or how he got away with the murders for so long, whether he really loved Liz, or if he genuinely lacked the ability to feel empathy, as Dorothy Otnow Lewis, Professor of Psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine, would claim in 1988 (something not covered in the film). Along the same lines, we learn nothing whatsoever about any of the victims. This was also a problem in the docu-series, but it's far more pronounced here, and because of this, the decision to put the names of Bundy's known victims on screen at the end of film is unearned, crass, and meaningless, coming as it does at the end of a film in which an A-list movie star has just portrayed their killer, whilst most of them are never even mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe film also makes some strange changes to documented fact, many of which seem designed to make Bundy more sympathetic. For example, there's no mention of the fact that he tried multiple times to pressure Liz into rough sex, particularly choking. The film also has Liz state that Bundy never raised his voice to her or laid a hand on her, ignoring an incident when he pushed her into a lake during an argument. Another scene sees Bundy forcibly restrained in his cell whilst a dentist takes impressions of his teeth. In reality, the impressions were taken in a dentist chair, and Bundy quite happily allowed the dentist to work, sitting down in the chair without any complaint. The film also shows him continuing to try to contact Liz throughout his incarceration, long after his marriage to Boone. In reality, however, he lost contact with Liz entirely in the early 80s, and there's no evidence he tried to find her, nor did she need to hear him confess in order to \"move on\". Ironically enough, if the film had stayed focused on Liz, these changes would have made more sense, as the entire film could be argued to be subjective. But because of the focal shift, one cannot make this argument, and such changes become more troubling.\r\n\r\n_Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile_ is by no means a bad film. But it could have been so much better. The shift from subjective focalisation to court-room drama makes very little sense, and fundamentally undermines what Berlinger seems to have been trying to do. Much like the media which he is so keen to criticise (both here and in _The Ted Bundy Tapes_), and despite numerous statements to the contrary, he seems as enamoured of Bundy the showman as everyone else was and so many still are. Adopting a fascinating approach, the film initially looks at how evil can hide in plain view, creeping into our lives under the guise of normalcy, hiding monstrousness behind affection. Unfortunately, Berlinger allows this theme to recede into the background as he gives the narrative over to Bundy. And yet, he never manages to say anything new, raising the question of why anything needed to be said at all. If this was supposed to be Liz's story, Berlinger takes his eye off the ball badly, allowing the grandstanding, manipulative Bundy to hog the spotlight. And although the film doesn't sympathise with him, and although the decision not to show any of the murders is commendable, the fact is that like he was with the media of the time, like he has been with so many writers and in so many documentaries and scripted films over the last few decades, once again, Ted Bundy is very much the star of his own show.","id":"5d86e0c2336e0100211600e1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d86e0c2336e0100211600e1","movie_id":457799}

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"In The Tall Grass is overgrown with flimsy dialogue and a premise that needed landscaping. Stephen King seems to have an endless amount of material to adapt. So much so, that his son is mimicking the footsteps of his father by also writing horror-related fiction. When the two generations joined together to write a novella on a mysterious field, it should\u2019ve harked back to King\u2019s legacy as the legendary writer he once was. Sadly though, despite the faithfulness to the source material, it\u2019s yet another King story unable to translate comprehensibly into a full-length feature. Two siblings, with one six months pregnant, stop outside an old church and venture into an endless field of tall grass when they hear a child yearning for help. This field however is enshrouded with a mysterious force that prevents anyone who enters from leaving, and so the two must survive the oddities of the tall grass before \u201csomething\u201d or \u201csomeone\u201d endangers them.\r\n\r\nMassive \u2018Triangle\u2019 vibes from this story, except its conceptual complexities are less innovative and more mundane. Past, present and future selves are lurking within the swaying echoes of the tall grass, conveniently outlining the rules and boundaries of the field\u2019s power. \u201cThe grass won\u2019t move dead things\u201d states an embattled young boy, whom had been lost for days. \u201cThe rock is the way out!\u201d. Paradoxical in nature, this story had the capacity to be both atmospheric and tense, given the frustratingly claustrophobic environment. Alas, was not meant to be. Despite Wrobleski\u2019s stunning cinematography that encapsulated the natural order of the field through stylised motion, particularly when visualising the field to be a living entity of its own, Natali\u2019s one-dimensional screenplay forced certain characters actions and personalities to be questionably dull.\r\n\r\nThe extent of characterisation can only be surmised by the pitch at which they shout for each other. For example, Cal continually shouting \u201cBecky? Becky? Becky with the good hair!?\u201d is the maximum capacity at which we feel for his character. Becky then shouts for \u201cCal!\u201d. Travis waltzes on in and shouts for \u201cBecky?\u201d and \u201cTobin!\u201d. Ross is just shouting at himself about real estate. His wife is the most expendable individual with nearly zero lines (shouting included!). And the dog had more screen presence than the majority of characters. The dialogue felt inorganic, starkly contrasting the entire premise. Yes, the performances were all functional with what the actors were given, although Wilson as always goes above and beyond. But it\u2019s not enough to carry a supernatural mystery that seeks to explain everything almost immediately. Unable to classify it as a horror, considering there was no legitimate threat\/tension, although some eye-wincing gore was well-utilised.\r\n\r\nThe third act commences and the plot\u2019s lunacy ramped up from confusion to diabolically non-sensical. Without spoiling it, stuff happens near a rock that resembled an incarnate of King\u2019s worst tendencies in fictional writing. Unnecessary \u201ccreatures\u201d are added into the mix, ironically adding nothing to the story. Then, as all films featuring time loops end, the characters miraculously close the loop before it even happened. So, what\u2019s the point? Did they honestly learn anything from this ordeal to which they hadn\u2019t actually experienced? Urgh.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s abundantly clear that Natali was unable to stretch King\u2019s novella into a feature-length film, despite being a faithful adaptation. The technical excellence was dimmed by flimsy writing and limited characterisation that forced this supernatural mystery to be anything but mysterious. This is why we should all purchase a portable lawnmower, you never know when you\u2019ll be stuck eternally in a field with a giant ancient rock in the middle...","id":"5e206729e004a60015990a4c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e206729e004a60015990a4c","movie_id":523139}

I honestly could not remember their names, that\u2019s how much of an impression they left on me, with the possible exception of the boy because when we first see him he comes off really creepy. I mean, really, it\u2019s not so much that you want any characters to die because they\u2019re irritating. They\u2019re just so cookie-cutter and stereotypical that they leave little to no lasting impression.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for this is that the audience can be a little too distracted by the grass itself. It does have a certain character to it, even if it\u2019s nearly impossible to figure out. But I found myself distracted trying to figure out the grass, how it works, its motivations, at the expense of the human characters.\r\n\r\nAnd here is where we run into another problem. Because most of the set looks the same, that being in the middle of a tall grass field, the filmmakers need to rely on a series of technical and visual gimmicks to keep the audience interested and focused. But they\u2019re inconsistent and stand out when they use them (for example, one consistent shot that is a 360 degree rotation). They don\u2019t feel natural. You see the gimmick instead of what the gimmick is trying to show you, although that\u2019s arguable as they\u2019re clearly proud of some of these visual effects. In addition, this being a horror movie, there are going to be jump scares, but jump scares are just about all there is for this horror movie.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is pretty meh and isn\u2019t really consistent with other parts of the movie from what we learn plotwise. All around, if you\u2019re really a Stephen King or Joe Hill fan and have nothing else to watch, go ahead, but for most people I would say not to bother.","id":"5d9c10e26b5fc20029d7d6c5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d9c10e26b5fc20029d7d6c5","movie_id":523139}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\n2018 was a disappointing year for me. A lot of letdowns regarding my most anticipated movies, and not enough surprises throughout the year. 2019, on the other hand, has been quite interesting. Most blockbusters have resonated with me, and they\u2019ve been my favorite films to watch so far (Avengers: Endgame, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, Us, Glass). Additionally, original low-budget flicks have also caught my eye, and I\u2019ve been enjoying them as well, even if they\u2019re no masterpieces (Greta, Long Shot). Although, I had some bad experiences as well (Dark Phoenix, Hellboy, Godzilla: King of the Monsters). \r\n\r\nCrawl, which I honestly expected just to be a cliche-filled silly horror movie, joins this last group, and it\u2019s on par with Long Shot as the best surprise of 2019, until now. First of all, this is not a typical horror film, at least having in mind the last few examples of the genre. People might go in expecting something along the lines of Annabelle Comes Home, but with alligators, so I might as well moderate those thoughts. I wouldn\u2019t even place it in that genre, even though disaster-horror isn\u2019t exactly a bad description. It\u2019s definitely a suspense movie, almost like a survival-thriller. Haley and Dave have to fight for their lives in a race against both a hurricane and fatal predators, so I wouldn\u2019t generally put this in the horror genre. Moving on \u2026\r\n\r\nI love this type of films, you know that. Suspenseful, claustrophobic sequences, straightforward plot, and set in (mostly) just one location. You might think that since it\u2019s only one place to shoot and it\u2019s such a simple concept, it\u2019s easier overall, but it couldn\u2019t be more distant from the truth. With high-budget, multiple-location movies, directors and screenwriters can hide their technical flaws with tremendous VFX or huge set pieces. In one location, especially such a small one like a modest house, there\u2019s no hiding. If you want to deliver an entertaining and captivating story, you have to write an enthralling screenplay. If you want to provide scary and efficient jump scare scenes, you need to show some creativity and prove you\u2019re a talented filmmaker.\r\n\r\nAlexandre Aja, who doesn\u2019t exactly has a remarkable filmography, showcases that even with such a simplistic and short idea, it\u2019s possible to be as or more fun than a massive blockbuster. Less than 20 minutes into the film, and we\u2019re on. There\u2019s enough backstory and characterization of the main protagonist for the audience to not only care about Haley but understand what skills she has that will help her survive what comes next. I love small details like zooming in on her locking a door, closing a window, moving a piece of furniture \u2026 Every shot has meaning because it will affect the plot later on. Aja is not shooting something \u201cjust because\u201d, and that\u2019s a skill that a lot of directors struggle to have nowadays since they feel that the runtime needs to be close to the two-hour mark.\r\n\r\nAfter so many dumb, cliche, and horribly performed jump scare sequences in previous horror flicks from this year, I finally got to watch a movie where the director knows how to truly scare people, and make them jump out of their chairs. There are no loud soundtrack noises to make you screech. There are no demons or monsters in front of the screen, screaming like crazy. I was at the edge of my seat for more than a couple of times, and I genuinely got scared on some particular moments, where the surprise factor (Aja doesn\u2019t follow the cheap timings of most horror scenes) and the creativity behind the camera were top notch.\r\n\r\nObviously, the VFX and overall production design aren\u2019t mind-blowing. The alligators look pretty real, and that was the main goal, so mission accomplished. Also, being Rated-R helps the film to deliver great alligator attacks with tons of blood, and the injuries our characters have to deal with are pretty gnarly and disgusting (that\u2019s a compliment). Filming in water is extremely hard, especially in such a confined space. However, Aja and his crew were able to produce a movie where you can understand everything that\u2019s going on for the entire runtime. \r\n\r\nKaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper deliver great performances and show amazing chemistry. Their characters have enough development, even if they don\u2019t have that imaginative scripts. Crawl is one of those films where I can\u2019t point out a preeminent issue with it because it\u2019s good at every aspect. I mean, sure, there are a couple of rare moments of extreme survival, where we might think \u201che\/she should be dead\u201d, but it\u2019s such a fun and entertaining time at the theater that we can let go of one or two over-the-top scenes. It\u2019s not like The Meg, where every single moment is unrealistic as hell. The success of the fictional part of a fiction movie depends on its realistic foundation and limits. If these aren\u2019t well-established, then the film will be all over the place, and its viewers won\u2019t know what to believe or not.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Crawl is one of 2019\u2019s best surprises, and I definitely recommend to see it in theaters. With compelling leads and a simple concept, Alexandre Aja delivers an entertaining, suspenseful, claustrophobic, and technically creative movie. Finally, someone who knows how to handle a camera, and provide genuinely scary jump scare sequences. Hopefully, this can catapult Kaya Scodelario to grab a bigger role on a more impactful film. I can\u2019t point out any \u201cflaws\u201d, it\u2019s simply a \u201cgood movie\u201d. With such a low-budget, give a chance to this one, and watch it instead of a massive blockbuster that will probably leave you disappointed with the numerous cliches and the extreme focus on silly action or huge set pieces as a replacement for a good story. Good job, Paramount!\r\n\r\nRating: B+","id":"5d2754ccbe4b3612f59db23a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d2754ccbe4b3612f59db23a","movie_id":511987}

{"author":"TheArtyDans","content":"Crawl is a medium budget creature horror film that\u2019s more Bait than Jaws \u2013 but with the added back drop of a massive hurricane. As if our characters weren\u2019t already in enough danger.\r\n\r\nIs Crawl a \u201cso bad its good\u201d movie, or a \u201cso bad you should avoid it\u201d movie? Read on to find out.\r\n\r\nSet in Florida during a category 5 hurricane, Crawl tells the story of Haley and her father Dave, played by Barry Pepper. After receiving a frantic phone call from her sister, Haley goes on the hunt to find her father who is trapped in their old house as the hurricane approaches. \r\n\r\nUnbeknownst to Haley, the overflow drain has been breached by Alligators, and their about to make Haley\u2019s rescue mission a whole lot more difficult.\r\n\r\nAnd if the gators don\u2019t get Haley and her dad, the rising hurricane waters will.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know much about Alligators or Hurricanes, but I do like to think I know something about logic. And that is something that is sorely lacking in most characters in this film. Even the dog.\r\n\r\nA series of unfortunate events conspire to make the rescue almost a futile effort. And the missing logic from our characters only add to the frustration to us, as the viewer. \r\n\r\nWhere should I start? First and foremost, I want to understand why neither Haley or Dave ever tried to smash out the weak looking brick work patterns on the basement wall and then crawl out of the new hole to safety? It doesn\u2019t look like the bricks would need much in the way of a good whack to break open \u2013 and considering there were tools in the basement, including the shovel that Dave uses later on to half-decapitate a gator, this bit makes no sense to me. Now I realise two things \u2013 1 is that the open brick patterns serves a purpose to flood the basement \u2013 but in reality it\u2019s the first thing anyone would think to smash open. And 2 \u2013 if they did do that, then I realise we\u2019d have a short film. But then the writers could have had more fun for the next hour putting Haley and Dave in more incredible and hard to survive scenarios. So there\u2019s a missed opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe gators that are stuck into basement with Haley and Dave also don\u2019t seem to be those of the killing variety \u2013 its either that or the skin of our two characters is so tough that these gators just can\u2019t bite through them. I\u2019m not gator expert, but I am pretty sure if one gets his whole mouth on your arm \u2013 he is probably going to bite your whole arm off, and not just leave a minor bite mark. Funny thing is we know these two gators are indeed killers, as one of them does eat the police man who comes to rescue them. \r\n\r\nAlso following up on the theme of me not being an expert on gators \u2013 one thing has me puzzled. Do gators kill for sport, or because they\u2019re hungry? I can\u2019t work that out based on this movie. \r\n\r\nAnd in something that really shocked me for an American movie \u2013 it took over an hour until we saw the first gun. That has to be some kind of record for an American horror thriller movie?\r\n\r\nBut its not all bad \u2013 because there are quite a few laugh out loud moments in this movie to lighten up the mood.\r\n\r\nI really liked the way Haley traps one of the gators in the shower. That\u2019s both clever and utterly ridiculous \u2013 that a flimsy piece of shower glass could be strong enough to hold back a gator that wants to kill.\r\n\r\nI also liked the nod to the Purge movies when the siren started just as the eye of the storm was passing through. It almost felt like a both a warning to all humans, and a sign to all gators that they could begin their hunt.\r\n\r\nIf you go into this movie realising that its not meant to be taken seriously, then its an enjoyable ride that will only briefly have you jumping in your seat over the scares and light gore. For a movie about gators hunting humans, it is surprisingly light on the gore \u2013 but then that\u2019s what happens when Hollywood makes horror movies for teen audiences.\r\n\r\nAnd there in lies the problem with this movie and someone like me watching it. It not aimed or marketed at me, and maybe not even at you. It\u2019s a forgettable popcorn flick in the same vein as Bait, but not as fun \u2013 at least that had gore to go with its killer sharks.","id":"5da3bb2ee860170017b0f0d2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5da3bb2ee860170017b0f0d2","movie_id":511987}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Let\u2019s make one thing perfectly clear. This is a movie you watch for the action and not much less. But then, that not really a surprise is it?\r\n\r\nThe movie takes off literally minutes after the last one ended. John Wick is on the run and that\u2019s the story for most of the movie. Well, not entirely. He does have a plan but first he has to escape the many assassins trying to cash in the 14 million dollar bounty on his head.\r\n\r\nThis movie is all about action. The movie is R-rated although I honestly do not understand why. Sure there\u2019s lot of action and a lot of killing but still, I wouldn\u2019t say it merits an R-rating and apparently the French ratings organisation didn\u2019t either since here in France it France it got a 12+ rating. That is, it is only restricted for those younger than 12 years.\r\n\r\nAnyway, as I wrote above, this movie is all about Keanu Reeves and action. Lots and lots of action which usually ends up in one or more persons getting killed by John or some of his remaining friends.\r\n\r\nIs the story and the action realistic? Hell no! But it is fun to watch even though most of the bad guys shoots as accurately as imperial storm troopers. Most of the time at least.\r\n\r\nTowards the end I did think it got a bit silly. The fight against Zero and his last two students was pretty rubbish. It was kind of kick, hack and slash for a few minutes and then stand of and wait until the other guy got up again. Then rinse and repeat. Silly indeed.\r\n\r\nAlso, they could really tone down on the ludicrous survivability of John Wick. I mean, come on! He gets hit by cars and walks away. Not to mention the final scene were he falls something like six seven floors, bounces (and I mean bounces!) off a fire escape and a trash container and apparently survives.\r\n\r\nI probably should rate the movie a star less for that kind of stuff but I wont. This is something as refreshing as a Hollywood movie apparently meant to entertain and nothing else. There\u2019s really no political or social preaching or any other such nonsense which is really rare today. That alone gives it a few extra stars in my book.\r\n\r\nThe movie has a 7.7 rating on IMDb at the time of writing this which is well deserved, even a bit low. Even the rubbish SJW site Rotten Tomatoes claims the movie is \u201cfresh\u201d which is surprising given what I wrote above.\r\n\r\nOf course there is a whole bunch of \u201creviews\u201d that claims it is so bad and so on and so forth. Some of these reviews are actually repeated several times. That really pisses me off since these people seem to write reviews just to complain. It\u2019s the third movie in the Franchise for Christ sake! You knew what you were getting yourself into. Don\u2019t watch the movie if you do not like these kind of movies. Claiming there is no story is bullshit since the first one didn\u2019t really have much more story but then the concept was bit more new of course. Some \u201creviewer\u201d claimed it was the worst movie he had ever seen. He cannot have seen many movies then. What a load och bollocks!\r\n\r\nBottom line, this was two hours of great entertainment.","id":"5d871477336e010029163b2d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d871477336e010029163b2d","movie_id":458156}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is going to be one of those posts where I go against the mainstream but my reaction when I watched this movie was: You got to be f\u2026 kidding me?\r\n\r\nThe only resemblance to the REAL joker in this movie is the name. As far as I am concerned this movie is an insult to the fans of Batman and the REAL Joker.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cJoker\u201d in this move is a unintelligent deranged nutcase. There is a sob story in the background about how he became that way which is totally uninteresting.\r\n\r\nThe REAL joker is a intelligent criminal mastermind. I was waiting for this nutcase to actually become that for the entire movie. Spoiler alert, it never happened! This guy starts as a useless sobbing nutcase and he ends the movie as the same useless sobbing nutcase.\r\n\r\nThe movie has NOTHING to do with the real Joker. It is a blatant attempt to garner support for a unrelated psychopathic thriller by using the Joker name. If it would have been advertised as such I probably would have, if not liked it, so at least appreciated it for it\u2019s qualities. It is indeed a well done movie technically and the main character is indeed excellently performed.\r\n\r\nHowever, even if I try to distance myself from the deceitful Joker label, I find it overall boring, too long and really a movie about a psychopath probably made by someone with mental issues himself. But then that\u2019s Hollywood today.\r\n\r\nThat the politically biased and elitist so called \u201ccritics\u201d on sites like Rotten Tomatoes like it is not really surprising but I have to confess that I am somewhat surprised at the rave ratings by real viewers on some other sites.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I was expecting to be disappointing by this movie.

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_The franchise keeps getting better_**\r\n\r\n>_Igitur qui desiderat pacem, praeparet bellum._\r\n\r\n- Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus; _De re militari_ (4th or 5th century AD)\r\n\r\n>_It wasn't just a puppy._\r\n\r\n- John Wick (21st century AD)\r\n\r\nDirected by stuntmen turned directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch, and written by Derek Kolstad, the original _John Wick_ (2014) was something of a sleeper hit, earning almost $90 million against a $20 million budget. The 2017 sequel, however, was a bona fide blockbuster, earning $171 million against a $40 million budget. And now we have _John Wick: Chapt__er 3 - Parabellum_, which has maintained the franchise's monetary trajectory, earning $230 million against a $75 million budget. Indeed, _Parabellum_ earned more in its opening weekend in North America ($57 million) than the original did in its entire North American theatrical run ($43 million). The three films were also critical successes, and have come to form the basis for the \"Wickiverse\"; an expanded universe that includes the forthcoming _Chapter 4_, a spin-off prequel film (_Ballerina_), a TV show (_The Continental_), and two video games (_John Wick Chronicles_ and _John Wick Hex_).\r\n\r\nNot bad for a franchise that began life as a story about a guy getting revenge on the thugs who killed his puppy.\r\n\r\nExcept, of course, it wasn't just a puppy.\r\n\r\nWith Stahelski back in the director's chair for the third time, and with a script by Kolstad, Shay Hatten, Chris Collins, and Marc Abrams, as with the previous films, _Parabellum_ is built on the foundation of Sir Keanu of Reeves's zen-like stoicism, a quality he can deploy to make a violent swordfight look about as stressful as sleeping on silk linen with \"Fur Elise\" playing in the background and a cat gently purring on the pillow beside you. And although this third entry in the franchise does flirt with a few themes amidst the mayhem (honour, fealty, destiny), it's not trying to be something it isn't, well aware of its own identity as a completely over-the-top orgy of violence. This is a world wherein even the most innocuous of items can be rendered lethal, and where the endless deaths by gun, knife, fist, dog, horse, motorbike, sword, pencil, and book of 18th century Russian folklore, are so excessive as to transcend any possible accusations of irresponsibility or glorification of violence. In short, the film leans into its status as basically a live-action episode of _Itchy and Scratchy_. Sure, it can become a little repetitive at times, and there's next to no plot or character development, so if you want to be reductionist, you could argue that it essentially gives us more of the same, except bigger, louder, and more elaborate. But that's to ignore how aesthetically accomplished it is, how funny it is, how compelling it is, and how unapologetically entertaining it is.\r\n\r\nBeginning only moments after _Chapter 2_ and about a week after _Chapter 1_ (it's easy to overlook the fact that the three _John Wick_ films span two or three weeks at most), _Parabellum_ opens with legendary assassin John Wick (Reeves) attempting to flee New York. Although known as the only assassin ever to have successfully retired from the Assassins' Guild, Wick was pulled back in when the puppy his dead wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan) left him was killed by Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen), son of powerful Bratva mobster Viggo Tarasov (the late great Michael Nyqvist). Having killed both Tarasovs, Wick's mission of vengeance ultimately led him to kill Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio), the Camorra crimelord who helped Wick retire several years prior. D'Antonio was a newly elected member of the High Table (the ruling body of the Guild, the members of which are considered off limits), and to make matters worse, Wick killed him on the grounds of the Continental Hotel (an assassins' hub in which violence is strictly prohibited). Declared \"excommunicado\" by the Table, and with a $14 million bounty on his head, Wick's friend and Continental manager Winston (Ian McShane) gives him one hour's grace before the contract goes live.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the High Table dispatch an Adjudicator (an eerily calm Asia Kate Dillon) to look into the unsanctioned help given to Wick by Winston, Continental concierge Charon (Lance Reddick), and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), the leader of a group of vagrant assassins. Chiding them for helping Wick, the Adjudicator gives them seven days to either resign their positions or face the consequences. To lead the pursuit of Wick, she hires Zero (a scene-stealing Mark Dacascos), a highly-skilled assassin (and part-time sushi chef), who hates guns and is a huge fanboy of Wick. With every assassin on the planet hunting him, Wick's travels bring him into contact with a litany of underworld characters - there's The Director (Angelica Huston), a former assassin who trained Wick and who currently runs a ballet academy; Sofia (Halle Berry), the manager of the Casablanca Continental, and an old friend who owes Wick a marker after he successfully hid her daughter away from the Guild; Berrada (Jerome Flynn), the assassins' Master of Coin and a member of the High Table; The Elder (Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui), the only person above the Table, and who Wick hopes may be able to clear the bounty; the Tick Tock Man (Jason Mantzoukas), an associate of the Bowery King; two of Zero's pupils (Cecep Arif Rahman and Yayan Ruhian), who insist on fighting with honour at all times; and Ernest (Boban Marjanovi\u0107), a towering assassin and Dante Alighieri aficionado.\r\n\r\nOkay, first things first, _Parabellum_ looks absolutely gorgeous. I mean really, really gorgeous. _Chapter 1_ and _Chapter 2_ both looked great, but _Parabellum_ is in another class altogether and is genuinely one of the best looking films I've seen all year. Part of the reason the film looks so good is the symbiosis between the various component parts of the aesthetic - the lush cinematography by Dan Laustsen (_Le pacte des loups_; _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_; _The Shape of Water_); the busy production design and complementary art direction by Kevin Kavanaugh (_The Dark Knight Rises_; _Nightcrawler_; _Only the Brave_) and Chris Shriver (_The Lovely Bones_; _The Wolf of Wall Street_; _Ocean's Eight_), respectively; the relatively slow editing by Evan Schiff (_Everly_; _Revolt_; _Proud Mary_); and the complex sound design by Martyn Zub (_Ghost in the Shell_; _Deadpool 2_; _Velvet Buzzsaw_). Everything looks and sounds amazing, working in immersive harmony to ensure the action grabs the viewer's attention and doesn't let go. The first half of the film, which takes place at night in New York, and is essentially one long almost real-time scene, is rain-soaked and bathed in glorious neon (mainly blues, greens, and reds), which reflect off the wetness on the road and bounce back towards their source, creating a dazzling display of light. When Wick nips inside a store, the vibrant colours are pulled out completely, with the brown of the store's walls and cabinets coming to dominate, so when he heads back outside, the richness of the palette really pops. The Moroccan section of the film is predominately gold, brown, and yellow, creating a sense of serenity that contrasts nicely with the hyperactive tone of the New York scenes which surround it.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the action, the film's opening scene sets the bar insanely high \u2013 a deadly fight in a library. The visceral brutality of this scene is emphasised both visually and aurally; when someone gets slammed against a wall or has a hardback book driven into their skull, you really feel the thump on the soundtrack, whilst the close-quarters nature of the combat makes for interesting shot compositions and editing rhythms (as does the fact that Wick is fighting someone over a foot taller than himself). The nature of the fight also leads to some inventive uses of the _mise en sc\u00e8ne_, as the combatants are forced to improvise.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, I was reminded very much of Gareth Evans's _The Raid_ and _The Raid 2_, (the presence of Rahman and Ruhian, who played villains in the first _Raid_ film, cannot be a coincidence). These two films effectively redefined action cinema by shunning the frenetic editing that had become the norm over the previous decade, instead employing longer takes that showcased the performers' physicality. You know that seizure-inducing scene in Pierre Morel's _Taken_ (2008) when Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) jumps a fence, and there are literally 15 cuts in five seconds? There's none of that in _Parabellum_, with the editing altogether calmer, allowing the audience to focus on the organic progression of the ballet-like hand-to-hand combat, creating what can only be described as a symphony of excessive violence. With Jonathan Eusebio's magnificent choreography paying homage to everyone from Harold Lloyd to Buster Keaton to Andrei Tarkovsky (seriously), _Parabellum_ doesn't just give us rote action scenes, it gives us immersive works of performance art.\r\n\r\nHowever, to say that the editing is rhythmic and slower than most action movies is not to say that the film is laid back. It isn't, and it includes any number of scenes that really shouldn't work, so batshit insane are they. There's the initial library fight where books become as deadly as knives; a scrap that takes place in an antique knife shop, where Wick and his opponents only realise that they're surrounded by literally hundreds of knives when they run out of ammo; a horse versus motorbike gauntlet (with swords) on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge that has more than a passing resemblance to a similar scene in Jung Byung-gil's magisterial _Aknyeo_ (2017); an aborted confrontation in Grand Central Terminal (damn girl scouts); a huge to-do in a Moroccan bizarre involving two people and two dogs against a legion of hired thugs; an old-fashioned shootout in the Continental as Wick and Charon face down the Adjudicator's team; and a climactic gunfight cum sword fight in a room made entirely of glass. Subtle it isn't. Entertaining it most certainly is. And the fact that the film can pull off such ludicrous scenes without becoming a parody of itself is as good a testament to the craft on display as anything could be.\r\n\r\nBoth previous _Wick_ films have been said to resemble video games in their visual design, although Stahelski has stated that this wasn't a conscious decision, as he has never played a video game. Conscious or not, _Parabellum_ is even more indebted to video games than the previous films, not just in its aesthetic, but in some of its narrative beats. For example, each fight is harder than the last (i.e., the difficulty level is increasing), with a few boss fights thrown in for good measure. A scene in a stable where Wick uses a horse to take out two thugs is essentially an environmental assassination straight out of the _Hitman_ franchise (and Wick dresses a lot like Agent 47 too). There's a single driving level (there's always a single driving level), and a non-combat level where Wick must reach his destination before dehydrating. To make it to the final battle, Wick must face down a platoon of heavily armoured soldiers, each of whom requires multiple hits before going down, whilst Wick himself has to pause at one point for a weapon upgrade. Then we have a mini-boss fight, followed by the real boss fight against Zero. The narrative is literally structured like a video game, and has a similarly insane kill ratio to the previous films (he killed around 80 in _Chapter 1_, about 130 in _Chapter 2_, and 94 in _Parabellum_). And this is not a criticism. On the contrary, part of the film's charm is its resemblance to a violent, hyper-stylized, morally questionable video game in which one must kill waves of faceless opponents \u00e0 la _Doom_ (1993), _Manhunt_ (2003), or _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_ (2004).\r\n\r\nIn terms of the acting, a good way to approach it is to ask, who looks at a library book and thinks, \"_I could kill someone with this_\"? The answer, of course, is John Wick. And the fact that we go along with such insanity is a testament to both the film itself and Reeves's performance, which grounds even the most ridiculous of scenes, taking everything in his stride as if it's the most normal thing in the world. His serene monotone delivery is also responsible for easily the funniest moment of the franchise thus far. When a thug shoots one of Sofia's dogs (don't worry, it's a non-fatal hit), she goes ballistic, laying waste to everyone around her, despite knowing that there could be serious consequences. Looking at Wick, she points out, by way of explanation\/apology, \"_he shot my dog_.\" To which Wick replies, in that half-asleep and still stoned from the night before surfer-dude voice of Keanu Reeves, \"_I get it_\". That line prompted a few people to applaud at the screening I attended. Of course he gets it. And so do we.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons the original film stood out so much was the subtle brilliance of Kolstad's world-building. It wasn't just a movie about a former assassin being pulled back into the trade. Instead, Kolstad created a fascinating underworld featuring an international Assassin's Guild, a hotel for assassins in which violence is prohibited, and even an assassins' currency. In _Chapter 2_, he expanded this further, introducing the person who helped Wick retire, the High Table as the governing body of the Guild, blood markers, and the Bowery King, who seems to operate slightly outside the purview of the Table. _Parabellum_ continues the expansion, introducing the person who trained Wick, the ballet school, the master of coin, the Elder, the adjudication process, excommunication, and deconsecration (when a hub such as the Continental is declared no longer a safe space and no longer protected by the Table). The mythology has deepened with each film, and the fact that it has so many religious overtones drives home the sense of old-world ideologies being applied to people who must be ultra-modern in how they conduct themselves.\r\n\r\nAre there some problems? Well, any film this violent is going to have immediate detractors, who will oftentimes speak out against the film without actually seeing it, and of course, there will be cries of \"_Hollywood preaches against the 2nd Amendment but then makes movies celebrating the destructive power of guns_.\" Fair point. But the thing is, the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, nor does it expect the audience to, so the question of its irresponsibility when it comes to violence is kind of a moot point. Of course it's irresponsibly violent. It's supposed to be irresponsibly violent. Does it treat guns and knives fetishistically? Yes, to a certain extent it does. But is it celebrating guns and violence in a realistic socio-political manner? No, not in the slightest.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, there is a sense in which the violence in the film does come across as meaningless, insofar as it doesn't seem to have any practical ramifications for any of the main characters. John Wick has literally killed over 300 people in the course of a few weeks, but there's not a hint of any kind of psychological consequence. Related to the disassociation that presenting violence like this can have, there's the problem that simply by virtue of logistics, almost all of Wick's opponents are nameless and faceless extras, anonymous hordes there to be killed. Indeed, at one point, Wick is literally pursued by two busloads of such villains (a bit of meta-commentary on the genre, which I personally thought was hilarious). The one criticism that I would definitely echo is that the structure of the narrative is a little awkward, and on several occasions, actions and decisions reached over the course of multiple scenes are simply undone just a couple of scenes later. However, this is a _John Wick_ film, not a Marcel Proust novel. The narrative structure is not really where your attention is supposed to be.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, I don't do blockbusters. I just don't like them, and can rarely get anything from them. I consider the medium of film to be an art form before it is entertainment, and I approach every film from that perspective. But attempting to parse a summer blockbuster in this manner doesn't tend to yield much in the way of interesting analysis. Nevertheless, every year, there are one or two blockbusters that I will go to see. The first such example this year is _John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum_. And I absolutely loved it. Easily the best in the franchise thus far, it's more ambitious, more ridiculous, more violent, and more entertaining than its predecessors. It's also funnier, and the Wickiverse continues to provide a fascinating _milieu_. Sure, themes such as fealty, honour, fate, and religion come and go without much engagement. But, as I've said, that's not what the film is about. It simply doesn't follow the rubric to which others must try to adhere - character development and motivation, a well-structured plot, insightful dialogue, and thematic undercurrents. Instead, Stahelski has crafted an action film that features extraordinary aesthetic elements and a wonderfully vibrant visual design. _Parabellum_ doesn't just unapologetically revel in its excessive violence. It makes art out of its excessive violence.","id":"5d782767069f0e113431acf2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d782767069f0e113431acf2","movie_id":458156}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nObviously, Joker is one of my most anticipated movies of 2019. I mean, how couldn't it be?! Besides belonging to the superhero genre, DC has been on a streak of great films within its universe, so an isolated installment definitely excites me, especially about one of the evilest villains ever. It's by far one of the less comic-book-y flicks of the century. It doesn't follow the generic origin story formula, it avoids any cliches associated with the genre, and it's the type of movie that's becoming more and more rare nowadays. It's a character study like we haven't seen in a long time.\r\n\r\nI'll simply begin with the person that elevates the entire thing: Joaquin Phoenix. Now, if there's something I'm not going to do is compare his performance with Heath Ledger's. That's the number one mistake people are going to keep making forever. First of all, The Dark Knight and Joker couldn't be more distinct films, even if they belong to the same genre (despite Joker being unique, it's still about a famous comic-book villain). Then, despite Phoenix and Ledger portraying the same \"version\" of the clown (crazy, sadistic psychopath), the former is 90% Arthur Fleck while the latter is 100% Joker, throughout each of their movies. Finally, Phoenix is the sole protagonist of this feature, while Ledger had the best live-action Batman sharing the spotlight.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it's both unfair, and a bit unreasonable to compare both interpretations since their roles have a different impact on the narrative, as well as each film being entirely different. In the end, both are impressive. However, let's switch to Phoenix since he's the star of this show \u2026 He has 2019's best performance, by far! With a strong marketing campaign, I'm sure he'll get that Oscar. I hope so! It's so well-deserved. Todd Phillips and Scott Silver developed a brilliant screenplay, but Phoenix elevates it to a whole other level.\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire runtime, I felt weird. Perturbed. Even uncomfortable with what I was watching and consequently feeling. It's a dark, brutal, violent, emotionally powerful origin of a villain who I feel disturbingly empathetic towards. Phoenix makes the story work due to its remarkably captivating display of someone who's mentally ill. Arthur Fleck slowly becoming crazier is due to how society behaves and not due to some chemical pool that transforms his skin white and hair green (nothing wrong with this, but I know which origin story I prefer). \"The world is getting crazier out there\", and it becomes excruciatingly painful to deal with it, especially when so much is going on with Arthur\u2019s personal life, and most of it he doesn't even realize because he tries to hide everything behind a smile.\r\n\r\nIt's a screenplay filled with narrative twists that not only pack a punch of surprise but leave you feeling extremely upset. The last act is one of the best in the last few years. If the second act is an enormous build-up, the last one is a terrific payoff. I can't remember the last movie I saw where I loved 100% every single narrative decision. I wouldn't do any of the big moments differently. There are so many excellent references hidden in plain sight that comic-book fans (and fans of the TDK trilogy as well) will love just like I did. In the ending, there's one pivotal moment in particular that serves as the absolute climax \u2026 I got chills all over my body. They couldn't have done that scene more perfect. I only have one tiny nitpick with the way some scenes feel repetitive since they neither move the plot forward or give us anything new. Some of these still help to create tension, some feel like they're just\u2026 there.\r\n\r\nA Best Picture and Best Actor nominations seem to be on its way, but these are not the only achievements that deserve to be recognized. The original score by Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir is incredibly addictive, so much that I'm listening to it while writing this review. It definitely helps to generate tremendous build-up, and it elevates the sinister environment of Gotham City. Lawrence Sher's cinematography is utterly stunning. The underexposure of some scenes is glorious. Sher paints the screen with so many gorgeous shots, especially with his close-ups on Phoenix, where the latter is able to shine. Jeff Groth is also impeccable in the editing room. There are several long takes with Phoenix just giving his all and letting all his emotions out (or keeping them all contained), which is always something I deeply appreciate since it helps with the flow of the narrative.\r\n\r\nRegarding the film's controversy surrounding its messages and the incentive to violence, I really don't know what to say. It's ridiculous. I remember those times when going into the movie theater was a surreal experience. It was the number one place for people to forget about their lives, jobs, everything. Joker is a fictional story! It's the origin of one of the worst psychopaths in the history of comic-books and cinema. If people expected to leave the theater \"happy\" or \"joyful\", then at least one of the film's message is right: society really is getting crazier. Have people forgotten who Joker is? What could you possibly expect from his origin story?!\r\n\r\nNowadays, no one knows how to behave (social media is the primary source for spreading hate). No one respects the fellow citizen or even the world itself. More and more people only look at their own bellies. Political agendas are everywhere. New extreme movements are created every other year. Social hypersensibility is exponentially growing. The same way some people will hate this movie for not being able (or simply not wanting) to accept that they feel empathy towards a murderer, people all around the world behave like their actions don't reflect on another person's life and on their own planet. If people get ruthlessly violent because they watched Joker, how can someone complain that the film's message is bad when it's eventually true?\r\n\r\nAll in all, Joker is one of the best movies of the year, and it's definitely on my Top3 at the date of this review. Joaquin Phoenix delivers my favorite male performance of 2019, by elevating a script about the origin of one of the evilest villains ever. The way he gradually becomes more insane is worthy of study, but it's how he's able to make the audience create empathy towards a psychopath that leaves me disturbingly captivated. Todd Phillips produces a character-study filled with an astonishingly tense build-up and one of the most chill-inducing payoffs of the last few years. With every single narrative decision nailed perfectly, Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir's score and Lawrence Sher's cinematography stand out. The lack of restraint in showing the unmerciful violence (physical and mental) that society inflicts on one another is what makes us feel unsettled. Because we know it's mostly true, and we refuse to accept it. It's not a film about the Joker. It's a very realistic portrayal of someone (anyone!) who can become someone like him. And it's disturbingly brilliant!\r\n\r\nPS: Robert DeNiro (Murray Franklin) and Zazie Beetz (Sophie Dumond) are also great. Phoenix's performance is so mesmerizing that I almost forgot there were other actors in the movie.\r\n\r\nRating: A","id":"5d975abdae26be001abe129b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d975abdae26be001abe129b","movie_id":475557}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t have a written review for each of the previous films, but I did watch both and thoroughly enjoyed them! John Wick (2014) is one of the best movies of that year and one of the best action films ever. However, John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) is a bit more convoluted and messy regarding its story and how it brings our protagonist back into the game, but the franchise\u2019s outstandingly choreographed fight sequences still make it tremendously entertaining.\r\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s precisely the mind-blowing, bone-crushing, jaw-dropping, extraordinarily long and brutally choreographed action scenes that make John Wick one of the most badass characters in the history of cinema! The Academy has been looking for something new to make the Oscars more popular, and the creation of new categories has been their number one idea. Well, nothing fits the show better than Best Stunt Work. Obviously, franchises like this one or Mission: Impossible would become major successes at this award show. These two sagas are undeniably the most important and crucial for the survival of truly real action. What you see, it\u2019s what you get.\r\n\r\nNowadays, viewers already have their eyes set to acknowledge everything as CGI or some sort of visual effect. I\u2019ll never forget when I left my Mission: Impossible - Fallout screening and while getting out of the theater, a group of friends was laughing around saying something along the lines of \u201cof course that scene is fake and this moment is CGI, how can you believe that?! You\u2019re such a moron!\u201d They were roasting one of their friends, thinking he was the dumb one when he was probably the one who was laughing the hardest. This definitely leaves me sad. Sad that people won\u2019t realize how incredible movies like these are. How they genuinely work like crazy to provide the audience with real and authentic stunts.\r\n\r\nYes, it\u2019s over-the-top. Yes, CGI and visual effects are still applied, but just to little details like bullets, blood, falls or knife throwing, which never distract you. And yes, it requires the audience to suspend their knowledge of physics in a few particular moments. But that\u2019s the thing: if you\u2019re pumped to watch a third film of a franchise, you\u2019re a fan. You know what it\u2019s about and what\u2019s its tone. John Wick established itself in 2014 as a pure revenge story and an unbelievably realistic action movie, the closest we will ever get to an assassin origin tale. John Wick: Chapter Two deeply explored the institution that governs these assassins and all of the rules that they are bound by. It\u2019s a bit messier than the first one, but it\u2019s still a blast of entertainment.\r\n\r\nParabellum has the best of both installments. It has the best-choreographed action ever seen on a big screen and some of the most impressive camera work I\u2019ve ever witnessed. In addition to this, the narrative makes more sense, and the characters decisions are logically or emotionally justifiable, contrary to the second film. The sound design is powerful, and the cinematography plus the set design look stunning. I would still argue that the pacing could have been better controlled. The transitions between long action sequences and the respective pauses to move the plot forward aren\u2019t always smooth. Some comedy bits that I don\u2019t think they really belong in this saga were added, and while some work just fine, others really don\u2019t fit this world.\r\n\r\nBesides that, I don\u2019t really have much to complain about. The cast is absolutely impeccable. Keanu Reeves is battling with Tom Cruise for the biggest action movie star alive. While Cruise puts his life more in risk by performing especially dangerous stunts, Keanu has the resiliency and agility of a beast, providing us with high-speed and hard-to-do fight sequences. Halle Berry (Sofia) is one hell of a surprise! I had no idea she was (still) capable of moving as she does in this film. The stunts that she performs are crazily good! Laurence Fishburne (Bowery King), Ian McShane (Winston) and Lance Reddick (Charon) also have their own shining moments, but Sofia\u2018s dogs are deadly cute, and they steal the show.\r\n\r\nRegarding the action stunts, they\u2019re all pretty memorable. From a throwback to Chapter Two\u2018s mirror room to an astonishingly riveting chasing scene through the streets of New York, everything Chad Stahelski and his talented crew throw at the audience is absolutely perfect. I also love how the final act resembles the experience of playing a videogame. You know when you have several levels, each of them with their respective boss, but the final boss is at the top of them all? It\u2019s kind of like Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time when Link has to eliminate an enemy in each floor in order to move up to the next one until he reaches Ganondorf. It might be the must nonsensical analogy that I have, but it\u2019s what my memory triggered. In the end, there are tons of set pieces for everyone to enjoy.\r\n\r\nAll in all, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is everything fans of this franchise desired: brutal, bloody, long, loud and beautifully-choreographed fight sequences, accompanied by a decent story that explored even more the assassins\u2019 world. Chad Stahelski is a master filmmaker, who knows how an action movie should be filmed. There are no sloppy editing or quick cuts here.

{"author":"Sheldon Nylander","content":"Okay, this film has already been so widely debated that I\u2019m not sure what I can really add to the conversation. So, I\u2019ll just give my thoughts.\r\n\r\n\u201cJoker\u201d is a fairly basic character study of Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill man who feels increasingly marginalized by an uncaring and brutal society in Gotham City. To start, the characters, except for Arthur himself, are pretty flat. They seem to have little purpose other than to further Arthur\u2019s story. This includes Thomas Wayne, who in other media is portrayed as a man of many dimensions, wealthy but caring, and instilling these values in his son Bruce. Here, he is portrayed as much more uncaring and elitist. Which gives much less of an impact in the inevitable alley scene we see in everything remotely related to Batman. More on this in a minute. It\u2019s important to the point.\r\n\r\nArthur suffers a condition that makes him burst into laughter at inappropriate times. He also has other unspecified mental illnesses. We\u2019re never given the specifics. This is actually a little troubling because of the general depiction of mental illness. It almost seems like they are saying that if someone is mentally ill then they are a ticking time bomb and it\u2019s only a matter of time before they go off. This is not a good look.\r\n\r\nAfter a series of events, Arthur begins spiraling downward, but at the same time realizes how much influence he can have over other people, an aspect of the Joker that isn\u2019t often explored. And this is where the characters other than Arthur being rather flat comes into play.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s more than one indication that we are actually witnessing these events through Arthur\u2019s eyes. And this creates a brilliant depiction of a narcissistic personality. The only character that gets fully fleshed out is Arthur himself, but he can\u2019t or won\u2019t connect with other people to see their depth. As such, we get to see narcissism from the inside, no connection to others and in fact seeing them as pawns in his own schemes. It\u2019s subtle and definitely not in your face, but if you look carefully, the hints are there.\r\n\r\nThose who fear that \"Joker\" would glorify incel violence or otherwise can rest a little easier, but as I mentioned, the film isn't without its troubling portrayals. It does vilify the mentally ill, which creates a whole host of other issues. The movie swings wildly between \"excellent\" and just \"okay,\" and sometimes even \"meh.\" As such, it gets a recommendation, but only a mild one.","id":"5dd9cdd528723c0014588c1f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dd9cdd528723c0014588c1f","movie_id":475557}
{"author":"Matthew Brady","content":"\"Your mother took me in. She's kind. She treats me like a person.\"\r\n\r\nTaika Waititi is on a roll recently and rightfully so, because he's got a great comedic vision.\r\n\r\n'Jojo Rabbit' is a World War II satire that's both hilarious and surprisingly tragic. Joy, terror, love, hate all in one movie. Waititi knows how far to take a joke and how humor can put on light on ugly issues. While absurd looking on the surface, but on a deeper look it's something unique. \r\n\r\nNewcomers Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie take center stage upon the big cast. Their comedic timing, emotional range and overall performances are nothing short than impressive. Also Archie Yates is like the adorable child version of Nick Frost.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of big name stars. Scarlett Johansson is having a fantastic year and she once again delivers a wonderful performance. Sam Rockwell is amazing in pretty much anything he's in and here is no different. Rockwell playing a closeted homosexual Nazi is hysterical, and yet meaningful when you look at it more thoughtfully. \r\n\r\nThe weakest actor upon the cast has to be Rebel Wilson. I really didn't buy her as this character. I thought she's just doing her usual comedic traits like in every other movie, which I'm not a fan of. \r\n\r\nNot only is Taika Waititi directing and writing, but also starring as Jojo's imaginary friend of his very own idol... Adolf Hitler. Apparently Waititi didn't have to research playing Hitler, because he thought Adolf was 'a f**ing c***'. Anywhere, the concept itself is really bizarre and really fascinating. While silly and entertaining, but could've been left out, in my opinion. There was a point where he completely disappears from the movie to later reappear during the finale.\r\n\r\nAt times I feel like it tries hard to be like a Wes Anderson movie, in terms of staging, quirky humor, and overall setting. Influence is one thing, but it came a point when it wasn't being it's own thing.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: Criticisms aside, I had an absolute blast. Endearing and highly vocal. I'm glad a movie like this exist.","id":"5e2f2887ac8e6b0011bcc3e9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2f2887ac8e6b0011bcc3e9","movie_id":515001}
{"author":"Matthew Brady","content":"the \u2018Hangover 2 & 3\u2019, the two most uncomfortable comedies he\u2019s ever directed that felt more crime drama than anything funny. There\u2019s also some dark humor in \u2018Joker\u2019 that involves a door chain. It\u2019s silly, yet absolutely terrifying with the given context. A complete departure from his other work and that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s one of his best. I honestly think he made something so unique and meaningful. Seriously, I do.\r\n\r\nThe score by Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir helped set the tone tremendously. A melancholy tone with a chaotic twist. A representation of Arthur slowly drowning in his own misery and pain. A little fun fact: The score for the film were written based on the script even before the actual filming of the movie started, which I think is the best way to do it, if you ask me. Someone to imagine movie by songs and incorporate their interpretation through music.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography was gorgeous and there\u2019s a handful of shots that has imprinted into my memory. Lawrence Sher does an excellent job off showing the decaying Gotham city and the sewer waste look of the city. Bright neon lights with striking colors that manage to make the most run down of places look pretty.\r\n\r\nI like how they actually gave Thomas Wayne a character rather than \u201cguy gets shot in alleyway\u201d. He\u2019s portrayed as a ruthless man with blunt ways of saving Gotham City. However he loves his wife and son, so his unforgiving attitude was all for the shake of keeping his loved ones safe. He\u2019s also a massive movie buff where he often goes to watch the classics on the big screen. So it\u2019s an interesting take on the character viewed in somebody\u2019s else perspective.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a scene where Arthur goes to watch a comedy standup show to take notes on a comedians act. Every time a joke is told and everyone laughs, his face is frozen in place with an unsure grin while his eyes look around the room wondering why everyone\u2019s laughing, but when the laughter dies down he jumps to live with a delayed laugh. It\u2019s moments like that are simple, yet says a lot about him. Basically showing how disconnected he is with humor and everyone else.\r\n\r\nNow lets talk about the controversy that's been surrounding this movie:\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most ludicrous controversy in recent memory. The movie will not cause or inspire violence, but shows why violence happens. I mean, there probably has been incidents when somebody committed a horrendous crime because their were influenced by a movie or a game. However, it\u2019s he\/she that should be brought into question, not the creators. Maybe this movie could inspire people to think twice about how they treat others. Why not think about the positives? If \u201cJoker\u201d is going to be responsible for violence and mass shootings, then so is every other movie with any form of violence ever. If people really care about how violence is portrayed in movies, then Rob Zombies \u20183 From Hell\u2019 should also receive the same attention. Just imagine \u2018Natural Born Killers\u2019 times 100, but I guess it\u2019s not mainstream enough for any of that. And sure, there\u2019s some brutal and raw approach to violence in \u2018Joker\u2019, but we all have seen worst. \u2018Deadpool\u2019 is more graphic than this. It's not the directors duty to teach morals to the viewer. People will never learn to stop pointing fingers at things to blame and actually do something about it! People often understandment how much power their got.\r\n\r\nAnywhere, sorry about that folks, just had to get that off my chest. Go and check it out.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: \u201cSend in the clowns\u201d \u21e0 you\u2019ve gotta sing that like Frank Sinatra.","id":"5e2f26e44ca676001249c3c2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2f26e44ca676001249c3c2","movie_id":475557}

{"author":"solstafir7","content":"Joker. The character that has existed since 1940, has become so heavy with so many different portrayals, different origins, that it feels impossible for any mortal man alive to impersonate the scattered personalities. It is an insurmountable task for any director to digest it all and still produce one more.\r\n\r\nTodd Phillips had a crazy challenge. He brought in one of the best actors alive to lift it with him, Joaquin Phoenix. Together, they have built a mass-market masterpiece which is just above the crop. It is appropriately crazy and completely focussed on the central character. The narrator goes close to the shores of that craziness, wets his feet but remains dry to tell this story. It is like those news reporters which go closer to the burning amazon, but it is impossible to step in the fumes. In no way, Joker is telling his story. Instead, his story is told to us and there are pillars of sanity (like the detectives, asylum clerk etc.) which remain steadfast to give a strong anchor to the audience. This dilutes the effect of the film.\r\n\r\nWith the copious amount of material on Joker already, I wished to consider this film as a standalone character study vaguely inspired by the batman universe. But this is not entirely possible. I was forced to think about it on two levels. With Batman and Without Batman. \r\n\r\nWith Batman, The Joker is on the home turf. There have been many renditions of Joker, and Heath Ledger's portrayal is still vivid in my mind. I knew that Arthur here will go on to become someone who is going to say, \u201c\u200eIntroduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos...\u201d. When I was thinking Joker in the context of Batman, I could not keep Ledger's joker too far away. I was searching for a path for Arthur to go from the mentally unstable to the calculating anarchist. I was left searching for that path when the movie ended. To remain as the crown prince of crime, and to justify the title of the greatest adversary of Batman, just mental instability isn't good enough. He needs to be much more intelligent, much more cunning. These traits are often visible early, In the case of Arthur, I could not find that complete foundation upon which the later psyche can stand. This reminded me of Cameron Monaghan's Jerome Valeska. The joker of my understanding is somewhere between the cruelty of Jerome and pitiable delusions of Arthur. Also, the iconic Batman moment was not needed in this. I kept feeling that Joker is trying to stand with the support of Batman's tale as a clutch. A safety net enforced by the producers.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if I consider this movie as a standalone tale, then it was a bit more satisfying. There are tearjerker movies where nothing good ever happens with the protagonist. A series of bad lucks, or difficulties keep blocking a normal life. He is most definitely poor, has a sub-optimal family background, has a medical affliction which is unique and provides a foundation of the pity I felt. This is not very far from Rani Mukharjee's Hichki if you only consider the medical condition. Rani's Naina had Tourette syndrome while Joaquin's Arthur suffers from pseudobulbar affect. The setting and genre make the two films vastly different. More often than not, I have noticed these disorders lift a lot of burden from the narrative. In the case of Joker, couple his disorder with usually being in the wrong place at the wrong time, you have a travesty of human life. Add to that, an unstable parent, amplify it with the volatile societal conditions, you have a perfect decoction of what Joker is made of. As a tale of its own, it works. The delivery is great thanks to the spectacular performance. It also helps to increase the awareness of mental health. But when you strip off all the Batman context, it remains a well-acted and averagely written tale. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is a single film, and I felt it is torn between these two polarising treatments. It wants to find its ground, which it finds. But that ground is far from being sensational. It remains somewhat indecisive. It can not be well soaked in Batman lore like James Gordon's tale, Gotham is. I am considering Gotham because both Gotham and Joker do not feature Batman, but they both have Bruce. Gotham understands its lore and fully embraces it but Joker does not want to. At the same time, as a tale of the psychologically troubled protagonist, Joker tries to play safe with the aim to please audience en-mass. I kept thinking about American Psycho and The Machinist. (Coincidently, both star ex-Batman Christian Bale). Those two take you in the psyche of the protagonist. Those take you inside the burning Amazon and not stand at a safe distance. Joker does not aim to do so. \r\n\r\nI am not at all qualified to talk about the acting performances. Joaquin Phoenix is in every frame and the way he waltzes between emotions is terrifyingly amazing. The Tai Chi to calm himself down, the menacing stare when finally becomes the Joker, those are chilling. He lives the character to the best of his abilities. Regrettably, he does not have the same level of writing support which Heath Ledger had and so due to no fault of his own, Joaquin could not topple Heath Ledger's portrayal of the crown prince of crime.\r\n\r\nIf I consider Todd Philips's entire resume, this was a genre shift for him. He knew very well that the biggest trump card is Joaquin Phoenix, so he takes no risk. He keeps him in focus, almost always all the setting and cinematography works for him. The only exception being Robert De Niro. Robert is allowed to carry his scenes quite independently. I think Todd Philips relied on both these giants to carry their parts. Sadly, I had gone to a theatre which had a bad print or screen so I think I will have to watch it again sometimes to enjoy the cinematography.\r\n\r\nI realised, I kept writing a lot and this is already over a thousand words. If you are here and reading still, I must say thank you. To summarise, The Joker worked for me and I enjoyed it, but I would not consider it the best depication of the iconic villain from comic books. The best may yet come.","id":"5dac3463174a870019a7c547","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dac3463174a870019a7c547","movie_id":475557}
{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_A hilarious piece of political satire that isn't afraid to be serious_**\r\n\r\n>_The great danger of lying is not that lies are untruths, and thus unreal, but that they become real in other people's minds._\r\n\r\n- Christine Leunens; _Caging Skies_ (2004)\r\n\r\nWe live in dangerous times. In this era of political regression, racists, xenophobes, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, white separatists, and fascists, once confined to the periphery of civilised society, have wormed their way back into the cultural mainstream, preaching hate and intolerance under the guise of terms such as \"nationalism\" and \"patriotism\". Meanwhile, politicians validate such groups by doing precisely nothing to curtail them and refusing to condemn them (\"_very fine people on both sides_\" and so forth). Far-right political parties have gained worrying footholds in numerous European countries, running on populist platforms of Islamophobia and anti-immigration, playing on peoples' fears of the Other, exploiting the dearth of facts in sociopolitical discourse, and trading in disinformation (and the less said about the current administrations in the US and UK, the better). Anti-establishment political rage is on the increase, as hordes of people disavow traditional centrism; think of Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, the _Movimento 5 Stelle_ in Italy, the _Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland_ in Germany. Scholars and sociocultural anthropologists have posited that hateful right-wing ideologies are more validated now than at any time since the rise of fascism in places such as Italy in 1922 and Spain in 1936. And the best known example of this kind of fascist thinking, of course, is the Third Reich in Germany, beginning with the rise to power of Adolf Hitler in 1933.\r\n\r\nAnd so, it's entirely fitting that a film set in this very _milieu_, which argues that love, tolerance, and kindness can defeat hateful indoctrination, has come along at this precise moment; because although this is a film set in Germany in 1945, it's really about the here and now. Based loosely on the 2004 novel _Caging Skies_ by Christine Leunens, _Jojo Rabbit_ is a political satire written and directed by New Zealand filmmaker (and Polynesian Jew) Taika Waititi (_Eagle vs Shark_; _What We Do in the Shadows_; _Hunt for the Wilderpeople_; _Thor: Ragnarok_). Courting significant controversy when it was announced (a comedy about Nazis? For shame. Especially when one considers that the novel is deadly serious) and sharply dividing critics upon release, the film has proven a significant hit with audiences, and has just scored an impressive six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture.\r\n\r\nPositing that the first casualty of indoctrination is objective truth, Waititi follows in the footsteps of filmmakers such as Charlie Chaplin (_The Great Dictator_), Mel Brooks (_The Producers_), Roberto Benigni (_La vita \u00e8 bella_), and even Quentin Tarantino (_Inglorious Basterds_), in attempting to defang Nazi ideology by rendering it utterly absurd and mercilessly exposing it to mockery. Marketed as an \"_anti-hate satire_\", the film has no easy task \u2013 to use Nazism as the (mostly) humorous background to what is essentially a _bildungsroman_, without it seeming exploitative or dismissive of the real suffering endured by real people. And Waititi manages this tricky balancing act exceptionally well. The satire and slapstick elements are as funny as anything in his filmography, and the film's more serious moments (of which there are several) arrive like an absolute gut-punch. This could have gone wrong in so many ways \u2013 if it wasn't funny, if the emotionality felt contrived, if the serious moments seemed manipulative, if the whole thing just came across as disrespectful and in bad taste \u2013 but Waititi navigates these dangerous waters magnificently. _Jojo Rabbit_ is, in fact, that rarest of films \u2013 a comedy where the serious moments feel completely earned and a drama with something important to say where the comedy enhances the seriousness.\r\n\r\n_Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich_, 1945. The European war is all but over. Germany's army has been pushed back to the homeland and allied forces are approaching from multiple directions. However, the propaganda machine continues to ensure that the populace are relatively unaware that _Der F\u00fchrer_ is on the brink of total defeat. In the fictional town of Falkenhem, ten-year-old Jojo Betzler (an astonishing debut by Roman Griffin Davis) lives with his whimsical mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson doing probably the best work of her career). His father, he believes, is fighting on the Italian Front, whilst his older sister Inge recently died of influenza. And, oh yeah, his imaginary best friend is none other than Hitler himself (a ludicrously over the top Waititi), or at least Jojo's childlike conception of Hitler. Believing absolutely in his duty to the state, Jojo and his actual flesh-and-blood friend Yorki (a hilarious Archie Yates) attend a camp for the _Deutsches Jungvolk_ branch of the _Hitlerjugend_. The camp is run by the cynical Cpt. Klenzendorf (a powerful performance by Sam Rockwell that was outrageously ignored by the Academy), who was forced to leave the front line upon losing an eye. Helping him manage the camp are his effeminate second-in-command Finkel (Alfie Allen) and the completely insane Fr\u00e4ulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson), who claims to have given birth to eighteen blond-haired blue-eyed _\u00fcbermenschen_ who are now fighting on the front. When Jojo is told by some older boys that to prove he has what it takes to be a soldier, he has to kill a rabbit, he refuses to do so, earning the moniker Jojo Rabbit. However, determined to show his fellow students what he's made of, he barges into a _Stielhandgranate_ exercise, tossing a grenade against a tree, which then explodes a few feet away from him, leaving him with a limp and a scarred face, and forcing him to return home in disgrace. As Jojo recovers, Rosie persuades Klenzendorf, who was demoted after the incident, to give him some work, and so he's employed to distribute propaganda around town. Life is dull but straightforward. That is until he learns his mother has been hiding a young Jewish girl, Elsa Korr (a nuanced performance from Thomasin McKenzie), in a crawlspace behind the wall of Inge's room. However, as every German youth knows, Jews are mind-reading demons who must be exterminated. So why would his mother be harbouring one, and, more importantly, what does Jojo do now that he knows?\r\n\r\nPerhaps _Jojo Rabbit_'s most laudable component is how well Waititi balances the disparate tones, which is a hell of a lot better than Benigni did. The film mixes slapstick humour, caricature, satire, dramatic irony, and hope, but never does it seem like its ignoring or trivialising real suffering. When the comedy is dropped and Waititi gets serious, the tonal shifts pack a shocking punch, and it's _because_ they're so well integrated into the overarching comic structure \u2013 if you take away the humour and the satirical edge, the film's darker elements simply don't work as well \u2013 it's the contrast that makes each element all the more powerful. Waititi's tonal intentions are indicated right from the beginning, as stock footage of German children performing 'Heil Hitlers' is scored (unashamedly anachronistically) by the German version of The Beatles' \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" (1963). Also crucially important to the film's tonal qualities are the bright, colourful palette employed by director of photography Mihai M\u0103laimare, Jr. (_The Master_; _A Walk Among the Tombstones_; _The Hate U Give_) and the whimsical production design by Waititi's regular designer, Ra Vincent. Together, they speak to the fact that this is Jojo's worldview rather than objective reality, with the look of the film reminding me a great deal of Wes Anderson's _The Grand Budapest Hotel_ (2014). It sure doesn't look like any World War II movie you're ever likely to have seen.\r\n\r\nThematically, the film examines multiple issues; the devotion of motherhood, the importance of kindness in defeating indoctrination, the disconnect between an unchallenged and rigidly reinforced ideology and a far more nuanced and complex reality, the predetermined attitudinal stance towards the Other, the clash between doing what one knows to be right and what one is expected to do, the fact that good people can be found even in the worst of circumstances. Klenzendorf's arc is especially telling in this respect. Introduced as a hyperbolic caricature, the source of some of the film's biggest early laughs, as things progress, we realise there's considerably more to his character than initially thought, and he commands what's easily the most moving scene in the whole film. This is Jojo's story, however, with much of the runtime concerned with his attempts to rationalise the cognitive dissonance between what he's been taught and what he can see with his own eyes. Rosie is rightly worried that the indoctrination Jojo has known his entire life has effectively brainwashed him \u2013 he's so passionately loyal to Nazi ideology, when he found out his grandfather didn't have blond hair, it took him three weeks to get over it.\r\n\r\nOf course, as mentioned, although set in 1945, _Jojo Rabbit_ is really about the here and now, although it's more than a little upsetting that its depiction of illogical hate is so timely. Essentially, the film mocks extremism, people who hate based on ethnicity or religion, with Jojo's belief that Jews are demonic figures capable of powerful magic standing in for people who believe all Muslims are terrorists or all Mexicans are rapists. In this sense, the film isn't about Nazis at all; their role is more allegorical. Rather it's partly about the role adults play in inculcating children into hate and partly about exposing the power of propaganda to subvert truth. But so too is it about rising above such ideology, no matter how ingrained it might be, a path that values personal relationships with persecuted minorities, which in turn reveal the individualistic humanity behind the political clich\u00e9. And although all of this is presented humorously, it never becomes didactic or monolithically preachy \u2013 Waititi balances his tones so well, the political undercurrent remains always subtle.\r\n\r\nIf I were to criticise any element of the film, it would be that Waititi undeniably glosses over some of the more horrific atrocities carried out during the War. The Nazis in the film are, by design, cartoonish, but that is done so as to render them as easily dismissed figures to be scorned. The reality, of course, was far, far darker. I've seen some critics point to this as evidence that the film is crass and manipulative, and although I disagree with that assessment, it certainly wouldn't have hurt to have at least one fully indoctrinated Nazi who isn't a figure of fun \u2013 even the Gestapo is exposed to ridicule, with the character of Deertz (an admittedly hilarious Stephen Merchant cameo) presented as more concerned with empty pop-cultural signifiers than carrying out the actions of the real Gestapo. In this sense, the film doesn't represent the awful truth, but it never claims to; this isn't a reality-based examination of Nazism, nor does it try to be.\r\n\r\nOnly two weeks into 2020, and I already have a possible film of the year. _Jojo Rabbit_ is beautiful, emotional, heartfelt, and devastating, but mostly hilarious and always hopeful. It's an extraordinarily sweet film without ever becoming saccharine, as Waititi strikes a perfect balance between comedy, tragedy, and drama. It's a very funny World War II film which imparts a vital message for our confused and divided world of today \u2013 if we let them, love will always trump hate, hope will always light a way through the darkness.","id":"5e21335e397df0001697591e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e21335e397df0001697591e","movie_id":515001}
{"author":"Sheldon Nylander","content":"I might be a bit more lenient on this just because I'm a huge fan of D&D art as well as being an old school player myself. It should not simply be pegged as something only for fantasy nerds, and this film tries to show that. Including interviews with artists from D&D's days when TSR was still around, it gives an interesting explanations of the art and even delves into the creative process.\r\n\r\nIf I have a complaint, and it's a significant one, it would be the omissions. The film covers art primarily from the first and second editions of the game (it's currently in its fifth edition), which admittedly is the most iconic era of D&D. I would have been interested in seeing an analysis of how the art continued to evolve under Wizards of the Coast in the third and fourth editions (they very, very briefly look at art from the fifth edition).\r\n\r\nThey also review art specific to popular campaign settings, such as Dragonlance or Dark Sun, but left out one of my personal favorites, Spelljammer. A continuation of this film into the third edition could have included art from Eberron, which was a different type of campaign setting, as well as the controversial Book of Vile Darkness. Maybe they could do this in a sequel. Anyone up for \"Eye of the Beholder II: Behold Harder\"?\r\n\r\nA great film for fantasy art afficionados as well as a fun trip down memory lane for classic D&D players.","id":"5d610d717f6c8d0017eca052","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d610d717f6c8d0017eca052","movie_id":551595}

If it's a choice of forcing me out of the country or putting me in gaol, then they'll have to put me in gaol._\r\n\r\n- Mikhail Khodorkovsky (July 3, 2003)\r\n\r\nAs superficially entertaining a show as it was, _Sons of Anarchy_ always had one especially egregious flaw \u2013 no matter who opposed the titular biker gang, the show went out of its way to paint them as utterly corrupt and\/or amoral, and so compared to them, the bikers (who just so happen to deal illegal guns) don't seem so bad. From Ernest Darby (neo-Nazi) to Joshua Kohn (obsessed stalker) to Ethan Zobelle (white separatist) to June Stahl (murderous lesbian) to Jimmy O'Phelan (murderous Irishman) to Damon Pope (murderous black man) to Galen O'Shay (another murderous Irishman) to Lee Toric (drug-addicted sadist and reader of French poetry), the show spent far more time painting the gang as decent-by-association than actually interrogating their questionable morals. And bizarrely, _Citizen K_, a documentary about Russian oligarch-cum-dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky, has a similar problem \u2013 it's more concerned with painting Vladimir Putin as the big bad than it is with critiquing Khodorkovsky himself, who emerges as the default hero \u2013 if your villain is villainous enough, anyone who goes up against them, regardless of their own moral fibre, is going to look pretty good. Partly in service of this reading of history, although the film is undeniably informative in a factual sense, it suffers from an absence of any kind of psychological deep dive and gives Khodorkovsky more of a pass than seems appropriate.\r\n\r\nDirected by Alex Gibney, the prolific Academy Award-winning documentarian behind films on subjects such as the collapse of Enron (_Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room_), the torture and murder of Dilawar by the US Army (_Taxi to the Darkside_), the Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal (_Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God_), Julian Assange (_We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks_), the Lance Armstrong scandal (_The Armstrong Lie_), Scientology (_Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief_), Stuxnet (_Zer0 Days_), and the Elizabeth Holmes\/Theranos scandal (_The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley_), Citizen K uses Khodorkovsky's history to tell the chaotic story of post-Soviet Russia and Putin's rise to power, a rise made possible by Khodorkovsky himself.\r\n\r\nBorn in Moscow in 1963, Khodorkovsky grew up in the Communist Soviet Union, but his story really begins in 1991, as Boris Yeltsin commenced his first term as the inaugural president of the Russian Federation. A proponent of democracy and capitalism, it was in the initial years of Yeltsin's presidency that Khodorkovsky opened one of Russia's first privately owned commercial banks, MENATEP. In the confusion of a country transitioning to a capitalist system it didn't fully understand, Khodorkovsky made millions in currency trading, but much of his initial wealth came from buying privatisation vouchers \u2013 free vouchers distributed to Russian citizens entitling them to shares in formerly state-owned assets. Unaware of the real value of such vouchers, millions of Russians simply sold their vouchers for cash to people such as Khodorkovsky, allowing him to acquire controlling stakes in over 30 companies. This period, dubbed \"Wild-West Capitalism\", resulted in seven bankers (Khodorkovsky, Boris Berezovsky, Alexander Smolensky, Vladimir Gusinsky, Petr Aven, Vladimir Potanin, and Mikhail Fridman \u2013 collectively known as the _\u0441\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0431\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0438\u0440\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430_ [_Semibankirschina_]) controlling between 50%-70% of the country's entire economy. In 1995, facing a fiscal crisis and in need of funds for his re-election campaign, Yeltsin introduced a \"loans-for-shares\" scheme, whereby some of the largest state-owned assets were leased through auctions for money lent by the commercial banks. However, because the auctions were rigged and controlled by insiders with political connections, neither the loans nor the assets were to be returned. In this sense, the scheme was really a clandestine method of privatisation, but at exceptionally low prices. In 1996, for example, MENATEP acquired a 78% share ownership of Yukos, the country's main oil and gas company, for $310 million despite the company being valued at over $5 billion. By 2003, Khodorkovsky had become the richest man in Russia, and in 2004, he was listed by Forbes as the 16th wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated personal fortune of $16 billion.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Putin, a former low-level KGB officer, was rising through the ranks of Yeltsin's government. Believing him to be a democratic capitalist in the same mould as Yeltsin, the oligarchs championed his rise to power, but upon becoming president in 2000, it quickly became apparent that he allowed them to operate only so long as they stayed out of politics. In February 2003, at a televised conference on corruption, Khodorkovsky challenged Putin, accusing the government of accepting bribes. In October, he was arrested and charged with tax evasion. Putin then froze Yukos shares, leading to the collapse of the company's share price and the loss of much of Khodorkovsky's wealth. In 2004-2005, in a blatant show-trial, Khodorkovsky was found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison. In 2010, while still incarcerated, he was charged with stealing 350 million tons (!) of his own oil and his sentence was extended to 2017. He was unexpectedly pardoned by Putin in 2013, possibly because of international pressure, and he moved to Switzerland. By now, his personal wealth had dropped to $100\u2013250 million. In 2014, he launched Open Russia, an advocacy group championing democracy and human rights, and calling for reforms to Russian civil society, including free elections and media independence. In 2015, a Russian court issued an international arrest warrant for Khodorkovsky, charging him with ordering the 1998 murder of Vladimir Petukhov, the mayor of Nefteyugansk, who had clashed with Khodorkovsky over local taxation issues. He currently lives in London, and will be arrested if he returns to Russia.\r\n\r\nThe film's interviewees are Leonid Nevzlin (former president of MENATEP and vice-president of Yukos), Igor Malashenko (co-founder of the Russian TV channel NTV and campaign manager for Ksenia Sobchak's failed 2018 presidential run), Anton Drel (Khodorkovsky's attorney), Maria Logan (member of Khodorkovsky's legal team), Alexei Navalny (politician and anti-Putin activist); Lysova Tatyana Gennadyevna (journalist and executive officer of S.-Peterburgskie Vedomosti Publishing House); Derk Sauer (founder of the _Moscow Times_); Vladimir Vladimirovich Kara-Murza (politician and vice chairman of Open Russia); Martin Sixsmith (former BBC Russian correspondent and author of _Putin's Oil: The Yukos Affair and the Struggle for Russia_); and Arkady Ostrovsky (_Financial Times_ journalist and author of _The Invention of Russia: From Gorbachev's Freedom to Putin's War_).\r\n\r\nOne of the main themes of the film is something which should be very familiar to anyone who has followed US politics over the last few years \u2013 the belief that Putin, despite all his power, is essentially a thin-skinned, classless bully who can't brook any kind of criticism and who throws his toys out of the pram when crossed. Sound familiar? The parallels with a certain American man-child president are never explicitly stated, but they're unmissable nonetheless \u2013 much like Trump, Putin didn't rise to power via traditional political channels; much like Trump, Putin proved especially adept at harnessing the power of television to rally his base; and much like Trump, Putin was able to appeal to a specific section of society, working his way into a position where he can seemingly do pretty much anything and his followers will blindly excuse\/protect him. After being installed by Yeltsin as \"acting president\", Putin (like Trump) projected an image of strength and nationalist pride, before later clamping down on any dissidence within the TV networks that helped bring him to power (again, the parallels are clear \u2013 how much would Trump love to do the same to CNN and MSNBC). And once Putin controlled the networks, he controlled the national discourse, then turning his attention to the oligarchs who he and a lot of working-class Russian people felt had become too powerful.\r\n\r\nOf course, none of this is to absolve the oligarchs for their own questionable behaviour, and one of the most bizarre moments in the film details a scheme that sounds like it was lifted from Barry Levinson's _Wag the Dog_ (1997). In 1996, Yeltsin was too sick to go on the road during his presidential campaign, and with rumours of his ill-health spreading across the country, he was in real danger of losing the election to Communist candidate Gennady Zyuganov, something which the oligarchs wanted to avoid. And so they concocted a ploy to hide the real state of Yeltsin's health by using set dressing to make it appear that he was taking interviews in various locations, when he was barely travelling at all.\r\n\r\nThe film is less critical, however, when it comes to Khodorkovsky's more personal failings. Take the murder of Petukhov as an example, which takes up all of two minutes of screen time. To be fair, Khodorkovsky has always denied involvement, and there is no real evidence to say he ordered the hit. Nevertheless, this is a major part of his story and the main reason he can't return to Russia, so for Gibney and editor Michael J. Palmer to skim by as quickly as they do is more than a little disappointing. And whilst they do feature some material on the (a)morality of the loans-for-shares scheme, with one interviewee calling it a \"_Faustian deal_\", there is virtually nothing on how Khodorkovsky essentially scammed poor people into selling their privatisation vouchers, exploiting their ignorance of capitalism to line his own pockets. Unfortunately, Gibney is far more focused on proving Putin's nefariousness than examining Khodorkovsky's imperfections, focusing on his latter-day dissident activities rather than his early capitalistic ruthlessness.\r\n\r\nAs this might suggest, one of the most significant problems is that Gibney is unable to strike a balance between championing Khodorkovsky the symbol of anti-Putin resistance and interrogating Khodorkovsky the man. In reaching for a grand political sweep and focusing on decades-spanning geopolitics, Gibney misses the opportunity to make a more intimate documentary about a fascinatingly contradictory individual. He does say some interesting things about the nature of power, but at every turn, it seems like there's a better, simpler film struggling to get out from under the massive weight Gibney has bestowed upon the material. Indeed, had he given more time over to the mistakes of Khodorkovsky's past, it would have made for a considerably more compelling narrative, investing his later attempts to right some of the wrongs he has done to the country with considerably more gravitas and pathos.\r\n\r\nUltimately, _Citizen K_ is an average documentary that provides an admittedly accessible overview of post-Soviet Russian politics, but which is unsatisfying as a portrait of its ostensible subject, failing to capitalise on how compelling Khodorkovsky's story is. This is an unscrupulous billionaire who mistakenly believed himself untouchable, who only learned humility in his nine years of incarceration in a Siberian labour camp (complete with multiple hunger strikes and the championing of prisoner rights); the one-time richest man in Russia who became one of the most outspoken critics of the president he helped to install. There's inherently great drama there, with an inbuilt character arc that any screenwriter would kill to come up with. Unfortunately, that's not Gibney's focus, and ultimately, his Khodorkovsky is an abstract symbol of an ideal, one that is far less interesting than a flesh and blood man _with_ ideals.","id":"5e0d63809974ee0012a5a8f2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e0d63809974ee0012a5a8f2","movie_id":618360}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"_Rocketman_ tries to walk a line between the paint-by-numbers musician biopic bog standard, and epic musical fantasy. A lot of the time when a movie tries to be a blend of two things, it ends up being neither. _Rocketman_, conversely, ends up being both, just never at the same time. It's basically two movies, and that epic musical fantasy movie I was talking about that's in there, that's a **great** movie. Unfortunately, the other one, is not so much. I'm still gonna come away giving it a recommendation, because there is enough in there to mean that I enjoyed it, especially in the core casting, all of which is great, not least Egerton. But I was little disappointed, not because my expectations were too high going in or anything, but because every time Rocketman began to slip into a euphoric high, it was moments later wrenched back to, well... Reality, I guess. Albeit a reality we only see on a movie screen. And we see on **every** movie screen when it's a musician biopic.

Paired with the man who would eventually change his life; Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell), Elton and Bernie combine to write a series of songs which in turn leads him to a series of gigs in Los Angeles.

Go home._\r\n\r\n- _Rambo_ (2008); Wri. Art Monterastelli, Sylvester Stallone; Dir. Sylvester Stallone\r\n\r\nIn the torrent of negative reviews that greeted _Rambo: Last Blood_, one that stood out was Richard Roeper's zero-star rant for _The Chicago Sun Times_, in which he said of the film, \"_this is a gratuitously violent, shamelessly exploitative, gruesomely sadistic and utterly repellent piece of trash_\". I agree with pretty much all of that sentence. And I loved it. But let me segue into asking a question. Which is the more \"responsible\" - the hard R-rated movie that makes no bones about its violent content, or the equally violent PG-13 movie that gets around the issue by removing the gore but leaving the savagery? _Last Blood_ is only moderately more violent than the movies in the _Taken_ franchise, for example, but it's a damn-sight more honest in its depiction of the impact of violence on the human body. It's like the old joke about _The A-Team_ - it didn't matter what the level of violence was, the fact that we never saw blood and never saw anyone die meant it was family entertainment. _Last Blood_ is not family entertainment. Nor is it trying to be. Nor does it want to be. It's a throwback to a time before studios saw an R as a death-knell; a threadbare story leading to an extended action scene of ever-increasing ridiculousness and viciousness.\r\n\r\nAnd it's awesome.\r\n\r\nIn an age of political correctness, when almost everyone with a public voice is afraid to say anything that might earn them a ticking off, it's easy enough for a film to stand out, but only if the filmmaker has the balls to stand there relatively alone. S. Craig Zahler's superb _Dragged Across Concrete_ (2018) was a good recent example, an unashamedly trashy piece of exploitation that wasn't afraid to air opinions that could be considered (say it quietly) right-wing. Now, make no mistake, _Last Blood_ is no _Dragged Across Concrete_; it's barely a movie at all (the script is so rudimentary, it rivals the dizzying complexities of _Rocky IV_), and it's by far the least political entry in the _Rambo_ franchise thus far. Is it xenophobic? Yes. Is it racist? To a certain extent. Is it likely to stoke irrational fears about the evils of Mexico and permeability of the southern border? Possibly. What it definitely is, however, is a film in which Rambo doesn't just kill his enemies, he kills them several times just to be sure (like the unfortunate schmuck who is decapitated via close-range shotgun blast and then shot several times in the torso for punctuation). What it definitely is, is a film in which on no less than two occasions, Rambo uses his bare hands to extract internal organs. What it definitely is, is an immensely enjoyable no-holds-barred revenge actioner that's about as interested in political correctness as it is in millennial angst. Which is to say, not even remotely.\r\n\r\nAnd it's awesome.\r\n\r\nWhen last we saw former Green Beret John J. Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), it was 2008, and he had returned to the US for the first time since 1985. Heading to his father's ranch in Bowie, Arizona, the implication was that maybe, after conflicts in Vi\u1ec7t Nam (twice), Afghanistan (where he fought alongside the Mujahideen), and Myanmar (where he faced off against the Tatmadaw), and an extended residency in Thailand, he had finally come home in both a literal and existential sense. _Last Blood_ picks up the story 11 years later. His father has died, but Rambo remains at the ranch, breaking in horses and taking medication to keep his PTSD partially under-control. He shares his home with live-in housekeeper Maria Beltran (Adriana Barraza) and her teenage granddaughter Gabriela (Yvette Monreal), who refers to him as uncle and who he helped to raise. All is quiet until Gabriela is contacted from Mexico by her friend Gizelle (Fenessa Pineda), who tells her she has located Gabriela's father Manuel (Marco de la O), who walked out on her and her dying mother when she was still a child. Soon to be heading off to college, Gabriela is determined to look Manuel in the eye and ask why he left his family. Although advised by both Rambo and Maria not to go to Mexico, she ignores their warnings and heads south anyway. After Manuel proves as cruel as Rambo told her he was, she and Gizelle head out for a few drinks, but she is drugged and abducted by the Martinez brothers, Hugo (Sergio Peris-Mencheta) and Victor (\u00d3scar Jaenada), who run a prostitution ring. Meanwhile, Rambo comes looking for her, but earns a beating for his troubles, only surviving because of the intervention of Carmen Delgado (Paz Vega), a local journalist investigating the Martinez cartel. And so, realising he can't fight the cartel on their territory and terms, Rambo decides to lure them back to Arizona, where he can fight them on his.\r\n\r\nIntroduced in David Morrell's superb 1972 novel, _First Blood_, the character of John Rambo was brought to the screen 10 years later, in the film of the same name, written by Michael Kozoll, William Sackheim, and Stallone, and directed by Ted Kotcheff. A Vi\u1ec7t Nam vet who finds himself unable to integrate back into a society that now hates him, he runs afoul of Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) in the small town of Hope, WA, against whom he wages a guerrilla war. One of many Vi\u1ec7t Nam-vet-comes-home-and-is-rejected-by-society films made in the years following the end of the Vi\u1ec7t Nam War (1955-1975), the character was praised as a particularly salient embodiment of the problems of unaddressed-PTSD. The novel ended with Rambo's commanding officer, Col. Trautman (played in the film by Richard Crenna) recognising that the man who came home from Vi\u1ec7t Nam could never be at peace in the US and shooting him dead in an act of mercy. The film was also supposed to end this way, but test audiences disliked the sense of nihilism with which they were left, and so a new ending was shot which saw Rambo arrested and imprisoned, but very much alive.\r\n\r\nOf course, Rambo hadn't been conceived as a muscle-bound action hero; Morell has always maintained the novel was a piece of social protest, and Stallone has spoken about how he thought of the film as the slightly more action-orientated, but equally serious, cousin of prestige dramas such as Hal Ashby's _Coming Home_ and Michael Cimino's _The Deer Hunter_ (both 1978). Nevertheless, it was the action elements of the film rather than the inherent tragedy of the character that audiences embraced, and for _Rambo: First Blood Part II_ (1985), written by Stallone and James Cameron, from a screen story by Kevin Jarre, and directed by George P. Cosmatos, Rambo took his first steps towards becoming a cartoon, as now the misunderstood vet who just wanted to be left alone was given a chance to return to Vi\u1ec7t Nam to fight the war the right way, rescuing undeclared POWs from the clutches of a Soviet\/Vi\u1ec7t Nam conspiracy. With his actions in the second film earning him a pardon for his actions in the first, in _Rambo III_ (1988), written by Stallone and Sheldon Lettich, and directed by Peter MacDonald, things got even more ridiculous, as Rambo, now the embodiment of jingoistic Regan-era American militarism, was tasked with entering Afghanistan in the midst of the Soviet-Afghan War, where he would fight alongside the Mujahideen against the Soviet war machine. Finally, in _Rambo_ (2008), written by Art Monterastelli and Stallone, and directed by Stallone, Rambo must penetrate into Myanmar to rescue a group of Christian aid workers from the clutches of the Tatmadaw, an entire battalion of whom he massacres with a commandeered M2 Browning in a gloriously violent finale.\r\n\r\nUndeniably, for better or worse, the _Rambo_ films have always found a way to tap into some of the major geopolitical issues of the era in which they were made. The first film, made in the second year of Reagan's presidency, was a thoughtful and genuinely heartfelt plea for understanding, arguing that you can't create killing machines for use in a foreign war and then simply bring them home and expect them to reintegrate. Indeed, it's a film that's relatively uninterested in violence _per se_ (Rambo only indirectly kills one person, and it's an accident). The next two films also took place during Reagan's presidency, at a time when although the wounds of Vi\u1ec7t Nam were still fresh, the idea of American exceptionalism had started to morph into a kind of over-compensatory machismo. It was for this reason that the perceptive and justified seriousness of the first film became diluted as Rambo transitioned from being an allegory for the real struggles of vets to an embodiment of juvenile wish-fulfilment (I mean, in the second film, he literally gets a second crack at winning in Vi\u1ec7t Nam). In essence, he had transitioned from a symbol for the psychological damage of war to an undefeatable representative of American military might. The fourth film came out in the final year of George W. Bush's presidency at a time when the US (in no small part because of an illegal war) had once again risen to the position of global police force, although the fact that he's on a mission to save, of all things, Christian aid workers, is a bit on the nose even for this franchise. \r\n\r\nAll of which brings us to _Last Blood_. Written by Stallone and Matthew Cirulnick, from a story by Dan Gordon, and directed by Adrian Grunberg (_Get the Gringo_), _Last Blood_, of course, comes in the fourth year of Donald Trump's presidency, and sees Rambo facing off against the bad _hombres_ south of the border (they bring drugs, they bring crime, they're rapists, although some, he assumes, are good people). And with a border this porous (characters easily cross over with weaponry, drugs, dead bodies, and, on one occasion, a decapitated head on the passenger seat), the only person who can protect the US of A from such villains is Don J. Trumpo...sorry, John J. Rambo. It's all gloriously juvenile, gloriously transparent, and gloriously entertaining.\r\n\r\nHowever, having said that, this is far and away the least political film of the franchise. Whilst the first and second both dealt explicitly with Vi\u1ec7t Nam, the third with the Soviet-Afghan war, and the fourth with the Myanmar Civil War, _Last Blood_ doesn't explicitly deal with a real-world conflict. It certainly alludes to real-world controversies, primarily issues related to the US-Mexican border, but it's not set in an inherently politicised _milieu_ the way the previous films have. And this ties into a crucial point \u2013 in moving out of the arena of politics, the storyline is more personal, which is important insofar as Rambo himself is presented somewhat differently this time, showing more emotion than we've seen from him since the opening few scenes of _First Blood_ (which Stallone has rightly pointed to as the last time we saw a vulnerable, very much human Rambo). This aspect of the film, in and of itself, is pretty fascinating, as it's also the only time since _First Blood_ where his PTSD has been so front-and-centre, as that element of his character was downplayed to the point of being virtually forgotten in the other three films. Here, not only is Rambo shown as still suffering the effects, he actually leans into it, using his trauma to motivate himself, essentially getting himself back into a Vi\u1ec7t Nam mindset, which is a pretty interesting way of presenting a character who has been rendered in simpler and simpler terms as the films have gone on. In this sense, the early parts of the film work extremely well from a psychological point of view \u2013 we see Rambo in a home, we see him trying to keep his demons at bay, we see him, for arguably the first time, with something to lose.\r\n\r\nHowever, for better or worse, the film's big selling point isn't the political allegory or the character's psychology \u2013 it's the action, the \"suit-up\" moment when Rambo unleashes hell. Here, the entire third-act is one long action scene, and it's entertaining enough to temper some of the political immaturity and distasteful stereotypes that lead up to it. Luring the Martinez cartel back to Arizona, Rambo hides out in a series of tunnels under the ranch, stalking and dispatching them one by one with simple, but vicious, man-made traps, in a scene that partly recalls his forest pursuit of Teasel and his men early in _First Blood_.\r\n\r\nWell shot by director Grunberg and cinematographer Brendan Galvin (_Veronica Guerin_; _Immortals_; _Self\/less_), it's kind of the inverse of the sleek action scenes found in the _John Wick_ films - it's dark, gritty, and brutal, and whereas those films often create the impression of near weightlessness, here, it's the tangible physicality that works so well, the sense of visceral devastation that results from a particular impact rather than anything balletic. Editors Carsten Kurpanek (_Kickboxer: Vengeance_) and Todd E. Miller (_The Expendables 2_; _The Purge: Election Year_; _Mechanic: Resurrection_) also do terrific work here. Large portions of the scene take place in reasonably poorly lit underground tunnels, with very little to distinguish one location from another, so the fact that the grammar of the combat is so well maintained is a credit to them \u2013 you always know roughly where you are at any given moment, and never once did I find myself losing consciousness because of a flurry of incoherent edits (another problem with the _Taken_ films).\r\n\r\nOf course, a vital aspect of any Rambo movie is that a lot of what some people love will be the exact things that others despise. In this case, it's the laughably simplistic politics, the barely disguised xenophobia, the brutal violence, and the fetishisation of weaponry. On this last point, I can't recall, off the top of my head, another film which is so blatant in its glorification of guns, whether it's the long tracking shots of Rambo's collection of rifles, or the way the film lingers on the destruction they mete out. In short, this is the NRA's wet dream \u2013 an all-American hero dispensing biblical assault rifle-based vengeance on a bunch of greasy Mexican scumbags. Charlton Heston would be proud, bigly (yeah, I know, I'm mixing my right-wing references). \r\n\r\nThe film's handling of the Mexican portion of the story is also a good example of how you either decry the stupidity or celebrate the ridiculousness. The character of Gazelle, for example, dresses like the only research the costume department did was to watch Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez's _Stand and Deliver_ (1988) \u2013 she literally wears pleated khakis, a chequered blue and white shirt, dark lip-liner, and a bandana tied at the front. Similarly, poor Gabriela gets abducted after one night (count 'em, ONE night) in Mexico, where, apart from Carmen, every single character we meet is either in the cartel, involved in prostitution, or, in a lot of cases, both. And as for the aforementioned porousness of the border, I'm not sure if it's appallingly lazy writing or satirical genius, but Rambo (who at this point is carrying some questionable items) gets back into the US by simply finding a quiet section and ploughing his truck through the wire mesh fence (ignoring a sign warning against illegal crossings, because Rambo spits at signage). He wouldn't have been able to do that if there'd been a wall.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a criticism that I would treat a little more seriously is that although this is supposed to be the last chapter in the franchise, the script doesn't have any sense of finality. Nothing happens at any point where you could say to yourself, \"that seems a fitting send-off for the character\". From the generic and mainly faceless villains to the rote dialogue to the poorly constructed narrative beats, never at any point did this feel like a culmination. In fact, the previous film felt more final than this one does, as at least that one gave the character a degree of closure. And speaking of the script, much as _Rocky IV_ was two boxing matches loosely tied together by montages (including a montage in which Rocky thinks about montages), _Last Blood_ is 40 minutes of plot loosely connected to an extended action scene via, you guessed it, a series of montages.\r\n\r\nFinally, it would be remiss of me not to mention David Morrell's opinion on the film. At one point, Morrell was actually working on a script for the film with Stallone, which he said gave Rambo a \"_soulful journey_\", and featured a \"_really emotional, powerful story_\". However, their draft was rejected in favour of an earlier idea which saw Rambo head to Mexico to rescue a young girl. Upon seeing the completed film, Morrell was far from impressed, writing on Twitter, \"_the film is a mess. Embarrassed to have my name associated with it_\", and later telling _Newsweek_,\r\n\r\n>_I felt degraded and dehumanised after I left the theatre. Instead of being soulful, this new movie lacks one. I felt I was less a human being for having seen it, and today that's an unfortunate message._\r\n\r\nMake of that what you will.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, _Last Blood_ is a hilariously bad film. But it's also a hugely entertaining film. And sure, it continues a process which has seen a character who was once a representative for the nation's wounded psyche and just how dehumanising war can be, transition into an unstoppable jingoistic war machine. And sure, the violence is off the chart. And sure, the politics are hilariously na\u00efve at best, dangerously reductionist at worse, with Rambo coming to embody some of the current administration's most racist ideological arguments. But it's extremely well shot, Stallone gives a predictably strong performance, the action is intense, and, for me, none of the problems are so large as to render the film unenjoyable. Approach it with the right frame of mind, and you'll find much to appreciate.","id":"5d9dffcf3d4d96003782c94e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d9dffcf3d4d96003782c94e","movie_id":522938}

{"author":"BlairArmstrong","content":"With no reviews, I could only use the preview to decide if I wanted to rent or buy this. I had a good gut feeling so I bought it. I knew 5 minutes into the film that I made the right choice. First, the acting on ALL characters was top notch. The story felt real and more like actual life situations instead of obvious fiction, where you have an unrealistic story. \r\n\r\nThe vehemently hostile relationship with the mother only made sense from his failures to protect or love her son. The mother's disclosure to her son of his similarly painful childhood helped the son to understand she did the best she could due to her pain and broken soul. The older brother's and care giver's role helped to facilitate healing. The relationship between the gay and straight brother was unexpected and truly beautiful.\r\n\r\nThere were some weaknesses in the storyline and editing, but I gave this a 5 instead of a 4 because of the exceptional strong parts of this film. Lastly, the film teaches us that what is seen is not always what is true and that healing and forgive is never too late, even if the wounds seem unforgivable. As much as we fight it, there is an instinctual bond in families. For the $6 difference, buy this instead of renting it.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Neo-Noir fans can find much to admire, and much to be angry with here.\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing, Wetlands has only two amateur reviews on the IMDb site, something which on first glance paints a damning picture. Yet purveyors of film noir and its kindred spirits should at the least take a look at this grim portrayal of lost souls functioning in Atlantic City all while  a devilish storm heads towards them. \r\n\r\nPlot is by the numbers from the noir 101 playbook. Police officer (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) is a recovering addict who battles his past demons whilst trying to save his loved ones from unlawful scumbags. And that's pretty much it, the impending storm is a sort of metaphor for the turmoil going on in the lives of everyone involved in the story. The script is hardly high quality either, and anyone looking for an emotional investment in the characters will eventually start throwing objects at the screen. Yet rewards are here for fans of the noir form.\r\n\r\nCharacterisations are pungent with a bleakness that holds court. Corruption, sexual kinks, addictions, infidelity, dark deeds, bohemian excess, sexual blackmail, and on it goes. That these black thunders jostle with our chief protagonist's honourable intentions makes for compelling viewing for those in the frame of mind for genre bulldozing. \r\n\r\nThen there's Barry Markowitz' cinematography. The film is big on atmosphere as opposed to physical action, and Markowitz' photography is a key player. If it's not turning down the filters for grim texture, it's offering up pronounced primaries for a magnetic beauty that offers up hope in what seems to be a forlorn venture, very haunting in its beauty. Great work in a strong decade for neo-noir photography.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's not a very good film by any stretch of the imagination, the performances are very uneven, and as the script and plotting screams for better thought, the resolution also comes off as rushed and unfulfilling. But it's no dead loss, and enough here for noir heads to savour. 6.5\/10","id":"5b82993f0e0a2645960251ef","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b82993f0e0a2645960251ef","movie_id":474170}

{"author":"Lenny\/Mosko","content":"Without a doubt, cinematically this is a visual tour de force. The one-shot approach becomes a distraction, at times, especially when one ponders \"how did they do that?\", but generally not enough to take away the wow factor.\r\n\r\nThe story, and dialogue, not to mention logic are the real problems that take this movie from great, to merely good.\r\n\r\nThe initial concept of sending two men on an imperitive mission to save 1600 men is ludicrous in itself, especially in a war where men were gassed and gunned down by the thousands. Sending only two of them into unknown situations, in no-man's-land was illogical.\r\n\r\nThen there was the fact the hero seems to never get shot by enemy soldiers, despite being in dead-duck situations. When he does get injured, his wounds seem to magically heal and disappear instantly. Director Sam Mendes must have never had the concussive effects of explosions explained to him, because while some fall from explosions, the heroes seem immune to physics.\r\n\r\nThe most ludicrous scene involves booby-trapped explosives, and a collapsed ton of rocks leaving not only no visible injuries, but no effects at all on clothing or hearing. But there was dust in the eyes.\r\n\r\nThere are many more scenes involving lack of logic, or credibility. \r\n\r\nOver-all, the movie is worth it for the cinematography, attention to detail, costumes and acting, but the trite story, and credibilty problems drag it down from what it should, and could have been.","id":"5e1e99815c071b0013630cce","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e1e99815c071b0013630cce","movie_id":530915}
{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps:\/\/www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nLet me just take a deep breath... Wait, one more... Uff, I have no idea how I survived this IMAX screening of 1917. Usually, I don't delve deep into technical stuff since most people don't know or don't care about these attributes, but it's impossible not to address Roger Deakins' cinematography. It's not the first time a film has been edited to appear as \"one shot\" (a continuous take), but it never fails to impress me.\r\n\r\nAlejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's Birdman, Silent House starring Elizabeth Olsen, or the famous Rope from the one and only Alfred Hitchcock... all produce the same trick. Even Mr. Robot and The Haunting of Hill House have brought us two phenomenal \"one shot\" episodes, edited as well with the so-called \"stitches,\" meaning that the actual cuts are made to look invisible to the viewer, hence giving that feeling that it's all just one continuous take. Cuts are often applied when a random character is passing in front of the camera; when the latter \"pans\" (movement similar to a head-turn) over a wall or an object that occupies the whole screen; or when the characters are simply going through a dark area.\r\n\r\nSam Mendes, Roger Deakins, and Lee Smith (editor) all work together to deliver the most immersive war movie (probably) ever. Yes, it has a simple premise, and the main narrative is basic, but the remarkable technical achievement elevates this film so freaking much. Even if you don't know the slightest thing about filmmaking or how movies are made, it's impossible to watch this film and not think \"something feels different about this one.\" This is a movie meant to be watched at the biggest, best screen possible. Watching 1917 at home on a TV or a laptop is not going to work at all.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole runtime, I felt like I was there with Schofield and Blake. It feels like we are a third soldier going with them on a vital mission to save thousands of lives. I believe 1917 is the best \"one shot\" film to date (I've been using the quote signs for a reason, don't mistake it for an actual one shot movie), with Birdman as a close second. If the latter deals with a lot more dialogue and acting, the former has dozens of nail-biting sequences featuring shootouts, explosions, and a lot of running\/walking\/swimming through mud, dead corpses, blood, and way too many nasty rats.\r\n\r\nI really have no words to describe Roger Deakins' cinematography. It's not merely a film, it's a whole experience. It's not just another cool technical achievement. It's the entire foundation of 1917, and the main reason why so many people are rushing to the theater. However, a lot of people are completely ignoring Lee Smith's work. Don't forget, this isn't an actual one shot movie. If it's been edited to look like one continuous take, and if it actually does appear to be a single take, then the editor should get as much recognition as everyone else. Yes, he doesn't have to work with thousands of cuts (I counted 14, but I'm sure there's more), but they still exist, and he has to make sure no one feels them. And he did so perfectly.\r\n\r\nMy last paragraph concerning the technical aspects has to go to Sam Mendes and Thomas Newman. As the director, Mendes is able to deliver precisely what he envisioned and seamlessly coordinate his actors. Not only has he directed my favorite Bond film (Skyfall), but he also offers one of my favorite war movies of all-time. As for Newman, I just wish that Joker had been released in another year because 1917's score is fantastic. Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir is likely taking the Oscar for Best Original Score, but if Thomas Newman takes it, I'll still be delighted.\r\n\r\nA lot of comparisons are being made with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk. They're similar films regarding the fact that their main goal is to provide the most immersive war experience. Story and character-wise, both movies don't really develop that much. Nolan's film is loved by most critics and audiences all around the world, but one common complaint about it is the lack of character building. I didn't mind that at all because the movie never actually tried to make their characters important. They were just soldiers caught in the worst of situations, similar to 1917. However, I do think the latter does a better job of making us care for the protagonists.\r\n\r\nGeorge MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman's characters have small arcs, but they exist. In the beginning, Blake is the emotional-driven character, while Schofield seems to be the rational one. We, as the audience, care about the mission first, but as time goes by, we learn about their personal traits and motivations. By the end of the film, I was crying. Both play off of each other really well, but it's their dialogue that impresses me the most. What seems to be just a random talk while strolling through an open field of grass, it truly isn't. If it's not meaningful at the time, it's going to be. The acting is more physical than anything, and both deliver outstanding performances.\r\n\r\nI would say I love 1917 as much as I love Dunkirk. I might be tempted to choose the former due to the \"recency effect,\" but there's one small aspect that negatively affects both. Their replay value is not as high as other films since their technical achievements don't work as well on a regular TV in the comfort of our own home. You will never feel or understand that \"immersive experience\" that everyone talks about. You won't know what made people to be blown away. You won't love it as much as everyone else. So, please, do NOT miss 1917 in theaters!\r\n\r\nSam Mendes, Roger Deakins, and Lee Smith. Director, director of photography, editor. Three key filmmaking roles in the creation of one of the best WWI movies of all-time. Edited to look like one continuous shot, 1917 is a mind-blowing technical achievement, elevated by Deakins' always jaw-dropping cinematography, Thomas Newman emotionally powerful score, Mendes impeccable directing, and Smith's seamless editing. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman deliver outstanding (physical) performances, but it's the astonishing filmmaking that steals the spotlight. Production design, costume design, sound, you name it. Everything is absolutely perfect. It's meant to be seen at the biggest screen near you since this is an incredibly immersive experience that you won't get at home. It's going straight into my Top10: Best Movies of 2019, and I hope you'll love it as much as I do.\r\n\r\nRating: A","id":"5e2c813e1685da0011e6f0bf","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2c813e1685da0011e6f0bf","movie_id":530915}
{"author":"Luis_989","content":"Finally yesterday I was able to experience 1917 and I ended up doing it at IMAX, something I didn't plan on, but after seeing it there, I can say this film deserves to be seen and heard in an IMAX room to remember why movies still need to be lived on a big screen.\r\n\r\nThe visual odyssey of Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins is an incredible journey. Yes, the story is very thin but that's something that made 1917 a somewhat different film\r\nIt's not a war epic, nor does it try to be one. It's kind of a lone wolf war story, though at the beginning it wasn't like that, and that's good because despite everything that happens, the film doesn't lose that sense of camaraderie at the task that remains after the loss.\r\n\r\n1917 is a story of survival and that although it could not be considered completely original, that's totally the least of its problems because after all the experience is just spectacular.\r\n\r\nI admit the film has certain rhythm dropouts that I didn't like, especially the scene where Schofield loses consciousness, but at that point we are given the extraordinary night sequence, so my discomfort ended up disappearing.\r\n\r\n1917 is not a perfect film, but it's a reminder of how wonderful is to enjoy a film as they should be, even if it's a film that deals with the horrors of war.\r\n\r\nThis is the kind of film that should be lived and experienced that way, otherwise it loses its resonance, so if you have the chance to see 1917 at a big screen do it.","id":"5e2371c4eb09320016f817b6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2371c4eb09320016f817b6","movie_id":530915}

{"author":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","content":"When it comes to impressive achievements in filmmaking, \u201c1917\u201d deserves to be near the top of the conversation. This war film, which unfolds in two hours of real time, is shot to appear as one continuous take. Thankfully, it is so much more than just a technical gimmick. The showiness eases up as the emotional weight of the story unfolds, but it\u2019s still hard not to get stuck on the challenges and manner of the moviemaking rather than the characters that should be the focal point of the film.\r\n\r\nSet during the First World War, the story follows Schofield (George MacKay) and Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman), two young British soldiers who are given a seemingly impossible mission: deliver a message across hostile territory to the front lines. In a race against time, these men must deliver the information within a couple of hours if they want to stop 1,600 men, and one of the soldiers\u2019 brothers, from walking straight into a deadly trap.\r\n\r\nThe plot is thin, and the characters even more so. Instead of learning more about Schofield and Blake, the showy filmmaking technique commands the spotlight over learning more interesting aspects of these soldiers. It\u2019s more of an experiment in \u201clook what I can do!\u201d rather than compelling storytelling. The camera becomes more of a character than the actual characters.\r\n\r\nDoes this matter? Not really. Roger Deakins is a master cinematographer, and his technique here creates a fully immersive experience. Paired with director Sam Mendes, the two capture the trench warfare of WWI with clever camerawork that not only gives a real sense of the distance these men had to travel, but makes you feel trapped alongside them as fellow soldiers sharing the same journey. The intimate style of camerawork makes you feel as if you are right there in the trenches, on the battlefield, with these two young men. Since the film is made to feel like it was shot in real time, it becomes a psychological wartime thriller as time begins to run out.\r\n\r\n\u201c1917\u201d is a large scale spectacle that often overshadows its small scale story, but there\u2019s no disputing that it is a grand achievement in filmmaking.","id":"5e7d575c6c74b95757cb3d01","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e7d575c6c74b95757cb3d01","movie_id":530915}
{"author":"narrator56","content":"I see that a lot is made of the technique they use to film this movie in one continuous shot, and it is very interesting, but I must confess I am not a student of film, merely a viewer. So you will find no critiques of the director or editor or that sort of technical detail. I like what I like.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I enjoyed this movie more than I expected I would. I am not big on war movies. The scenery seemed great to me, and though there were visually stunning scenes, they didn't try to pile on explosion after explosion to cater to that crowd. The two leads were at the same time heroes and regular guys. I could almost picture myself in their position. Moments of extreme courage and bravery under fire were balanced by totally justified panic and fear. There were also quieter moments here and there, breaks from the sometimes hard to bear tension. Finally, there was a plot twist that seems normal looking back at it, but it shocked me at the time. I will leave it at that and not risk giving anything away.\r\n\r\nSo while I probably won't watch it again anytime soon, I do recommend it, even to viewers like me, who aren't big on war movies. As a side note, one viewer warned others NOT to compare this movie to Saving Private Ryan. I guess he thought it doesn't compare with it. Maybe I should give that movie a second look.","id":"5e85da1398f1f10016aafb61","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e85da1398f1f10016aafb61","movie_id":530915}

{"author":"The Peruvian Post","content":"\"Director Sam Mendes employs distinctive but extraordinary shots in the first person during the two-hour footage, which makes the production work in many different ways. Although it sometimes results too shaky, it is thanks to George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman's performances that 1917 preserves both sombre but optimistic tones throughout the montage. In short, this is an exceptional approach to memorialise the hundredth anniversary of the end of the First World War\".\r\n\r\nWe are somewhere in France during the Trench Warfare [1915 - 1917] with a depleted British Army; the atmosphere, alongside with the dialogues, can define by itself how was life at the front: scarce water and food, despair between soldiers to go home, endless weapons and corpses scattered on the floor, and so forth. Corporals Blake and Schofield are told to attain a severe\/impossible mission despite not having any reinforcements. Before achieving this goal in sending General MacKenzie [Bennedict Cumberbatch] the infamous fallback letter, both privates must penetrate the frightful No Man's Land and experience horrendous life-and-death encounters in many places. \r\n\r\nRegardless of the silent second half, the absence of preeminent performers and the woozy experience of watching the film in one sole perspective director Sam Mendes and executive producers deliver an eloquent portrayal about surprising facts of the four-year global conflict. For example, both soldiers are bewildered by the superiority of the German trenches in proportions and in quality considering that historically they were far better equipped than the Allied ones which allow the audience the opportunity of a lifetime to analyse the condition millions of innocent citizens were facing. The result improves with some accurate shots at landscapes, underground warfare channels, entire villages pulverised, etcetera. I must acknowledge the last fifteen minutes of the film; it has been a long time since I spotted such an imposing ending. Countless emotions appear regardless of having reached the climax. What a masterpiece ladies and gentlemen!\r\n\r\nWhat amazes me the most is that despite being a World War film, 1917 does not give the impression in duplicating the ordinary details of previous same-genre releases such as Hacksaw Ridge [2017]. Once Mr Gibson introduced a brief biography of Desmond Doss [the main character] he began recording some ultraviolent scenes as though you were spotting the most savage state of humankind. As an alternative, 1917 delivers some innovative procedures in creating a war film without increasing the brutal strength of instant classics as Saving Private Ryan. \r\n\r\nCongratulations!\r\n\r\n[80\/100]","id":"5e4cb88a9b8616001167d037","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e4cb88a9b8616001167d037","movie_id":530915}

Campbell was with the 9th Battalion of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, 48th Brigade, 16th (Irish) Division and took part in the capture of Ginchy on September 9, 1916 during the Battle of the Somme. My dad was born in 1933, and in all the years that came afterwards \u2013 even when he himself joined the RAF \u2013 his father never spoke about those years.\r\n\r\nThe Great War broke men in ways the likes of which had never been seen before, and perhaps have never been seen since. It exposed men to psychological horrors inconceivable to most people today. The nature of trench warfare and the concomitant use of artillery on a scale beyond anything in human history did such things to men's minds that even thousands of those who returned never really left the battlefields. We've all seen \"Shell shocked soldier, 1916\", one of the most haunting photographs ever taken, and the picture it paints is a disturbingly vivid one. But what makes the Great War, the so-called \"war to end all wars\", so much worse than it had to be was that it pitted old school tactics against modern weaponry. Generals on both sides believed the war could be won, as others had been, by sending wave after wave of men \"over the top\" in an attempt to overwhelm enemy positions. However, such tactics failed to take into account advancements in weaponry, with combatants defending their trenches with miles of machine-gun emplacements and fields of landmines, reinforced with the war's most successful killer \u2013 endless artillery barrages. The technology had advanced. The tactics had not. Which led to the nine-month stalemate of the Battle of Verdun (February 21 to December 18, 1916), during which the Germans lost 143,000 men and the French lost 163,000. Which led to the first day of the Somme (July 1, 1916), when the British suffered nearly 20,000 loses in less than 12 hours. Which led to the unimaginable slaughter of the hell-come-to-Earth that was the Third Battle of Ypres, better known today as Passchendaele (July 31 to November 10, 1917), where at least 400,000 men died, maybe as many as twice that.\r\n\r\nEvery soul who fought in those battles is gone now. The last surviving combat veteran, Chief Petty Officer Claude Choules, who joined the Royal Navy in 1915, aged just 14, died at the age of 110 in 2011. And unlike conflicts such as World War II or Vietnam, The Great War has largely dropped from the popular consciousness. Not just the reasons why it was fought, but the conditions in which it was fought. Even celebrated films such as Lewis Milestone's _All Quiet on the Western Front_ (1930) or Stanley Kubrick's _Paths of Glory_ (1957) aren't all that well known. And that's one of the reasons that films like 1917 are important \u2013 they ensure we don't forget.\r\n\r\nWritten by Sam Mendes and Krysty Wilson-Cairns, _1917_ is very loosely based on stories told to Mendes by his grandfather Alfred Hubert Mendes, who was a front line messenger during the war, and who, at 5'4\", was able to use the low-lying No Man's Land mist as cover without having to stoop or crawl, and thus was much faster compared to other messengers. The film is directed by Mendes (_American Beauty_; _Revolutionary Road_; _Skyfall_), and unless you've been living under a rock, you'll know that it's done in such a way as to give the impression that it all takes place in two single shots (the marketing material says one shot, but it's two \u2013 there's a cut-to-black time-jump about midway through the film where no attempt is made to hide the transition). In reality, of course, there are a lot more than two shots (the longest single shot was just over 8 minutes), but the edits have been digitally 'hidden', much like Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's _Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)_ (2014) or Erik Poppe's _Ut\u00f8ya 22. Juli_ (2018). Working with legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins (_Kundun_; _No Country for Old Men_; _The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford_; _The Reader_; _Blade Runner 2049_), Mendes wanted the film to be the most immersive war movie ever put on screen, with the story designed to take place in real-time so as to ensure the importance\/relevance of the single-shot aesthetic. And although I have some issues with it, and I certainly don't think it's the greatest war movie ever made, by and large, I think Mendes has made an exceptional film, one in which form and content are unusually tightly matched, with the style extremely effective at delivering the story in a thematically justified manner.\r\n\r\nApril 6, 1917; the Western Front. Two young British Lance Corporals, Will Schofield (George MacKay), a veteran of the Somme, and the younger, more idealistic Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) are summoned to a meeting with General Erinmore (Colin Firth). Recently, German forces have fallen back, and Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) of the 2nd Battalion, Devonshire Regiment believes that if he attacks now, he will break the line and turn the tide of the war. However, he's unaware that the retreat is a tactical gambit \u2013 the Germans have fallen back to the heavily fortified Hindenburg Line and are lying in wait. With communication lines cut, Schofield and Blake, who has a brother in the 2nd, are given a simple but dangerous mission \u2013 to physically carry an order from Erinmore to Mackenzie calling off the following morning's attack, a mission which will involve them crossing into No Man's Land and traversing the Germans' former position. If they fail, 1,600 soldiers will be slaughtered. Mackenzie is six miles away. They have ten hours.\r\n\r\nSo, the film's big selling point is its aesthetic design. The use of the single-shot format is such a noticeable and idiosyncratic type of form that whenever it's used, it automatically places pressure on the content, which must justify why the film is shot this way, why it would lose something inherently thematic if shot conventionally. If the content can't do that, in other words, if the content can't justify the form, the form becomes gimmicky, drawing attention to itself. Think of, for example, Alfred Hitchcock's _Rope_ (1948), which was edited to look like one shot, or Sebastian Schipper's _Victoria_ (2015), which was legitimately one shot. Very little in either film justifies the stylistic design \u2013 shoot them conventionally and they're still broadly the same film thematically. Compare this with genuine one-shot films such as Mike Figgis's _Timecode_ (2000) or Alexander Sokurov's _Russkij Kovcheg_ (2002), and edited one-shot films such as Gustavo Hern\u00e1ndez's _La casa muda_ (2010) or the aforementioned _Ut\u00f8ya 22. Juli_. Whether it's the spiralling nature of events in _Timecode_, the elegant cause-and-effect historical sweep of _Russkij Kovcheg_, or the real-time pressure and escalation of _La casa muda_ and _Ut\u00f8ya 22. Juli_ these films tie form to content in such a way that they become indistinguishable \u2013 form _is_ content, content _is_ form. And I think Mendes achieves like synergy.\r\n\r\nIs the one-shot effect distracting? At first, yes, it is a little, especially if you're playing the game of trying to spot where editor Lee Smith (_Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World_; _Elysium_; _Interstellar_) has hidden the transitions. But after sussing two edits in the first twenty minutes, I stopped looking, because I realised I was just pulling myself out of the film unnecessarily. In essence, once you go with the aesthetic on its own terms, you forget about trying to spot the edits and asking yourself, \"_how did they do that_\", instead of letting the cinematography do exactly what it's supposed to do \u2013 immerse you. This is a film that wants to try to convey what it was like to live and fight in those trenches, with Mendes stating, \"_I wanted people to understand how difficult it was for these men. And the nature of that is behind everything_\". And, it does about as good a job as any war film I can think of in evoking the psychical reality, if not necessarily the psychological (more on that in a moment).\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the majority of the film is shot in one of two ways \u2013 either the camera is behind Schofield and Blake, following their path, or it's in front of them, facing back towards them as they 'follow' its path. There are some minor deviations from this (a few drone shots, some side-on footage etc), but irrespective of that, the film never for one second leaves their presence. And because the two men are almost perpetually in motion, it means that the camera is almost perpetually in motion, lending not only a tremendous fluidity to the blocking, framing, and movement, but so too a natural motivation \u2013 if they're walking along a trench, we're walking along a trench; if they're moving stealthily through a bombed-out town, we're moving stealthily through a bombed-out town. Almost everything the camera does is because one or both of the protagonists are doing the same thing, further emphasising the correlation between form and content.\r\n\r\nThe opening scene serves as a superb introduction not just to the visual design, but to the reasons for employing that visual design and the effectiveness of doing so. The film starts with a shot of a daffodil field, before pulling back and revealing Schofield and Blake taking a break against a tree before being summoned to the meeting with Erinmore. They rouse themselves and begin walking, first past more resting soldiers, then a camp where food and laundry are being prepared, then down a ramp into the trenches, the bucolic opening moments giving way to barbed wire and dirt. Geographically, it's a short walk, but thematically, it covers considerable ground. In a film that's all about scale and scope, this sequence perfectly encapsulates one of the main thematic reasons behind the single-shot \u2013 to accurately convey the importance of geospatial relations. We see the tactile transition from Edenic to hellish because we're moving in real-time through the _milieu_ with the characters; we see the boundary between peace and war because the characters walk along that boundary. You shoot this opening sequence conventionally, and you undercut this sense considerably.\r\n\r\nAlong slightly more conventional lines, one also has to commend the work of production designer Dennis Gassner (_Bugsy_; _Waterworld_; _Into the Woods_). Every location is visually unique \u2013 from a German bunker to an abandoned farmhouse to the bombed-out remnants of \u00c9coust-Saint-Mein, and every location feels authentic and lived in. His design of No Man's Land is especially laudable, not just in terms of the expected mess of barbed wire and debris, but in the use and positioning of dead bodies, dead animals, and semi-destroyed machinery, with the whole thing having an almost post-nuclear desolation feel. Indeed, the film's No Man's Land is designed thematically. Mendes has said, \"_the first World War starts with literally horses and carriages, and ends with tanks_\", and this is mirrored in Gassner's designs. When the men first crawl into No Man's Land, they immediately encounter a rotting fly-covered horse carcass. Gradually, however, the battlefield becomes more mechanised, until they eventually pass through a German artillery position.\r\n\r\nAlso in a slightly more conventional sense, one has to mention Deakins work during the nighttime scenes in \u00c9coust-Saint-Mein. The entire village has been reduced to nothing but the shells of buildings, and as we pass through the town, the only source of light is from the flares arching through the sky, which create very hard shadows in constant motion. The whole thing is almost otherworldly, and as the garish light traverses the sky, it's as if the ground itself is in motion, almost liquid-like, with the protagonists desperately trying to time their movements to ensure they stay hidden in the constantly shifting shadows. It might be a little too aesthetically beautiful for a film aiming for such gritty realism, but for aspiring cinematographers, you won't find a better study in how to compose an image using light and shadow.\r\n\r\nThematically, by its very nature, _1917_ is far more focused on the micro than the macro \u2013 you might learn something about life on the front, but you'll learn nothing about the politics behind the conflict, or even a sense of who's winning. Partly because of this, the film avoids, for the most part, the overwrought patriotism found in so many American World War II movies, the kind of cartoonish jingoism that made Steven Spielberg's _Saving Private Ryan_ (1998) so obnoxious. Indeed, it's relatively unimportant which side the protagonists are even on \u2013 their mission could have come from any of the combatants. Their nationality is largely anonymous, which is not something you can usually say of a war film, but which does illustrate just how irrelevant lofty political issues were at ground level, with everyone simply trying to survive as best they can.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, however, because the film is so tightly focused, you shouldn't expect too much psychological insight. If you're anticipating an existential treatise along the lines of Terrence Malick's _The Thin Red Line_ (1998), you'll be severely disappointed. Malick's masterpiece is, for my money, the greatest war picture ever made precisely because it subverts at every moment what a war picture is supposed to be. It's about the war within rather than the war without, about nature's indifference to humanity's self-destruction, about the damage war does not to the mind or the body, but the soul. _1917_ is nowhere near this kind of thematic complexity, it's not even playing the same game, but I would value its simple individualised insights above something like the empty temporal trickery of Christopher Nolan's _Dunkirk_ (2017), which leans far too heavily into the \"keep a stiff upper lip chaps\" style of British filmmaking for my liking.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems. I've seen some critics argue that the one-shot structure is a gimmick which draws attention to itself, and thus, rather than being immersive actually has the opposite effect. I admit that the film does take a little getting used to, but you soon settle into its rhythms (or lack thereof). I would agree that the story is paper-thin, but that's pretty much by design. One criticism I did have, however, is how well-groomed Scholfield and Blake constantly are, each with a perfect set of teeth. One only need watch Peter Jackson's _They Shall Not Grow Old_ (2018) to see how unrealistic this is. Indeed, for most of the runtime, the duo look like they've just stepped out of the makeup trailer, and it's glaring enough on a couple of occasions to pull you out of things.\r\n\r\nAll things considered though, I thoroughly enjoyed _1917_. I thought the single-shot strategy worked exceptionally well, and even if the film is weak from a character\/storyline\/theme perspective, it didn't really matter when the form and content are this well matched. This could have become an empty technical exercise predicated on nothing, but Mendes hasn't allowed that to happen, and instead, it's a war film that does justice to its subject. The more one knows about the Great War, the more one realises that it was hell on Earth. _1917_ doesn't make us feel what that hell was like. Because no film, no art form, can do that. But it's a damn good approximation.","id":"5e28f6959638640019ab1d5b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e28f6959638640019ab1d5b","movie_id":530915}
{"author":"narrator56","content":"Queen & Slim was entertaining overall, and its social messaging that might have turned off viewers of a certain political world view worked for me. It will not make my greatest movie list, but it held my interest. Not because of its theme or message so much, but more for the character depth and development. I liked how the two main characters don't really even like each other (well, her at least) at first but began to grow on each other. Also, except for the fat cop and e dude near the end with the money, there didn't seem to be any two-dimensional characters.

I am not good to live._\r\n\r\n- Algernon Charles Swinburne; \"Ph\u00e6dra\" (1866)\r\n\r\nI was lucky enough to get tickets for the _Dronningen_ [_Queen of Hearts_] screening at DIFF, where the film was introduced by lead actress Trine Dyrholm. When she returned for a post-screening interview and to receive the 2020 Volta Award, she apologised that she'd been enjoying a nice dinner whilst we'd been watching the movie. And an apology was welcome, not because _Dronningen_ is a bad film, but because it's an exceptionally difficult film \u2013 like Adrian Lyne at his most sensationalist, but with all the commercialism stripped out and the morality kept fuzzy. Examining the destructive power of forbidden desire and how sexual abuse can masquerade as consensual seduction, it's a film wherein our protagonist becomes our antagonist, where her initial self-confidence transforms into heartless manipulation, where our emotional centre shifts multiple times, where our own morality is examined, where our sympathies are used against us as we're pushed to condone something abhorrent. A psychologically fascinating and morally complex film, in the age of #MeToo, _Dronningen_ dares to remind us that women can be the perpetrators of abuse just as men can be its victims.\r\n\r\nAnne (Dyrholm) and her husband Peter (Magnus Krepper) are an affluent middle-class couple living with their two young daughters on the edge of a forest just outside Copenhagen. Anne is a partner at a law firm and specialises in defending victims of sexual assault and domestic violence, whilst Peter is a top surgeon. Their life is uneventful but happy, and although their jobs mean they don't see a lot of one another, they both seem content. Things change, however, when Gustav (Gustav Lindh), Peter's recalcitrant teenage son from his first marriage, arrives to stay with them, having been expelled from his Swedish school. His mother is having problems keeping him on the straight and narrow and hopes that time spent with Peter will set him right. Although initially, Anne is far from enthused about his sullen presence, when she acquires some unexpected leverage, she uses it to force him to improve his behaviour. This creates something of a bond between the two, and as time passes, he awakens something in her, and she seduces him, with the duo subsequently embarking on a dangerous affair which could potentially destroy all three of them.\r\n\r\nWritten by May el-Toukhy and Maren Louise K\u00e4ehne and directed by el-Toukhy, _Dronningen_ initially walks a very well-trodden genre path \u2013 an unexpected attraction turns to rampant lust and becomes as destructive as it is passionate. We've been here many, many times before \u2013 films such as Lyne's _Fatal Attraction_ (1987) and _Unfaithful_ (2002), Alan Shapiro's _The Crush_ (1993), and Andrew Davis's _A Perfect Murder_ (1998), as well as literature such as Ford Madox Ford's _The Good Soldier_ (1915) and Vladimir Nabokov's _Lolita_ (1955). What's so brilliant about _Dronningen_, however, is the direction taken not only by the story, but by Anne herself. El-Toukhy uses the genre template as nothing more than a frame onto which to graft her real concerns. For example, she initially depicts Anne and Gustav's relationship in generic terms as a story of sexual (re)awakening, before abandoning genre beats and revealing a story of abuse camouflaged as a consensual affair.\r\n\r\nMuch of the film's strength lies in how the audience is initially encouraged to empathise with Anne before having the rug pulled out from under us and our own morality called into question \u2013 how could we ever have identified with this woman? It's easy enough when you consider that she's the emotional centre of the film for the first two acts, she's also the narrative focaliser, and she's introduced as brave, driven, and confident, someone who's appalled not only at the abuse her clients have suffered, but so too at a system which could potentially find them to be in the wrong (after she loses one particular case, she abandons decorum and legality, and approaches the perpetrator in a parking lot to tell him exactly what she thinks of him). Once the affair begins, although the audience is shocked at what Anne is doing, el-Toukhy depicts things in such a way that we revel in the sense of erotic freedom, savouring Anne's sexual awakening almost as much as she does herself (the first time we see her smile in the film is during a scene where Gustav coaxes her to join him and her daughters in a lake). It's not until she's faced with the possibility of the affair being revealed that we see who Anne truly is \u2013 a heartless and cruel exploiter, incapable of seeing her own immorality even as she lectures others for their behaviour, incapable of seeing that she is perpetrating a similar kind of abuse as that suffered by her clients. That we initially identified with such a woman speaks volumes about el-Toukhy's mastery of tone.\r\n\r\nAnother important element is the gender paradigm. As mentioned, we're initially encouraged to empathise with Anne and approve of what she's doing. After all, she's a hardworking, decent woman whose marriage has lost its spark, so who could deny her a little bit of illicit fun? But would we think the same were the genders reversed \u2013 how would we react to the story of a fortysomething man seducing a 19-year-old girl? With this in mind, el-Toukhy interrogates our morality, by 'tricking' us into condoning Anne's actions and later asking how we could ever have done so \u2013 gender, she suggests, is irrelevant in cases of abuse, and the fact that we give a woman a pass to behave in this manner when we would crucify a man for doing the same thing is part of the film's complex thematic texture.\r\n\r\nIn terms of acting, this is some of Dyrholm's best work (which is saying a lot considering her extraordinary CV). Initially playing Anne as strong-willed and inherently decent, Dyrholm does drop a few hints that all is not as it appears, that there's something darker and more selfish underneath \u2013 she point blank refuses, for example, to apologise for something she knows she shouldn't have done, with her partner at the law firm lamenting, \"_can't you just admit you were wrong for once_\". As it turns out, no she can't. Once Gustav arrives on the scene, Dyrholm loosens up, carrying herself differently, and displaying a different kind of confidence than we've seen thus far \u2013 a more personalised confidence, one that has to do with her sense of self rather than her professionalism. Later, when she faces the possibility that Peter could learn of the affair and that her comfortable middle-class life could be jeopardised, she shuts herself down, becoming almost eerily void of emotion and interiority. That she has very much transitioned from protagonist to antagonist is made apparent in two especially chilling scenes \u2013 one involving herself, Peter, and Gustav, and another involving just herself and Gustav. The Anne in these scenes is a million miles away from the Anne who threw caution to the wind, giddily enjoying sex in the forest with her stepson. Throughout it all, Dyrholm never lets us forget that Anne is very much a flawed human, but so too does she wholly commit to playing Anne's darker qualities; when the wheel turns, Dyrholm makes sure that we come to despise Anne. It's a performance of great dimensionality, and with its copious nudity and one hard-core oral sex scene, it's the kind that critics would once have called \"brave\". I just call it exceptional.\r\n\r\nWorking opposite such a powerhouse performer can't have been easy for the 25-year-old Lindh, who's only been acting professionally since 2015, but he holds his own admirably. And much as Dyrholm creates a fascinating arc for Anne, so too with Lindh, who plays Gustav with an exceptional visceral quality, his emotions always on the surface \u2013 from sullen teenager who barely says anything to laidback houseguest enjoying his surroundings to confident young man thoroughly enjoying a sexual relationship with an older experienced woman to bitter child unsure how to deal with what is happening to complete emotional wreck. His arc is essentially the inverse of Anne's \u2013 whereas she's introduced as the protagonist, someone with whom we're encouraged to identify, yet she later becomes nothing short of a monster, he's introduced as an unlikable, resentful, petulant, and moody brat, yet he evolves to the point where he becomes the emotional fulcrum of the final act, with Lindh's heart-breaking performance in one particular scene as strong as anything you'll see all year. As Peter, Krepper has a lot less to do than his co-stars, but he does it well, never putting a foot wrong. He plays Peter as decent and loving, but not especially warm or attentive. Sex between him and Anne is a rarity, and even when they do have sex, it's vanilla and rote. However, these are his most significant crimes; he's a good husband and father and a kind man, and Krepper plays him as unable to even conceive that Anne could have seduced his son because it's simply so far outside his understanding of the world. If Anne and Gustav represent the emotional centre of the film at different points, Peter is the moral centre throughout.\r\n\r\nLooking at issues of gender inequality in relation to sexual trauma and abuse, _Dronningen_ is a story of how a woman can be a predator just as easily as a man. Indeed, the film reminds us that gender is irrelevant when considering the pain caused by such predation. Ultimately, Gustav is no different from the clients who Anne represents, but whereas she is shown to be remarkably protective of them (even allowing one to stay in the house the night before she's due to testify), when Anne finds herself in the role of the perpetrator, her treatment of Gustav is as reprehensible as anything done to her female clients by their male abusers. This is tricky and emotionally complex territory, and _Dronningen_ is never anything less than thematically fascinating. It's by no means an easy watch, but it is an exceptional piece of filmmaking.","id":"5e608ab09b8616001301802f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e608ab09b8616001301802f","movie_id":519465}

Yanez was charged with second-degree manslaughter and the dangerous discharge of a firearm, but he was acquitted of all charges.\r\n\r\nAnd they're just the ones I can think of off the top of my head.\r\n\r\nWhite police officers killing (often innocent) black men is something we've seen much of in recent years, and it's been represented in films such as Ryan Coogler's _Fruitvale Station_ (2013); George Tillman Jr.'s _The Hate U Give_ (2018), Reinaldo Marcus Green's _Monsters and Men_ (2018); Steve McQueen's _Widows_ (2018); and Nate Parker's _American Skin_ (2019). And to that list you can now add _Queen & Slim_, albeit with an asterisk, because here, it's a black man killing a white police officer. But, and this is a key point, he does so only in self-defence. Embracing the notion that Black Lives very much Matter, the film is something of a stealth social commentary insofar as it wears the disguise of the classic genre template of a duo on the run \u00e0 la films such as Nicholas Ray's _They Live By Night_ (1950), Arthur Penn's _Bonnie and Clyde_ (1967), Terrence Malick's _Badlands_ (1973), or Ridley Scott's _Thelma and Louise_ (1991). And it works perfectly well as a taut road-movie. However, underneath the genre elements, you'll find a condemnation of a criminal justice system that seemingly targets minorities, a celebration of black unity and cultural vibrancy, and an examination of Trump's divided America. It's not an angry diatribe per se, certainly not in the sense that some of Spike Lee's films are, but it does attempt to Speak Truth to Power and it is fundamentally of the moment. It also happens to be a very fine film, albeit a little too long and with some strange tonal inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nQueen (a superb debut performance by model Jodie Turner-Smith) and Slim (a brilliant Daniel Kaluuya) are on a date, having met on Tinder. However, things are not going especially well, as they quickly discover they have virtually nothing in common. He works at Costco, is a devout Christian, and wants a family; she's an atheistic defence attorney with no filter for her often acerbic comments, and has no interest in raising a family. As the date ends, Slim drives Queen home, partly as an act of chivalry, partly because he's hoping for sex, but on the way, he accidentally swerves the car and is pulled over by Officer Reed (Sturgill Simpson). Reed is unnecessarily threatening and belligerent from the start, and when a freezing Slim (politely) asks him if he could hurry up with his search of the car, Reed draws his weapon and orders Slim to the ground. Queen attempts to start recording what's happening, but Reed shoots her in the leg. Slim then tackles Reed, gets his gun, and kills him as Reed lunges at him. Slim wants to remain at the scene, but Queen points out that a black man has just shot a white cop with his own gun, and if they stay, the best they can hope for is prison. And so the duo find themselves on the lam, with Slim concocting a vague plan to head south from Ohio to Miami, and ultimately on to Cuba. Meanwhile, mostly without their knowledge, they become the symbol for and inspiration behind a nationwide protest movement against racially-motivated police violence.\r\n\r\nPassing through Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, Queen and Slim encounter characters such as Edgar (Benito Martinez), a Kentucky sheriff who offers to help them; a gas-station attendant (Joseph Poliquin) who makes a very strange request of Slim; Earl (a scene-stealing Bokeem Woodbine), Queen's uncle, and a pimp and former marine who served in Iraq; Naomi (Melanie Halfkenny) and Goddess (Indya Moore), two of Earl's live-in girlfriends; Mr. and Mrs. Shepherd (Flea and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny), a conservative Georgia couple; a mechanic (Gralen Bryant Banks) who's unimpressed with the duo's actions; and Junior (Jahi Di'Allo Winston), the mechanic's son, who's in awe of them.\r\n\r\nQueen & Slim is written by Lena Waithe (best known for her work on shows such as _Master of None_ and _The Chi_), from a story by Waithe and James Frey (yep, _that_ James Frey), and is directed by Melina Matsoukas in her feature directorial debut, having thus far worked predominately on music videos such as Rhianna's \"S&M\" (2010), Christina Aguilera's \"Your Body\" (2012), and Beyonc\u00e9's \"Formation\" (2016). \r\n\r\nAlthough at a structural level, _Queen & Slim_ is a classic duo on the run film, at a thematic level it focuses on socio-political issues such as ethnic tension, systemic racism, unchecked police violence, communal anger, and both the importance and danger of protest movements (it's telling that the film doesn't paint every protestor as a paragon of virtue, and one scene in particular shows a protestor acting as unnecessarily aggressive as Reed did at the start of the film). Concerning this, a key point is that the film doesn't try to be a piece of social realism. On their journey from Ohio to Miami, Queen and Slim encounter a litany of black characters, all of whom know exactly who they are, all of whom approve of what they did and treat them like folk heroes (except the mechanic), and all of whom are more than happy to help out in any way they can. This isn't done to suggest that black identity in the US is a unified and monolithic subculture, rather it's to make an allegorical point; it's a reference to the \"them and us\" mentality that has resulted in such deep fissures in identity and which give the lie to claims that the US is a post-racial country. This allegorical sense is heightened further with references to slave catchers, chain gangs working rural fields, and the Underground Railroad.\r\n\r\nAside from this, the other major theme is the notion of legacy. This is tied into the fact that Queen and Slim are symbols for a nationwide movement. The fact that they don't see themselves as symbols, doesn't matter to the people who mythologise them. In much the same way as the Bonnie and Clyde of Penn's film or Mickey and Mallory in Oliver Stone's _Natural Born Killers_ (1992) became symbols for disenfranchised, countercultural youth, and Thelma and Louise become symbols for striking back against an abusive patriarchy, Queen and Slim find themselves as the spearhead of a movement focused on black socio-political anger. When Slim kills Reed, he and Queen flee because they assume they won't get a fair trial in a country that sees race before all else (and remember, she's a lawyer). And this assumption is what forms the basis of the movement built in their name, with black people shown as utterly exasperated by such treatment. In such a dangerously volatile milieu, Queen and Slim provide the spark that sets the tinderbox aflame; as one character tells them, \"_y'all really gave niggas something to believe in. We needed that for real._\" Indeed, in many ways, the film's unifying theme is the notion of how little control you have over how the world perceives you, which can be both powerful and dangerous in equal measure.\r\n\r\nHowever, the film looks at legacy in other, arguably simpler ways. For example, when Slim says he doesn't have many photos of himself because \"_I know what I look like_\". Queen argues that \"_pictures aren't just about vanity. They're proof of your existence_\". Later on, in a central scene, Junior takes a photograph of the duo (which is also used as one of the film's posters), and the last shot dwells on the importance of visual records, not just in terms of providing proof of existence, but so too in terms of ideological reinforcement of abstract concepts.\r\n\r\nLooking at the aesthetic side of things, Waithe's screenplay does a really good job of telling us who Queen and Slim are from the get-go, taking only a few moments during the opening scene to set up many of the characteristics that will prove important later (his faith, for example, or her acerbity). And because the scene is a first date, the dialogue can introduce such getting-to-know-you material without it seeming expositionary or inorganic. The script also fleshes out the supporting characters in subtle but believable ways, from Earl's obvious but unmentioned PTSD and concomitant bitterness to Mr and Mrs Sheridan's differing reactions to the duo to the mechanic's reasons for disliking them to Junior's reasons for idolising them. It's all obvious enough not to miss, but subtle enough not to jump out as being too heavily scripted. The acting is also terrific. Turner-Smith, in her first feature film role, plays Queen as the realist to Slim's idealist, someone who has sacrificed much to achieve success and who, although she hides it, is deeply lonely. Kaluuya plays Slim as an eternal optimist, someone who trusts others, but is also borderline na\u00efve, in a performance that's the complete inverse of the intimidating enforcer he played in _Widows_. \r\n\r\nThere are some problems though. For example, I don't know if it was a decision made at a scripting level, directorial level, or editing level, but on a few occasions, the movie inexplicably starts using voiceover. But not normal voiceover. Two characters will be shown having a normal conversation and then, for no apparent reason, some of the dialogue is delivered as VO, only for the normal conversation to resume again. If it was confined to Queen and Slim, I might think it was a poorly-conceived attempt to draw us into their psyche, but it isn't, as we also see it happening with Junior. So, I honestly don't know what the point is, but it sure is distracting and seems to come from a different film entirely. Some scenes are also just too fanciful. I recognise that it's not social realism, and so there has to be some leeway, but scenes such as the one where the duo stop so Slim can ride a horse just push it too far, as does a bizarre scene with a gas station clerk, which (I think) is supposed to be comic relief, but which is just too tonally divorced from everything else to work in any capacity. Another poorly conceived scene, although for a very different reason, sees Matsoukas cut to Slim's father (Thom Gossom Jr.) to show us that the police are monitoring his phone line. It's an entirely unnecessary scene, and it breaks the rigidly maintained focalisation, which up to this point has been entirely confined to Queen and Slim. The film also runs about 15 minutes too long, with several fake-out endings, and in its final moments, it veers very close to melodrama.\r\n\r\nThese issues notwithstanding, however, this is a strong film that works on several levels. On the one hand, it's a decent duo-on-the-run story; on the other, it's a film tuned into the socio-political frequency of the times. It's well-acted, and for the most part, well written and directed. A snapshot of a house divided against itself, it paints a bleak picture of an ethnic group that has been pushed and prodded to the point where combustion may be unavoidable. 31% of Americans believe that a second Civil War will happen within their lifetime, and it will almost certainly be race-related. _Queen & Slim_ suggests they might just be correct.","id":"5e4228199603310013f09461","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e4228199603310013f09461","movie_id":536743}
{"author":"deRedtube","content":"Andre Davis (Chadwick Boseman) is the NYPD detective tasked with the case of two criminals who kill several police officers during a drug heist. The deaths enrage an entire precinct, and the captain (J.K. Simmons) now has a bunch of trigger-happy cops thirsting for revenge. He decides to pair Andre with a DEA agent (Sienna Miller). But the incident also uncovers a conspiracy, and Andre doesn\u2019t know whom to trust. He has just one night to solve the case and catch the killers before they escape the city of Manhattan.\r\n\r\nChadwick Boseman\u2019s rendition of Andre Davis is intense, and the actor has a commanding on-screen presence as well. He continues to display a lot of range in his acting repertoire to prove, yet again, why he deserves to be a leading man. J.K. Simmons is perfectly cast as Captain McKenna, who makes you really care about why the police deaths matter so much to him and the rest of the cops. Sienna Miller is also impressive in a restrained performance as the DEA agent Frankie Burns. On the other side of the law, Taylor Kitsch and Stephan James make a strong pair. Kitsch plays Raymond Jackson, a sharpshooter who knows how to dispatch whoever is in his sights, and James plays Michael Trujillo, the brains of the operation, who needs to figure how to escape without getting arrested.\r\n\r\nAlthough the plot is neither new nor inventive in any way, it has an interesting setup with perspectives from both sides of the law. Director Brian Kirk shoots the film, particularly the action, well enough to keep the pace engaging throughout. The screenplay has the potential to explore different motivations, but the film barely scratches the surface of its subject matter. If you\u2019re familiar with the crime thriller genre, the chances are you\u2019ll predict the outcome because we\u2019ve seen this story play out many times before. Despite that, you\u2019ll still enjoy \u201821 Bridges\u2019, because the action combined with its competent cast and their performances make it highly watchable.","id":"5dd8300728723c001253dab7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dd8300728723c001253dab7","movie_id":535292}

{"author":"Matthew Brady","content":"\"For John.\"\r\n\r\n'Dark Fate' was meh. I mean it's basically the Force Awakens of the franchise just more cash grab. Like...how many times can they keep alternating T1 & T2, and yet it's astounding that it never ruins the legacy of the series. \r\n\r\nDespite all that, it's the third best in the series. At least this movie knows that Terminator is not for kids! I had some engagement in the movie, even through the reason being that it follows a familiar plot line.\r\n\r\nLinda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger are both the stand outs. Hamilton playing a cranky bad-ass and Arnold playing an involved machine that has a life of his own. Mackenzie Davis was surprisingly not as annoying as I thought she will be just from the marketing alone. Her character was straight forward in terms of motivation and can take damage.\r\n\r\nTim Miller really knows how to direct action scenes effectively and in this movie he delivers some grand action set pieces. However, after seeing the movie a few days ago, only a small selection stick to memory.\r\n\r\nGabriel Luna did a decent job playing the new advance Terminator. They took the \"Robert Patrick\" approach with picking an ordinary looking guy and making him into the biggest threat of humanity. Although it was a bit hard for me to feel threaten by him as throughout the movie he seemed easily out match by pretty much everyone. \r\n\r\nI didn't really buy into Dani played by Natalia Reyes as the main \"saviour of the future\", mainly because of her stiff acting and everytime she holds a gun it's twice her size.\r\n\r\nThe visual effects at times looked pretty OK, but the rest looked really bad. It really doesn't help when there's close ups on the effects where you can see the fakeness. At times the movie was a little too dark and I don't mean in tone, just whenever it's night time.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: Not as great as T1 & T2, but nothing will without James Cameron magic touch.","id":"5e2f270f1685da0011e9c7da","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2f270f1685da0011e9c7da","movie_id":290859}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the Terminator franchise, I share the same opinion as most people. The 1984\u2019s original became a cult classic, and it\u2019s one of the most influential sci-fi\/action films of all-time. Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of the (very) few sequels to such a beloved movie that actually improves on its predecessor, standing as the number one film of the saga, quality- and entertainment-wise. James Cameron left the franchise, and suddenly it all went down the sewer. While Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is still tolerable, Salvation is absolutely terrible, and the reboot, Genisys, failed to change the saga\u2019s history compellingly. So, obviously, even with the return of Cameron to the production team, my expectations were moderately low.\r\n\r\nThat said, Dark Fate is the best Terminator installment since T2 \u2026 which is not saying much. The last two flicks have great casts (from Christian Bale to Emilia Clarke), but their scripts are baffling bad. This time around, the cast has amazing chemistry, and their characters have better dialogue, but it comes at a cost. The last three movies possess stories that are not as captivating or entertaining (or even rational) as the first two films. Dark Fate has a much better screenplay, but again it comes at a cost. What cost is this? Basically, it repeats the exact same bits as The Terminator.\r\n\r\nAn extremely thin line exists between paying homage to a movie and blatantly copying it. Tim Miller\u2019s team of screenwriters walk that line, stumbling to both sides several times along the way. Some scenes are indeed wonderful nods to the saga\u2019s first two installments, but a lot of other moments (too many, to be honest) are pretty much a copy-paste version of a significant plot point or character development arc from one of those films. In case you\u2019re wondering, this is the reason behind some of the \u201chate\u201d from both critics and fans all over the world. Nowadays, people are harsher with this sort of homages, and the previously mentioned line is getting thinner and thinner.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for the divisive opinions is the opening sequence. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t spoil. They simply make a sudden and surprising narrative decision that takes some of T2\u2019s emotional impact, at least without first clarifying why they made such a call. Therefore, I gave the movie a chance to develop its idea, but it doesn\u2019t. It just goes with it, and it never returns to this initial moment. Having this in mind, I understand if people instantly decided to hate the film based on just that very first scene\u2026. Because it really doesn\u2019t have any justification besides \u201cwell, we need a story\u201d.\r\n\r\nDark Fate\u2019s screenplay is emotionally resonant, and it\u2019s also packed with (mostly) well-directed action sequences, but it resembles the 1984\u2019s original plot too much. There\u2019s even a direct line from Sarah Connor saying that a particular character is the equivalent of her son, John. This unnecessary and lazy exposition is surprisingly not as used as I expected it to be, but when it occurs, it\u2019s like they chose the lamest, silliest, worse possible moments to place it. However, I can\u2019t deny I actually had fun with the movie.\r\n\r\nWith a much better script than the last films, the cast was able to not only shine in a few scenes, but their incredible chemistry allowed for outstanding moments. Seeing Linda Hamilton portray Sarah Connor once again is a delight to my eyes, and Arnold Schwarzenegger is an awesome badass with hilarious lines. These two are phenomenal! Nevertheless, Mackenzie Davis steals the show as the enhanced soldier, Grace, especially regarding the action scenes. I don\u2019t think Natalia Reyes offered what her character needed since she\u2019s the protagonist, after all, but she\u2019s able to stand her ground. I did enjoy Gabriel Luna take on the Terminator Rev-9, but I wish he had a little bit of more screentime besides the action.\r\n\r\nTim Miller brings his talented directing chops from Deadpool and applies his action techniques to deliver a lot of entertaining sequences. The VFX team provides with some impeccable CGI, but there are a couple of shots concerning a few speed bursts that should have received better treatment.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Terminator: Dark Fate is the best Terminator installment since Judgment Day, but it still doesn\u2019t even reach the latter\u2019s heels. It boasts a fantastic cast, with Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger returning to their respective iconic roles, but Mackenzie Davis outshines both with some badass moments and great acting. Natalia Reyes, as the protagonist, is disappointingly fine. Despite the action being well-directed and the screenplay being well-written, it all comes at the cost of essentially replicating the 1984 original\u2019s plot. Some homages are notable, but it\u2019s so identical story-wise that it takes away any sort of surprise, severely lacking creativity. In addition to this, it makes a narrative decision in the opening sequence that removes some of T2\u2019s emotional impact, damaging the saga\u2019s best movie and one of the greatest sci-fi\/action films of all-time. I don\u2019t exactly recommend it, but if you\u2019re a fan of the franchise, go see it but with moderate expectations.\r\n\r\nRating: C","id":"5dc065fe7d2bc1001338b963","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dc065fe7d2bc1001338b963","movie_id":290859}
{"author":"jackcarlin18","content":"> **_Review on Horror Focus_**\r\n\r\nThis indie sci-fi thriller Vivarium from Irish filmmaker Lorcan Finnegan is many things, one definitely being quite the head-scratcher. Not because of it being an intellectually challenging story, or one that is laced with twists and turns to create an unpredictable viewing, but a film that delivers a narratives so peculiar that it is like something you've never seen before. Take this with a pinch of salt, as there's certainly aspects which don't make the landing of such an ambitious plot, but let it also be known that Vivarium contains some impressions visual and narrative storytelling, enough to forgive some of the mid-act waffle that cripples the films momentum.\r\n\r\nFinnegan gets the ball rolling with power, keeping the story taught enough that we are thrown straight into the mystery early doors. This works extremely well as the tension begins to bubble within the first ten minute mark. The performances here from our main cast member already begin to show their brilliance, especially Jonathon Aris who sets a chilling foreshadowing tone with his appropriately eerie character Martin. The small (yet effective) amount of screen time we have with Martin is enough to set the tone, and we, like Tom and Gemma are forced to endure something that is so ominously intense that it leaves a lingering sense of dread.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this soon begins to simmer once Finnegan establishes the plot in its whole, and realisation settles on the simple fact that, after the 30 minute mark, there really isn't much else for the story to go. Yes the labyrinth maze of suburbia is strangely terrifying, and the strenuous repetition is effective, but after 15 minutes of having the child introduced, Vivarium begins to fall flat, and grow increasingly more stale up until after the sixty minutes in. The fantastic Poots and Eisenberg, and the deadpan humour do prevent this film from becoming a little too one-note, but this doesn't exuse more than a few scenes that will be a task to sit through, even in these current homebound world we are living in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a glimmer of brilliance in Finnegan's choice of release here, as what our main couple are enduring is poetically reflective of the life we are living in this mad pandemic virus. I found myself identifying with the irritated attitude our characters develop, and sympathised with them when their child (the boy) was well deserving of a slap. Vivarium is intelligently relative right now, and can definitely be perceived as as Finnegan holding a mirror up to the idealistic yet treacherous concept of what makes the perfect home, and the urge to be the perfect family.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there's so much underlying aspects of Vivarium that are so incredibly reflective of the inevitable repetition that comes once a spunky couple are weighed down by family life, securing their \"ideal\" home and tolerating each others impurities under the same roof constantly. Finnegan exposes the dangers of the nuclear family here, and forces us to endure it too, warts and all. We even get those little moments in which Tom consistently chips away, digging a whole, not to be talked to, helped or interrupted by Gemma, who becomes a slave to ensuring nothing but contentment for their boy. This moment is humourous with a dark sting, and will be reflective of reality to many, but to those inside Vivarium is nothing but a nightmarish loop.\r\n\r\nThis distorted utopia Finnegan creates is what's most effective, orchestrated by a Burton-esque palette that is as gorgeous as it is hauntingly off-kilter. The early 80's, Romero's Day of the \r\n\r\nDead-like synth is undeniably effective, and carries the tension through to the final act, which although doesn't hit a payoff point that excuses the slow middle act, does add to the bankers reality Finnegan has crafted, and highlights the eeriness established from the beginning. While Vivarium does lose a tone of momentum when it hits the mid-way point, by the time it reaches its end, I can't shake the distinct feeling of unease I had to endure for over eighty minutes, and I can't deny that a film like this was an experience I have quite been exposed to before. I have been feeling really under the weather these past few days, and let's just say this only made me feel worse. Great job, I guess?\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDICT \r\nVivarium is a simplistically disturbing suburban nightmare with a captivating story and little room for growth. Enduring its drab middle act may prove tricky, but once Finnegan blows the dust of the eerie intensity established from the beginning, you'll find there is much to be desired with this unsettling little indie-sci-fi thriller.","id":"5e94938e8e87020016ce43d5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e94938e8e87020016ce43d5","movie_id":458305}

And what happened was - well, I will let you find out for yourself as a reward for sticking through the weaker moments of an ultimately heartwarming movie. \r\n\r\nUltimately, if you don't like rom-coms, this won't change your mind, so save yourself the irritation.

It's a pretty comprehensive take down of the green industry and how for all their big talk about saving the planet, a lot of their practices are the same, if not worse for the earth than the methods they want to do away with. \r\n\r\nThe film also takes aim at certain environmental organisations that when examined are shown to be not so green after all, and in many cases taken over by capitalistic practices. It's a deep dive into the shortcomings of the current green energy sector, the destructive operating practices of the biofuel industry, and how billionaires and multinational corporations have hijacked the environmental movement for their own gain.\r\n\r\nThe hypocrisy of certain companies and people are laid out using archival interviews, documentation, and contemporary footage. Gibbs visits green rallies to see if protesters have an understanding of what they are shouting for, and takes some movement leaders to task over the ambiguous wording of their policies and how what they claim and what they do often do not align at all.\r\n\r\nI found the content of this to be quite thought provoking. If what is being said here is true, then a lot of the green and environmentally friendly solutions being put forward today to hush the climate change movement are ineffective, and in some cases as harmful or more harmful than current practices.

{"author":"Kai","content":"Please note: This review comes from an avid horror fan; this film is my first interaction with the School Lives! franchise and my opinion is based off seeing this as it's packaged - a zombie survival action-horror and without any prior knowledge. This review contains spoilers.\r\n\r\nI knew upon starting this zombie survival horror that it was going to be a little worse for wear around the edges. The cast are a Japanese idol girl group - already I know that this is going to be cliched and a little cringe-worthy. That's nothing on the girls - it's just how they always end up type-cast a majority of the time. Something to take into consideration whenever you watch idol rookie-actor lead films.\r\n\r\nI honestly thought this was a horror-comedy, maybe something satirical that was taking the mick of a lot of tropes within horror movies. The surprise when I checked the page to find that this was being pushed forward as a fully serious film was painful.\r\n\r\nEvery time a zombie shows up, the girls fluster, fall over, freak out, etc and don't seem to have any ability to defend themselves. They way they've survived as long as they have is an utter mystery to me. Not surprising, again, with cute and innocent Japanese idol leads, but disappointing none the less - they could have still done this with grace and professionalism that showed the actresses as cute and sweet, but with some semblance of realism.\r\nSome of the girls deal with mental issues that would be common in an apocalypse - PTSD, being unable to accept reality etc, and this is a really interesting part of the film. Of course, this part of the film they barely developed and had pop up a few times and that was it.\r\n\r\nWith another cliched goodbye scene nearer the end, this film gets a tick for every possible trope they could have used, and ruined themselves with. Cliches are relatively normal in Japanese horror, don't get me wrong - but this is just taking the mick.\r\n\r\nI feel like this is meant to be a feel good horror movie, one that blurs the line between realism and imagination within its parameters. However, even coming to this conclusion mid way through the film, I still feel like it missed the mark on that.\r\n\r\nMaybe I would have enjoyed this more if I was a fan of the franchise, if I even knew what the story was about before going into it, or even if I knew how trope ridden it was going to be. Maybe it's meant to be like this in tone, similar to the anime and manga - not something I would know. I've seen a lot of people say this is very true to the source content.\r\nAs a horror fan? Someone who was browsing the horror tag and wanted something full of horror to watch?\r\nDefinitely one I wish I had skipped and not come across. I swear I've only seen 4 good anime\/manga adaptations and there'll all by the same director... It's a massive shock and shame that the director of this was the person who directed The Chasing World.\r\n\r\nWith a cliche hallway scene, everything suddenly going wrong and another emergency to contend to, this film is honestly the most cliched and trope ridden horror I've seen released this year, worldwide. A film that has left me underwhelmed, bored and knowing I should have sprung for a Korean 2019 horror instead.\r\n\r\nAlso: one small pet peeve is how do these girls have an unlimited supply of bright white unstained uniforms in their exact sizes every day. It's the middle of the zombie apocalypse. How and where are you washing your clothes? When every other person\/zombie in this film has disgustingly grey, ripped, and ruined shirts and pants? (Yes, this is how bored I was.... I was scrutinising their clothes come the ending).","id":"5df8bc41d1a89300197e0b85","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5df8bc41d1a89300197e0b85","movie_id":572609}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nThis might be the very first film of 2019, which I knew absolutely nothing about going into the theater. Usually, I avoid trailers for most movies, but it\u2019s almost impossible to not catch an image or a clip here and there. However, for Scary Stories, since it wasn\u2019t heavily marketed in my country (at least), the only things I knew was that Guillermo del Toro was involved and that it was a horror flick. Knowing del Toro, I also remembered myself that this wouldn\u2019t just be a straightforward horror story, filled with predictable jump scares, and a bland narrative. That\u2019s my first advice to my fellow readers: if you expect a film similar to those of The Conjuring Universe, then you\u2019ll be disappointed.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also not the other extreme. It doesn\u2019t follow the ambiguity and weirdness of Jordan Peele\u2019s installments, so if you\u2019re one of those people that don\u2019t appreciate that type of horror, you\u2019re safe as well. Having in mind the latest movies released from the genre, it\u2019s hard to find one that balances these two separate takes instead of choosing one of them. Scary Stories spends its first half slow-building their characters, but mainly its story. There\u2019s a massive build-up to something that\u2019s pretty much the premise of the film, so it struggles to reach the actual \u201caction\u201d without it becoming a tad boring or too long. It\u2019s a \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d (in the genre, I mean) to have a good set up, with decent character development, and an exponential interest in the main story, instead of jumping into silly horror sequences fifteen minutes after it started.\r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal does an excellent job in directing. He really knows how to generate suspense and create a genuinely creepy build-up. There\u2019s tremendous camera work involved in some fantastic sequences that don\u2019t rely on jump scares to provide the \u201cfear\u201d factor. It\u2019s the never-ending suspense, that feeling of claustrophobia even if the character isn\u2019t in a confined space. Except for one scene, we can always see what\u2019s happening. The \u201cmonsters\u201d don\u2019t appear out of nowhere, they don\u2019t screech at you precisely at the third time a character looks another way, and the actual jump scares are rather efficient. However, they\u2019re not scary, as well as the movie itself\u2026\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not simply a scary film. It doesn\u2019t have that heavy and dark tone that we feel in other horror movies. At first, I thought it might be a bad thing, but Scary Stories establishes this distinct tone from the very beginning. Even without knowing a single thing about the film, I understood from the first few minutes that it was going to be \u201cdifferent\u201d. I would advise caution to not judge this movie by its trailers if they indicate that this is one of those films to make you scream every five minutes. There\u2019s definitely a message to be transmitted, and I think it was well-delivered in the ending. It might be too cheesy for some or lack impact for a movie that asks the audience for a bit of patience, but for me, it worked well enough.\r\n\r\nThe acting is mostly good. Zoe Colletti (Stella) and Michael Garza (Ramon) are undoubtedly the standouts, and they do a good job of carrying the narrative forward. They both have compelling backstories, but for the time that the film spends developing its characters, I wish they went more in-depth with Stella. She has a particularly intriguing past, and I don\u2019t think we get enough out of it. Gabriel Rush (Auggie) and Austin Zajur (Chuck) have great chemistry, but their comic-relief roles are a disservice to an otherwise pretty solid movie.\r\n\r\nTechnically, there are some beautiful shots from the DP, Roman Osin. Usually, sequences at night in low-budget films suffer a lot with lack of clear visibility, but Osin does a remarkable job, playing with lighting in a truly unique way. I\u2019m curious to know what audiences will think of this movie. If I had to bet, I think people will leave disappointed due to the lack of more generic jump scares, and a straightforward narrative. Truth be told, the slow pacing doesn\u2019t help, especially when the character development only works for two. Finally, the \u201cscary stories\u201d that Sarah tells are entertaining and imaginative, and the whole concept of this film is incredibly captivating.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is a distinct horror flick, with well-developed leads, and a creative approach to an unique premise. It doesn\u2019t follow the rules of generic horror, by not relying itself too much on jump scares, and making the actual story and characters the main interest. Beautifully-produced by Guillermo del Toro and co. as well as brilliantly directed by Andr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal. The \u201cscary stories\u201d are indeed dark and creepy, providing a whole second-half of excellent horror scenes. \r\n\r\nHowever, the first-half takes its time to set everything up, and the lack of more \u201caction\u201d might leave some viewers disappointed. Only two characters are genuinely engaging, which proves that the slow build-up didn\u2019t entirely pay off as it should have. It\u2019s meant to be a divisive movie, but I definitely recommend seeing it!\r\n\r\nRating: B-","id":"5d5a84f40e4fc854775539f8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d5a84f40e4fc854775539f8","movie_id":417384}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you can read my review of one of my favorite movies of 2017, Jordan Peele\u2018s Get Out by clicking its title. One of the best feature-long debuts of all-time by a writer-director who I wish he discovered his filmmaker skills sooner because the horror genre urgently needed someone like him. Peele is starting to become one of Hollywood\u2019s most notable people, and he proves once again, now with Us, that his undeniable talent is going to leave our jaws dropped and our minds confused for quite some years. While I do think that his first film is more consistent and better structured, Us is so far the best movie of the year, and I doubt that it will stop being part of that list by the end of it.\r\n\r\nThe best films are the ones that can transform a 45-min car ride back home from the theater into a blink of an eye. I spent all that time plus some more minutes discussing and arguing with my partner who I saw the movie with. By now, I have a pretty decent understanding of the film\u2019s story and of Lupita\u2018s character arc, which will definitely leave you extremely confused and mind-blown by the end of the movie. However, I will see it a second time to make sure my \u201ctheory\u201d aligns with everything else, especially those tiny little details we don\u2019t really think they matter when they actually do.\r\n\r\nPeele\u2018s screenplay is thought-provoking and suspenseful, filled with brilliant character development, and surprisingly well-filmed action scenes. I guess he knows how to do anything efficiently. The chasing scenes are riveting, and the fights are bloody awesome. In addition to this, most of the action occurs at night which requires the director to know what he\u2019s doing, so the audience is able to follow what\u2019s happening. I never, not once, lost my place during an action sequence. I knew who everyone was, where were they at, and what were they doing. Nowadays, having in mind how actual action blockbusters are being made, this is the best praise I can give a director regarding these type of scenes.\r\n\r\nA lot of articles are calling Jordan Peele the \u201cnext Spielberg\u201c or \u201cnew Hitchcock\u201c. I\u2019m calling him the first Jordan Peele! I would have loved to be the one who came up with this last sentence, but I wasn\u2019t \u2026 and I\u2019m so happy about it. It means that more people are starting to plant into their minds that Peele is one of a kind, not one like the other. His trademark close-up shots right in the actors\u2019 faces can show and tell so much about a character. Besides that, the actors will have a golden opportunity to show their enormous emotional range, their incredible expressions, their limitless talent \u2026 That is if you are someone like Lupita Nyong\u2019o.\r\n\r\nRight after I watched Alita: Battle Angel, I called that it would get an Oscar nomination for Best Visuals Effects, and I still stand by it. Well, I also want to be the first to call not only an Oscar nom, but a Best Actress win for Lupita. Daniel Kaluuya was outstanding in Get Out, but Lupita surpasses his fellow comrade with two (!) powerfully captivating performances. As the original mother, she shows kindness and endearing traits. As her doppelganger, she\u2019s scary, menacing, and evil. Two completely different characters with distinct physical and psychological characteristics are no problem for Lupita. She handles them in such a flawless and effortless manner, carrying the entire narrative on her shoulders like it was nothing. She deserves every recognition there is.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, she still received great help from the remaining cast. Winston Duke (Gabe Wilson) is hilarious, and he\u2019s the primary source of comedy throughout the film. With a remarkable balance of tones, Peele lets Duke shine in a role that he thrives on. Us can be very heavy and dark at times, so a good laugh here and there is always welcome. The young actors are also great, but I have to congratulate Shahadi Wright Joseph\u2018s performance as Zora Wilson. She has approximately the same age Amandla Stenberg had in The Hunger Games. At the time, I knew Stenberg would be an outstanding actress, and I was not wrong. Now, I\u2019m 100% certain that Shahadi will be an exceptional one if she isn\u2019t already.\r\n\r\nTechnically, I already wrote above how talented Peele is. From his seamless ability to film action sequences in the dark to his brilliantly-written screenplay, he nails almost every aspect of his movie. The score beautifully accompanies the narrative with cool, rhythmic songs when everything seems fine, and with loud, angelically weird voices that instantly change the tone. Flawless editing helps hide some nitpicks I have with some exposition scenes, especially towards the end. While I understand that the story has a lot to take in once \u201cexplained\u201d, I believe Peele does so in a slightly too fast monologue that I think some people won\u2019t quite enjoy. For me, I would have loved total ambiguity. If they didn\u2019t explain a thing, I would have been ecstatic, but I understand the need to do it.\r\n\r\nMy other gripe with the film is the other family, portrayed mainly by the always astonishing Elizabeth Moss (Kitty Tyler), and Tim Heidecker (Josh Tyler). Thinking about them and their importance to the story, I find that either they could have been better utilized or they shouldn\u2019t even exist. It\u2019s the middle ground between these two options that bothers me a little since it feels like these two remarkable actors, especially Moss, were left aside too much. They are indeed relevant to elevate the story as a whole, but I still wish they were explored a bit better.\r\n\r\nSadly, I think audiences will like Get Out more, even though Us has more of the horror genre\u2019s traits than the first. Not only due to the story being more comfortable to follow and ultimately understand (some people actually left my theater way before the end \u2026 shame on you!), but also because it has a definite ending. Unfortunately, people don\u2019t really like to think about a movie after it finished, so if it has some sort of open-ending, they\u2019re going to be mad. That\u2019s what happens if you go into Us expecting a cheap horror film, filled with cliche jump scares, and hollow characters. This is not a scary flick. It is a horror movie, and a phenomenal one. In case you want a simple, spoiler-free advice on how to approach the film\u2019s story, I\u2019ll leave just one small sentence after my rating.\r\n\r\nJordan Peele is one of a kind. He is not like anyone else. Once again, he offers a thought-provoking, deeply layered, and incredibly suspenseful narrative. Captivating and entertaining from beginning to end, with no misstep along the way. Technically seamless, with his emotionally-driven trademark close-ups on the characters faces being a standout. Lupita Nyong\u2019o delivers what I believe it\u2019s her career-best performance(s), which should grab her not only a bunch of award nominations, but wins as well. Brilliant cast, tonally well-balanced with hilarious comedy, and filled with excitingly scary action sequences.\r\n\r\nUs does not have a single interpretation. My perspective is not right or wrong, it\u2019s just my point of view. It\u2019s one of those movies you can watch time and time again, and each viewing will give you another insight that you missed before. However, I do think that what happens at the very end, it\u2019s true, and I have more than enough hints throughout the film to sustain my opinion. Despite some minor issues\/nitpicks, it\u2019s undoubtedly the best movie of 2019 so far, and I highly doubt it will be out of my Top10 by the end of the year. Thank you, Peele, not only for giving us great horror films, but for being yourself. Go see it!\r\n\r\nRating: A-\r\n\r\nAdvice: focus on the boy\u2019s actions, and how he reacts to everything he sees or does.","id":"5c926f1bc3a3686111535623","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c926f1bc3a3686111535623","movie_id":458723}

{"author":"Sheldon Nylander","content":"It\u2019s sloppy, lacks logic or internal consistency, makes really bizarre and inane storytelling decisions, and has a less than satisfying ending. It\u2019s also strangely fun and absorbing and a good time, even if you end up racking your brain trying to figure out the logic.\r\n\r\nFollowing up his excellent \"Get Out,\" Jordan Peele gives us \"Us,\" the story of a family terrorized be evil doppelgangers who want revenge for something and to finally get their time in the sun in a very clear socioeconomic metaphor. Ultimately it doesn't make a lot of sense, and yet there's still something strangely compelling about this film. It's as though Peele tries to walk us through the door, but realizes too late that he forgot to open the door first and we end up crashing through it, Kool-Aid man style, getting a few splinters stuck in our eye in the process. We get the results we ultimately wanted, but it's far from painless.\r\n\r\nThe problem comes down to basic logic. As the movie goes on, you can't help but wonder how exactly this works. When needing to identify with movie characters, you have to figure out how the world they're in works. Honestly, I found Middle Earth to have more of an internal logic than this world. And this is supposed to be our world, not some weird fantasy realm.\r\n\r\nWhile this movie is plagued by problems with disbelief, it\u2019s still strangely fun. Like, really fun! It\u2019s a great idea, just sloppily executed and rushed out without fixing the logic part. As such, it\u2019s one of those movies that seems to have divided audience everywhere. I myself can see both sides, so it\u2019s getting a middle of the road rating from me. If you can consciously suspend disbelief in the face of some major logical problems, you\u2019re bound to have a lot of fun.

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_An effective socio-political thriller looking at issues of class and privilege_**\r\n\r\n> _Therefore thus saith the LORD, \"Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.\"_\r\n\r\n- Jeremiah 11:11\r\n\r\nThere's a detail to be found in writer\/director Jordan Peele's second feature, _Us_, which gives you a good idea of the amount of thought that has gone into the film. In the opening scene, set in 1986, a young girl walks into a hall of mirrors, with a sign outside proclaiming \"Find yourself\", and a picture of a Native American above the door, with the words \"Shaman Vision Quest\". Later in the film, now in the present day, the same hall of mirrors is seen, the same \"Find yourself\" is seen, but now the picture of the Native American has been replaced with a wizard, and \"Shaman Vision Quest\" with \"Merlin's Enchanted Forest.\" This change, easily dismissed as representative of everything that's wrong with PC culture, is actually much more telling. It represents a meaningless and superficial attempt to tackle society's discomfort with the violence found throughout the history of the United States. It's like putting a plaster on a severed limb; \"_sure, the white man slaughtered the Native Americans, but if we do things like change signs on amusement parks, everything should be forgiven, right?_\" This, in turn, speaks directly to one of the film's most salient themes - the US (or us) as we know it today is a country built on violence, racism, and oppression, but as long as such things are swept under the carpet and no one talks about them, then there's no need to worry. Peele very much wants people to start talking about them.\r\n\r\nI wasn't the biggest fan of Peele's previous film, the smash hit, _Get Out_; it was a terrific idea and a well-made film, but it left me a little indifferent. However, although it wasn't my all-time favourite movie, I certainly admired how he reformulated the tropes of the genre so as to suggest that just because the US gives the appearance of being a pseudo-post-racial society, it doesn't necessarily mean that that's true behind closed doors and in people's hearts. With _Us_, he is working in a similarly metaphorical mode, using the tropes of the home invasion thriller to probe issues of class and, especially, privilege, whilst also suggesting that what gives us our humanity may not be the same thing as what makes us human. The plot is an allegory for a nation divided unto itself; a fractured national identity that sees a strict demarcation between those above and those below, the haves and the have-nots, those with opportunity and those without. Essentially, Peele suggests that when social\/economic\/political inequality is so pronounced for so long, sooner or later, the only recourse available to the have-nots is to make a grand statement, a statement that will almost certainly not be peaceful.\r\n\r\nThe film opens in 1986 as the Thomas family visit the boardwalk in Santa Cruz. With the relationship between father Russel (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and mother Rayne (Anna Diop) icy at best, daughter Adelaide (Madison Curry) is somewhat of an afterthought. Leaving Adelaide in Thomas's charge, Rayne heads to the bathroom, but with Thomas more interested in playing Whack-a-mole, Adelaide wanders down onto the beach. Walking into a strange beachfront hall of mirrors, she sees something that deeply traumatises her, resulting in her not talking for several years. The film then cuts to the present day as the now-adult Adelaide Wilson (an astounding Lupita Nyong'o) travels to Santa Cruz with her family - husband Gabe (Winston Duke), daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and son Jason (Evan Alex). Comfortably middle-class, the family are staying in a house owned by Adelaide's parents, although much to Gabe's irritation, they are nowhere near as wealthy as their neighbours, the Tylers - Kitty (Elisabeth Moss), Josh (Tim Heidecker), and twin daughters Becca and Lyndsey (Cali and Noelle Sheldon). Uneasy at being so close to the scene of her childhood trauma, Adelaide becomes convinced that something terrible is going to happen, and although Gabe is initially dismissive, she seems so earnest in her conviction that he agrees the family can leave the next day. However, the power then cuts out, and Jason reveals that there are four people standing ominously in the driveway.\r\n\r\nIt's not a spoiler, of course, to say that the people in the driveway are the Wilsons' exact _doppelg\u00e4ngers_ (played by the same four actors), or that their intentions are less than friendly. However, one of the problems with reviewing the film is that so many of the themes and larger socio-political ideas are tied to who the _doppelg\u00e4ngers_ are and what they want, that it's difficult to discuss them without spoilers. So, small spoiler ahead - the _doppelg\u00e4ngers_ are called the Tethered; essentially, they are an underground-dwelling race of lookalikes, spiritually tied to those living above (this info is revealed quite early in the film, so it's not a massive spoiler). Although partly inspired by the 1960 \"Mirror Image\" episode of _The Twilight Zone_, the main influences for the Tethers appear to be urban legends surrounding \"mole people\" and, more specifically, the conflict between the Morlocks (strong underground-dwelling troglodyte-like humans) and the Eloi (small fruit-eating humans living on the surface) in H.G. Wells's _The Time Machine_ (1895).\r\n\r\nSetting out to probe both economic and societal divisions in the contemporary US, Peele introduces the theme early on with Gabe's jealousy at the Tylers' nicer house, fancier car, and much bigger boat (named \"B'Yacht-ch\"). Later, after the arrival of the Tethered, the theme becomes more explicit; through no fault of their own, they live in an underground realm, deprived of the opportunities those above the surface have access to. The allegorical dimension couldn't be clearer; the film is essentially a parable about class division. The Wilsons represent a middle-class all-American family, financially comfortable and well educated (Gabe wears a Howard University sweater; Adelaide studied ballet). The Tethered represent the underclass, whose lives are the inverse of the Wilsons, those without access to the privileges enjoyed by the wealthy, despite possessing the same emotions, the same biology, and the same capacity for happiness and success. This similarity is driven home when Adelaide asks Red (her Tethered) who they are, and Red seems confused by the question, answering (truthfully), \"_we're Americans._\"\r\n\r\nIn this sense, the film is very much about classism and marginalisation in contemporary American society. Taught they have no soul, the Tethered are depicted as resentful and bitter versions of the people on the surface, with Peele positing that only circumstance divides them. Adelaide is not smarter or more capable than Red; rather, the main difference between the two is just that of the difference between a poor person and a rich one; fate of birth. This speaks to perhaps the film's most important point - the marginalised, destitute, and discriminated against can succeed just as much as everyone else if only they're given the opportunity to do so. This is also alluded to in the powerful final shot. I won't spoil it, but the last image reveals that the Tethered have accomplished something which the surface dwellers once attempted but failed.\r\n\r\nPhysically trapped underground and emotionally trapped by their connection to those above, the Tethered are ignored, swept under the rug of society, out of sight out of mind, just like the alteration to the picture above the hall of mirrors; \"_if we hide the problem, that means the problem no longer exists._\" In what is essentially a sustained inversion of impostor syndrome, Peele allegorically examines what could happen when the marginalised and ignored can be marginalised and ignored no longer, whether they be the economically impoverished, the racially suppressed, vets suffering from PTSD, non-Americans xenophobically regarded as the Other, really any group of people that society at large has shunned. Looking at issues of double consciousness, social identity, sin, and privilege, Peele asks the US to look at itself in the mirror and consider those invisible millions.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds didactic and\/or preachy, that's because it is - Peele is very much preaching. However, he also allows himself to have some fun with it - when Zora arms herself for battle, for example, she does so not with a gun or a knife, but a golf club. What possible better weapon could there be for the bourgeoisie? Later, the only thing that gets Gabe to abandon a secure hiding spot is the prospect of driving the Tylers' car. True, the deeper Peele explores the Tethered, the more insurmountable logistical problems that are thrown up, and the further he strains credibility. However, it's a testament to both his filmmaking acumen and the strength of his thematic concerns, that such straining is not as detrimental as it may sound. Sure, there are huge practical problems with the Tethered, but you sort of go with it because what he's saying is so interesting, and he's saying it so well.\r\n\r\nOne of the most impressive things about the film is the attention to detail. For example, there are numerous references to Jeremiah 11:11, in which the prophet Jeremiah warns Jerusalem it is facing destruction because of their worship of false idols. In the film, so too do such false idols occur, in the form of money and, more specifically, a virtual assistant named Ophelia on which the Tylers are completely reliant, and which is at the centre of probably the darkest joke in the film. Another example is that the number 11, which itself is obviously a mirror image, recurs throughout, not just in objects (a digital clock is shown reading 11:11, the roof of an ambulance has the number 1111), but in the actual shot composition, wherein objects in the frame are made to literally look like the number (two lights reflected in the water, the frame of a door, trees in the background, a pattern on the floor).\r\n\r\nAs this might suggest, _Us_ is exceptionally accomplished from an aesthetic point of view, even more so than was _Get Out_. The opening scene, for example, features extraordinarily impressive photography by Mike Gioulakis, designed to place us as close to young Adelaide's consciousness as possible. As she wanders along behind her parents, the camera sticks primarily to her height, with everything towering above her, whilst the candied apple she holds is hypnotically red and shiny (one could say Edenic). Additionally, her parents never come close to touching, a visual manifestation of the obvious problems in their marriage. The film also features an agonisingly beautiful scene involving one of the Tethered and a fire, which is masterfully shot. The music by Michael Abels is especially good in this scene. Another fine scene features the rare use of a split diopter, a tool favoured by Brian De Palma that allows both foreground and background subjects to stay in focus simultaneously. Using it in a crucial scene towards the end of the film, it is the only time we see Adelaide and Red's faces in the same shot at the same time, with Red shot in BCU, facing away from Adelaide, who stands behind her. Far from being a gimmick, Peele uses it to enhance his theme, allowing the content to dictate the form.\r\n\r\nIn terms of acting, there are no weak links, but Nyong'o's nuanced work as Adelaide and Red is especially noteworthy as a study in fundamental contrasts. Apart from their appearance, nothing about the two is similar; their posture, their facial expressions, how they talk, how they walk, how they react to things around them, how they use their hands. Adelaide, a former ballet dancer, is graceful and elegant, whereas Red is automaton-like, her movements almost staccato and splintered into sudden bursts. It's a clinic on how to convey individualised psychology through body language, and at times, it's hard to believe it's the same actress playing both roles, she really is that good and deserves serious awards recognition for her work. For his part, Duke plays Gabe as a gentle and dorky father with an endless line of bad jokes, who frequently embarrasses his kids, but his _doppelg\u00e4nger_ Abraham as a hulking monster.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, there are a few. As already mentioned, there are insurmountable practical issues with the Tethered which are never addressed, and on occasion, Peele becomes overly didactic. My biggest issue with the film, however, was something you see a lot of, and not just in horror movies - every time the Tethered want to kill someone, they do so immediately, without ceremony or pause. However, they pass up multiple opportunities to kill the Wilsons. At first, this seems as if it's because they wish to keep them alive for some reason, but later in the film, we find out that really, they just want to kill them. Never once do they attempt to do so with the ruthless efficiency with which they kill others, which is an irritating inconsistency. It also means for large parts of the film, there isn't really any tension. Additionally, the final twist, of which I will say nothing, doesn't really work, feeling like something of a twist for twist's sake that was never fully integrated into the narrative.\r\n\r\nThese small problems notwithstanding, _Us_ is an impressive film that improves on _Get Out_ in almost every way, and which serves as a more complete artistic statement. Examining what it means to be so concerned with what you don't have that you never consider the fact there are people with far less, the film holds a cracked mirror up to society, showing some of its ugliest prejudices and failings. The Tethers are monsters because they have been left with little choice other than to become monsters, imprisoned by a system they had no part in creating and in which they are not allowed to participate. Both visually accomplished and thematically complex, _Us_ once again finds Peele examining the kind of social oppression that no one wants to acknowledge (just like that sign above the hall of mirrors), but this time he widens his scope to move beyond issues of race. In _Get Out_, he took a story of bodily possession and moulded it into a story of black\/white relations. In _Us_, he demonstrates that oppression can easily cross racial boundaries. And the real horror of this isn't to be found in monsters or jump scares. It's to be found in humanity's frequent inhumanity to one another.","id":"5d4a0cb61b72940018a8f0a6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d4a0cb61b72940018a8f0a6","movie_id":458723}

It stars Jason Clarke, Amy Seimetz, John Lithgow, Jet\u00e9 Laurence and Hugo and Lucas Lavoie. Music is by Christopher Young and cinematography by Laurie Rose.   \r\n\r\nDr. Louis Creed and his wife, Rachel, move from Boston to Ludlow, in rural Maine, with their two young children.

Itself a simply ordinary adaptation from what is a very good book, you would have thought the 2019 version would at least bring some fresh life to the story. Yet albeit that some changes have been made (one of which was moronically shown in the trailers), it's still a re-tread that has failed to entice newcomers to this world. \r\n\r\nThere's some good on show, though. Child actor Jet\u00e9 Laurence is excellent, particularly in the latter part of the pic. The design for the Pet Sematary and the surrounding areas are splendidly eerie, with photographer Rose deserving a better film really. While the sound work out at the special place is also bang on the tonal money.\r\n\r\nThe ending has provided much division, but personally it was a change that I liked. Two writers and two directors came up with this adaptation, but they didn't get much right between them and the pic feels like a compromised cash cow.

Let there be God, let there be Sunday morning, let there be smiling Episcopalian ministers in shining white surplices\u2026but let there not be these dark and draggling horrors on the nightside of the universe._\r\n\r\n- Stephen King; _Pet Sematary_ (1983)\r\n\r\nIn Stephen King's celebrated (and massive) _oeuvre_, his 1983 novel _Pet Sematary_ (the misspelling is intentional) is something of a curio. Although reasonably well received at the time, critics have never considered it worthy of the kind of attention lavished on work such as _The Shining_ (1977), _The Stand_ (1978), _The Deadzone_ (1979), _The Dark Tower_ series (introduced in 1982), _It_ (1986), _Misery_ (1987), _The Green Mile_ (1996), or _Under the Dome_ (2009). Fans of King, however, have long championed it as one of his most emotionally devastating and philosophically complex works, whilst King himself considers it the scariest novel he's ever written. And although on the surface, the plot is as schlocky as they come, buried underneath is an examination of grief and how it can compromise one's ability to act rationally. Much as _The Shining_ was really about alcoholism and a descent into madness, _Pet Sematary_ is about emotional trauma, guilt, the importance of family, and the question of what happens after we die.\r\n\r\nWritten by Jeff Buhler (_The Midnight Meat Train_; _The Prodigy_), from an initial script by Matt Greenberg (_Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later_; _Reign of Fire_; _1408_), who's credited with \"screen story by\", and directed by Kevin K\u00f6lsch and Dennis Widmyer (_Starry Eyes_), _Pet Sematary_ comes in the midst of something of a resurgence for the Stephen King adaptation industry. Recent adaptations include Nikolaj Arcel's risible _The Dark Tower_, Mike Flanagan's excellent _Gerald's Game_, Andy Muschietti's massively successful and massively overrated jump-scare-reliant _It: Chapter One_ (all 2017), with Flanagan's _Doctor Sleep_, Muschietti's _It: Chapter Two_, James Wan's _The Tommyknockers_, and Mike Barker's _The Talisman_ (amongst others) currently in production, whilst on the small screen, _Mr. Mercedes_ is entering its third season and _Castle Rock_ its second, with new versions of _The Stand_ and _The Dark Tower_ forthcoming. However, for me, much like _It: Chapter One_, _Pet Sematary_ doesn't really work. It's certainly better that Mary Lambert's 1989 filmic adaptation, for which King himself wrote the script, but it pales in comparison to the novel. Granted, most films suffer when compared to a source text; even Stanley Kubrick's _The Shining_ (1980), although a masterpiece as a standalone film, is a terrible adaptation of the novel. _Pet Sematary_, which relies far too heavily on jump scares, is especially disappointing in this sense insofar as it starts off very strongly, taking care to respectfully modernise the novel's themes and examine the characters' underlying emotions, before descending into absolute stupidity in the last act. King was fully on board with the film (he was fully on board with _The Dark Tower_ too), but Buhler changes numerous aspects of the story; some of these changes work very well, but many don't, with a new ending, in particular, substituting cheap shock for the lingering sense of psychological and esoteric hopelessness with which King's original so memorably concludes.\r\n\r\nLouis Creed (the prolific Jason Clarke), a doctor from Boston, moves to the town of Ludlow, Maine with his wife Rachel (Amy Seimetz), their eight-year-old daughter Ellie (Jet\u00e9 Laurence), three-year-old son Gage (Hugo and Lucas Lavoie), and Ellie's beloved cat, Church. In the woods surrounding their house, Ellie finds a pet cemetery but is cautioned against exploring further by their friendly neighbour, Jud Crandall (John Lithgow). Several weeks later, Louis and Jud find Church dead, and Jud, who has grown very close to Ellie and doesn't wish to see her suffer, takes Louis to an ancient Mi'kmaq burial ground behind the cemetery, instructing Louis to bury Church. The next day, Louis is stunned when Church returns home, although considerably more aggressive than before he died. Jud explains that anything buried in that place comes back to life, although very different from how it was, with local legend suggesting that returnees are possessed or controlled by some sort of malevolent spirit. A few days later, the Creed family suffers an unspeakable tragedy, and guessing what Louis plans to do, Jud tells him not to return to the burial ground. Louis, however, has no intention of heeding his warnings.\r\n\r\nKing's _Pet Sematary_ is a very loose retelling of W.W. Jacob's 1902 short story, \"The Monkey's Paw\" from _The Lady of the Barge_ anthology, in which a man is given three wishes, setting off a chain of events that results in the death and subsequent resurrection of his son. When the film version was first revealed, there was a lot of online grumbling about the big change from the original - it's Ellie and not Gage who is killed in the film, and whom Louis decides to bring back (if this was supposed to be a twist, someone forgot to tell the marketing people, because it's right there in the trailer). Speaking to _Flickering Myth_, Clarke defended the change, explaining,\r\n\r\n> _it's pretty easy to justify. You can't play that movie with a three-year-old boy. You end up with a doll or some animated thing. So you're going to get a much deeper, richer story by swapping for a seven-year-old or nine-year-old girl. The reward will come. People who are upset will hopefully see the benefit of it. But a lot of people didn't have an issue. Stephen King didn't have an issue with it._\r\n\r\nHe makes a good point. Indeed, speaking to _EW_ the following month, King himself said,\r\n\r\n> _it's something different. They did a good job. Boy, I saw all the stuff that came online when people realised that it was Ellie rather than Gage that got run over in the road, and I'm thinking like, \"Man, these people...\" It's so nuts. You can take Route 301 and go to Tampa, or you could take Route 17 and go to Tampa. But both times, you're gonna come out at Tampa! You know what I'm saying? It didn't change anything for me. I thought, \"Okay, I understand why they did it, because it's maybe easier to work with a zombie when she's a little girl than a toddler\"._\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think the alteration actually improves the story - as in the novel, it's Ellie with whom Louis and Rachel have portentous conversations about what happens after we die, and having her be the one killed establishes a more coherent thematic through-line.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of themes, much like the novel, the film is primarily focused on grief. I've always loved King's ability to \"hide\" serious themes behind what are ostensibly rote horror stories (he's so good at hiding them that literary academics don't believe they're even there, refusing to afford him a place on the canon); in 2003, Yale University's Sterling Professor of Humanities Harold Bloom famously said,\r\n\r\n> _the decision to give the National Book Foundation's annual award for \"distinguished contribution\" to Stephen King is extraordinary, another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life. I've described King in the past as a writer of penny dreadfuls, but perhaps even that is too kind. He shares nothing with Edgar Allan Poe. What he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis. The publishing industry has stooped terribly low to bestow on King a lifetime award that has previously gone to the novelists Saul Bellow and Philip Roth and to playwright Arthur Miller. By awarding it to King they recognise nothing but the commercial value of his books, which sell in the millions but do little more for humanity than keep the publishing world afloat. If this is going to be the criterion in the future, then perhaps next year the committee should give its award for distinguished contribution to Danielle Steel, and surely the Nobel Prize for literature should go to J.K. Rowling._\r\n\r\nIn 2014, he told the BBC, \"_Stephen King is beneath the notice of any serious reader who has experienced Proust, Joyce, Henry James, Faulkner and all the other masters of the novel_\".\r\n\r\nAnd yes, _Pet Sematary_ does feature a sentient zombie child, so it's unlikely to ever achieve the status of the fiction of, say, Virginia Woolf, but its core is the emotional trauma suffered by Louis and how his uncontrollable grief drives him to do something unspeakable. His heartache is such that his logic centre simply stops functioning; not only does he completely accept the fact that Ellie can be brought back, but he also ignores Jud's warnings that she will not be his Ellie. Like in the book, he's a man of science, who clashes with Rachel about what to tell Ellie regarding death - she wants to talk about an afterlife, he wants to focus on the finality of death as something natural and unavoidable. This is a smart choice by King, as Louis becomes the one who refuses to let death have the final word, with his conscious mind unable to accept the random tragedy that has befallen him, and whose entire purpose in life comes to be focused on the fact that Rachel was (at least in part) correct, that there is something after death. He must forget everything he has ever known about the corporeal world in order to travel the path down which Ellie's death launches him; this gives him an inbuilt arc, from a man of medicine to a believer in resurrection.\r\n\r\nRachel's arc, and again, this is excellent writing by King and well handled in the film, moves in the opposite direction to Louis's - she accepts the finality of Ellie's death, and reacts in horror when she learns what her husband has done. Her arc is rendered more complex insofar as she also suffers crippling guilt because of the death of her sister Zelda (Alyssa Brooke Levine) when they were still children. Suffering from severe spinal meningitis, Rachel couldn't help but look at Zelda as a monster. One night, whilst their parents were out, Rachel made dinner for Zelda, but because she was afraid of her, rather than bringing it to the room in which Zelda was confined, she used the faulty dumb waiter to send it to her, leading to Zelda falling into the shaft and breaking her neck (a hideous death unflinchingly depicted in the film). Whereas Louis's arc is more concerned with the question of what it takes for a rational man to abandon everything he knows to be unassailably true about the nature of existence, Rachel's looks at questions of survivor guilt and how one is supposed to come back from having one's life shattered (of course, it's the very fact that Rachel had this early-life trauma that gives her the tools with which to cope with Ellie's death).\r\n\r\nThis is seriously heavy, unsettling stuff, and it's how King engages with it that has made the novel such a fan-favourite. And for about two-thirds of the runtime, the film deals reasonably convincingly with these issues. Sure, it moves faster than the novel, but that's more to do with the nature of medium than anything else. Even after Louis brings Ellie back, the film is still fairly leisurely paced, letting us observe his disintegrating mental state (one especially good scene sees him lying in bed next to the newly resurrected Ellie, with Clarke playing him as a man trying to convince himself that what is happening is perfectly normal). Whereas Kubrick largely ignored the themes of alcoholism and abuse in _The Shining_, K\u00f6lsch and Widmyer go in the opposite direction - grief and guilt are really the only things on which they focus. At least up to the point when they seem to forget about them entirely, as the third act descends into a ridiculously campy series of murders, attempted murders, and all-round violence, reminding me of the end of Shakespeare's _Titus Andronicus_, where Lucius kills Saturninus because Saturninus killed Titus because Titus killed Tamora because Tamora had Lavinia raped because Titus defeated Tamora in battle.\r\n\r\nThe last half-hour or so of the film is as superficial and immature as anything in any King adaptation, and the new \"twist\" ending not only doesn't work on its own terms, it completely undercuts both King's original themes, and how well the film itself had handled those themes earlier on, replacing King's bleakly poetic _d\u00e9nouement_ with something right out of \"_horror clich\u00e9s for dummies_\". In general terms, I've no problem with filmmakers altering the end of a literary adaptation; the finale of Frank Darabont's _The Mist_ (2007), for example, is completely different from King's novel, but it replicates the tone and spirit of the original, eliciting similar emotions from the audience. However, if you're going to alter the end of an adaptation, you absolutely need something that works, both in the context of the adaptation itself, and in its relationship to the original. _Pet Sematary_'s new ending does neither. The whole point of the end of the novel was that Louis learns nothing from his experience bringing Gage back, convincing himself that there were tangible reasons it didn't work, and under different circumstances, Gage would have returned as the Gage he was in life. The tragedy of the novel is that, lost in madness and despair, Louis repeats his mistakes. The end of the film has none of this, with the final shot more of a silly \"dun-dun-duuuun\" moment than anything with any emotional complexity.\r\n\r\nThe new ending may be the biggest problem, but it's by no means the only one. Another is something common to many films - an overly idealised family. An especially egregious example of this was Jordan Peele's _Us_ (2019), and there's more of the same here; much more so than in the novel, the Creeds are a picture postcard family, where everybody just loves everybody else so much, dad is always cracking jokes, sister hates annoying little brother (but loves him really), and parents talk to their kids like they're already fully grown adults. It's easy to see why this trope is usually found in horror and revenge movies - the more idealised the depiction when everything is going well, the more heartbreaking it will be when things go wrong. But just because the purpose is apparent, doesn't mean it isn't a clich\u00e9, and the Creeds of the film elicit some serious eye-rolling. Another big problem is the aforementioned trailer, which not only tells us about the switch from Ellie to Gage, but which also gives away a major plot point from just prior to the finale, which, if I hadn't already known about from the novel, would have been ruined. Speaking of Ellie, she doesn't just get hit by a truck, she's flattened by a massive tanker that should have turned her into a pancake, but when Louis picks her body up, she's still whole, and when we see her in the coffin, there's literally not a mark on her. Why make the crash so spectacular in the first place when the body has to be intact for the rest of the movie?\r\n\r\nThe film also leaves out a lot (almost all) of the backstory concerning the burial ground. So, there's no extended flashback telling the story of Bill Bateman and what happened when he resurrected his son Timmy, whose body had been shipped home after he was killed in WWII, although Louis does briefly come across a news article about a Vietnam veteran named Timmy Bateman who returned from the dead many years previously. Additionally, the rich mythology of the burial ground and the role of the Wendigo (an evil necromantic spirit spoken of in Algonquin folklore) is mostly absent; Louis sees a picture of the Wendigo in a book (that's in the trailer too), but it's unnamed, and later, he thinks he sees something in the distance of the fog-shrouded forest, but that's as close as we ever get to the spirit that turns up a couple of times in King's mythology (as well as _Pet Sematary_, it also features in _The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon_). These changes aren't overly surprising, however, as they speak to the streamlining that all narratives must undergo when being adapted for the screen.\r\n\r\nThere is one extremely irritating omission, however. In the film, Jud is full of dire warnings about the evil of the burial ground and the danger of using its powers (\"_sometimes, dead is better_\"; \"_that place has a power...its own evil purpose_\"), which makes you wonder why he told Louis about it in the first place. The film tries to explain this by showing us that Jud doesn't want to see Ellie upset over Church's death, which makes not a lick of sense and is grossly out of character, evidenced by the fact that literally the day after showing Louis the burial ground, Jud is already warning him about its dangers. In the novel, however, he has a different reason. When his wife, Norma (absent from the film), has a heart attack, Louis saves her life, and in return, Jud tells him about the burial ground by way of thanks. It's still a poor way of having Louis learn about the site, but it's a damn sight better than \"_I didn't want your daughter to be upset about her cat dying, so I'm going to tell you how to make a demon cat!_\"\r\n\r\nAs a novel, _Pet Sematary_ is a study of grief and childhood trauma first, a horror narrative second. Investigating our psychological reaction to death, the book probes how far we might go to ensure a loved one never leaves us. As a film, _Pet Sematary_ seems to be charting a similar course, until it abandons this tack in favour of a shock-for-shock's sake ending. Much like _It: Chapter One_, there is an over-reliance on predictable and silly jump scares, and ultimately, what could have been a mature and emotionally affecting story gives in to the worst excesses of the genre, betraying both itself and the original novel.","id":"5d574488bc86576e722f03fb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d574488bc86576e722f03fb","movie_id":157433}

{"author":"narrator56","content":"I really enjoyed this movie. Right out of the gate, you must accept that it is a fantasy rather than science-fiction, because the latter genre usually tries to give some sort of explanation for why something happens, but here we just take it as it is. \r\n\r\nThe dialogue is mostly witty and fun, and the characters got my sympathy. I had a slight problem with the two lead characters having always been platonic, as it was never fully explained why that was. But I was able to put that aside. Plus I really liked seeing the third lead character, the Mini Cooper (okay, yes, I have owned one for nearly twenty years).\r\n\r\nPart of the ending could be considered predictable, and part of it was, but another piece of the conclusion astonished me in its originality, so it worked for me. One interesting subplot revolved around a couple of people who shared the knowledge about the Beatles that drives the story, and I was surprised and pleased at how they resolved that subplot. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, to deal with the elephant in the room, most of the songs presented in the movie were better when the Beatles performed them, but isn't that the point? I had no problem setting that fact aside and enjoying this harmless and entertaining film. Oh, and I appreciate what a good sport Ed Sheeran is in this movie, allowing the lead character to more or less beat him in a songwriting contest (though of course Ed really won). In this movie, everybody wins (Well, except of course for the fictional Beatles, unless you can imagine they would prefer where the fantay lands them.)","id":"5e873fdeaf58cb0012e31978","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e873fdeaf58cb0012e31978","movie_id":515195}

{"author":"Matthew Brady","content":"\u201cThis is how *I* win.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne of the most stressful movie experiences I\u2019ve had in awhile.\r\n\r\nThis whole movie runs entirely on acid and how the series of events unfold was particularly stressful. People constantly talking or yelling over each other while the brilliant sound work made the space around them feel so tight, but incredibly claustrophobic.\r\n\r\nWhile I like \u2018Good Time\u2019 a little more, but man what a rush.\r\n\r\nAdam Sandler is absolutely terrific as the greedy and sleazy Howard Ratner. If he's working with a good director, a strong supporting cast, and an interesting concept, Sandler will thrive. We follow Howard Ratner, a jewelry store owner in New York with a serious gambling problem that makes the hole his standing in deeper and deeper. Despite every terrible decision his character made...I still felt sorry for him. I think it has to do with Sandler's devilish charm that won me over into pitting such a petty crook. He isn\u2019t a loser, he\u2019s a winner who doesn't win. It\u2019s one of his best performance right beside \u2018Punch Drunk Love\u2019.\r\n\r\nBenny and Josh Safdie are such vibrant directors that can inject so much style while also having a harsh look to it, which ties in with the slimy side of business. The Safdie Brothers are building a solid career for themselves. Darius Khondji outstanding cinematography is the glue that holds this high tension of a movie together.\r\n\r\nI loved the score from Daniel Lopatin, which will often drown out the dialogue as the retro rift comes blasting through. On the other hand, there\u2019s also a slow mystical vibe that Lopatin composes that gave me a surreal feeling of levitating.\r\n\r\nKevin Garnett is surprisingly really good in this movie. A professional basketball player actually delivering a solid performance is almost unheard of. It kinda reminds me of Tyler Perry \u2018Gone Girl\u2019, in terms of your expectations from them vs what you got. I also couldn\u2019t believe this is Julia Fox first acting debut, because she\u2019s fantastic in the movie.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: While I\u2019m only two movies into their filmography, Safdie Brothers are upon my favorite working directors.\r\n\r\nI hope they make another movie like 'Good Time' & 'Uncut Gems', so it can called the LSD trilogy.","id":"5e2f2c14ac8e6b0015bcdb9e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2f2c14ac8e6b0015bcdb9e","movie_id":473033}
{"author":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","content":"Brothers and co-directors Josh and Benny Safdie are two of the most exciting names working in modern independent cinema, so their film \u201cUncut Gems\u201d debuted alongside a shadow of grandiose expectations. The bottom line is that the film is good but far from great, and I\u2019m comfortable going out on a limb and guessing those crowing the loudest about how fresh and original this movie is haven\u2019t seen their far superior 2017 film, \u201cGood Time.\u201d\r\n\r\nNew York City jeweler Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) is always on the lookout for the next big score. When he makes a series of high stakes bets that could lead to the windfall of a lifetime, Howard finds himself struggling to keep the balance between the growing list of adversaries, his business, his scams, and his home life. There isn\u2019t much to the story other than a lot of cursing and ongoing scams, but there\u2019s a decent sense of suspense that carries through the majority of the film.\r\n\r\nThe most shocking thing about \u201cUncut Gems\u201d is that it lacks depth, especially when compared to \u201cGood Time.\u201d It\u2019s not unfair to compare the two films, as each portray a gritty side of the city with antiheros who are close to completely hitting the skids. An effective crime thriller should have a lead character you can at least root for if not relate to, and Howard isn\u2019t it. Sandler\u2019s character is an irritating scumbag and while I guess that\u2019s what he was going for in his performance, it\u2019s shrill and unpleasant to spend time around this loser. I didn\u2019t really care to see the end of Howard\u2019s story because by the time it rolled around, I was completely worn down by his repeated poor decisions.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s what happens in the film: Howard lies, gets cash, gambles it away, extends himself, gets a beating \/ stern warning \/ workplace visit from goons, then lies, gets cash, gambles it away, extends himself, and gets another beat down \/ visit from more goons. It\u2019s an exhausting repetition of watching a sleazy scumbag spiraling out of control by digging himself deeper into a hole. His cycle of poor decisions is coupled with an indestructible optimism of a life-changing big score. Why should I care about somebody like that?\r\n\r\nSandler is good in the lead role, but much of the praise seems to be coming from the fact that, after a career in comedy films, his performance is unexpected. He\u2019s a talented man, but he\u2019s been even better in other, smaller films (like Noah Baumbach\u2019s \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories\u201d). Howard is a loud, crude, unpleasant man to spend time with, but Sandler inhabits the role as a shady jewelry dealer and degenerate gambler in a way that lends the slightest glimmer of humanity to an otherwise detestable character.\r\n\r\nThe film plays like a hardcore, taxing Scorsese ripoff. It\u2019s not very exciting, and the tension that does exist feels forced. The direction is more conventional than the material suggests, but major applause to the Safdie brothers for conveying their clear vision and having the courage to stick with it. They\u2019ve started to corner the cinematic market on adapting the gritty side of New York for a modern era. I don\u2019t feel the Safdies are as overrated as some other critics do, but I do think this film is bloated in all the wrong ways.","id":"5e7d56b9eec4f34267aa04aa","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e7d56b9eec4f34267aa04aa","movie_id":473033}

It's a film where you know from the first ten minutes that sooner or later, he won't be able to worm his way out of one of his mistakes, and at that point, his seemingly unshakable optimism and belief in his own delusions will prove ill-equipped to deal with the reckoning. So from the first act, you're on edge, and you remain there for the duration. It's a film that never stops moving at the chaotic breakneck speed with which it begins, a film possessed of energy nearly queasy in nature. So, two hours and fifteen minutes of rapidly-paced stress-inducing cinema about a deluded hustler screwing up? Sounds fun doesn't it? No, of course it doesn't. However, it has been made with such craft, the _mise en sc\u00e8ne_ is so good, the dialogue so sharp, the acting so intense, that you may as well be watching a fly-on-the-wall documentary. It's a film made of pure sweat and anxiety, and it's about as stressful an experience as you can have at the movies. It's also superb, and I'd highly recommend it.\r\n\r\nThe film begins in 2010 in Welo Mine, Ethiopia, with the discovery of an ultra-rare black opal of extraordinary translucence. We then cut to New York in 2012, where Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) is a charismatic jeweller who lives his life on the principle of robbing Peter to pay Paul. A serious gambling addict, he always has at least one hustle going, and he always owes somebody something. Soon after we meet him, it's revealed that he's currently in debt to his loan-shark brother-in-law Arno (the great Eric Bogosian) to the tune of $100,000, and Arno is having such a hard time with him, that he's had to hire two Boston thugs, Phil (Keith Williams Richards) and Nico (Tommy Kominik), to try to muscle Howard into paying the money back. Meanwhile, his jewellery business is doing well, not the least reason for which is his colleague Demany (Lakeith Stanfield), who helps bring in high-profile clients. The latest example of such is Boston Celtics' basketballer Kevin Garnett (a surprisingly strong performance by Garnett himself). As Garnett is browsing the store, it's revealed that Howard has smuggled the black opal into the country for an auction the following day, where he expects it will sell for up to $1 million. However, when Garnett sees the stone, he insists he is allowed to have it as a lucky charm, just for the match he's playing that night. Howard is reluctant but agrees to part with it when Garnett offers to leave his All-Star ring as collateral (which Howard immediately pawns for money to place a bet on Garnett's game). And, predictably, things quickly go awry.\r\n\r\nAnd all of this is to say nothing of his contemptuous wife Dinah (Idina Menzel), who has grown to loathe him over the years and considers their marriage a sham; his na\u00efve but kindly colleague and mistress Julia (Julia Fox), with whom he shares an apartment; his father-in-law Gooey (Judd Hirsch), who always seems to see the best in him; and his children, Marcel (Noa Fisher), Eddie (Jonathan Aranbayev), and Beni (Jacob Igielski), none of whom have any illusions about who their father is.\r\n\r\nHoward is a delusional and doomed figure about whom there's a hint of Cosmo Vittelli (Ben Gazzara) \u2013 the gambling addict wannabe social climber who keeps slipping on the ladder's lowest rungs in John Cassavetes's _The Killing of a Chinese Bookie_ (1976). However, whereas Vittelli is driven to a point of despair by his own work ethic, Howard is very much the product of late capitalism; a man who genuinely believes, despite past experience to the contrary, that his big score is right around the next corner. In this respect, the film is a deconstruction of the concomitant globalised alienation; a system capable of drawing into a single self-delusional orbit such varied parties as exploited Ethiopian manual labourers, small business owners in New York, under-pressure athletes, loan-sharks, and bookies \u2013 all operating with the unshakable belief that a huge win is just within their grasp. Howard, of course, is the worst example, and is essentially a fantasist who's utterly divorced from reality, a man who believes completely that if people would get out of his way and let him turn that fabled corner, all of his worries will disappear. It's the gambling addict's fallacy \u2013 no matter how much or how often you lose, the next bet will be the big winner. The problem Howard faces is that he has made promises based on that fallacy \u2013 he owes money which he can only pay if his latest scheme works out _exactly_ as intended; such is the precarious house of cards that is his life.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, the film is an especially astute study of addiction, although this theme is never foregrounded \u2013 no one accuses Howard of being a gambling addict, and he certainly doesn't seem to think of himself as one. This is not a cautionary tale about the perils of addiction. Indeed it even goes so far as to play up (if not necessarily glamorise) the gambler's high \u2013 the precarious sense of everything being on the line, consequences be damned, the sense that if one thing goes wrong, everything collapses, but if everything goes right\u2026 However, if you're paying even the slightest bit of attention, you can't help but see just how hopelessly consumed Howard is by his addiction (never once does he give the impression that he wants to stop gambling). It has wormed its way into every facet of his life, to the point where it has become his life, or certainly a hugely important part of that life. This is why delusion is such a major component in his psychological make-up \u2013 addiction and delusion form an ever-tightening feedback loop that becomes more difficult from which to escape, the more self-sustaining they become.\r\n\r\nIn terms of aesthetics, it's worth noting that two of the three writers (Bronstein and Benny Safdie) are also credited as the editors, and this is crucial insofar as the frenetic pace of the narrative isn't achieved only by the cutting, but by the script as well \u2013 this is a film written by people with at least one eye on the editing rhythms. The first scenes in New York, for example, immediately establish the chaotic energy \u2013 Howard speaking rapidly into his mobile, dialogue overlapping almost unintelligibly as multiple characters interact and talk over one another, at least three things always happening, each one of which would occupy our complete attention in a more conventional film. Here, it's almost like everything is a background to everything else, with nothing ever given a sustained sole focus. The opening scenes establish the pace as blistering, and that never really changes. It's the kind of film where there's perpetual propulsive momentum \u2013 because the characters never stop moving, neither does the story, even if the characters never actually manage to get anywhere. The score, by Oneohtrix Point Never, is also excellent. Obviously inspired by Tangerine Dream's electronic scores for Michael Mann's early films, most notably _Thief_ (1981), it's an unexpectedly crucial element of the film, adding to the overlapping cacophony of sounds and enhancing the general sense of twitchy chaos.\r\n\r\nAs for the acting, everything you've heard about Sandler is true; he's incredible. The Safdies originally pitched him the script in 2009, but he turned it down and the project went nowhere. In 2017, after the success of _Good Time_, they resurrected the film and cast Jonah Hill as Howard, but when he dropped out, they offered it to Sandler again. And he totally and completely inhabits Howard, to the extent where it no longer even seems like acting. And sure, he's playing the same kind of volatile delusional loser that he's played in a million-and-one subpar comedies. But it's the tone of the performance, the key in which he plays Howard that makes it stand out. You could make the argument that Howard is simply Sandler dialled up to 11, and you wouldn't be wrong, but the inherent tragedy of the man, his self-delusion, his seemingly unquenchable optimism and belief in himself \u2013 Sandler draws these elements out every second he's on-screen, finding pathos in virtually everything he does, in a performance that's both subtle and broad. I'm no Sandler apologist, but he really does have to be seen here to be believed. Elsewhere, Bogosian is his usual stoically intimidating self; first-time performers Williams Richards and Kominik are each as terrifying and authentic as the other; Menzel manages some of the most withering looks ever captured on film; and Fox, another impressive debutant, imbues what could have been a clich\u00e9d bimbo-type role with real emotional nuance.\r\n\r\nAs for problems, the pace of the film will certainly put some people off. There are no down-moments here, no scenes designed to let the audience breath. This is as anxiety-inducing a film as you're likely to see, and that simply won't be to everyone's taste. Partly because of this, the tone never really varies. There are some comic beats (Howard getting dumped naked into a car trunk during his daughter's school play is particularly funny), but by and large, the tone is perpetually dark, ominous, and exhausting. Which, again, won't be for everyone. And there will, of course, be people who just can't get past the presence of Adam Sandler, which I can understand. Personally though, I loved _Uncut Gems_. It's certainly not the subtlest of films, nor the most thematically complex, but as character studies go, this is exceptionally good work from everyone involved and a genuinely unique piece of cinema.","id":"5e2ba36d688cd00015c80315","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2ba36d688cd00015c80315","movie_id":473033}
{"author":"Luis_989","content":"Adam Sandler's best performance? No. But it's indeed his best since Punch-Drunk Love, which continues to be the pinnacle of his talent.\r\n\r\nWhile the film isn't the best talking about technique, it seems to me that its style is totally focused on making the experience an exhausting one. And Uncut Gems is an overwhelming journey full of anxiety and stress. It achieved that splendidly.\r\nThat's its greatest accomplishment: To immerse you in the entire atmosphere of the environment that Sandler's character inhabits, while we witness the cascade of bad decisions he makes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest mistake is how the directors get to over-lengthen the story, which indirectly gets to a point where Sandler's character becomes obnoxious but I think that's part of the experience, because who ever in their right mind would feel more sympathy for a person like him? I mean more than the allowed sympathy anyways.\r\n\r\nIts ending, although predictable is certainly what he built and there's no learning in it and it doesn't need to be.\r\nAfter all the story was his decline while he believed that he was going to succeed.

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this is a spoiler-free review of Far From Home, but NOT of Avengers: Endgame! So, if you still didn\u2019t watch the latter or heard what happens in it (by some inexplicable reason), this is a SPOILER WARNING for the events of that era-ending film. Moving on to the web-slinger, this sequel is everything it should be and a bit more. It beautifully encapsulates how everyone\u2019s feeling about the central death of Endgame, especially Peter Parker. I wished Jon Watts would put a lot of focus into Spider-Man\u2019s grief and I hoped that a big part of the plot would be him just having to deal with the fact that his mentor\/father figure is gone. He can\u2019t continue to just be the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. He needs to grow up and become what everyone expects of him: to be the best of them all.\r\n\r\nWatts does all of it. There are so many emotionally powerful dialogues featuring Nick Fury or Happy (Jon Favreau) or even just moments with Tom Holland just standing alone and having to breathe through the pain of losing someone you love. The pressure that everyone is putting on his shoulders is immense, maybe too much for a simple teenager, but he\u2019s everything but simple. I love every single bit of story dedicated to Peter and Tony Stark\u2019s (Robert Downey Jr.) relationship. Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers wrote a wonderful screenplay, and Jon Watts executed it seamlessly. However, the reason why all of this works is due to Tom Holland\u2019s performance.\r\n\r\nHe said in an interview he would play Spider-Man until he can and until producers let him. I hope he stays around for years without end. He\u2019s not only my favorite on-screen Spider-Man but my favorite on-screen Peter Parker as well. I love how he spends most of the movie holding on to his feelings, and in the last act, he just lashes out because he can\u2019t take it anymore. He left my eyes close to tearing up in probably the best dialogue of the film with Happy. As a superhero, he perfectly embodies what Spidey is all about, and Holland has the plus of doing most of his action stunts. As a teenager, he\u2019s incredibly funny, innocent, and he still doesn\u2019t know how to deal with falling in love or having a crush, which leads me to the second of the three main storylines of this movie: his relationship with MJ. \r\n\r\nZendaya did get some criticism from fans who, well, don\u2019t like the fact that MJ is not the same one as in Sam Raimi\u2019s original trilogy (physically and psychologically). Same for Holland and the fact that this Spider-Man has a lot more \u201cgadgets\u201d than Tobey Maguire\u2019s. For those people, I only have one advice: understand that this is a distinct universe with different takes on characters we know and with other stories to tell which are, in fact, the closest we had to the comics so far. The sooner you accept this, the easier will be for you to enjoy these films. Having that in mind, MJ didn\u2019t have much to do in Homecoming. Actually, she was even played as a post-credits twist so that the sequel could focus more on her \u2026 and it did.\r\n\r\nTheir relationship gradually evolves throughout the movie smoothly and realistically. They\u2019re teenagers! Having their first crush, trying to come up with a good time and place to tell the other they like them, being nervous when they\u2019re together and being anxious when they\u2019re separated \u2026 Watts handled this subplot very well. It didn\u2019t feel forced (rom-coms should take some tips), Zendaya and Holland\u2019s chemistry is palpable, and I love this new MJ. Most of the superhero\u2019s lovers are the cliche damsel in distress, always needing saving and making dumb decisions. Zendaya\u2019s MJ not only can handle herself, but she has an unique personality that makes her stand out.\r\n\r\nFinally, the third and last storyline relies on Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). I can\u2019t really get in-depth about this character because he has a massive impact on the narrative, but I can guarantee that Gyllenhaal makes this character work. I like how they approached Mysterio, but if it wasn\u2019t for the outstanding actor that Gyllenhaal is, Far From Home would have suffered a bit. The relationship between him and Spider-Man is well-developed, but the character of Mysterio lacked better treatment. There\u2019s an exposition dump midway through the runtime that\u2019s just horrible. Really, really bad. However, the film moves on and gets better until it reaches the last 45 minutes, which are unbelievable.\r\n\r\nI will always prefer a slow start and a fantastic finish than the other way around. Far From Home struggles with the first two acts\u2019 pacing, but the last one compensates that with some of the best action a Spider-Man movie ever had! There are so many sequences where our superheroes are just going at it, flying and swinging across buildings, bridges, and rivers like we\u2019ve seen before, only better. The CGI looked like it could be excessive in the trailers, but instead, it\u2019s some of the best Marvel has shown us. Nevertheless, the jaw-dropping scenes are some that involve illusions, very much like Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) had in his origin flick. Spider-Man has two memorable sequences (the VFX here are mind-blowing), one of which incorporates a certain superpower not seen in the MCU so far (officially, at least). The kid in me was smiling with pure joy, let\u2019s write that.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s on par with Homecoming. One is better than the other in various areas, but they\u2019re extremely different, so comparing them might be unfair. The first had the goal of introducing a \u201cnew\u201d character to the MCU, so the focus relied solely on Peter Parker having to deal with his powers and being the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. This sequel is set so far away from the origin story and so much happened between these two that if people chose to watch them back-to-back, they wouldn\u2019t understand much of what\u2019s going on. Nevertheless, Far From Home still has its own issues.\r\n\r\nLike I wrote above, the first two acts struggle with its pacing. While it\u2019s refreshing to watch Spider-Man in other cities besides New York, the transitions between them are ridiculously fast, especially one that takes Peter Parker to another country in such an illogical way. The film tries to play off these less rational moments with comedy bits quite often and sometimes it just doesn\u2019t work, affecting both the tone and pacing. I liked Ned in Homecoming, and I also enjoyed his presence here, but this time he almost felt like just a comic relief guy instead of that essential \u201csidekick\u201d to Spider-Man. Michael Giacchino\u2019s score is good, but for some reason, I couldn\u2019t really connect with it, which I think it\u2019s the first time I don\u2019t exactly love Giacchino\u2019s themes. Finally, the comedy skits could be better, they don\u2019t land that many times and the one supposedly funny scene I remember is the absolute worst.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I still had a blast! I think I prefer Far From Home to Homecoming since the latter deals with a much more complex and emotionally compelling story than the origin flick. The action is some of the MCU\u2019s best and definitely as great as Spider-Man\u2019s action ever was, featuring some mind-bending, astonishing sequences. The cast is brilliant, especially Tom Holland who cements his spot as the best on-screen web-slinger ever. Zendaya and Jon Favreau are also amazing, but I have to praise Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s performance because he\u2019s just awesome every single time. It\u2019s the movie the MCU needed after the tragic events of Endgame. It works because we feel what Peter Parker\u2019s feeling and we can deal with our grief with the help of Spider-Man\u2019s journey in this film. Aside from some minor problems with pacing, comedy, and exposition, the last act plus the two post-credits scenes, which have a tremendous impact on the movie and on what\u2019s to come on Phase Four, are more than enough for you to go see this film at the theater. Don\u2019t miss it!\r\n\r\nRating: B+","id":"5d23564b15c6364753f412f7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d23564b15c6364753f412f7","movie_id":429617}

I didn\u2019t exactly regret having forked out the money to watch it in the cinema but that\u2019s about it. It\u2019s far from a great movie and the end scene\u2026well it\u2019s a typical really crappy Hollywood ending where the writer cannot be bothered to spend time creating something intelligent so he just goes for the usual sensationalist cliffhanger bullshit.\r\n\r\nAs with the previous movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming, this is a Spider-Man for kids, or at least younger people, movie which perhaps is part of why I am somewhat lukewarm towards it. This one did not feel as childish as the previous one but there is still a lot of teenage angst and rubbish in it. The plot is of course highly predictable as well.\r\n\r\nThe special effects on the other hand are quite good and essentially what makes the movie worth watching. At least to me. The end fight with hundreds of those drones flying around intermixed with Mysterio\u2019s illusions where quite cool.

Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) gets a look-in once again after her very disappointing absence from 99.99% of \u2018Endgame\u2019, but she\u2019s wasted on screen, serving little to no purpose. And while this film finally gives us a Peter\/MJ love story, it\u2019s all too familiar territory - not because of the characters involved but because we saw Peter pursue a crush in \u2018Homecoming\u2019. We also saw him try to balance the student\/hero sides of his life then too. This is THIS Peter Parker\u2019s fifth time on the rollercoaster. We\u2019ve seen him and fell in love with him as the sweet, innocent kid who had greatness thrust upon him and his thirst to be a superhero. He had his shot in the ring - several times in fact - and now we need to see him grow, but they\u2019ve just given us much of the same. We need to know where this is going, not just watch a kid play dress-ups time and time again.\r\n- Jess Fenton\r\n\r\nRead Jess' full article...\r\nhttps:\/\/www.maketheswitch.com.au\/article\/review-spider-man-far-from-home-in-a-post-iron-man-world-spideys-still-the-same-insecure-kid","id":"5d16ef595b4fed001e4684c9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d16ef595b4fed001e4684c9","movie_id":429617}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_An impressive eco-thriller that could do with more clearly delineated characters_**\r\n\r\n>_It is a curious situation that the sea, from which life first arose should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life._\r\n\r\n- Rachel Carson; _The Sea Around Us_ (1951)\r\n\r\n>_From the ocean came a roar of passions that seemed to have broken through all barriers: 'We must procreate and multiply! We must exhaust all the powers of lust!' The waves glowed like lava, and I imagined I could see multitudes of living beings \u2013 algae, whales, sea monsters \u2013 revelling in an orgy, from the surface to_ _the bottom of the sea. Immortality was the law here._\r\n\r\n- Isaac Bashevis Singer; \"Hanka\"; from _Passions and Other Stories_ (1975)\r\n\r\nThe debut feature from writer\/director Neasa Hardiman, _Sea Fever_ examines such issues as humanity's disregard for the size of our ecological footprint, the knee-jerk argument that if something hitherto unknown can't be exploited for profit then it should be destroyed, and Mankind's utter insignificance in the face of the wonders of nature. Heavily influenced by David Cronenberg's body horror films, Ridley Scott's _Alien_ (1979), and John Carpenter's _The Thing_ (1982), it could do with some refinement, especially in terms of characterisation, and the _d\u00e9nouement_ is a little anticlimactic, but Hardiman gets the atmosphere spot on, and overall, this is an impressive debut.\r\n\r\nSiobh\u00e1n (Hermione Corfield with a gorgeous head of red hair and a decent Irish accent) is an all-work-and-no-play doctoral student studying marine biology, specifically anomalous ecological patterns. A socially awkward introvert, she's not at all happy with she's told that she needs to get practical experience outside the lab and so her professor has organised for her to join a fishing boat and monitor their haul. The boat in question, the _Niamh Chinn-\u00d3ir_, is owned by Freya (Connie Nielsen) and captained by her husband Gerard (Dougray Scott), but it hasn't been doing too well recently and money is tight. However, Gerard has been tracking a huge shoal of fish and believes their luck is about to change. Meanwhile, Siobh\u00e1n gets to know the crew; Ciara (the always spectacular Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9), her son Johnny (Jack Hickey), genius engineer Omid (Ardalan Esmaili), and the baby of the group, Sudi (Elie Bouakaze). Upon sailing, Gerard sees that the shoal has moved into an exclusion zone, but without telling anyone, he too enters the zone. No sooner has he done so when the _Niamh_ hits something and becomes entangled. Investigating the collision, Siobh\u00e1n is stunned to see huge bioluminescent tentacles arising from the deep and attached to the hull. Back on board, she's thrilled to announce they may have encountered a creature unknown to science, but when it becomes apparent that the tentacles are secreting dangerous microscopic parasites onto the _Niamh_, the crew find themselves in a fight for survival, where their greatest enemy is one another.\r\n\r\nIn the _Fhianna\u00edocht_ [Fenian Cycle] of Irish mythology, Niamh Chinn \u00d3ir [Niamh of the Golden Hair] is the daughter of Manann\u00e1n mac Lir, king of the Otherworld, T\u00edr na n\u00d3g [Land of the Young]. Upon falling in love with Ois\u00edn, son of Fionn mac Cumhaill, Niamh returns with him to T\u00edr na n\u00d3g, where they spend three happy years, although in the real world, 300 years have passed. Wanting to see his homeland again, Ois\u00edn persuades Niamh to let him return to Ireland. She gives him her horse, \u00c9nbarr, but warns him not to dismount and touch the soil or the spell of youth from T\u00edr na n\u00d3g will be broken. After finding his childhood home on _Cnoc Al\u00faine_ desolate, he is helping some men move a large stone when he falls from \u00c9nbarr and immediately turns into an old man. Before he dies, Ois\u00edn encounters Saint P\u00e1draig, telling him the stories of the _fianna_. The relevance for _Sea Fever_ is fairly obvious; the exclusion zone is T\u00edr na n\u00d3g and the _Niamh_ is Ois\u00edn, going somewhere it shouldn't be, a place which will fundamentally change it. The possibility of the Niamh returning to Ireland carrying an infection correlates with Ois\u00edn being 'infected' with age if he touches the soil of Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn a post-screening Q&A with Hardiman at the film's Irish premi\u00e8re, she specifically said that one of the main impetuses behind the story was to offer a corrective for films which demonise or are critical of the scientific method, to challenge narratives which \"_depict the scientific method as being cut-off, antisocial, self-important, and irrelevant_\". In this sense, there's a lot more hard real-world science than you might expect \u2013 from details of Siobh\u00e1n's research and her explanations of marine biology, biodiversity, and anomalous patterns to some fairly detailed discussions of the possible biochemistry of the creature that ensnares the _Niamh_, hypotheses as to why it behaves the way it does, and detailed depictions of how the parasites enter and exit the bloodstream (how they exit is not for the faint at heart). In the latter half of the film, a lot of time is given over to discussions of whether the _Niamh_ should head back to Ireland, with Siobh\u00e1n trying to make the others understand the devastating ramifications that could result from introducing the parasites into a population centre. All of this doesn't quite position the film in the realm of science-fact, but it certainly helps to lend the narrative a stronger sense of real-world verisimilitude.\r\n\r\nScience is also important thematically insofar as one of the main issues explored is that the creature may not be acting aggressively in attaching to the _Niamh_; it's simply trying to survive, and even the parasites aren't a form of attack. In this way, Hardiman refuses to demonise the creature, and from the moment of its discovery, Siobh\u00e1n consistently argues that the crew must protect it, which is not what you expect from this type of film. On the other hand, Gerard sees it in more black and white terms; initially as something to be used for profit, and later as something to be destroyed \u2013 capitalism at its finest. There are no real villains as such, but on a sliding moral scale, the creature is above several of the human characters.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, there's a merciful absence of jump scares and, apart from one scene, there's very little gore. Instead, the film's horror elements are based more in the intricate sound design, Ray Ball's production design, and Ruair\u00ed O'Brien's cinematography. The three work in tandem to make it impossible for the viewer to ever forget that we're on a ship isolated at sea \u2013 from the constant creaking and sound of lapping water to the claustrophobic quarters (the _Niamh_ is so small, it only has four beds) to the handheld and often dimly lit photography that imbues every shadow with a sense of the unknown. Indeed, as was the _USCSS Nostromo_ in _Alien_ and U.S. Outpost 31 in _The Thing_, the rusty and battered _Niamh_ (a vessel which has clearly seen better days) is very much a character in _Sea Fever_, and its aesthetic design is pivotal in allowing Hardiman to achieve a sense of psychological unease.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, the most significant is that even given the small cast, there isn't a huge amount of character differentiation. Even Siobh\u00e1n is never really developed, whilst the _Niamh_'s crew are largely interchangeable. One of the reasons films like _Alien_ and _The Thing_ are considered classics is because of how good the character individualisation is \u2013 every person in both of those films is a distinct individual with an interiority and a clearly defined set of character traits that sets him or her apart from the others; pick any character, and you'll be able to talk about who that character is as a person, from the take-charge and rational Dallas (Tom Skerritt) to the reactionary Parker (Yaphet Kotto) in _Alien_, from the by-the-book and eerily calm Garry (Donald Moffat) to the hot-headed Childs (Keith David) in _The Thing_. Their traits aren't painted in minutiae, but they are painted in strokes clearly differentiated from the others. A failure to recreate this is one of the main reasons that Scott's _Prometheus_ (2012) is such a pile of tripe wherein no one is differentiated from anyone else and no one acts consistently because none of them have dominant character traits. _Sea Fever_'s script is a lot better than that rubbish, but it's still very light on individualisation, which makes it harder to care about these people, which makes them feel expendable, a potential death sentence for a film of this nature. Thankfully, it doesn't come to that here, but with just a little more work on the screenplay, the whole film could really have been elevated into something truly special. Another small gripe I have is that the conclusion is pretty anticlimactic; it works very well thematically, but it's a bit weak in terms of drama or tension, and it feels somewhat rushed.\r\n\r\nMixing body-horror with elements of a creature-feature garnished with some eco-friendly themes, _Sea Fever_ is a very enjoyable film and an impressive debut feature. Although its broader genre beats offer nothing we haven't seen before, it still manages to feel like its own thing with its own things to say. It could do with a better balance in terms of the plot\/characterisation ratio, but the unexpected focus on science and ecological themes mean it rises above the monster movie clich\u00e9s you might expect, which should help it to stand out in a crowded field.","id":"5e741615cabfe400131e2120","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e741615cabfe400131e2120","movie_id":507441}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nI will always respect and appreciate the will of a director\/writer in trying to do something bold and bonkers. Whether that\u2019s a divisive plot twist, a double-faced character or even an unusual method of filming, it doesn\u2019t really matter, as long as it succeeds. Steven Knight delivers a story that doesn\u2019t feel right from the get-go. Everything feels strange and random, with weird dialogues and awkward hints at something underneath it all. Then, a somewhat predictable plot twist changes pretty much everything since our perspective is entirely different now. However, it sinks the movie even more and creates a whole bunch of incongruencies and plot holes.\r\n\r\nThe film wasn\u2019t near good before the twist, and it gradually transformed itself into something jaw-droppingly bad, after it. In addition to this, the final message that Steven Knight leaves the audience with, is probably one of the worst ones since The Emoji Movie. \u201cDoing the wrong things for the right reasons\u201d is always going to be a controversial statement, but in this particular case, having in mind what happens in the movie and who does it involve, it\u2019s 100% wrong and I want to believe that Knight didn\u2019t exactly want to transmit this in the way that he did.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s an intriguing and meaningful story to be told deep down in this messy screenplay. Behind all of the unnecessary exposition scenes (there\u2019s no need to describe what\u2019s happening since the twist is quite self-explanatory) and cringe-worthy dialogues, there\u2019s a well-structured narrative and an extraordinary concept to be explored. However, I have no idea what happened to the script nor the production and filming stages of the film, but I understand now why its original release date in October was postponed to the traditional January\u2019s garbage. This was supposed to be an Oscar-bait movie: an Oscar-nominated director\/writer plus two Oscar-winner protagonists, in a film that seems to be more than what it actually is?  I guess the production companies saw this coming and they tried to prevent an even bigger flop. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m always the first to defend that a movie without at least \u201cgood\u201d technical attributes is rarely one of the best of the year. However, I\u2019m also the first to affirm that if a film fails to deliver a captivating story with compelling characters, there\u2019s no magnificent cinematography or mind-blowing special effects that can salvage it. Serenity doesn\u2019t even have that. Despite me feeling pleased that it was filmed in one-location and that the set design is pretty sweet, the editing is incredibly choppy. It feels like Knight had to remove several cuts in order to reduce the overlong runtime, which wasn\u2019t performed in the best way possible. There are a lot of moments where a character is facing a side, and in the next cut, the former is already facing a completely different one (this particular thing really occurs often).\r\n\r\nRegarding the characters, Baker and his son are definitely the ones that we learn more about since their connection is continuously addressed. Like I wrote above, there\u2019s a relevant story behind all of this mayhem, but I did saw (even if briefly) the light at the end of this very dark tunnel. That light is instantly consumed by the darkness as new characters or subplots start to show up, and the hollowness prevails over everything else. Jeremy Strong\u2019s character is baffling ridiculous, Diane Lane (Constance) is one of the dozens of logical reasons why the twist doesn\u2019t work, but the one who annoyed me the most didn\u2019t even show up. You spend a whole movie talking about this one person, like it is going to be a crucial subplot, and then you forget about it. You merely end the film, and it\u2019s like that character was never even mentioned\u2026 Why? Why give even more reasons for someone to leave the theater frustrated?\r\n\r\nThen, there\u2019s the tone. It\u2019s weird until the twist and weirder after it. Not even Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway can save themselves from some awfully delivered lines. Nevertheless, it\u2019s the cast who saves this wreckage of being an F. McConaughey is a hell of an actor and he demonstrates his outstanding range throughout the runtime. Hathaway has less to do, and I felt that her lines were the worst, but I can\u2019t argue with her ability to deliver any emotion. Jason Clarke (Frank Zariakas) is perfect as the violent father\/husband, and Djimon Hounsou (Duke) has some space to shine.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Serenity tries to go big and bold, but falls astonishingly flat. Plot holes, logical incongruencies, awful dialogues, terrible editing, hollow characters, and neglected subplots. Steven Knight had a great concept and a truly interesting thriller-mystery in his mind, but his execution is shockingly baffling, and the twist transforms everything into something way worse. The final message is the number one reason why I don\u2019t recommend anyone to see this movie, especially if you take teens or kids with you. Matthew McConaughey is good enough to avoid a total disaster, and I know that there was something incredible behind all of this horrible mess. It\u2019s probably going to end up as one of the worst films of 2019, unless we have a truly disastrous year in cinema.\r\n\r\nRating: D-","id":"5c4f43130e0a2612cccc6f1c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c4f43130e0a2612cccc6f1c","movie_id":452832}

{"author":"JPV852","content":"If you never heard of Serenity before, you\u2019re not alone because neither had I. The movie was in and out of theaters making a mere $11.4 million off of a reasonable $25 million budget. But one of the best perks of reviewing is getting to see films I might\u2019ve otherwise skipped and boy was Serenity one hell of a ride. Well, more of a ride that\u2019s on a collision course toward a semi, but still\u2026\r\n\r\nHere is the basic plot synopsis: Baker Dill (MATTHEW MCCONAUHEY) is a fishing boat captain who leads tours off of the tranquil enclave of Plymouth Island. His peaceful life is soon shattered when his ex-wife Karen (ANNE HATHAWAY) tracks him down. Desperate for help, Karen begs Baker to save her \u2014 and their young son \u2014 from her abusive husband (JASON CLARKE). She wants him to take the brute out for a fishing excursion \u2014 then throw him overboard to the sharks. Thrust back into a life that he wanted to forget, Baker now finds himself struggling to choose between right and wrong.\r\n\r\nSounds simple enough, no? While indeed that does happen in the movie, where I thought I was getting some sort of modern-day film noir, what eventually we get is more along the lines of The Truman Show. Despite the insanity that I was watching and how some of it makes no sense whatsoever, I have to admit, I kind of was entertained by it all.\r\n\r\nFirst, the performances are, well, uneven. The supporting players of the respectable actors which  included Djimon Hounsou as Dill\u2019s skipper and Diane Lane playing the sugar momma. However, McConaughey switched back and forth from mild mannered to over-the-top, where I wonder if he got to the point where he realized just what a messy movie he had signed on to. Hathaway was decent enough, although she did feel like a character out of an old-time film noir while Jason Clarke went full-on portraying a loutish, all-around despicable human being, necessary if you want your main character to even consider murdering the guy.\r\n\r\nOutside of my reference to The Truman Show, I won\u2019t go much further as not to spoil the twist, though it is one maybe M. Night Shyamalan would probably appreciate\u2026 And I suppose I did as well, even if it didn\u2019t make a lick of sense, even days later thinking upon what the hell exactly happened. That being said, it certainly was one of the more unique, and bewildering, viewing experiences  of the last few years.\r\n\r\nSerenity was the brainchild of Steven Knight, Academy Award nominee for writing Dirty Pretty Things and who has also written the screenplays for Eastern Promises, Allied and The Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web amongst others. This also marks his third film in the director\u2019s chair following the Jason Statham thriller Redemption and Locke starring Tom Hardy, both movies released back in 2013.","id":"5d68758fca83545e55f669d2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d68758fca83545e55f669d2","movie_id":452832}

They jumped to their deaths in front of the very people who purchased the clothing they made. The outrage of seeing these people die lead to consumer and political activism to ensure this did not happen again. Better fire safety, building safety, and workplace safety standards came out of this activism. And during the twentieth century Americans fought and demanded for change.

They did so not only for cheap wages, but to avoid workplace safety regulations and environmental regulations. So in 2013, when over 1,100 workers die at Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, it is the same industry as the Triangle Fire, with the same subcontracted system of production that allows apparel companies to avoid responsibility for work as the Triangle Fire, and with the same workforce of young and poor women, the same type of cruel bosses, and the same terrible workplace safety standards as the Triangle Fire.

No one needs or deserves to have that much money, it is obscene._\r\n\r\n- John McDonnell (Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer), speech on November 18, 2019\r\n\r\nWe live in an era where wealth is distributed upwards and the gap between the haves and have-nots has become wider than ever. According to inequality.org, the richest 1% of the world's population controls 45% of global wealth, whilst adults with less than $10,000 capital make up 64% of the population and control less than 1% of the wealth. In 2018, Oxfam reported that the wealth of the 26 richest people in the world was equal to the combined wealth of the 3.5 billion poorest people. This is the _milieu_ of _Greed_, a hilarious satire from incredibly prolific genre-hopping writer\/director Michael Winterbottom (_Family_ (TV); _Welcome to Sarajevo_; _24 Hour Party People_; _Code 46_; _A Cock & Bull Story_; _A Mighty Heart_; _The Killer Inside Me_; _The Trip_ (TV); _The Emperor's New Clothes_). Examining how the rich get richer whilst the poor get unpaid jobs building faux-Roman coliseums on Greek islands, the film focuses specifically on a successful British clothing entrepreneur, and its bread and butter is the concomitant grotesquery that results when an individual has the same wealth as a small country. Effectively mixing send-up and satire with more serious socio-economic points, _Greed_ doesn't really do or say a huge amount that hasn't been done or said before, but it's entertaining, amusing, and undeniably relevant.\r\n\r\nSir Richard McCreadie (Winterbottom's regular leading-man Steve Coogan in full-Steve Coogan mode) is one of Britain's richest men, and in possession of Britain's whitest teeth. The perma-tanned \"self-made\" billionaire is the owner of several thriving clothing chains and is known as \"the King of the High Street\", although a less complimentary nickname is \"Greedy\" McCreadie. The non-linear narrative depicts three main events in McCreadie's life. We see his rise to power, when, as a young man (played by a wonderfully loathsome Jamie Blackley), he opens multiple businesses (all of which fail) as he learns the ins and outs of asset-stripping, the importance of using foreign sweatshops, and how to exploit realty and tax practices without breaking the law. In the modern-day, we see him hauled before a Parliamentary Select Committee convened to investigate the bankruptcy of one of his chains. And, in the film's present, on the Greek island of Mykonos, the final (chaotic) touches are being put to McCreadie's Roman-themed 60th birthday bash \u2013 complete with mandatory togas, a fake coliseum, and a real, albeit somnolent, lion (McCreadie is obsessed with Ridley Scott's _Gladiator_ \u2013 and yes, the fact that there were tigers rather than lions in that movie is brought up several times). The party is scheduled to take place in a couple of days, or at least it will if the underpaid Bulgarian workers will ever finish the coliseum, the optically-unappealing Syrian refugees will ever leave the nearby public beach, and the litany of celebrities who promised to swing by will ever stop cancelling.\r\n\r\nMuch of the story is told through the lens of McCreadie's \"official biographer\" Nick (David Mitchell in full-David Mitchell mode), a classically-trained literature buff who drops quotes from Shakespeare and Shelley into everyday conversation, and who hates himself for agreeing to write a fawning celebration of McCreadie \u2013 a task which sees him shadow the man himself on Mykonos, having previously visited McCreadie's Sri Lankan sweatshop to talk to the workers about how much they love their job and 'appreciate' McCreadie for employing them. We also meet Margaret (Shirley Henderson in heavy makeup), McCreadie's acerbic Irish mother, who's been with him every step of the way; Samantha (Isla Fisher), McCreadie's ex-wife, who's come to Mykonos with her spectacularly French boyfriend, Fran\u00e7ois (Christophe de Choisy), although it's obvious she and McCreadie still have feelings for one another; Naomi (Shanina Shaik), McCreadie's current wife; Finn (Asa Butterfield), McCreadie and Samantha's obviously damaged son, who has a penchant for bringing up Oedipus's patricidal tendencies to anybody within earshot; Lily (Sophie Cookson), McCreadie and Samantha's daughter, who's filming a (staged) reality TV show with her obviously gay 'boyfriend' Fabian (Ollie Locke); Melanie (Sarah Solemani), the under-pressure party-planner; Frank (Asim Chaudhry), the world's most laid-back lion handler; Amanda (an extremely impressive Dinita Gohil), McCreadie's overworked PA, who comes to occupy the spotlight in a very unexpected manner; a cadre of (hilariously bad) lookalikes for all the guests who've cancelled, in an effort to fool the press (the Rod Stewart and George Michael jokes are especially worth looking out for); and a host of (real) celebratory cameos, including Stephen Fry, James Blunt (a viciously self-effacing appearance that's one of the funniest moments in the film), Pixie Lott, Ben Stiller, Colin Firth, Fatboy Slim, Ed Sheeran, and Caroline Flack (to whom the film is dedicated).\r\n\r\nThe idea that a billionaire could be so cut off from workaday reality as to stage a Roman-themed birthday party on a Greek island may sound far too on the nose, too ridiculously hubristic to say anything of any worth, and too over-the-top to even function as satire. However, it's worth noting that McCreadie is based on Sir Philip Green, chairman of the Arcadia Group (which owns, amongst others, Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, Topman, Topshop, and Wallis), avoider of taxes, exploiter of the working-class, asset-stripper, and enemy of the #MeToo movement. Similarly, many of the details of McCreadie's ludicrous birthday are lifted verbatim from Green's very real 50th birthday celebrations in 2002 \u2013 when he flew 219 guests to Cyprus for a three-day toga party which featured live performances from Tom Jones and Rod Stewart (and, while we're on subject, the party for his 60th was even more lavish).\r\n\r\nMcCreadie, of course, is a hilariously despicable slimeball, a man who unironically feels hard done by when Syrian refugees show up on the (public) beach he's using for his birthday, and both Coogan and Blackley portray him as not only narcissistic and void of conscience, but as a completely classless philistine \u2013 whereas Nick, for example, can quote Shakespeare and recite Shelley, lofty symbols of Englishness both, McCreadie proudly gets his cultural know-how from BrainyQuote (unless he's quoting _Gladiator_, which he appears to know word-for-word). However, the important point is that for all his loathsomeness, McCreadie is a symbol for the system that gave rise to and sustains him. He and those like him didn't arise in a vacuum; he's simply the result of an economy that takes from the poor and gives to the rich. For all his crass hubristic excess, McCreadie is neither an aberrant individual nor is he a criminal \u2013 he's an especially vulgar product of the system. And, with the crushing defeat of Labour in the 2019 English general election, it seems he's the product of a system which the vast majority of people appear to support.\r\n\r\nThe film gets pretty serious towards the end, and before the closing credits, a series of title cards detail some of the facts and figures of global economic disparity, particularly concerning the vast gulf between those who make the clothes we wear and those who sell them to us. Originally, these cards named specific brands as especially guilty of exploiting sweatshop employees, pointing out, for example, that workers in Myanmar earn $3.60 a day making clothes for H&M, whilst owner Stefan Persson is worth $18 billion, and workers in Bangladesh earn $2.84 a day making clothes for Zara, whilst owner Amancio Ortega is worth $68 billion. However, Sony Pictures International, which financed the film with Film4, refused to allow Winterbottom to use these cards, with company head Laine Kline telling him, \"_we're worried about the potential damage to Sony's corporate relations with these brands_\". And so replacement cards were used, which feature much of the same information but without reference to any specific companies or people. So how do we know what the original cards said? Because Winterbottom, very much in the viciously sardonic spirit of the film, read them out on-stage after the world premi\u00e8re in Toronto! Kline, who was in the audience, was far from impressed, which may account for the shoddy advertising campaign, with the film being released into theatres with virtually no market awareness. Whatever the case, Kline seems unaware of the irony of his actions \u2013 in relation to a film which accuses the rich of all manner of shenanigans to insulate and protect themselves and their fortunes, a massive corporate entity has exerted its authority to protect other massive corporate entities. It's like something McCreadie himself would do.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, the film employs a plethora of techniques, including non-linear editing, direct-to-camera addresses, YouTube videos to provide exposition, split-screen, fake news footage, and title cards. It's all very Guy Ritchie, busy and flashy, presumably to mirror McCreadie's own excess. However, the film is at its most effective when at its simplest, particularly in scenes involving the wonderful Gohil. Amanda's interactions with Nick provide the emotional core of the story, and there's nothing bombastic or ostentatious about their construction \u2013 it's all simple shot\/counter-shot editing and blocking. And by far the film's best sequence, which comes towards the end, is another simple setup involving Amanda, McCreadie, and a third character who I won't name, as it would be a spoiler. With a terrifically emotive piece of music by Harry Escott (_Shame_; _The Selfish Giant_; _Journeyman_), this scene tells its story not through aesthetic construction or even through dialogue, but through the expression on Gohil's face. It's the moment during which Winterbottom drops all pretence of comedy and focuses on the more serious issues that have hovered at the fringes since the opening seconds.\r\n\r\nI've seen it said by some critics who disliked Greed that taking pot-shots at the super-rich is easy, which is undoubtedly true. But does that somehow imply we should stop doing so, that they're not a valid target for satire? Just because criticising such ilk is \"easy\", that doesn't mean such criticisms are invalid. That's like saying, \"_Nazis were evil and all, but they're an awfully easy target for criticism_\". Yes, they are. As they should be. Personally, my biggest problem with the film would be two underdeveloped subplots. The reality TV show subplot provides for some very funny individual moments, but it contributes nothing whatsoever to the main plot. Additionally, the fact that McCreadie and Samantha are still in love with one another never really goes anywhere, which is a shame, as it could have provided some much-needed character development for her and some shades of grey for him.\r\n\r\nSociety does not need billionaires. Capitalism would be just fine without billionaires. But, for better or worse, we live in an age where there are more billionaires than ever before and the gap between their wealth and the wealth of the poorest members of society is only growing wider. Equal parts funny and disturbing, _Greed_ is a comedy about the excess and disconnect of such people, but so too is it a cautionary tale, a reminder that just because we're removed from exploitation doesn't mean such exploitation isn't happening.","id":"5e5dcc5555c9260017548768","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e5dcc5555c9260017548768","movie_id":567598}

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"Guava Island musically enraptures its tropical aesthetic through severe self-indulgence. Donald Glover\u2019s rhythmically-inclined alter-ego, Childish Gambino, is an inspirational talent. A rare find that cements the credibility of the current generation\u2019s ability to produce harmonious tunes with a political trajectory. His \u201cAwaken, My Love!\u201d studio album infused psychedelic funk with soul and hip-hop, while his latest singles \u201cThis Is America\u201d and \u201cSummertime Magic\u201d provide insight into his meticulous thought process. He is an artist through and through. So it comes to much astonishment that Guava Island, a miniature film that was clearly targeted at fans of his discography, was unable to find its footing amidst the soothing tropical breeze. A local musician\/celebrity attempts to hold a music festival for the oppressed town of Guava Island, albeit ignoring the threatened warnings from the local dictatorial business magnate.\r\n\r\nIt commenced with an animated folk tale, narrated by the stunningly beautiful Rihanna (\u201cTe Amo\u201d!), describing the origins and current state of Guava Island. Considering the runtime, totalling just under an hour, this method of expressionistic exposition was required to construct the foundations of the basic narrative. Delightful, if somewhat mundane. Murai, in his directorial debut, then proceeds to the live-action bulk with a stylised 4:3 ratio filter equipped with grainy visuals for authenticity. Considering the economic and structural climate of Guava Island, it was immersive and enhanced the world Rihanna lovingly described to us.\r\n\r\nGlover goes about his day, carrying his wooden guitar, singing and reinterpreting his latest singles. The infamously abnormal dance moves proceeded with \u201cThis Is America\u201d in the middle of a factory. Then it hit me. Guava Island is essentially a \u201cmusical\u201d to coincide and\/or boost the promotional material of Gambino\u2019s songs. Disagree? Well, he then proceeds to serenade Rihanna with \u201cSummertime Magic\u201d before winning my heart over with \u201cFeels Like Summer\u201d.\r\n\r\nA fundamental question then dawned on me. Can the artistic integrity of music be translated effectively to a narrative feature? Perhaps, but Guava Island is not a good example of that. The musical spirit of the island\u2019s residents being suppressed by a totalitarian state is nothing new and, unfortunately, conveyed obviously. The relationship between capitalism and the affected individuals of its grotesque aftermath failed to empower. This is due to Glover\u2019s self-indulgence blurring the clarity of the story. Rihanna\u2019s Kofi and her relationship with Deni is almost non-existent, despite the \u2018Romeo & Juliet\u2019 introduction. These characters are so focussed on portraying eccentricity, that the dynamics between them fell flat. Glover\u2019s frequent collaborator and older brother was unable to balance all aspects in such a condensed time constraint within his screenplay. It\u2019s so \u201cto the point\u201d that it loses that flavoursome flair that makes Gambino the artist he is.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say the music isn\u2019t catchy and Uzowuru\u2019s rhythmic score won\u2019t make you sway, as the musical aspect will have the biggest effect. The acting is serviceable, even if Glover can\u2019t escape his exaggerated TV tendencies, and Sprenger\u2019s cinematography is sublime. Unfortunately though, Murai\u2019s inability to balance the film and rein in Glover\u2019s overpowering talent taints Guava Island to be a drinkable albeit sour beverage.","id":"5e20674fe004a60015990b07","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e20674fe004a60015990b07","movie_id":543343}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps:\/\/www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nAs it becomes more and more common nowadays, I have to start this review by stating that no controversy surrounding this film affected my opinion in any way. I\u2019m feeling a bit exhausted about the fact that almost every movie has some sort of external problem entirely unrelated to its story or characters. You can watch whatever you want, no one will make you watch this or that film. As long as you don\u2019t purposefully give a negative review based on something that has nothing to do with the movie itself, I\u2019m fine with people skipping them. That said\u2026\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed\u00a0Guns Akimbo! I mean, how can someone not feel entertained by\u00a0Daniel Radcliffe\u00a0dressed in his robe with guns attached to his hands? Or by\u00a0Samara Weaving\u00a0taking a step up in craziness compared to\u00a0Ready or Not? There\u2019s no denying that this film is extremely violent, bloody, and it doesn\u2019t shy away from having a clear social commentary. The latter is not only evident, but it undoubtedly demonstrates something everyone knows it\u2019s true: Internet trolls are the worst!\r\n\r\nActually, I wish\u00a0Jason Lei Howden\u00a0would have gone even further. There\u2019s a lot of potential in a movie like this, and while it\u2019s safely above average, it could have been at the top of the most entertaining films of the last few years. Still, I wholeheartedly love this take on a subject that everyone (online film critics especially) unfortunately has to deal with every day. A part of me wished it was real\u2026 Every time a \u201ctroll alert\u201d was activated, that person would have to leave its comfortable, safe couch, and battle TO THE DEATH other online cowards in real-life\u2026 okay, maybe not that extreme, but you get my point.\r\n\r\nThe action is as crazy as the concept itself. It goes by without saying, but obviously, this is one of those flicks which asks the viewer to simply accept and enjoy the unrealistic, far-fetched, no-way-he-could-have-survived-that action. The camera work (cinematography by\u00a0Stefan Ciupek) suits the videogame-style employed by the action, and even though some sequences are admittedly way too over-the-top, the majority of these scenes are either pure entertainment or truly hilarious. Oh, and\u00a0Michael Bay, if you\u2019re reading this:\u00a0Guns Akimbo\u00a0gives a neat demo on how to make explosions look really cool AND advance the narrative.\r\n\r\nThe two leads are fantastic and share great chemistry.\u00a0Daniel Radcliffe\u00a0has been doing some overlooked\/underrated work post-Harry Potter\u00a0(definitely check out\u00a0Swiss Army Man), and he\u2019s very funny throughout the whole runtime. On the opposite side,\u00a0Samara Weaving\u00a0apparently found his comfort zone in portraying completely lunatic, insane psychopaths. Both deliver incredibly entertaining performances, carrying the whole movie through all of its wild action and comedic bits.\r\n\r\nJason Lei Howden\u00a0isn\u2019t able to control the film\u2019s pacing very well, but it never becomes overwhelming. However, the tone is spot-on.\u00a0Guns Akimbo\u00a0never tries to be something more than what it actually is. It keeps the narrative simple and fun without complex layers or extreme romantic endeavors. It never says to the viewer, \u201cI know the action is absurdly over-the-top, but here\u2019s a really emotional scene that you\u2019re supposed to care about\u201d. It\u2019s an entertainment-driven story with no real emphasis on character development, and there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with that.\r\n\r\nGuns Akimbo\u00a0is the craziest movie of 2020, so far.\u00a0Jason Lei Howden\u00a0doesn\u2019t hold back on the brutal, violent, bloody, extremely over-the-top action, and as long as the viewer is able to accept this purposefully unrealistic depiction of a real-life videogame death-match, it\u2019s a blast of pure entertainment. The social message is evident, and it\u2019s perfectly suited for today\u2019s online trolls, who hide behind their monitor.\u00a0Daniel Radcliffe\u00a0and\u00a0Samara Weaving\u00a0are amazing together, both delivering hilarious performances. Unfortunately, this film doesn\u2019t reach its full potential. It lacks control of its pacing, but I genuinely wish\u00a0Howden\u00a0would have gone all-out regarding the social thematic. It\u2019s a good, fun movie, but it could have great. Still, it\u2019s undoubtedly a recommendation of mine, unless the (dumb) controversy surrounding this film clouds your judgment. In this case, just skip it and let others enjoy it.\r\n\r\nRating: B","id":"5ea84247be55b7001de4edb8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ea84247be55b7001de4edb8","movie_id":457335}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nI\u2019m writing this review one day after the Oscars night, and I can guarantee at least one thing: Alita: Battle Angel is getting a Best Visual Effects nomination and it\u2019s probably going to win. Calling it now. There are no words that can describe how immersive, realistic and groundbreaking the IMAX 3D experience is. Weta Digital is undoubtedly the most incredible VFX\/CGI company since the beginning of this millennium. From the Lord of the Rings trilogy to the Avatar movie(s) and through the most famous TV series of this time, Game of Thrones, Peter Jackson\u2018s company keeps surpassing the impossible.\r\n\r\nAlita is a mix of Rosa Salazar\u2018s motion-capture performance and CGI animation, and it\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve seen in a long time. Visuals are not the most important aspect of a film, they\u2019re not even the key technical feature. The story and characters are and always will be the necessary ingredients for a movie\u2019s success. That said, I\u2019m also the first to defend that without remarkable technical achievements, a film won\u2019t ever go above \u201cvery good.\u201d If you want a movie to be one of the best of the year, a combination of compelling story\/characters and great filmmaking attributes is essential. Robert Rodriguez\u2018s film nails the latter requirement, but has a lot of hits and misses regarding the former.\r\n\r\nLike I wrote above, I have no vocabulary to describe how mind-blowing and eyegasmic this movie looks. If you\u2019re intrigued by how fascinated I am, you know what to do: buy an IMAX ticket and watch it. The visuals alone compensate for the price of admission. Besides the jaw-dropping VFX, the sound and production design are unbelievable. I could feel every punch, kick or scream like I rarely feel with other high-budget films. The amount of work that went in to build this world is worthy of recognition, and I honestly hope that by the end of this year, Alita is receiving a whole bunch of nominations for its aesthetics.\r\n\r\nI love how anime-like this feels. I didn\u2019t read the original manga, but you will like this movie more if you\u2019re a fan of anime. Rodriguez does a seamless job bringing Iron City to life, and there are tons of nods to how anime stories flow, which will surely please fans of said genre. Sadly, the screenplay isn\u2019t exactly written as it should be. One of the most emotive moments of the film trusts the audience to buy into the romance displayed on-screen, but since it feels very forced from the get-go, this unnecessary subplot carries too much influence on the end result.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, James Cameron and his team took a quite questionable decision concerning the main plot, having in mind the marketing surrounding this blockbuster. It\u2019s still a minor spoiler, so I can\u2019t really delve into details, but I\u2019ll write this: the closest the movie gets to its third act, the more worried I became. From the moment the second acts ends, I start realizing something that not a single person working on this film even hinted at. And that was the worst call they could have ever made. Not only it dragged the first half of the movie, but it deeply damaged its narrative.\r\n\r\nOnce you see this film, you\u2019ll understand what I\u2019m talking about. You\u2019ll get me when I say that the marketing strategy for Alita: Battle Angel ruined its story and it will definitely make a lot of people leave the theater frustrated, just like I did. Hopefully, this was just a misstep that doesn\u2019t affect its box office because this is a movie worthy of watching at a movie theater and ONLY at such place. Yes, it does have issues with its storytelling. It has a whole world that doesn\u2019t fit in just a 2-hour flick, so the plot becomes convoluted and a bit slow. However, I do think critics are being too harsh \u2026\r\n\r\nAlita is one of the most complex, intriguing and well-written characters of the last few years. While the screenplay contains fundamental writing flaws, its main protagonist is flawless. Despite still feeling a bit frustrated, I want to rewatch this movie so bad, just to get another opportunity to follow Alita throughout her journey. I love character-driven narratives, especially when the character in question is such a compelling one. Rosa Salazar delivers an amazing mo-cap performance (The Academy wants a new category? Well, Best Motion-Capture Performance suits your ceremony like a glove). Alita and Salazar share resemblances that can only be achieved with the unique camera-setup and technology that the production team had at their display, which is something pretty outstanding.\r\n\r\nChristoph Waltz brilliantly portrays Ido, as expected from such a high-caliber actor. Mahershala Ali (Vector) and Jennifer Connelly (Chiren) are underused, but they make their characters work for the story. Keean Johnson is fine as Hugo, but he\u2019s connected to one of the film\u2019s major issues. Everyone else is pretty great, each performance elevates their respective character, which helps move the plot forward. However, it all goes back to Salazar\u2018s remarkable performance and the way she and Alita carried the whole thing to safe harbor. Hollywood, put your eyes on this girl!\r\n\r\nFinally, the action. Oh my God! The action scenes are some of the most entertaining, riveting and thrilling sequences I\u2019ve seen since Mission: Impossible - Fallout. While the latter based its action on real jaw-dropping stunts, Alita: Battle Angel probably delivers some of the best animated action ever. The motorball sequences are impossible of getting your eyes off-screen, and the fights that Alita goes through are so well-crafted. Honestly, I\u2019m even scared of how these look in regular 2D. I doubt they feel seamless and flow as perfect as they do in IMAX 3D, so be careful with which choice you make. In my opinion \u2026\r\n\r\nAlita: Battle Angel is one of those movies that you HAVE TO watch at a movie theater, especially on IMAX 3D. You will not be able to grasp or feel the astonishingly immersive world that James Cameron produced, nor the powerful sound design. Its visuals effects are groundbreaking, and I promise you\u2019ve never seen such a mixture of real and animation like this. Beautiful or gorgeous are not adjectives enough to describe the world where Alita lives. It\u2019s a visual experience, so do waste your time and money in supporting this film.\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t deny neither its storytelling problems or the damaging marketing surrounding this blockbuster. However, Rosa Salazar\u2018s terrific performance and Alita as the protagonist are more than enough reasons to make you feel entertained and captivated until the very end. The action is mind-blowing, and I\u2019m not lying when I state that it contains some of the best animated sequences ever. I left the theater frustrated, but I can\u2019t wait to see it again on the big screen. Alita alone deserves that effort.\r\n\r\nRating: B+","id":"5c741b630e0a262c1c81b465","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c741b630e0a262c1c81b465","movie_id":399579}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"I did enjoy _Alita_. It was a great big \"pkyew-pkyew\" sort of a mess, but I did still walk away having had a pretty good time.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, both Alita(the character)'s romantic interest and _Alita_(the movie)'s romantic plotline I despised. And this aspect took up **so much** on screen realestate that I could never see my way to giving _Alita_ a glowing score, even if everything else about it had been perfect (it wasn't).\r\n\r\nAn interesting part of the flim though that I also need to touch on is the special effects. They aren't even close to photorealism, but it honestly still totally works, just because there are so many of them. Impressive is the most appropriate word that comes to mind. See, even if the CGI effects don't always sell themselves as reality, the world that they are in fits, it's like how an animated movie doesn't look like real life, but you're still convinced because against its own backdrop, even though maybe they didn't use an actual elephant to play the role of Dumbo, you still believe that he's a real character **in that world**. _Alita's_ sheer abundance of creative, setting driven CGI, blurs the lines between live action and animation, delivering a totally new, unique product.\r\n\r\nIt's just a shame they couldn't have done that in a better, more coheseive (and less bogged down) narrative.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._","id":"5c74d607925141688952dc52","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c74d607925141688952dc52","movie_id":399579}
{"author":"leeboardman","content":"James Cameron has spent more than a decade trying to bring Alita: Battle Angel to the big screen. Based on a popular cyberpunk manga series by Yukito Kishiro, published between 1990-1995, he has spent that time refining the script and developing the world that Alita inhabits. And that\u2019s pretty much what he now spends most of his time taking care of with the Avatar movies and the world of Pandora. Hence the reason why he eventually decided to step back into producer duties for this movie, letting Robert Rodriguez pick up the directing reins in order to finally get it finished. Rodriguez uses much of the script that Cameron wrote, but brings a little bit of his trademark style to the table too.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s 2563, and we\u2019re in Iron City. Dr Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) is scavenging among a huge scrapyard, looking for cyborg spare parts that he can make use of, while fresh metal and rubbish rains down from Zalem \u2013 a man-made, floating city sitting in the sky above Iron City. 300 years ago there were many of these floating cities but following a brutal war all of them except for Zalem perished. During that time though, the elevator leading up to Zalem was destroyed, and these days only the \u2018pure\u2019 inhabitants of Zalem are permitted there. Nobody from Earth is allowed to visit and if anyone comes down from Zalem, they\u2019re not allowed back. It\u2019s to try and avoid any contamination from entering Zalem. If you\u2019ve seen the Matt Damon movie Elysium\u2026 well, then it\u2019s a bit like that really.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the usual items, such as robotic hands and eyeballs, Dr Ido discovers Alita, or rather the core of Alita \u2013 lying lifeless and broken, with only a battered hairless head and upper torso remaining. He takes her back to his laboratory\/home, where he works as a cybernetics expert, repairing and upgrading the inhabitants of Iron City who are either cyborgs or humans with cyborg body parts. Along with his assisting nurse, and using a robotic body that had been previously built for his now deceased daughter (this gets briefly explained later), they rebuild her, giving her the name Alita (also his daughters name). Alita awakens later in a nice comfortable bed, in what was presumably Dr Ido\u2019s daughters room. She has no memory of her previous existence and sets about experiencing all the sights, sensations and tastes that human life and Iron City has to offer, exploring and striking up a friendship with local boy Hugo and his group of friends. But, as the name of the movie implies, this cyborg was built for battle, and it\u2019s not long before Alita begins to remember who exactly she used to be and just how good at kicking ass she is.\r\n\r\n\r\nA quick word about the visuals, as they are by far the best thing about this movie. Iron City, despite clearly being a futuristic world, is certainly not dark or bleak looking in the way we\u2019re used to with similar movies of this genre. Many of the early scenes take place during daylight hours and the city is a vibrant, bright, bustling home to thousand of humans and cyborgs. We get to go beyond the limits of Iron City \u2013 the city walls, out to the badlands beyond, and as you\u2019d expect from Cameron a lot of thought and detail has gone into mapping out and building this world. The cyborgs and the other robots we meet are all pretty standard for a movie of this kind, but it\u2019s Alita that is the most impressive. Much of this is down to the incredible CGI involved in making her look as realistic as she does, but a lot of what makes her so enjoyable and believable is down to Rosa Salazar, whose motion captured performance helps bring her to life. The visuals are obviously at their most impressive during the battle scenes involving Alita \u2013 where so many movies with heavy CGI battles end up as just a messy whirlpool of characters and action, that\u2019s certainly not the case here. Slick, inventive and exhilarating choreography allowing you to actually track and follow every single character and action in crisp detail. It\u2019s refreshing and impressive, even more so when watched in 3D and particularly so during the fast paced Motorball scenes featured towards the end of the movie.\r\n\r\nOutside of the visuals though, other characters and plot lines don\u2019t seem to stick so well, which is disappointing considering the rich source material available to the film makers. Alita: Battle Angel suffers from inconsistent pacing, dialogue that is clunky and exposition-heavy and there are many times when the accompanying soundtrack just felt distracting to me, out of place with whatever is currently happening. Christoph Waltz, Mahershala Ali and Jennifer Connolly all seem overqualified and underutilised, and the romance between Alita and Hugo is unnecessary, and at times annoying. It feels like it\u2019s trying to cram too much story into its two hour run time, resulting in plot holes and frustrations later on. And there is even a cliffhanger ending \u2013 frustrating in that it feels as though we haven\u2019t even properly concluded this part of the story and we\u2019re now being left to wait should a sequel ever be given the go ahead.\r\n\r\nI found much to enjoy with Alita: Battle Angel, and would gladly go see a sequel or two, should they get made. It\u2019s enjoyable at times, and dazzling to look at, but overall it did leave me feeling a little bit frustrated and disappointed.","id":"5c5da23c0e0a2627a7671cb8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c5da23c0e0a2627a7671cb8","movie_id":399579}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I quite enjoyed this movie. Of course it was a good start that it was directed by Robert Rodriguez.  It is perhaps a bit of a young adult movie but that did not stop this old fart from enjoying it.\r\n\r\nI guess most people know the basic premise of the movie. It is based on a Japanese cyberpunk manga. Alita, a cyborg, is found by Dr. Ido. She is reawakened, given a new body (two actually), she is much more than she seems and \u2026 she kicks ass.\r\n\r\nThe movie plays out in a somewhat post apocalyptic world although it is not as dark and depressing as many post apocalyptic scenarios. It is actually quite colorful and sometimes both funny and cool. A lot of people, if not most of them, in this world are cybernetically enhanced. Alita herself is a \u201cfull body conversion\u201d. It is a quite detailed world full of pretty cool cyberpunk gadgets.\r\n\r\nThe various cyborgs themselves are of course the \u201cmain feature\u201d of the movie. They range in a wide variety from fairly human-like to cyborg tanks. Most of them wielding various kinds of bladed weapons. Of course the CGI and the various action scenes are top notch. Alita is really cool when she gets going with her ass-kicking.\r\n\r\nStory? Well it is manga of course so it is pretty simple but having said that it\u2019s not bad at all. I definitely feel there is some elements from Rollerball in the no rules racing and ball chasing games which is a centerpiece of the story.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I liked immensely is that there is really no preaching in this movie. No green nonsense and no social crap. Maybe that\u2019s because it\u2019s based on a Japanese manga and the Japanese has not yet developed the easily offended SJW mob that plagues all too many western countries nowadays. I know there\u2019s a bunch of SJW retards that manages to cram some feminist message into it and another bunch that claims Alita is too pretty. Well if you like cyborgs with eyes like golf balls maybe but these asshats should perhaps stop their ranting and take a serious look at their sexual preferences in that case.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that I was not too happy about was that there is no real ending to it and what is there is rather sad. This Nova guy pulling the strings up in Zalem, the cloud city, is never even touched and the ending scenes just shows him smiling like a huge cliffhanger. I guess I should not be surprised because him and his cloud city is the foundation of this manga world so for the story to continue in a possible sequel that had to be kept but still \u2026 it irked me somewhat.","id":"5c72a7c69251415edfb36a5b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c72a7c69251415edfb36a5b","movie_id":399579}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nWhat a wonderful surprise! I didn\u2019t watch any trailers or clips, I completely stayed away from any sort of marketing, but I couldn\u2019t hide from the negative feedback that social media was presenting. People online were skeptical of how good Will Smith\u2018s Genie would be, of how Mena Massoud (Aladdin) and Naomi Scott (Jasmine) were not the best casting choices, and of how the remake would actually honor and respect its original. From someone who didn\u2019t know what to expect, I thoroughly enjoyed Guy Ritchie\u2018s take on the retelling of this famous story. All of the fears described above are obliterated by a magical cast, and they\u2019re the ones who carry the movie to safe harbor.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll start with one out of two standout performances: Will Smith as the Genie. He delivers an indisputably unique and entertaining display as the blue entity. By the way he moves and talks, there\u2019s absolutely no way of people criticizing him for trying to copy Robin Williams. Smith does his own thing, and it works superbly. The best compliment I can give him is that I felt the same thing about Genie in this remake that I did while watching the original: every time he wasn\u2019t on screen, I wanted him to be back immediately. In the original, I thought that the Genie appeared in the right moments every single time, which was when the pacing started to drop too much.\r\n\r\nIn this remake, the periods without Genie are more extended, and the first act suffers a bit from its slow pace, and lack of truly fun sequences. Nevertheless, once the Cave of Wonders comes into play, it\u2019s a blast until the very end. The magic carpet and Abu make one hell of a comedy duo, and they\u2019re responsible for a lot of the laughs throughout the runtime. Going back to Genie, I love that Ritchie and John August gave him something more in comparison with the original, and that\u2019s one of few improvements actually made to the original. I wrote on that review that I was hoping that they gave more time for the core relationship of the film to develop and that Jafar (Marwan Kenzari) was more than just a paper-thin villain\u2026\r\n\r\nWell, Jafar keeps being an evil sorcerer that only desires power to rule everything and everyone. Unfortunately, he has more screentime than its predecessor, which means more over-the-top monologues of Kenzari, and sillier sequences with the whole hypnosis trick. On the other hand, Jasmine and Aladdin have a fully-developed script, which is by far the best improvement on the original. Their relationship grows naturally, and each character gets a lot of moments to express their feelings and show who they truly are, especially Jasmine. She is directly connected to an issue that will definitely make this movie incredibly divisive, audience and critics alike, but I\u2019ll address it more at the end of the review.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the characters, Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott deliver breakthrough performances. Massoud is funny and quite likable as Aladdin, but Naomi is an absolute standout. Now, we look at this film as just another Disney remake. In a few years, we\u2019ll look at Aladdin (2019) as the movie that launched Naomi Scott into the stardom. She is astonishingly outstanding as Jasmine. Not only her voice is pretty amazing, but her acting is unbelievably seamless. Regarding singing, Will Smith and Mena Massoud are also pretty good, and the musical numbers are another aspect that I surprisingly loved. Prince Ali, Friend Like Me, A Whole New World and the new song, Speechless, are beautiful, powerful, and the first two\u2019s production design and VFX are overwhelming in a good way.\r\n\r\nGuy Ritchie is known for his very fluid chasing sequences, and Aladdin running through Agrabah is very well filmed as expected. However, the long choreographed takes during these musical scenes are a wonder to behold, from the first to the very last one, even after the \u201cThe End\u201d tagline shows up. A perfect remake is one that is able to keep the original\u2019s essence while being its own thing. Ritchie does an impressive job balancing these pillars. For anyone who loves the original and wanted the remake to be a shot-by-shot retell of the story, every single little detail (from key words to important character moments) is present in this film. For anyone who wanted a different take, there\u2019s more than enough minor changes to either how the story proceeds (order of events, more character development) or even how it ends, which leads me to the above-mentioned divisive issue.\r\n\r\nEvery time a political or social agenda is inserted in a movie, people don\u2019t care if it\u2019s well-written or not. They just don\u2019t want any of those things on any film, and I support that. Hollywood needs to stop trying to put something politically or socially correct in a movie, just for the sake of it. Aladdin (2019) has a clear social message, and it uses one of the main characters to state that message clearly. Now, here\u2019s the catch: having in mind the character in question, how it\u2019s written, and what they do to send that social message, I think it\u2019s fine. Yes, I know that a lot of people will think the complete opposite and crucify the film for it. I usually do the following mental exercise: \u201cDoes it make sense with the story\/character? Is it just a single moment during the movie (proving that it might be too forced) or do they develop the idea? If it was an original film, would I even be thinking about this?\u201d\r\n\r\nYes. They develop the idea. Probably not. Those are my answers, and that\u2019s why I stand on the positive side of this soon-to-be heavily discussed subject during a few days. People need to start opening their minds to these modern takes on pre-21st-century classics. I always use Dumbo (1941) as an example: this is probably the most racist Disney movie ever, with extreme discrimination, total disrespect for animals, alcohol-induced plot points, and so much more morally and socially wrong storylines and character\u2019s personalities. There\u2019s no way that a film like that can be released today! So, obviously, Dumbo (2019) had to be extremely different from that one-hour racism show.\r\n\r\nAladdin (1992) also has a particular aspect about it that it doesn\u2019t quite fit nowadays\u2019 culture. It\u2019s not offensive or anything, but I bet that if it was released today, a whole group of people would complain about it. Aladdin (2019) tries to adapt, and while it might have tried too hard, I still appreciate the effort, and at least it makes sense. It\u2019s only a minor change to the core story and to the character in question, so it' shouldn\u2019t affect the overall viewing of the movie. If Speechless wasn\u2019t created, it would have been totally fine, but I have to admit that even if the song sounds great and the lyrics are impactful, it\u2019s still a stretch\u2026 Naomi Scott interprets it beautifully, though.\r\n\r\nVisually, the film is stunning. Agrabah is an absolute delight that will make hardcore fans\u2019 jaws drop continuously, each time a new location is shown. I love how Ritchie strolls the camera around to show-off his production crew beautiful work, most of the times through long and fluid takes. I wish (no pun intended) he could have controlled the movie\u2019s pace and tone better. Periods without Genie to entertain the audience are too long, and Ritchie shouldn\u2019t risk the boredom levels to be as high as they are occasionally.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Aladdin (2019) succeeds in balancing the two pillars of any remake: it keeps the original\u2019s true essence while standing on its own. Will Smith shuts down online skeptics with a super entertaining and unique performance as Genie, but it\u2019s Naomi Scott and Mena Massoud palpable chemistry that surprised the hell out of me. The latter is perfect as Aladdin, but Naomi has her breakthrough display, which is definitely going to take her to even bigger stages. Guy Ritchie proves he\u2019s a fantastic director, by delivering some beautiful one-take sequences and exceptionally fun and well-choreographed musical numbers. Technically, the production and set design are astounding, but the pacing-tone levels aren\u2019t as balanced as they should have been, which makes the runtime over-extend itself.\r\n\r\nStory-wise, people will feel incredibly divisive. Most of the screenplay is identical to its predecessor, but Disney\u2019s attempt to force down a social message is not going to help the film, at all. Even if it makes sense and it\u2019s only a minor twist, it was still unnecessary, and it might even shadow Naomi\u2018s brilliant performance, which would be a massive shame. Jafar bothers me a lot more than any of this stuff. However, Ritchie and John August deserve nothing but compliments for trying so hard to adapt such a risky original and mostly succeed doing it. I genuinely hope it crushes in the box office. It\u2019s really a diamond (in the rough). Go watch it and make your own opinion!\r\n\r\nRating: B+","id":"5ce6be5f0e0a26522acf29b6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ce6be5f0e0a26522acf29b6","movie_id":420817}

That was their way,_\r\n\r\n>_their heathenish hope; deep in their hearts_\r\n\r\n>_they remembered hell._\r\n\r\n- Seamus Heaney; _Beowulf: A Verse Translation_ (1999)\r\n\r\nMuch like his feature debut, the excellent _Hereditary_ (2018), writer\/director Ari Aster's _Midsommar_ has divided audiences much more than critics. Whereas _Hereditary_ had an 89% critical approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 8.26\/10, it managed only a 65% audience approval rating, with an average score of 3.43\/5, whilst also famously garnering a pitiful D+ CinemaScore. _Midsommar_ currently has an 82% critical approval with a 7.51\/10 average, against a 61% audience approval, with a 3.36\/5 average and a C+ CinemaScore. This recalls recent films such as Robert Eggers's _The VVitch: A New England Folktale_ (90% with a 7.77\/10 average vs 58% with a 3.22\/5 average and a C- CinemaScore) and Trey Edward Shults's superb _It Comes At Night_ (87% with a 7.36\/10 average vs 44% with a 2.75\/5 average and a D CinemaScore). The reason for the discrepancies? In large part it's because all four films were promoted as something they weren't, drawing in audiences who were disappointed that they didn't get what they were expecting; all four were heavily promoted as horrors, when none in fact are (and in the case of _It Comes At Night_, not even remotely close). As for _Midsommar_, it is, at best, a thriller, and I would argue that even that's pushing it. Whereas _Hereditary_ was a study of grief and familial breakdown, it undeniably had horror elements (the floating self-decapitation scene is one of the most haunting images put on screen in decades). In the case of _Midsommar_, however, apart from one very brief moment involving somebody wearing somebody else's skin (don't ask), there's nothing remotely resembling a horror trope, and very little that's thrilling. Which is not necessarily a criticism; I enjoyed the film very much, I simply think the marketing people have once again set the movie up to fail with a lot of the people who will see it.\r\n\r\nWhat _Midsommar_ does have in abundance, however, is dread, which is, of course, very different to horror. More unsettling than frightening, as with _Hereditary_, _Midsommar_ is primarily an allegory built on a foundation of generic tropes \u2013 both films begin with paralysing tragedies that almost cripple the protagonist, with the subsequent narrative analysing the psychological reaction to such tragedies by way of various spooky goings-on. And whereas _Hereditary_ dealt with the lengths one may go to shut off deep emotional pain, _Midsommar_ is more interested in what happens when the initial pain of bereavement starts to wear off, especially when the only person one feels one can turn to isn't exactly sympathetic to one's situation. Aster himself has called it a \"_breakup movie_\", and it's hard to argue against this categorisation, as the story begins and ends with very specific relationship drama. And whilst the characters are grossly underwritten, and the film is painfully predictable (if you're familiar with Robin Hardy's _The Wicker Man_ (1973), chances are that everything you think is going to happen in _Midsommar_ does happen), it's beautifully crafted, brilliantly shot almost entirely in glaring sunlight, and vastly ambitious in scope (it runs 147 minutes). Indeed, it's the type of film where you can tell the director was given an unusual amount of freedom to fulfil their vision. And whilst that can often result in unmitigated disaster (think filmmakers such as Michael Cimino, Richard Kelly, and David Robert Mitchell), much like Jordan Peele's _Us_ (2019), _Midsommar_ avoids the dreaded sophomore slump without necessarily knocking it out of the park.\r\n\r\nThe film begins as Dani Ardor (a superb Florence Pugh) is hit with the kind of tragedy from which many would find it impossible to recover - her bipolar sister has killed their parents and subsequently committed suicide. Already emotionally fragile and prone to anxiety attacks even before their deaths, the incident sends Dani spiralling into despair, turning for support to her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor), an anthropology student struggling to find a topic for his PhD thesis. Unfortunately, for some time, Christian has wanted to break things off with Dani, as he finds her overly needy, and he had been trying to work up to ending the relationship when her family died. The following summer, Dani learns that Christian and fellow students Josh (William Jackson Harper) and Mark (Will Poulter) have been invited by Swedish student Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) to his ancestral pagan commune in H\u00e5rga, where a midsummer celebration that only occurs once every ninety years will be taking place, with Josh planning to write his PhD thesis on the festival, and Mark planning to have sex with as many Swedish girls as he can. Dani is upset that Christian didn't tell her about the trip, and to placate her, he invites her to come, never imagining she will say yes. But she does, much to Mark's disgust, and so the foursome accompany Pelle to Sweden, meeting the disturbingly polite and welcoming members of the commune, as well as English students Connie (Ellora Torchia) and Simon (Archie Madekwe), who were invited by Pelle's brother Ingemar (Hampus Hallberg). It doesn't take long, however, for the visitors to learn that things aren't exactly kosher in the commune - whether it's the elderly couple who fling themselves from the top of a cliff, the pies with pubic hair in them, the \"oracle\" child specifically bred through incest, the caged bear who seems to have no function in the festival, the strange yellow pyramid building which they are forbidden from entering, the elaborate murals depicting violence and torture, or the communal wailing.\r\n\r\n_Midsommar_ originally began life as a slasher movie set in a Swedish commune, until Aster revised the script to focus on a toxic relationship after going through a particularly bad breakup himself. Christian is your garden variety manipulator, who uses Dani's emotional vulnerability against her. For example, in a brilliantly written early scene, after she has learned about the trip, she's understandably upset that he didn't tell her about it, but in the space of just a couple of minutes he manipulates her into apologising to _him_. The core of the story is Dani slowly coming to realise that Christian isn't the man she thought he was, and in a weird way, it's a variation on the female revenge genre. However, whereas usually it's revenge for rape or assault, here it's revenge for being a complete and utter dick. In this sense, the film is primarily an allegory for the process of a young woman's emotional\/spiritual awakening independent of the man on whom she thought she had to rely. Indeed, one could take this even further if one reads the character names as symbolic; Dani's surname is Ardor, but she is denied love and passion, and in the paganism of the commune, she's offered something she can't get from a self-serving Christian(ity). Whether _Midsommar_ works for you or not will depend largely on how you respond to this element of the story - if you buy into the notion that Christian is the _de facto_ villain, and that Dani is an emotionally scarred young woman looking for support, you'll get a lot more out of it than if you think Dani is a needy whinger and Christian would do well to be rid of her.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, the film looks terrific, with Henrik Svensson's production designer, Andrea Flesch's costume designer, and Pawel Pogorzelski's cinematography especially praiseworthy. Whereas the US scenes are dark and confined, taking place in small poorly lit rooms with the characters wearing drab costumes, once the film shifts to Sweden, the visual design changes completely. The production design emphasises an open-plan vastness with unlimited space to move, but few places to hide; the cinematography drenches everything in glaring sunlight, which, again, makes it hard to hide; and the costume design focuses on brilliant white, with a smattering of colour. Unlike the vast majority of horror movies, there are few shadows or dark corners, but the film is shot in such a way that the very lack of such is itself disconcerting. The same is true for the always pristine costumes, which suggest that something is just not quite right underneath the veneer of cleanliness and insincere sense of perfection. Indeed, the attention to detail in the presentation of the commune is immensely impressive; the long middle act doesn't really feature much in the way of narrative incident, but it sure does a fine job of creating a _milieu_ that feels completely authentic and lived-in.\r\n\r\nThere are also some nice individual moments. For example, the choral singing with which the film begins is harshly interrupted by a telephone ringing, suggesting the clash between tradition and modernity that will play out throughout; Dani's hysterical crying upon learning of her family's deaths blends seamlessly with Bobby Krlic's wonderfully discordant music; a superb single-take shot takes Dani from heading to her apartment bathroom to entering the bathroom of an airplane; a high altitude shot showing a car travelling along a country road is imbued with malevolent undercurrent as the car passes under the camera, but rather than turning around to pick the vehicle up on the reverse angle, the camera follows the car by turning downwards, ending up upside-down, signalling to the viewer that things have changed irrevocably for the characters, as if they have crossed a barrier of some kind.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the narrative design, somewhat unusually, the film wears its predictability on its sleeve, with many of the major narrative beats not only foreshadowed but literally shown to the audience prior to occurring in the story, whether it be the mural that opens the film or the illustrations seen on the walls all over the commune \u2013 the _d\u00e9nouement_ isn't simply hinted at, it's all-but presented to us from the outset. With that in mind, anyone who has seen any folk horror will be able to predict much of what happens. Even if you're only familiar with _The Wicker Man_, you'll still be able to take a decent stab at how things are going to turn out. Of course, this allows the audience to roundly mock the characters' utter obliviousness to what's coming, which is presumably the point. You know that scene in most horror films where you think to yourself \"how can they not realise something nasty is going to happen\"? _Midsommar_ is like a 147-minute version of that one scene.\r\n\r\nAs for the acting, much as _Hereditary_ was Toni Collette's, _Midsommar_ belongs entirely to Florence Pugh, who's going from strength-to-strength at the moment. For most of the film, she's on the precipice of a nervous breakdown, with her performance redolent of Shelley Duval in Stanley Kubrick's _The Shining_ (1980). Pugh has already impressed in films as varied as Carol Morley's _The Falling_ (2014), William Oldroyd's _Lady Macbeth_ (2016), Richard Eyre's _King Lear_ (2018) and Stephen Merchant's _Fighting With My Family_ (2019), but _Midsommar_ is easily her best and most layered performance thus far, especially the gamut of contradictory emotions she runs in the batshit insane last 20 minutes. Elsewhere, the performances are all fine, but the actors aren't helped by the script. As Christian, Jack Reynor plays, well, Jack Reynor. There's nothing really wrong with the performance (although he is the least convincing academic ever put on screen), and he does do a decent job of getting the audience to loathe his passive-aggressive persona, but there isn't a huge amount of depth. The same is true of Will Poulter, who plays Mark as the kind of ignorant sex-crazed loudmouth that seems to only exist in the movies and who is never characterised beyond this caricature. As Josh, William Jackson Harper, although a far more believable academic than Reynor, barely registers, whilst Vilhelm Blomgren's Pelle is so one-note and obviously untrustworthy that it pushes suspension of disbelief to breaking point.\r\n\r\nAs this might suggest, one of the biggest problems with the film is the underwritten characters. This is especially true of Christian, a boyfriend so selfish and uncaring, one wonders how he ever wooed Dani in the first place. Additionally, their relationship is demarcated along painfully stereotypical lines \u2013 the emotional female whose need for support becomes overwhelming and the thoughtless bro who is more interested in hanging out with the boys than comforting his girlfriend. Another issue is that even aside from the character of Pelle, the film pushes the suspension of disbelief too far. There are multiple moments when the goings-on in the commune should prompt the visitors to leave immediately, but apart from a few weak attempts by Dani to persuade the others to go, they repeatedly accept the most ridiculous of situations based upon the most tenuous of explanations. Indeed, in a lot of ways, they're no different from the horny idiots who get picked off one by one in so many cheap slasher films. Furthermore, it doesn't help that initially Josh is depicted as an expert on paganism, and is familiar with many aspects of the festival, but later on, the script conveniently forgets about this when necessary.\r\n\r\nThematically, things are also quite jumbled. Whilst the core theme of a toxic relationship is present to one degree or another throughout, and Aster actually has some interesting things to say about complicity in such relationships, a lot of other ideas are thrown into the mix without really going anywhere \u2013 death, renewal, paganism itself, the nature of grief (and given the strong opening, that Aster allows this theme to drop off is especially disappointing). Additionally, as already mentioned, there are few surprises here. Aster is obviously a big fan of the subgenre of folk horror, but he allows reverence to the tropes supersede any kind of narrative inventiveness, leading to predictability, and as insane as the last 20 minutes are, nothing really happens that surprised me. Also, as in _Hereditary_, the explanation for what's going on isn't anywhere near as interesting as the ambiguity preceding it, making explicit something which was so deeply unsettling when implicit.\r\n\r\nThat all said, however, I did enjoy _Midsommar_. Not as disturbing as _Herditary_, it finds Aster again working with dread rather than quintessential horror tropes. Aesthetically impressive, and built on a terrific central performance, it could be accused of style over substance or cited as an example of a filmmaker whose ambitions outweigh his abilities, but ultimately, Aster's mastery of tone sees him through. The script could use some work, no doubt, but the ominous sense of dread is palpable throughout and is brilliantly handled, with the most mundane of objects imbued with haunting portentousness. The _d\u00e9nouement_ is more rote than I expected, and although Aster tries to tackle too many issues, his depiction of the death throes of a toxic relationship is as penetrating and emotionally honest as any ostensible relationship drama. Unnerving and audacious, _Midsommar_ is, ultimately, an exceptionally confident piece of filmmaking, if not necessarily an exceptional piece of filmmaking.","id":"5d894f3ed9f4a600204da5c2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d894f3ed9f4a600204da5c2","movie_id":530385}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nWith all due respect to Roland Emmerich and to his fantastic Independence Day, his movies never quite reach their potential, ending up in constant disappointments. It doesn't matter if he has excellent casts or amazing VFX teams, his films' screenplays are almost always stuffed with narrative issues. Midway is simply another installment in his saga of letdowns. Without knowing the director, anyone who looks at this movie will feel instantly captivated. From the unbelievably talented cast to the impressive visuals, it has two attention-grabber ingredients, which can result in a remarkable film\u2026 only if the two pillars of any cinematic production are decent enough: story and characters.\r\n\r\nThese are the main issue with Emmerich's movies. His characters are not compelling or intriguing enough, and his screenplays lack creativity and excitement (whether these are written by him or someone else). When I noticed that Midway had such an acclaimed cast and that it was about the Battle of Midway, I immediately got excited. War epics are a genre that I sincerely appreciate. However, when I checked who was \"running the show\", I instantly lowered my expectations. Honestly, it's exactly what I expected it to be: visually gripping, but emotionally hollow.\r\n\r\nI don't want to understate it. The CGI work in this film is jaw-dropping. The actual war is riveting with astonishing aerial sequences and powerful sound design. Even at a regular screening with the usual 7.1 Dolby surround speakers, the floor was rumbling with the explosions and the planes. This is why I think audiences will definitely enjoy this movie. Maybe not a vast majority, but surely most people will leave their theaters feeling it was good entertainment. It has a long runtime, and it's hard to get through the exposition-heavy story, but in the end, I bet the general public will appreciate the war action enough to give the whole thing a thumbs up.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it's still a very superficial flick. While it's very respectful to everyone who fought in the war (including the Japanese) and to the historic event on itself, it lacks emotional attachment to its characters. Dunkirk was praised by both critics and audiences all around the world, but its main criticism connects to what I just wrote. Christopher Nolan's film also didn't have any compelling characters. However, there's a big difference between these two movies. Both their marketing and their ultimate goal are distinct. Dunkirk was all about showing the actual war. It never marketed itself as a character-study or that it would even have a significant focus on some of the heroes that fought there. Nolan repeated several times: it's about the war and the war only.\r\n\r\nIt's genuinely one of the best, if not the best, *pure* war film I've ever seen. When it comes to depicting the claustrophobic, unbreathable, restless, bloody, loud event that a devastating war is, Dunkirk is so realistic it can even become uncomfortable with just sitting in your chair (at least, I did in IMAX). On the other hand, Midway's marketing was about paying homage to \"people who fought in the Battle of Midway\". Hence the stellar cast compared to Nolan's just competent actors (with obvious exceptions like Mark Rylance or Tom Hardy). It spends most of its screentime trying to develop the actual people that helped win that battle, not with the action itself. Therefore, these characters need engaging scripts and emotionally resonant arcs.\r\n\r\nWes Tooke delivers a screenplay packed with so much exposition that a lot of it looks clearly unrealistic. Characters discuss specific topics that don't make any sense of being in a conversation at a particular time and place. Throughout the runtime, there are dialogue sequences with the sole purpose of explicitly telling the audience what we need to know to understand the story, which ends up turning the narrative confusing, convoluted, and lacking faster pacing. It's tough to get through the non-action periods, and I can't even imagine how dull it would be without such an impeccable cast. Ed Skrein remarkably portrays Dick Best, the only character who's genuinely compelling and carries a complete, well-developed arc.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I didn't feel invested in any other character. Only the best movies of every year can have a numerous and talented cast while giving each and every actor an exciting role. Midway has too many characters for the story it wants to tell. In addition to this, it has to stretch its runtime because you can't get Woody Harrelson or Dennis Quaid playing secondary roles and not giving them more than just a couple of lines. As time goes by, Emmerich's storytelling structure gets needlessly more and more complicated to follow. It's yet another film added to the \"wasted potential\" list\u2026\r\n\r\nPotential due to how truly magnificent the action sequences can be. It's undeniable that these are entertaining, gripping, and exciting. The dive bombers' scenes are packed with so much tension that I was getting more and more frustrated every time they missed their target, and a bomb went into the sea. I wanted them to succeed so bad, and this feeling can only be triggered by something extraordinary. Midway's war is as close to epic as it could be, but as with every other cinematic production, if its story and its characters are not up to par with the action, there are no outstanding VFX that can save a lousy screenplay.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Midway is a respectful homage to the people who fought in the Battle of Midway, but it fails to deliver an engaging story with compelling characters. With more characters that what it needed, the runtime is stretched beyond its limit due to the numerous acclaimed actors who would never be in a movie if they didn't have more than a couple of lines. Roland Emmerich has to thank his VFX team for presenting the closest war action we could ever get of the famous battle. Truly epic visuals with tense and riveting aerial sequences, plus a powerful sound design, get your teeth biting the nails. Unfortunately, except for Ed Skrein's character, I didn't feel invested enough to appreciate the non-action moments due to the confusing, convoluted, and exposition-heavy narrative. It's a shame that a visually impressive film possesses such an emotionally dull story. However, I still recommend it for anyone who enjoys war epics and \"based on a true story\" adaptations.\r\n\r\nPS: it doesn\u2019t hurt to research a bit about the Battle of Midway. I didn\u2019t and I\u2019m sort of regretting that now. Don\u2019t make the same mistake. Going in with basic knowledge of what, how, and why it happened will only help you enjoy this movie more.\r\n\r\nRating: C+","id":"5dc5a360ab1bc70013ff7b68","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dc5a360ab1bc70013ff7b68","movie_id":522162}
{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nThis was easily one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Hereditary was my favorite film of 2018, so obviously, Ari Aster's second feature grabbed my full attention from the very first announcement. Fortunately, even though Midsommar is only being released now in my country, I was able to stay away from spoilers, as well as from any sort of images or clips. As you might expect, this is not a typical horror movie, even though it's being marketed as belonging to the genre. Sure, it has some horror stuff that indisputably connects it to the genre, but it definitely doesn't play out to scare audiences or make you have nightmares at night.\r\n\r\nHereditary was quite divisive among audiences due to the lack of traditional jump scares and generic entertainment, besides it being too excessive regarding spiritualism for the general public. Midsommar is undoubtedly going to be even more divisive. First of all, it drags. There's no denying it. The first weird cult scene only occurs about one hour in, which in a 140-minute runtime is a bit too far ahead. Granted, it's one of the most shocking and horrific sequences in the daylight I've ever seen, but its build-up (extremely well-done) takes a big part of the second act, slowing down the pacing too much.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it's a film that entirely relies its entertainment value on the feeling of shock instead of fear. If you didn't enjoy Aster's first feature because it didn't have enough scary sequences, Midsommar isn't going to convert you to being a fan of his work. Similarly to Ad Astra (just released last week), it's a story that requires the audience to care about more than only superficial aspects. If you go in expecting to leave your brain outside just so you can be uncloudedly entertained, then you might want to think again. I can't stress this enough: you need to pay attention to what you're watching!\r\n\r\nHints to what the story holds for us are everywhere, especially in the walls. Through paintings, runes, and hand-drawings, Ari Aster spreads basically all the information you need to better understand where the movie is going. It's a film about two key themes: how to deal with grief, and how to handle a complicated relationship. These are the issues that people should be able to acknowledge and understand how they're being developed. I love how Aster addresses the latter topic (he wrote this screenplay after he ended a relationship of his own), but I'm disappointed by the way he put the former into the \"background\".\r\n\r\nThe first 15-20 minutes deal with what happens to Dani's life, and it's never approached again, even though there's a vague idea of what could have actually happened, by the end of the movie. Regarding the other point, it isn't exactly a \"toxic\" relationship that we've seen in previous films, but one where each person is waiting for an excuse to leave the other. Hence, some actions feel forced in the hope that they can trigger something. It's a strangely realistic yet uncomfortable take on something a lot of people go through. Technically, this is one of 2019's most fascinating productions.\r\n\r\nFrom the colorful cinematography to the impeccable editing, from the stunningly impressive production design (again, the WALLS!) to the immersive score \u2026 Ari Aster is no joke. The way he handles dialogues is a treat to someone like me, who cares so much about engagement through characters speaking. There are so many long takes with Florence Pugh giving her all, just raw and powerful emotions. It's her career-best performance, no doubt about it. Her character's storyline is partially what brings the \"horror\" to the narrative. Just like Toni Colette on Hereditary, Pugh is probably going to be ignored during the awards season, as well as the movie's technical achievements since the horror genre still didn't convince enough people to give a shot.\r\n\r\nRegarding the other characters, they're my main issue. They simply felt like plot devices. Will Poulter (Mark) is funny as the comic-relief guy, but his character, like every other one besides Dani, doesn't do much to make me care about or feel invested in their own subplots (if there are any). They barely have any backstory, and their purpose is basically to help move the plot forward by giving Aster opportunities to show some pagan rituals of some kind. There are incredibly shocking, bloody, and jaw-dropping scenes, some might make you feel uncomfortable, others might make you laugh. But they're all meant to shock you in some shape or form.\r\n\r\nWhether you love it or hate it, Midsommar is memorable. If you didn't enjoy Hereditary due to the lack of jump scares, the former isn't for you then. Midsommar requires full attention, patience, and an open-minded mentality. It's not a generic horror flick, so don't go in expecting to be constantly entertained by silly scares. Expectations are everything, so moderate them in the best way possible. It has one of the most abstract ways of addressing a difficult relationship and how to deal with grief, but if you LOOK AT THE WALLS, you'll be able to (maybe) follow the story a bit better.\r\n\r\nTechnically, Ari Aster delivers a masterful work, with exceptional production design and gorgeous cinematography, plus seamless editing. Florence Pugh carries the story on her shoulders with an astonishingly compelling performance, but her supporting cast didn't do much with their under-developed characters. The film drags a lot, and it can become tedious at some point, but in the end, it's one of those movies that sticks with you. A second viewing may be necessary, and it will probably be a better experience. Can't wait to find out. Go see it!\r\n\r\nRating: B","id":"5d8e3626221ba60029b5833d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d8e3626221ba60029b5833d","movie_id":530385}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Just the facts, Jack***\r\n\r\nIntelligence officer Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) warns that a Japanese attack is imminent, but his advice is disregarded and the Japanese use their carrier fleet to attack Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) swiftly assumes command of the heavily weakened US Pacific Fleet. After the Doolittle air raid on Tokyo & Honshu 4.5 months later, \tevents lead up to the Battle of Midway on June 4\u20137, 1942. Ed Skrein plays cocky pilot Dick Best while Dennis Quaid is on hand as carrier commander William \"Bull\" Halsey. \r\n\r\n\"Midway\" (2019) tackles the Battle of Midway and events leading up to it without throwing in a dramatic fictional story, like the love triangle of \u201cPearl Harbor\u201d (2001). While I loved \u201cPearl Harbor\u201d and proudly stand by it, \u201cMidway\u201d chooses to stick to the facts and is thrilling from beginning to end. The main cast members are all real-life figures and there\u2019s a tribute to each at the close.  \r\n\r\nThis is superior to the 1976 movie because Roland Emmerich had the CGI technology to pull off the battle scenes which take place in & above the Pacific Ocean near the atoll of Midway, which is located a little over a thousand miles west of Hawaii. The flick successfully takes the viewer right into the midst of the fight on the water, in the air and under the water.

{"author":"Sheldon Nylander","content":"An impressive work, \u201cMidsommar\u201d is Ari Aster\u2019s follow-up to \u201cHerditary,\u201d a decent if flawed horror film.\r\n\r\n\u201cMidsommar\u201d follows Dani, who, after the tragic loss of her parents and sister, decides to follow her increasingly distant boyfriend and his friends on a trip to Sweden to visit the pagan cult commune their roommate, Pelle, grew up in. While seemingly open and friendly, it becomes obvious fairly quickly that something else is going on here. The obvious comparisons to \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d are not uncalled for.\r\n\r\nFirst, in the interest of full disclosure, this review is based on the nearly three-hour Director\u2019s Cut of the film rather than the theatrical release. I haven\u2019t even seen the theatrical release, so I can\u2019t attest as to what was added in the nearly 30 new minutes. I will say that the Director\u2019s Cut is pretty seamless and doesn\u2019t seem to have any superfluous scenes.\r\n\r\nSecond, we need to start with the elephant in the room and address how this compares to \u201cHereditary,\u201d which as I stated was okay but flawed. The major flaw in that film is that it has its own internal consistency, but doesn\u2019t have consistency from an audience standpoint. There\u2019s only the most minor of hints as to the truth, and it\u2019s clear that in that world, such things were possible, but the audience isn\u2019t really let in on the answer until the end. The audience has to think about it to get that internal logic. I\u2019m usually the type that doesn\u2019t like spoonfeeding information to the audience, but this withheld a little too much.\r\n\r\nOkay, that was \u201cHereditary.\u201d So how does \u201cMidsommar\u201d compare? Well, it\u2019s far better in terms of letting the audience in on the secret and revealing its internal logic. But, sometimes it\u2019s too good at it. There\u2019s not much of a secret. You know what\u2019s ultimately coming.\r\n\r\nHowever, interestingly this is where the brilliance of the movie actually comes in. Much like life and sex, it\u2019s about the journey, not the destination. We know where we\u2019re going, but the fun is in seeing how we get there. And it\u2019s a fun and colorful journey. This is bright daytime horror, taking place in Sweden at Midsommar when there is very little darkness at night, which itself could be a metaphor in that we can see the end and know where we\u2019re going.\r\n\r\nSo, why only 4 stars? The film is great, but definitely not perfect and has a couple deep flaws. I could give the film a little more credit if it did conceal the end a little more, giving a less obvious \u201ctwist.\u201d The other is that it sticks pretty close to traditional character archetypes for horror films. If you don\u2019t know what I mean, this was very well addressed in \u201cCabin in the Woods.\u201d A little more variety and a little added creativity could have elevated \u201cMidsommar\u2019s\u201d score. While it\u2019s still great, don\u2019t expect a perfect film.","id":"5db93e062d37210015eaa959","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5db93e062d37210015eaa959","movie_id":530385}

{"author":"SierraKiloBravo","content":"Click here for a video version of this review: youtu.be\/2Mr6XRF4GR4\r\n\r\n_Midway_ is an ambitous film that sets out to follow the United States entry into World War Two, from the attack on Pearl Harbour through to the Battle of Midway. To tell this story it focuses on two main characters who are also based on real life people. There's Ed Skrein playing Dick Best, a pilot on the USS Enterprise, and Patrick Wilson playing intelligence officer Edwin Layton.\r\n\r\nAs you might imagine jamming seven months of war into just over two hours is a big task, and while they did manage to pull this off, the result is a movie that feels rushed, where we can't get to know all the many characters, and which probably requires a pretty strong knowledge of this time period in history to understand all the things that are rapidly being thrown on screen.\r\n\r\nI actually had a lot of trouble telling who was who in many of the scenes involving the pilots. Apart from Ed Skrein and Luke Evans the rest of the pilots and rear gunners are such a copy \/ paste of each other and they come and go so fast on screen that you have zero time to have any kind of emotional connection to them, even though the movie tries to make you feel for them. For a lead actor, Skrein is very wooden and uninspiring, and I don't think has shoulders big enough to carry his part of the film.\r\n\r\nThen, as if the 10,000 mile an hour story is not bad enough, this movie relies very heavily on visual effects. Apart from close-ups, everything you see that involves a ship or a plane is entirely CGI and it is woefully bad 99% of the time. I've used the Playstation analogy a lot, and this is another example. I feel like if they had cut back the story to not cover so many fights and battles, there would have been a lot less visual effect shots. And with less shots to create and render, perhaps those remaining would have come out looking more realistic. As it is, it really takes you out of the movie - the planes move like they are weightless and defy the laws of physics, the explosions look they were made in AfterEffects, and each scene on a ship has that horrible green screen glow about it.\r\n\r\nIn summary I think this movie suffers from trying to do too much all at once. This came off feeling more like a trilogy of movies about Pearl Harbour, The Doolittle Raid, and The Battle of Midway had been edited down to one single movie. The end result is a rushed film that is hard to follow, whose characters are difficult to connect with, and whose visual effects are video game level at best. This will not go down in history as a great war film.","id":"5ea38739af432400259ff3dc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ea38739af432400259ff3dc","movie_id":522162}

All the other performances were on DOT.\r\n\r\nThe story takes its time to build in the first half with necessary Sikh-comedy, typical Bollywood secularism, but it\u2019s the second hour where the full blown action occupies all the frames. The cinematography is top notch and cynosure to the eyes, music is equally and emotionally-effective; while the BGM provokes the audience while setting up the war frames.\r\n\r\nThe air within Bollywood is blowing in a different direction as these days the films are being made on the right concept and true heroes which is a welcome change. The Nationalists are lapping up such films wholeheartedly.","id":"5def3e12688cd00017215de1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5def3e12688cd00017215de1","movie_id":498448}

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"Doctor Sleep may not diagnose you to the land of nod, but tediously drains your shining spirit. Director Mike Flanagan had an unfathomable task. To both adapt a Stephen King novel, which is no easy achievement considering his uniquely descriptive writing style, and provide a sequel to what many describe as \u201cthe greatest horror film of all-time\u201d. Quenching the thirst of King\u2019s avid readers and cinephiles alike. So even without divulging my own opinion on Doctor Sleep, applause must be given for just producing this feature. That, unfortunately for Flanagan, doesn\u2019t result in myself excusing specific inexcusable filmmaking tendencies that taint, not just Doctor Sleep, but various decaying intellectual properties that have been unnecessarily drudged up again.\r\n\r\nAn alcoholic scarred Dan Torrance, having endured the irrevocable dangers of the Overlook Hotel (\u2018The Shining\u2019), has his peace shattered when he encounters a young extrasensory girl whom is being hunted down by shine-draining monsters.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, I have not read the novel, although this should not come as a surprise. I have however, watched \u2018The Shining\u2019 multiple times. Now, what promotes the aforementioned horror as the best of its kind, is legendary Stanley Kubrick using the essence of King\u2019s novel and essentially making his own iteration of it. One that the renowned supernatural writer still, to this day, has mixed emotions for. So for Flanagan to introduce some faithful interpretations of Doctor Sleep, whilst maintaining the cinematic endeavour that Kubrick meticulously crafted, is as I said, unfathomable. And there\u2019s a perfectly valid reason for that. The overtly supernatural strands of the novels do not complement the genesis of terror from Kubrick\u2019s film. Which is why, with great regret, I have to report that Doctor Sleep does not work. It doesn\u2019t.\r\n\r\nA beastly behemoth that, whilst does stand on its own two legs, relies on heavy-handed storytelling techniques and nostalgia to tackle both mediums that inspired it. In tonality, they are irrefutably different from each other. But before the disappointing third act is tackled, let\u2019s address some positives first.\r\n\r\nDoctor Sleep is a shining example of depicting childhood trauma and how fragmented coping mechanisms are embedded throughout adulthood. Young Danny imaginatively designs mental traps so that he can hold the starving ghosts from the Overlook in captivity. Yet that wilful mentality does not prevent him from suffering with alcoholism, substance abuse and an insalubrious lifestyle that masquerades the trauma instead of curing it. Thematically, this is powerful, and grants the narrative a solid cohesion throughout. For the first two hours, you subconsciously warm to Danny due to the tormenting fears he has established throughout the two films. He\u2019s a pillar of \u201cthe shining\u201d. McGregor consistently captivated by depicting a fragile mentality through a physically demanding performance, maintaining the entranced demeanour of his younger character.\r\n\r\nThe first hour, that heavily explained \u201cthe shining\u201d and the intentions of the merciless antagonists The True Knot, experienced inconsistent tones due to the mass sprawl of locational change. One minute we\u2019re in a sleepy town, the next a woodland area, and then all of a sudden eight years have been and gone. The zippy nature of the editing and bloated exposition resulted in atmospheric terror being abolished. The tension was non-existent, and the imitation of Kubrick\u2019s directing style paled in comparison.\r\n\r\nThen, the second hour commenced, which is by far one of the strongest acts the year has yet to offer. Flanagan retained a surprisingly dark tone that, was so shocking, forced audience members to leave the auditorium. The mind-space of Abra, a precocious teenager who has \u201cshine\u201d, produced a transcendental imaginative battle against Rose the Hat, leader of The True Knot. Ferguson, who portrayed the primary antagonist, was sensational. Equalling the likes of Pennywise as one of the most enthralling King villains ever depicted. Sinister, unrelenting and bordering on near-lunacy. Controlling every scene from just her eyes alone, she enhanced the palpable tension. She made the second act. In fact, she made the film. The interjecting gore and darkness throughout the middling act abruptly astonished me, and settled for a direction that I thought would control the underwhelming first act.\r\n\r\nThe third act then arrives, and the entire story crumbles much like the Overlook itself. Plagued by an overshadowing sickness that \u2018The Shining\u2019 had produced. Nostalgia. Remember that time where Jack viciously chopped the bedroom door down with an axe? Or that moment where blood came hurtling through the hallways in slow motion? What about Room 237? The introductory swooping camera movement that Kubrick embraced whilst the Torrance\u2019s drove to the hotel? The typewriter? Slowly walking up the stairs in a confrontational manner? The snow-covered hedge maze? The twins? No? You don\u2019t remember? Flanagan has got you covered. Nostalgia is a powerful tool, yet it must be handled with delicacy. The difference between imitating and homaging is very fine, and unfortunately Flanagan settled for the former.\r\n\r\nSo much of \u2018The Shining\u2019 is replicated in the third act, scene for scene, that it was a near-identical copy without the textual substance that accompanied them originally. The re-casting of the original actors, despite Essoe bettering Duvall\u2019s performance (although not difficult), felt unnecessary. Almost tarnishing \u2018The Shining\u2019 in itself. Danny walking through the dilapidated hallways for ten minutes whilst Flanagan incorporates identical sequences, had no purpose other than to forcefully remind you that this is the sequel. Literarily, it never progresses Danny\u2019s character or the plot. Rose the Hat staring at the blood-spewing elevators? Pointless. Danny staring at an axe encased in glass? A suitable nod to its predecessor. Do you see the difference? Between imitation and homage? The third act was littered with falsified copies, preying on the nostalgia of fans. It\u2019s uninspired. It\u2019s mundane. And it made me a dull boy.\r\n\r\nCreatively, Doctor Sleep managed to infuse the very best of its adapted novel and preceding feature, but embellished the very worst techniques when conveying the plot. Psychologically stimulating without installing dread. Extrasensory without testing the senses. Dimly shining amongst King\u2019s supernatural adaptations.","id":"5e20721ab3316b00130356b2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e20721ab3316b00130356b2","movie_id":501170}

{"author":"Matthew Brady","content":"\u201cHi there\u201d\r\n\r\nHello there...\r\n\r\nMike Flanagan has some of the biggest balls in the horror industry. I mean just look at his filmography so far.\r\n\r\nHe took one of the worst horror movies in recent memory \u2018Ouija\u2019 and said: \u201cyeah, I wanna make a sequel to that\u201d, with \u2018Ouija: Origin of Evil\u2019 and somehow made it less terrible. How about \u2018Haunting of Hill House\u2019 where he\u2019s going to direct every episode of a television series that has to weave two narratives together at once over ten episodes...and again he somehow made it work. And now this guy is gonna make a sequel to one of the most revered horror movies of all time with \u2018Doctor Sleep\u2019...the son of b**ch did it again!\r\n\r\nI think Flanagan deserves more credit as a director rather than people bitching that his movies \u201cain't scary enough an-\u201d blah blah blah shut the hell up.\r\n\r\n\u2018Doctor Sleep\u2019 was a complete surprise for all the right reasons. At first I wasn\u2019t sure if the movie would hook me, because it takes awhile for it to get going, but slowly I got invested in the story and the characters. There have been four Stephen King movie adaptions this year: \u2018Pet Sematary\u2019, \u2018IT Chapter Two\u2019, \u2018In The Tall Grass\u2019, and now this movie. This is by far the best out of them all.\r\n\r\nThe runtime is 152 minutes long and I can safely say that the movie is 85% it\u2019s own thing, because it doesn't just rely on nostalgia to tell their story and it\u2019s only the last act where things start to play on nostalgia when the characters return to the Overlook Hotel. The nostalgia being the 80\u2019s horror classic of course. It\u2019s either that or 97 TV mini-series. Who\u2019s got fond memories for that piece of sh*t? So with this being both a sequel to Kubrick's movie and King\u2019s original novel; a clash of visions coming together with Flanagan trying to put this together, while also applying his own vision into the mix.\r\n\r\nNow that\u2019s hard.\r\n\r\nThe part that got me invested in the story was the scene between Danny and a elderly patient who\u2019s on their death bed. Danny comforts them as their peacefully past away, without dying alone. It\u2019s a beautiful and heartfelt scene that you would never expect to see in a supernatural horror movie.\r\n\r\nEwan Mcgregor was fantastic as an alcoholic grown-up Danny Torrance. Nicholson's presence was felt through out the movie as adult Danny fears he might follow in his fathers footsteps. There\u2019s a scene where Danny gives a talk at a rehab group and as doing so he reflects deeply on everything that happened to him in the past, while the camera is locked on Ewan\u2019s face. Not only from his childhood, but everything afterwards and drowning out the trauma through drinking - something that us as the audience don\u2019t see. I thought he was excellent. He absolutely \u201cshines\u201d as the character...and am not sorry for that pun.\r\n\r\nI loved how fleshed out the villains were, which surprised me the most about the movie. They are like vampires, but instead of feasting on blood, it\u2019s \u201cthe shining\u201d they crave for a expanded life. Casual and charming, and yet wickedly evil. There\u2019s a particularly scene that was so difficult to watch and really got under my skin. However you do get to see them interreacting with each other in normal conversations as they casually go on with the day and work as a group. Rose the Hat sticks out from the rest as a sinister and endearing villian played marvelously by Rebecca Ferguson.\r\n\r\nMike Flanagan dose a great job on balancing both Kubrick\u2019s and King\u2019s version respectfully, but also manages to put his visual spin in. The one thing that hasn\u2019t been mention yet is how great he is with child actors as he always gets the best performance out of them, especially Jacob Tremblay and Kyliegh Curran who was so convincing in the roles it was scary.\r\n\r\nThe movie looks stunning with the use of colors adding to the overall tone and helps creates the horror atmosphere. Same thing with the score that while it takes samples from Kubrick\u2019s movie, but not to say it doesn\u2019t have it\u2019s own.\r\n\r\nFor issues:\r\n\r\nThere was a couple of callbacks that was a little on the noise, usually through references. As I said early the movie takes a while to find it\u2019s footing and you couldn\u2019t help but draw comparisons. There were a few questionable and almost silly lines that King himself would inject into his work for humor, but here, with tone in mind, just took the fear out of it.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: \u201cEat well and live long.\u201d","id":"5e2f2797c56d2d001a4e48b6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2f2797c56d2d001a4e48b6","movie_id":501170}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nThere's this misconceived idea that \"scary movies\" are the ones with demons, monsters, or ghosts literally showing up in jump scare sequences, one after another, accompanied by an extremely loud sound. Granted, we're scared of what we're scared of. No debate here. However, one common complaint about this type of horror films is that they aren't \"scary enough\". I couldn't disagree more. These movies are the ones that truly get to us and stay with us for a while. If we watch a film with cyclical jump scares, we're going to forget about it as soon as we leave the theater. Movies with a horrific story, based on relatable themes, those are the ones that leave us uncomfortable and disturbed. I'm just writing this \"prologue\" to say that you shouldn't go in expecting a \"scary\" film. At least, not in a mainstream way. Moving on...\r\n\r\nAs you probably know by now (if you don't, check out my The Shining's review), I'm a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's novel of the same name. It's a cult classic horror movie, one that influenced generations to come, especially regarding filmmaking techniques and equipment. With that said, Mike Flanagan had one of the toughest jobs of 2019. Not only did he need to deliver a sequel worthy of being associated with a beloved classic, but he had to deal with all the differences between the source material and Kubrick's changes. I'm going to leave a SPOILER WARNING for The Shining since the film came out 40 years ago, and I already wrote a review about it. Still, SPOILER-FREE for Doctor Sleep, don't worry.\r\n\r\nIn case you don't know, the major difference between King's book and Kubrick's cinematic adaptation is the ending. In the book, Jack Torrance forgets to relieve the hotel boiler's pressure, and it explodes, destroying the hotel and killing Jack in the process. In Kubrick's movie, Jack freezes to death in the maze outside the hotel while chasing his son, while the hotel stands tall. Flanagan is able to do the impossible: he perfectly continues the story left by Kubrick while respecting King's \"demands\". Just don't go with a \"purist\" mentality, thinking that Flanagan doesn't have the right to explore and expand \"the shining\". It's a sequel, so expect things to be added to the story (nothing is removed or retconned, so relax). As long as it makes sense, be always open to new ideas.\r\n\r\nAs the director, Flanagan proves once again he's a pretty talented guy by seamlessly recreating some of The Shining's most iconic scenes, but also by delivering some tricks of his own. With the help of his amazing cinematographer, Michael Fimognari, they are able to generate incredible levels of tension, characteristic of the original film. As the editor, he puts together everything remarkably well. The sequences inside someone's mind are wonderfully handled and provide some of the best moments of the entire movie. However, there's a massive difference when it comes to how the runtime flows in each film.\r\n\r\nBoth cross the 140-minute mark, and both purposefully employ slow pacing. Nevertheless, The Shining feels like it goes by way faster than Doctor Sleep (and mathematically it does have less 5-10 minutes, but that's not the point). Why? Due to Kubrick's movie constantly having long takes and extense dialogues, while Flanagan's installment has a modern approach with regular cuts plus much more action. Audiences presumably won't think of this (it's not like the \"average Joe\" notices or even cares if a scene has been going for 5 minutes straight or pieced together with 50 cuts), and just assume that the latter is more boring than the first without really understanding why.\r\n\r\nPeople will probably blindly blame the story, but Doctor Sleep has a lot more \"blockbuster entertainment\" than The Shining. The latter is pretty much two hours spent inside a hotel where dialogue is the primary source of entertainment (things only go crazy in the last 15-20 minutes), and we all know that the general public usually doesn't fall for that. The sequel has a lot more action, subplots, and characters, so the runtime should go by faster than the original, right? No. This film is the number one proof that I'm going to use from now on to defend that uncut dialogue sequences and overall long takes are the best way of managing an extended runtime without it feeling too \"heavy\", especially in a psychological horror flick.\r\n\r\nI wrote all these last paragraphs not to complain about the movie's being too slow, too long, or too dull. I'm just trying to help everyone understand why the film might feel slower and (much) longer, while protecting its story because the screenplay is indeed extremely well-written. Like in the original, exposition is handled beautifully with scarce lazy displays, but it's the characters of Ewan McGregor and the debutant Kyliegh Curran that carry the narrative effortlessly. McGregor is the perfect casting as Danny Torrance, and he does a great job of embodying Dan's personality. However, it's Danny's journey through his young and adult years that impresses me.\r\n\r\nExceptional character development! Danny's life after the events at the Overlook Hotel is as realistic and logical as it could be. Flanagan does a phenomenal job in handling this character and throwing just the right obstacles in his path. The way he deals with the aftermath of The Shining, how he grows up as a man, and even what he ends up doing for a living, everything is absolutely perfect. Furthermore, he's not alone. Abra is a badass young girl who wants to use her \"shine\" to protect others, but this time it's the actress that steals the spotlight from the character. Kyliegh Curran delivers one of the best young acting debuts I've ever witnessed. She's wonderful as Abra, and her range of emotions is already surprisingly vast.\r\n\r\nShe has some of the best scenes of the movie, especially when she's \"fighting\" Rose the Hat, but here is where we get to my major issue with the film. Rebecca Ferguson gives an outstanding performance, no doubt about it. She elevates infinite sequences, giving 200% to her role. However, her character and The True Knot group are the only significant flaw of this sequel. When writing a villain, there are basically two paths for success: either make the \"bad guy\" a compelling character with whom the audience can create some sort of empathy with and understand where he\/she comes from, or turn him\/her into a menacing, powerful, scary force that makes us fear for our heroes.\r\n\r\nFlanagan apparently chooses the latter route, and unfortunately, it's his only misstep. I don't know if King didn't allow for changes to Rose or The True Knot cult, but they don't quite work when adapting to the big screen. Not only their history is never truly explored, but their motivations are too shallow, so I didn't care for a single character from the group, not even Rose. If she was the \"menacing, powerful, scary force\" that I wrote above, this wouldn't be so important, but the truth is she isn't. As the narrative progresses, there's a constant reminder that our heroes are in danger and that Rose is astonishingly strong, but the interactions between her and Abra prove the contrary. So, I never really felt frightened or overwhelmed by her.\r\n\r\nA decent portion of runtime is handed to Rose's group, but its development didn't work for me at all. They're not bad villains, and they're still more fleshed out that a lot of characters in horror movies. I just think something's missing. Nevertheless, that's the only major problem I have with the movie. For true fans of The Shining, the countless references and Easter Eggs are such a delight (there's good and bad fan-service, the one present in this sequel only appears after we are already invested in the story and its characters, demonstrating once more Flanagan's talent). From the haunting and addictive score that The Newton Brothers are able to seamlessly adapt to the sequel to the influential Kubrick's framing, Flanagan and his team produce something pretty extraordinary having in mind this is a sequel to one of the most beloved horror films of all-time.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Doctor Sleep might be the first sequel\/remake\/reboot\/whatever to a cult classic movie that doesn't diminish the original, disgracefully copies it or takes something away from it, while actually being an individually great film with a captivating narrative and compelling leads, plus the right amount of homages to the classic. Mike Flanagan took the impossible task of balancing both Stephen King's The Shining and Stanley Kubrick's cinematic adaptation, and successfully nailed pretty much everything regarding the connection between the main stories. In addition to the slow pacing not working as well as in the original, The True Knot group is the big stumble in an otherwise pretty consistent screenplay. However, the phenomenal cast (with a terrific debut performance from\u00a0Kyliegh Curran) elevate every scene, ultimately driving the sequel to a nostalgia-full ending that will turn out to be divisive among fans. I stand on the good side. Therefore, I genuinely appreciate this movie. If you're a fan of the original, you can't miss this one!\r\n\r\nRating: A-","id":"5dbb01b612970c001838bead","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dbb01b612970c001838bead","movie_id":501170}

{"author":"narrator56","content":"It doesn't always work, but I figure and movie with Timothy Spall in it is worth a look. Mrs. Lowry and Son is one of those slowly paced movies that you have to let roll over you and be patient. The two characters are not always likable and may let you down in small ways, as they let each other down, but I was till rooting for them.\r\n\r\nL.S. Lowry as presented here and presumably in his life was a very complex character. I liked how he was playful with neighborhood children and poetic when describing as a painter the scenes and places he has seen. But the other side of him is the rent collector trudging around town, and the timid soul who tries in vain to impress his mother and gain her love. And I don't have reason to doubt this depiction of him, as I have since read, for example, that in real life he refused several awards later in life, including the royal OBE because, his thought was, what would be the point since his mother was now gone.\r\n\r\nI can't say his artwork impresses me, with his matchstick men and all, but I leave that to those who know art. His artistic sensibilities were grounded in the harshness of life for the working classes during the Industrial Revolution. Therefore it seemed symbolic to see him walk through a gorgeous scene of verdant green fields and trees, reach the top of a slope, and and then paint a cluster of squatting factories. Yes, a different sort of artist.\r\n\r\nOne other aspect of Spall's performance occurred to me. It reminded me of a couple of his Mike Leigh films, such as Secrets and Lies, where he gives a measured, restrained performance all the way through only to explode as an actor for an emotionally powerful scene near the end. Worth watching, but not for when you are in the move for a lively movie.","id":"5e85d4a498f1f10012ab18dc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e85d4a498f1f10012ab18dc","movie_id":604298}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\n1941\u2019s Dumbo was never a favorite of mine. It\u2019s a great movie with a sweet message (as most Disney flicks), but I was curious to see how a remake of a 60-min film would develop. Obviously, changes to the story not only will occur, but they need to. People have to stop desiring these live-action remakes to be a literal copy-paste of their originals and start being fair to these movies. Pure animation is different from live-action, and the latter provides a much more realistic environment than the former, so it\u2019s evident that every remake they produce will have some \u201cupdates\u201d in the more \u201csilly\u201d aspects.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I\u2019ve witnessed a couple of \u201ccritics\u201d hating this Dumbo. Hating! Calling it one of the worst films of the year! Now that\u2019s a strong feeling to have against a movie that improves so much regarding its original. Yes, it has a bunch of narrative issues, and the dialogues can be cringe-worthy, but hating this 2019 remake while defending the original as it was some kind of masterpiece is ridiculous. Complaining about the 2019\u2019s ending when the 1941\u2019s is absolutely inadmissible is being a hypocrite. Whining about Dumbo not being 100% the star of the show when the original has the elephant discover his flight abilities four minutes before the end is dumb. In addition to that, this film runs for twice the original\u2019s runtime! What did you expect?! That human characters wouldn\u2019t be a necessary modification? \r\n\r\nSome \u201ccritics\u201d are even complaining about animal abuse or their unnecessary exploration \u2026 Are they joking?! Have they seen the original? Do they remember how racist it was? How discrimination was treated as comedy? Even alcohol was handled as a plot point for God\u2019s sake! 2019\u2019s Dumbo barely has any animal violence, and its final message is against animal captivity or exploration, so any person who criticizes this ending is either a despicable human being or not a fan of the original Dumbo, at all.\r\n\r\nEnough about those \u201ccritics\u201d. I feel sick just remembering what they wrote\/said. Unfortunately, 2019\u2019s Dumbo does have a lot of screenplay issues. There\u2019s no way of denying it. The human characters are filled with cliche storylines and child-written dialogues. I know that analyzing children\u2019s acting is not exactly a fair critic, but I\u2019ve seen so many remarkable young actors nowadays, who make Nico Parker and Finley Hobbins performances look not that good (their scripts also don\u2019t help). The visual style characteristic of Tim Burton is definitely present, even if its magic becomes overwhelming at times. 1941\u2019s Dumbo was very concentrated in one small location contrary to its 2019 remake where V. A. Vandevere\u2018s park feels like Disneyland.\r\n\r\nThe stiff dialogues don\u2019t help the movie\u2019s pacing, and its tone could be better balanced. Nevertheless, just the opportunity to watch such a gorgeous, magnificent, and visually jaw-dropping live-action elephant come to life is absolutely delightful and entertaining as hell. When a character like Dumbo makes you cry when he\u2019s crying, makes you feel sad when he\u2019s feeling sad, makes you happy when he\u2019s feeling happy, that\u2019s when you know the visual effects team has reached a point where live-action is pretty much reality. The little elephant looks like an adorable little elephant. I mean, what better compliment can I give a live-action character than \u201cit looks and feels real\u201d?\r\n\r\nEven with the issues mentioned above, it\u2019s still a heartfelt story, filled with emotional moments, and a wonderful message. Technically, it might lack consistency and some overall quality, but I end up enjoying myself. Experiencing Dumbo\u2018s pain, happiness, and his bond with the kids flourish is special. Colin Farrell and Eva Green deliver good performances, and their character arcs, cliche as they may be, still carry some efficiency. There\u2019s a wrong vibe surrounding the word \u201ccliche\u201d, like it\u2019s a bad thing. Not at all! Something being cliche just means we\u2019ve seen that before a lot of times, it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ve seen it performed better or worse. Dumbo is a remake of a very influential 1941 film, so obviously, cliches are a certainty. It\u2019s a Disney tale, after all. \r\n\r\nIn the end, cliche as it might be, 2019\u2019s Dumbo improves on a lot of aspects of its predecessor. I do believe these movies are almost incomparable since the dimension, runtime, and even the main plot are surprisingly (or not) different. Still, not remembering or even acknowledging the original not only is an absolute flaw, but it can ultimately make you a hypocrite, so be careful with what you write\/say. I understand a person not enjoying this film or not liking it as much as I did, but if you hate (!) it, you better give me good enough reasons.\r\n\r\nDumbo is probably the most visually stunning and incredibly realistic live-action character Disney was able to produce so far. This little elephant alone is worth the price of admission. His arc is way bigger and complex than the one in the original, which can either delight or disappoint you. To me, it not only worked, but it finished strong and way better than the original. It\u2019s upsetting that the screenplay couldn\u2019t accompany Burton\u2018s impressive visual style, even if overwhelming at times, as well as the human characters who feel a bit detached from the actual story to tell. It\u2019s still a good time at the movie theater, so go see it!\r\n\r\nRating: B","id":"5ca367a60e0a2605a68e73d1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ca367a60e0a2605a68e73d1","movie_id":329996}
{"author":"garethmb","content":"Disney has continued their trend of live-action remakes of their animated classics with \u201cDumbo\u201d. The film follows the same premise as the 1941 classic in that a baby elephant with giant ears is born into a travelling circus. Like in the animated film he is separated from his mother and soon becomes an unlikely circus act when it is discovered that his giant ears give him the power of flight. \r\nIn the new version we are introduced to Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell); who returns from WWI injured and dealing with the fact that his wife has died  and he must raise their two children alone. Further complicating matters is the fact that Circus owner Max Medici (Danny DeVito), has sold the prized horses Holt used in his act in an effort to keep his struggling circus alive. \r\nWhat has become a tragedy soon becomes a boon when wealthy industrialist V.A. Vandevere (<ichael Keaton) offers to make Max a partner and take him and his troup on at his fabled entertainment park with Dumbo as his featured star. \r\nIt is at this point where the film takes some wild deviations and becomes very linear with paper thin characters and an emphasis on effects over story. \r\nDirector Tim Burton has once again crafted a film filled with lavish visuals as his take on the entertainment park and circus is amazing; but it as usual comes at a cost. Like most of Burton\u2019s works, the visuals are the star and key element and the development of characters and story are often given little more than lip service. \r\nThe same is true fro this film as we learn noting about the motivation of the characters and the villains play out as stock baddies without even a nod as to why they are so inclined to tehir action.s They are being evil just for the sake of being evil. The same can be said for the other characters as we are given very little reasons to care for them. There is a nice subplot with Eva Green but it is never fully developed and the worst part is that the title star almost becomes an afterthought in the final acts so we can be given scene after scene of lavinsh park visuals. \r\nThe film may be a bit to dark and intense at times for younger viewers and those who remember the original may have a hard time with this take of the film. It entertains at times but could have been so much better. \r\n3 stars out of 5 \r\n \r\nSecond review by Tracey Barrientos\r\nIn 1941 Walt Disney Pictures brought audiences around the world the fourth animated Disney feature film Dumbo. 78 years later Disney has partnered with Tim Burton to bring audiences of new generations a fresh and live action take on the classic tale.\r\nAfter returning home and left injured from the war, Holt Farrier (Collin Farrell) unites with his kids and his beloved job and home. His home is a traveling circus and his act has been cut due to his injury. Max Medici (Danny DeVito) the owner of the circus asks him to forget about the act and instead take care of a newborn elephant with hopes that the young elephant would help the once booming but now looming circus. The peculiar pachyderm nicknamed Dumbo with extremely oversized ears is the new laughingstock of the circus until Holt\u2019s children discover the magic within Dumbo. He can fly and is attracting attention from all around.\r\nAs a huge Tim Burton fan I was ecstatic to hear that he was set to direct the live action version of the beloved film. A fantastic cast was put together and to be honest I don\u2019t know that anybody else could\u2019ve played those roles as well as Collin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Eva Green and Alan Arkin just to name a few. They brought a sense of magic and true emotion to each character which added depth and soul to the film. Every time the first note from Danny Elfman\u2019s music reaches my ear I instantly get goosebumps. I was extremely happy to here that familiar music in this film. As with all of Tim Burton\u2019s films, it gave a touch of magic and intrigue that Dumbo deserved. The colors were beautiful and vibrant but still held drab contrast to what we are normally used to.\r\nI was asked a little bit ago if the film made me cry. The answer is I did. Both with sad and happy tears. A film that encapsulates so many emotions in only two hours and leaves you with a happy heart, THAT is what I look for in a film. That is what a film should make an audience feel. A good tug at those heart strings along with happiness and laughter is the perfect formula. Well done Mr. Burton! I recommend this film to be seen by fans old and new because you won\u2019t be disappointed.\r\n5 out of 5!","id":"5c9cfacd0e0a2613ebebb767","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c9cfacd0e0a2613ebebb767","movie_id":329996}

{"author":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","content":"\u201cAd Astra\u201d is one of the most cerebral sci-fi films I\u2019ve ever seen. The original story from writer \/ director James Gray gives an intimate look at the emotional toll that comes from being just one man lost among the stars in the vastness of space. It\u2019s like a more existential version of Terrence Malik\u2019s \u201cTree of Life,\u201d but set in the outer reaches of our galaxy.\r\n\r\nRoy McBride (Brad Pitt), an astronaut with nerves of steel, travels to Neptune to find his missing hero astronaut father (Tommy Lee Jones). As part of a top secret mission, Roy begins to unravel a mystery and uncover truths that may threaten the survival of Earth. This may sound like a blockbuster action thriller, but it\u2019s not. Instead, the film is an emotionally complex introspective about a man burdened with the sins of his father.\r\n\r\nPitt gives a stunning, understated performance as a man struggling with the psychological toll of isolation and regret. It\u2019s one of his best to date, and it\u2019s nearly impossible not to have a deep emotional connection as you share his character\u2019s established sadness. The father and son dynamic shapes Roy\u2019s life, and he\u2019s never quite gotten over the abandonment issues he\u2019s felt since he was a child. The scenes where Roy and Cliff finally reunite are brief but come from a heartfelt place of forgiveness that grows with the passage of time. It\u2019s the perfect analysis of our own humanity, as we all continue searching with a blind hope to find our footing in the cosmos.\r\n\r\nThe film relies heavily on voiceover narration from Roy, something I normally hate because it feels like lazy storytelling. That isn\u2019t the case here. It works well and is a very effective method that complements the director\u2019s vision. In fact, everything about this film is a success, from Max Richter\u2018s haunting original score to the special effects and striking cinematography (by Hoyte Van Hoytema), tight direction, and detailed sound design. Gray achieves what he\u2019s going for when every element of the film works together as a whole, and it all is executed in a stunning fashion.\r\n\r\n\u201cAd Astra\u201d is highly intelligent and melancholy science fiction that will leave a lasting impression on those who can appreciate its sadness and beauty.","id":"5e7d5a796c74b95757cb41fa","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e7d5a796c74b95757cb41fa","movie_id":419704}

After only seeing it once, I feel that this will grow on me overtime and so far it has. A mixture of both \u20182001: A Space Odyssey\u2019 and Terrence Malick movies. While not as great as those two comparisons, but while watching I couldn\u2019t help to be reminded of those two.\r\n\r\nThere's some beautiful and impressive shots through out the movie, especially when the movie constantly shows you the entire scale of space and planets through the characters journey. The colors adds to environment that oozes with style and has a tranquil feel to it. I think that\u2019s where the Blade Runner vibes really come in. Brilliant cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema.\r\n\r\nBrad Pitt was terrific as the silent astronaut with tangled mood swings. It\u2019s not an explosive performance, just simple enough for it to be effective. Any other actor would\u2019ve gone big for no other reasons than being overly dramatic and it makes sense for his character to be closed off; similar to Ryan Gosling in \u2018First Man\u2019, where his emotional health comes last. You learn very little about his character, as most of his backstory is only in the background for you to piece together the puzzle.\r\n\r\nThe score was mystical and often eerie at times which helped ties in with the unknown aspects of space. The visual effects are excellent and nearly photo realistic at times - something you come to expect by now with space movies.\r\n\r\nI wasn\u2019t too sure about the narration at first, because it was very off putting and a cheap way for the character to express himself. However it sorta grew on me after awhile and some of it was almost rambling with Roy questioning every decision he made.\r\n\r\nNow for the issues:\r\n\r\nI have no idea why Liv Tyler was in this movie, because she literally does nothing and could have easily been cut out. It felt like a re shoot for some reason.\r\n\r\nRemember when I said the visual effects are photo realistic \u2018at times\u2019, but that isn\u2019t always the case with certain scenes. There\u2019s a deranged chimpanzee that pops up and it looks really phoney. I think that entire scene could been cut out. I\u2019ve brought up twice about cutting scenes, because I believe if this movie went back to the editing room one more time, then my score would be a lot higher.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a ridiculously and almost laughable scene where Roy (Brad Pitt) steaks into a spaceship that he\u2019s not suppose to be on, and all the astronauts on board go into a frenzy and accidentally start kill themselves while trying to cease Roy. No joke. Roy doesn't even do anything as he never intended to hurt them. It was cheap way of making Roy isolated for the rest of the movie. A few years ago I remember reading a horrifying incident that happened to astronaut Luca Parmitano where he reported water inside of his space suit helmet, and nearly become the first astronaut to drown in space. However, Luca remained calm throughout the whole incident despite the odds of him dying being high, but in the end he survived. So it\u2019s really strange seeing these trained astronauts freaking out because came on board.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: Out of the whole spectacle, I find the meaning of the movie the most striking. The themes of family, love and abandonment plays a major role in the story. The whole idea of \u201cworking hard and playing later\u201d comes with a cost, which is the less time we spend with our loved ones and abandoning everything to pursuit something better out there when in reality the best things in life are right here. When you discover nothing there\u2019s no turning back and no finding your way back. I\u2019ve been thinking about it for awhile now after seeing the movie.\r\n\r\nNever underestimate James Gray as a storyteller.","id":"5e2f26a0fd140b00196bf3b0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2f26a0fd140b00196bf3b0","movie_id":419704}

An esoteric science-fiction film in the tradition of Stanley Kubrick's _2001: A Space Odyssey_ (1968) and Andrei Tarkovsky's _Solyaris_ (1972), it attempted, amongst other things, to convey the sense of near-inconceivable vastness that must be attendant to any self-respecting pseudo-realist discussion of the universe, and to convey the psychological ramifications of what it must feel like to be lost in such a vastness. This is the lineage into which _Ad Astra_ wishes to step, but for me, it has more in common with Danny Boyle's excellent _Sunshine_ (2007) and Christoper Nolan's enjoyable but flawed _Interstellar_ (2014); irrespective of its themes and tropes, it remains fundamentally a mainstream Hollywood movie. And whilst such a status can certainly hold advantages for a filmmaker (primarily in terms of budget and casting), so too are there major pitfalls in having to toe the line of commerciality and cater to demands for crowd-pleasing material, demands which often don't jibe with esoteric content. In the case of _Sunshine_, this took the form of a relatively sudden genre shift into horror that Boyle doesn't fully pull off, and in the case of _Interstellar_, it's an unnecessary third-act twist that's (paradoxically) as predictable as it is nonsensical. And so we have _Ad Astra_, where it's in the form of an overly convenient resolution and some of the most ludicrous narrative diversions I've seen since the sojourn to Canto Bight in the Rian Johnson abomination that was _Star Wars: The Last Jedi_ (2017), diversions which seem to belong in a different film entirely, so tonally unrelated are they to the more existential material surrounding them (space pirates! enraged simians! knife-fight\/shoot-out!). Which is not to say, for one second, that I disliked the film \u2013 I didn't; even if the narrative never manages to get beyond the \"_Heart of Darkness_ in space\" template and the script relies far, far too heavily on a sub-Terrence Malick voiceover. The craft on display is exceptional and the story is thought-provoking and generally entertaining, with a terrific central performance, and some spectacular visuals (especially in the IMAX format). But it all could have been so much better.\r\n\r\nSet at an unspecified point in the near future (an opening legend informs us, rather generically, that it's \"_a time of hope and conflict_\"), space travel has become routine, with the moon not unlike any major city on Earth, although there are territorial disputes and marauding pirates are a constant threat. Mars too has been colonised, although it's not yet open to the public. As the film begins, we meet SpaceCom's Maj. Roy McBride (Brad Pitt), who is working on repairs to the International Space Antenna \u2013 a massive communications array that juts miles into the sky from the surface of the Earth. When a huge explosion causes him to fall from the antenna, he remains unnaturally calm as he plummets to Earth, and is able to land relatively unscathed. In a debriefing, he's told the explosion was just one result of a series of energy surges that originated near Neptune and which have left much of Earth and the moon without power. 29 years previously, Roy's father, H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), left Earth as the leader of the Lima Project, a mission aimed at establishing contact with whatever alien civilisations may be elsewhere in the galaxy. Needing to get far enough from the Sun's solar interference to send out adequate communications, the Lima team travelled to the same region near Neptune from which the surges are now emanating. However, 16 years into the mission, all contact was lost. SpaceCom presumed the crew dead, but now they fear that Clifford may be behind the surges, and with an antimatter power core at his disposal, if he has become unhinged, he could create a chain reaction that would eradicate all life in the galaxy (it's best not to dwell too much on the script's fundamental misrepresentation of how matter and antimatter interact). However, all attempts at communication have failed, and so Roy's highly classified mission is simple \u2013 travel to a secure long-range communications base on Mars and record a (prewritten) message for Clifford in the hopes he might respond. And, of course, it's no spoiler to say that the mission doesn't exactly go smoothly.\r\n\r\n_Ad Astra_, which is written by James Gray and Ethan Gross, and directed by Gray (_The Yards_; _We Own the Night_; _The Immigrant_; _The Lost City of Z_), wastes no time in tying us rigidly to Roy's perspective; it opens with a POV shot from inside his helmet, and the first words we hear are him speaking in voiceover. This sets up the narrative to come, as Roy remains the sole focaliser throughout \u2013 we see and hear what he sees and hears, we know what he knows, we learn things as he learns then, and we never experience anything with which he is not directly involved. Such rigid focalisation can lend itself to some very subtle moments. For example, as Roy thinks back to a time before his marriage broke up, there is a shot of him sitting on a bed in a darkened room. Barely visible behind him, lying down, is his then-wife Eve (a thankless and largely wordless performance by a blink-and-you-miss-her Liv Tyler). As the camera moves in on him, Eve fades out of the image \u2013 she disappears without him noticing, which sounds like it should be horribly on the nose, but because it's dark, because she was out of focus to begin with, and because by the time she disappears, Roy has come to occupy almost the entire frame, it makes the moment easy to miss, and rather poignant \u2013 he quite literally doesn't notice his wife phasing herself out of his life because of his obsession with his career (his focus on work is something he shares with Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) in Gray's masterpiece, the criminally overlooked _Lost City of Z_, although to be fair to Fawcett, Roy's single-mindedness at the expense of all else makes Fawcett look like husband-of-the-year material).\r\n\r\nThe fact that the film is set amongst the stars, but remains always tied to Roy's perception allows Gray to fashion a narrative that's both massive in scope yet emotionally intimate (in this sense, he one-ups Kubrick, whose _2001_ has all the grandeur and awe imaginable but is relatively detached from and uninterested in its characters' psychologies). Gray is aided immensely in this by cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema (_The Fighter_; _Her_; _Interstellar_; _Dunkirk_), arguably the finest currently active DoP not named Emmanuel Lubezki. Shot on 35mm film, van Hoytema's gorgeous photography effortlessly captures the overwhelming scale of the milieu, but also frequently shoots Pitt in tight close-ups that afford the actor little room to hide his emotions (which become more and more externalised as the film progresses).\r\n\r\nSpeaking of emotions, depending on your perspective, Pitt's portrayal of Roy is either one of the film's most laudable aspects or one of its most alienating. Initially played as emotionally closed off, if not necessarily shut down (he tells us in VO, \"_I've been trained to compartmentalise my emotions_\"), he's depicted as cold and distant. This stoicism, however, slowly starts to erode as his mission begins to go wrong, although there are a few early hints that all is not well - his fixation on the breakup of his marriage, for example, or his observation of the crew of the _Cepheus_ (which takes him from the moon to Mars), \"_they seem at ease with themselves. What must that be like?_\". His emotional state becomes more and more tempestuous as we move closer to the finale, until, rather suddenly (and rather unrealistically), he manages to steady himself in time for the _d\u00e9nouement_. Pitt's performance is such that one viewer might praise it for shunning emotional grandstanding even as another might criticise it as too taciturn. Personally, I'm very much in the former camp; I think it's a terrifically modulated and minimalist performance in which Pitt uses the lack of outward emotion to inform the character's emotional beats. For example, Roy doesn't have a huge amount of dialogue (aside from that accursed VO) and for long stretches, he doesn't even have anyone to act against, so Pitt has to rely to a large extent on subtlety and nuanced gesture to convey emotion, which he does exceptionally well. Having said that, however, I can certainly understand why some might find the performance too cold \u2013 Roy is definitely not your typical Hollywood protagonist, and the problem is that if you're not impressed by Pitt, I'd imagine it must be very difficult to get into the film at all as he's in literally every scene.\r\n\r\nThematically, on the most basic of levels, _Ad Astra_ is the story of two men obsessed with their profession to the detriment of all else - a theme brought to perfection in the work of Michael Mann. Such a theme is not unusual in Gray's films, receiving its most thorough exploration in Percy Fawcett and Henry Costin (Robert Pattinson) in _The Lost City of Z_. Additionally, like most of Gray's films, _Ad Astra_ is heavily androcentric, with neither Liv Tyler nor Ruth Negga (as the administer of the SpaceCom base on Mars) given much to do. In this sense, it's a study of masculinity, much as were its most obvious narrative influences \u2013 Joseph Conrad's _Heart of Darkness_ (1899) and Francis Ford Coppola's Conrad-adaptation, _Apocalypse Now_ (1979). In the reformulation of the narrative template, Roy is Charles Marlow (Cpt. Benjamin L. Willard in the film), whilst Clifford is Kurtz. In the original, Marlow, a merchant seaman, must locate revered ivory trader Kurtz, who has established himself as a demigod at a trading post on the Congo River. In the film, set at the tail-end of the Vietnam War, US Army captain Willard (Martin Sheen) must travel from South Vietnam into Cambodia to track down Col. Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a once-legendary but now renegade Army Special Forces officer who, in all probability, has gone insane. The narrative parallels are obvious enough \u2013 a conflicted man sent to find a brilliant and pioneering man who has gone off-grid and who must be stopped, with the journey proving to be as much about travelling into the self as reaching a specific geographical destination. All three narratives also feature a roughly similar relationship between the two characters whereby the man searching deeply admires the man for whom he is searching.\r\n\r\nOf course, _Ad Astra_ is also an esoteric science fiction film that looks at issues such as humanity's place in the galaxy and the search for intelligent life. An especially interesting theme that comes up when Roy is on the moon is commercialism and humanity's tendency to taint anything we touch. The commercialism of space travel is introduced when Roy takes a Virgin America shuttle to the moon, whilst an exterior wide shot of a lunar tourist base shows signs for, amongst others, Applebee's, DHL, and Subway. And since the moon is now so like Earth, thus it has become blighted by many of the same issues as Earth; crime, political division, materialism - the grandeur of space travel infected with the mundanities of Earth. This point is driven home by the references to territorial disputes and the problem of marauders, which is significant enough for Roy to need a military escort from the base to the _Cepheus_. And if all this wasn't enough to get the point across, in VO, we hear Roy lament how sickened Clifford would be with what the moon has become, pointing out it's now simply a \"_re-creation of what we're running from on Earth. We're world eaters_\". All of which helps create the impression of a future that's reasonably familiar and relatively plausible, given current technologies. Indeed, the lived-in nature of the film's environment is superbly realised by production designer Kevin Thompson (_Birth_; _The Adjustment Bureau_; _Okja_), whose discoloured sets and gritty textures are as far from the more glossy end of science fiction as you could imagine.\r\n\r\nHowever, for all these positives, some significant problems detract from the whole. For me, there were three main flaws; 1) a poorly written and hugely distracting voiceover upon which Gray relies far too heavily, 2) three ludicrous action scenes that accomplish nothing and which feel like they're from another movie entirely, and 3) an anti-climactic and overly neat d\u00e9nouement.\r\n\r\nTo look first at those three scenes, although they all occur in the first half of the film (with two in the first act), to describe them in any detail would constitute a spoiler, so I'll just give a very basic overview \u2013 the first is a chase scene involving moon buggies, the second is something more suited to Paul W.S. Anderson's hugely underrated _Event Horizon_ (1997), and the third is a shoot-out\/knife fight, which is the most narratively justified of the three, but still a ridiculously over-the-top scene for a film of this nature. Imagine if in _2001_, instead of attempting to outwit HAL 9000, Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) had pulled out a shotgun and engaged in a running battle with androids controlled by the AI. Ridiculous? Of course. The three scenes in _Ad Astra_ are only slightly less so. The third at least does have a narrative point insofar as it serves as the springboard for the entire second half of the movie, but it's still a monumentally silly way for Gray and Gross to advance the plot when there were far more organic ways to do so. The first two scenes, however, serve no such purpose \u2013 remove them from the film, and you'd have to change virtually nothing in the surrounding material - they're that disconnected and irrelevant, right out of the Rian Johnson school of narrative construction. They lead nowhere, reveal nothing about the character or his psychology, and have no connection to the esoteric themes found elsewhere. You know the French plantation scene in _Apocalypse Now Redux_? They make that scene look pivotal. I really can't over-emphasise how much they pulled me out of the film and detracted from the excellent work elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAs for the other two issues (the VO and the ending), obviously, I can't say much of anything about the finale without spoilers, so all I'll say is that I'm led to believe the ending as it exists now was a reshoot after test audiences responded poorly to the original (and far superior) ending \u2013 look it up online; the originally scripted ending made a lot more sense and was as thematically fascinating as it was existentially audacious (sheesh, test audiences, am I right?). \r\n\r\nIn terms of the VO, good lord, it's bad. I can count on one hand the number of times VO has been done well in film \u2013 there's the hard-boiled noir films of the 40s and 50s, the Michael Herr-written narration of _Apocalypse Now_, the work of Terrence Malick, Andrew Dominick's _The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford_ (2007), and...well, that's about it really. The VO is obviously intended to function in much the same way as Willard's in _Apocalypse Now_, providing some factual info, but also probing the soul of the character. However, the problem is that most of the time, the voice is describing something we can see plain as day on the screen. Pitt's performance is strong enough that the VO is unnecessary. You know the way the best films show rather than tell and the worst tell rather than show? _Ad Astra_ does both, and it's hugely distracting \u2013 you think \"_I don't know why he saved my life_\" ruins the end of the original version of Ridley Scott's _Blade Runner_ (1982)? I lost count of the number of times Roy's derivative interior monologue undermined the power of the moment. By the half-way stage of the film, I was sick of his cod-philosophical ramblings that aspire to portentousness, but end up coming across as someone trying and failing to imitate Malick.\r\n\r\nWith all that said, however, it's a testament to the story the film tells that despite these significant hurdles, I still enjoyed it. Pitt's performance is excellent, and Gray, who has yet to make a bad film, is his accomplished self. The storyline is interesting, and what it says about man's place in the universe, particularly whether or not we're alone, is unexpected and fascinating. The original ending was infinitely superior, the VO is a huge misstep, and the action detours are ludicrous, but this is still an entertaining movie. It's not a patch on _Lost City of Z_, but the manner in which Gray juxtaposes an intimate tone with such massive themes is really impressive. In essence, _Ad Astra_ is a fable about the importance of transient human connection, played out against the backdrop of the infinite, and despite some not insignificant problems, it's well worth checking out.","id":"5d9e02057f05400037ab4d04","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d9e02057f05400037ab4d04","movie_id":419704}
{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nI love sci-fi space movies, especially when these depict the cosmos in such a visually stunning manner as Ad Astra does. It\u2019s one of those films where the visuals elevate whatever narrative is being told. If you don\u2019t get goosebumps or get excited with the opening sequence of this movie, then it might not be the film you\u2019re looking for. From the quiet but powerful sound design to the impressive cinematography, James Gray delivers a visually captivating story with an outstanding protagonist. Brad Pitt is definitely getting tons of nominations this awards season (let\u2019s not forget his amazing role in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood).\r\n\r\nHis subtle yet incredibly emotional performance shows an astonishing range. He carries the whole screenplay in his shoulders, and I don\u2019t mind that at all. There\u2019s a lot of narration, and here\u2019s where I transition to the most divisive aspect of the movie: it\u2019s a slow-burn. Now, there\u2019s no problem with a film being deliberately slow. In fact, some of my favorite movies of all-time aren\u2019t fast-paced. They cherish their story and make the audience feel interested in what they\u2019re experiencing. Ad Astra isn\u2019t an action flick or a comedy, it\u2019s a character-driven drama, so most of the runtime is devoted to developing Roy.\r\n\r\nThat said, don\u2019t go in with expectations of feeling entertained all the time. Some moments aren\u2019t supposed to excite you or leave you jaw-dropped. Some sequences are just meant to make you feel immersed by the environment, be lost in space (IMAX is the mandatory way of watching this feature). Don\u2019t expect the film to make an 80-day trip to some planet end in two cuts and 20 seconds. Gray purposefully establishes a slow pace. Obviously, general audiences don\u2019t usually enjoy this type of flicks, but if you\u2019re able to manage your expectations realistically, you\u2019re one step closer to not feel bored throughout the runtime.\r\n\r\nThe first act is the one that captures everyone\u2019s attention. It doesn\u2019t waste time on Earth, it goes through what\u2019s happening pretty quickly, and it possesses 90% of the heavy action (including one of the best opening sequences of the year). Sound has a significant impact on how Gray films his sequences, and it\u2019s unbelievable how well-shot the chasing scenes on the Moon are. Scientifically speaking, this is no Interstellar where you simply have to accept some mind-blowing yet unjustified stuff. Ad Astra doesn\u2019t have a single scene where one might think \u201cthis completely takes me out of the movie, I can\u2019t accept that this is possible in some fictional future\u201d. This is a huge compliment to a space film containing several launches, lunar bases, and (very) long space journeys.\r\n\r\nHowever, the remaining two acts focus intensely on Pitt\u2019s character, slowing down the main plot. Like I wrote above, there\u2019s a lot of development through Roy\u2019s thoughts. Extensive narration is almost always an issue, even when the narrator is Brad Pitt. Some monologues do indeed develop the character or explain what he\u2019s feeling, but some tend to fall into the philosophical side that doesn\u2019t always carry a meaningful or interesting message. Using everyday language, sometimes it\u2019s a bit boring\u2026 Additionally, the ending might be a letdown for a lot of people. Tommy Lee Jones (H. Clifford McBride) doesn\u2019t have a lot of screentime, and I can\u2019t really delve into details about his storyline, but his character\u2019s relationship with Roy doesn\u2019t exactly serve as a fantastic payoff.\r\n\r\nMax Richter\u2019s score is one of 2019\u2019s best, and I hope it gets recognized by every award show. It definitely helps the experience to be more enthralling. The lack of sound in space is also powerful in its own way. Beautifully-edited, but with a continuously slow pace that doesn\u2019t change from the moment the second act begins. However, the story of Ad Astra is vastly superior to, for example, Gray\u2019s The Lost City of Z, which I genuinely disliked. This space adventure is visually more exciting, its story is more engaging, and its protagonist is more compelling than everything else in Gray\u2019s previous installment. Finally, it\u2019s one of those movies that watching at a film theater (mainly IMAX) or at home, makes a massive difference. You\u2019ll never feel as entertained or captivated at home, so make sure to check this one at the best possible screen near you.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Ad Astra is yet another display case for Brad Pitt\u2019s chances at winning an Oscar. With a subtle yet powerful performance, Pitt carries the whole story to safe harbor with tremendous help from the eyegasmic visuals. Technically, it\u2019s one of 2019\u2019s closest movies to being perfect. Very well-shot, well-edited, with an immersive score, and gorgeous cinematography. However, it\u2019s a slow-burn that doesn\u2019t always work as such. Narration is the go-to method to develop Pitt\u2019s character, and while it works most of the time, it slows down the main plot, becoming a tad boring during a few moments. The ending isn\u2019t the impactful payoff that the film needed, and the incredible supporting cast is under-utilized.

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"Ad Astra galactically depicts sorrow, proving that no one can hear you cry in space. For the past few years, dramas set in the expansive dangers of space have been my bread and butter. Devouring them during my annual breakfast as I purposefully starve myself for the taste of space traversal. Every year, the likes 'Arrival', 'Blade Runner 2049', 'First Man', 'Interstellar' and my all-time favourite film 'Gravity', have secured scores ranging from outstanding to perfect. Whilst Ad Astra may be tilting towards the former adjective, it's still irrefutably one of the best films of the year thanks to Gray's understanding, yet again, of what makes a character study captivating. After unearthing the possibility that his missing father may still be alive, his astronaut son travels across the Solar System in search for him and to unravel a mysterious power surge phenomenon that threatens humanity's survival.\r\n\r\nImmediately, one thing I need to brush off my chest is the horrendous marketing. This is not a sci-fi blockbuster. There is limited \"action\". And if you're wanting the next 'Star Wars' or 'Avatar', then remove yourself from the cinema and watch mind-numbing nonsense like 'Angel Has Fallen' instead. This is a James Gray extravaganza. A meticulously woven character study, harnessing melancholia to challenge an existential crisis. Thematically, Ad Astra's premise bolsters a plethora of metaphorical imagery that divulges into the empirical purpose of humanity. Majestic planets emitting every prismatic shade available, yet emanating no emotional connectivity. The vacuous expansivity of space, marking humanity's reflection on life as a mere speck of stardust. Worldly hostility reaching the depths of our galaxy, hyperbolising the \"world-eating\" philosophy of our own self-destruction as a species. The obsession to venture forth. Departing love, hate and grief. Welcoming nothingness.\r\n\r\nGray's space-opera is a sorrowful tale, intently focusing on the pressures of a son following in the footsteps of his acclaimed father. A patriarch of inspiration to many. Allowing a tangible tense bond to illuminate the stars with despair and anguish. Pitt's universally nuanced performance brings forward stoic mannerisms that allow McBride to feel these emotions. Minor glitches that break character, such as slamming the wall in frustration, showcase the purity of humanity within him.\r\n\r\nGray encompasses the plot around McBride. The lunar pirate raid, mayday rescue and crew brawl scenes, whilst inserting mainstream tendencies into a contemporary drama, were emblems of McBride's emotions. Fear, rage and desperation respectively. A series of gestures that, again, hark back to humanity's endurance. The mildly engaging supporting cast, ranging from Jones, Sutherland and Negga, acting as stability for McBride. Stepping stones allowing him to find his father, as if fate was dictating his alignment. Narration, shifting between inner thoughts to exposition, was overused and irked me with its basic functionality. Hoytema's cinematography could've elicited these unnecessary lines of dialogue from his beautiful imagery. And beautiful just doesn't do it justice.\r\n\r\nImmediately, from the iridescent opening shot, Hoytema takes hold. Utilising colours and shadows to produce the incarnation of life, what it means to see. The blue of Neptune, the red of Mars. Clashing tonalities resembling McBride's emotions. Accompanied by Richter's euphoric score and the almost '2001' production design, and Ad Astra is technically a masterful piece of art. Gray's conclusion is teetering on the edge of underwhelming, for me atleast, with its rushed journey home that dissipated the simmering sorrow built exquisitely beforehand. The ending I personally would've desired, would be the ending no one wanted (but that's life I guess...).\r\n\r\nRegardless, the small criticisms here and there are subject to change upon an inevitable rewatch. Gray is fast becoming one of my favourite directors. He is a man who understands character. He acknowledges the obsession of man. Amalgamating life's wondrously challenging hurdles into singular expressive characters. Ad Astra's meditative and resonant pacing, whilst is sure to put many viewers off, ensures that loss and grief are captured wherever a soul may be. At home or in deep space. It never vanishes.","id":"5e206465b3316b0013032124","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e206465b3316b0013032124","movie_id":419704}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"I like quiet moments in big action\/sci-fi type movies. The family sitdown at Avengers Tower in _Age of Ultron_ is probably the best part of that movie. The contemplative moments of John Wick are what make that character who he is. What is a little more odd, however, is when a quiet, reflective drama, is broken up by moments of big action\/sci-fi type sequences. _Ad Astra_ is certainly the latter. The majority of _Ad Astra's_ runtime is taken up by Brad Pitt narrating environmental cosmic shots, or having quiet conversations about his father, or his mood. Then suddenly! Space pirates! It's unusual, and I don't know that it really works. _Ad Astra_ is something different, and if that's all you're looking for, by all means, give it a chance, but I don't know if I'd personally call it very good. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._","id":"5e083f7aeda4b700142e147f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e083f7aeda4b700142e147f","movie_id":419704}
{"author":"deRedtube","content":"In the opening scene of Adithya Varma, we see an old woman (Leela Samson) talking about the obsessive nature of her grandson with pride to her friends. This scene gives an inkling into why Adithya Varma (Dhruv Vikram) is the man he is. His grandmother is just one among the people in his inner circle who have enabled his abusive behavior since childhood and turned him into the angry, rebellious, possessive and abusive young man who cannot take rejections.\r\n\r\nIn his introduction scene, we see Adithya getting frisky with a young woman. But before they can have sex, the woman's fiance knocks on the door. While the woman, who had been a willful participant until then, stops him, in a momentary fit, the enraged Adithya threatens her to undress at knife point. Director Gireesaaya stages this scene in such a way that the power that has gone off in the house acts as a visual metaphor. It's almost as if the switch inside Adithya's head has gone off, bringing the darkness inside him to the surface. But then, the power comes back, and Adithya comes back to his senses. What follows next establishes his mental state. He desperately wants to get physical with a woman, but when he realizes that might not be possible, he cools himself off by putting ice in his groin.\r\n\r\nAdithya Varma is the remake of the Telugu film Arjun Reddy (which was recently remade in Hindi as well - Kabir Singh) and this opening stretch - which glorifies the acts of the protagonist and tries to project them as bad-ass and cool (\"unconventional mindset\" and \"free-spirited\" are some of the terms that characters in the film use to describe him) - makes you realize that the criticism that the films have invited are valid. But thankfully, this Tamil version also sets right some of the problematic aspects of the original.\r\n\r\nThe narrative switches between these episodes of Adithya's self-destructive behavior and the past, where, he, as a house surgeon, falls in love at first sight when he sees Meera (Banita Sandhu), a demure fresher who has joined his college in Bangalore. But unlike in Arjun Reddy, here, Meera's intentions are clear to us right from the start. While Adithya came across as someone imposing himself on a hapless girl in the original, here, we see that Meera is as interested in him as he is in her. Unlike Shalini Pandey, whose sad eyes made the character's acquiescence ambiguous, Banita plays Meera with a smile, clearly conveying that the character is interested in this relationship as much as Adithya. There is real chemistry between her and Dhruv, and the two young actors make us buy into the madness in their characters and in this strange romance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Adithya's life keeps spiraling out of control in the present as he obsesses over the failure of his romance, which has led to Meera being forcefully married to another man by her caste-conscious father. Even as he immerses himself into alcohol and drugs, his family (his elder brother) and friends (his college friend) rally around him and try to bring him back to normalcy, but will there be light at the end of this personal suffering?\r\n\r\nGiven its troubled production, there were doubts if the film might be any good, but Gireesaaya delivers a well-made, if overly faithful, remake with Adithya Varma. The film is as intense as the original, with a lead performance that suggests that we might be witnessing the birth of a star. Dhruv Vikram comes up with a performance that apes Vijay Deverakonda's intense and raw act in the original note for note, but there is an absurdness and honesty here that makes us appreciate it rather than dismiss it just as mimicry.","id":"5dd81d4c3faba00019f97bce","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dd81d4c3faba00019f97bce","movie_id":585561}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_A bleak allegorical study of war as seen through the eyes of children_**\r\n\r\n>_The idea comes from, in many ways, the country where I'm from, Colombia, a country that's experienced 60 years of civil war. And it's been going on for so long, and there are so many different factions and sides, and there's peace agreements and they break, so, in a way, it wasn't something you could go at with clear ideological premises, but instead something that had a kind of ghostly feel. That's what inspired the story, to try to break any binary notion of future\/past, man\/woman, paradise\/hell, and try to get_ _at something that you feel through the stomach or through the skin. I think that's what cinema has; it appeals to your conscious, like a story does, but also your subconscious, kind of like dreams do. So the idea was to do this politically sensitive allegory, but like a dream._\r\n\r\n- Alejandro Landes; \"Alejandro Landes, Julianne Nicholson & Moises Arias On The Film Monos\"; _BUILD Series_ (September 13, 2019)\r\n\r\nJoseph Conrad's _Heart of Darkness_ (1899) and William Golding's _Lord of the Flies_ (1954) by way of the mad folly of Werner Herzog's _Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes_ (1972) and Francis Ford Coppola's _Apocalypse Now_ (1979) and the children-are-screwed nihilism of H\u00e9ctor Babenco's _Pixote: a Lei do Mais Fraco_ (1981) and Jean-St\u00e9phane Sauvaire's _Johnny Mad Dog_ (2011), garnished with the soul-shattering futility-of-war mentality of Elem Klimov's _Idi i smotri_ (1985), all wrapped up in a pseudo-fairy tale\/fantasy aesthetic. Turns out an insane hodgepodge like that results in a completely unique film, quite unlike anything you're ever likely to have seen. Written by Alejandro Landes and Alexis dos Santos, and directed by Landes, Monos (from the Ancient Greek \"_\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2_\" (\"_m\u00f3nos_\"), meaning \"alone\") is an uncategorisable film that moves from a mountain top which is literally above the cloud-line to a stifling jungle to a raging river to the edge of a city in the midst of war, whilst thematically travelling all the way from a tight-knit group of soldiers who would die for one another to a last-man standing mentality bordering on insanity. Visually stunning, the plot is a little lacking, and sometimes the allegorical basis is a tad imprecise, but this is hugely ambitious and audacious filmmaking from a director we're going to be hearing a lot about in the coming years.\r\n\r\nIn an unidentified country (the characters are speaking Spanish, meaning we're somewhere in Latin America, with the filming done in Colombia) at an unidentified point in time, a war is raging between unidentified combatants for never-specified reasons. On a mountaintop, we're introduced to the MONOS unit, a small group of child soldiers known only by their _noms de guerre_ \u2013 Wolf (Julian Giraldo), Rambo (Sofia Buenaventura), Bigfoot (Mois\u00e9s Arias), Swede (Laura Castrill\u00f3n), Smurf (Deiby Rueda), Dog (Paul Cubides), Boom-Boom (Sneider Castro), and Lady (Karen Quintero). Apart from being drilled by \"Messenger\" (former real-life Colombian guerrilla fighter Wilson Salazar), a superior officer in what is referred to only as \"The Organisation\", the children have two tasks \u2013 to look after a conscripted milk-cow named Shakira and to guard an American prisoner being held for ransom, referred to as Doctora (Julianne Nicholson). By day, they take their duties very seriously, but by night, they act more like the teenagers they are; drinking, eating mushrooms, having sex, goofing around. A tight-knit group, morale is high. That is until an accident has a series of knock-on effects that ultimately sees them abandon their mountain base, heading into the unforgiving jungle far below. Cut off from their chain of command, their discipline starts to break down and soon, they have come into violent conflict with one another.\r\n\r\nThe film is very loosely inspired by the Colombian Conflict, a low-intensity, multi-sided civil war that began in 1964 and is still going on today. The majority of fighting has been between the government, paramilitary groups, narcos, foreign actors, and guerrilla organisations, the best known of which is _Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia_ (FARC). In particular, Landes and dos Santos based the events of the film on the 2016 peace agreement signed by Juan Manuel Santos's government and FARC, which called for FARC members to surrender their weaponry to UN forces, at which point they would be reintegrated into Colombian society. FARC officially ceased to exist as a military group in 2017, instead reconstituting as a political party, _Fuerza Alternativa Revolucionaria del Com\u00fan_. However, around 1,600 FARC dissidents refused to lay down arms, forming independent splinter groups to continue fighting the war. According to Landes,\r\n\r\n>_the fragile possibility of peace is in the air, and it's been a long time coming._ Monos _explores this moment through the prism of the war movie. Though this is my generation's first chance, this is not Colombia's first peace process and so it feels plagued by ghosts. These ghosts inspired me to shape the film like a fever dream._\r\n\r\nOne of the most important aspects of the film is the lack of political, historical, societal, and militaristic specificity \u2013 it could be an allegory for almost any conflict at any point in time, with Landes explaining,\r\n\r\n>_the idea, from the story to the production design, was to create an atemporal world, out of place, out of time, far away from everything \u2013 with this group of kids who is being trained and watched over by some unknown force. They're on a mission, part of a clandestine army. They're a squad of soldiers in the 'back' lines of a war \u2013 but also just a tight-knit pack of teenagers. Though the specifics of the Colombian civil war are the source of inspiration, the idea was always for the experience of the film to cross borders and exist as a world in and of its own._\r\n\r\nIn this sense, it has both a fairy-tale sensibility and a mythological underpinning, with the violence and brutality offset by a poetic tone that speaks to timelessness. Rather than attempting to elicit pathos by evoking the horrors of a particular conflict, Landes treats the story as a universal allegory, facilitated by the lack of concrete contextualisation.\r\nOn top of this, the film examines the chaos and absurdity of war through the lens of adolescence; although the members of MONOS can be violent, so too are they teenagers, a duality that informs the entire film. The opening scene, for example, depicts the group playing football, but wearing blindfolds, thus encapsulating both the seriousness with which they regard their training, but also acknowledging that play is still an important part of their lives. Indeed, the film could even be interpreted as an (admittedly extreme) allegory for adolescence itself (as opposed to adolescence being an allegory for something else) \u2013 a group of teenagers unsure who they are, experimenting with drugs, alcohol, and sexuality, not entirely thrilled about being told what to do by adults, and convinced that they can do a better job of running things.\r\n\r\nMonos's most salient aesthetic characteristic is its dream-like quality, walking a very fine line between the gritty realism of a war drama and the hallucinatory feel of a fever-dream (in this, it very much recalls _Apocalypse Now_). This sense of existing just slightly outside reality is aided in no small part by the discordant and dislocating score by Mica Levi (_Under the Skin_; _Jackie_; _Marjorie Prime_), which is built around whistling and timpani percussion. Also important here is the lush and saturated photography by Jasper Wolf. On the mountain, Wolf often shoots scenes with the characters dwarfed in a small corner of the frame, filling almost the entire screen with vegetation and sky. Such compositions suggest life lived at the edge of the world, existing outside society, existing outside even time. However, once we relocate to the jungle, Wolf goes in the opposite direction, shooting in tight close-ups, frequently handheld, suggesting both claustrophobia and the loss of the near-omniscient control seen earlier in the film.\r\n\r\nIf I were to criticise anything, it would be the plot, which is very slight, even by allegory standards. Indeed, regarding that allegory, although I certainly admire Landes's steadfast resistance to specificity, sometimes he's almost _too_ successful in rendering the non-specific and universal, leaving you wondering what exactly he is trying to allegorise (even the title can't be locked into a single meaning \u2013 apart from the Greek word for \"alone\" and the name of the unit itself, it's also the Spanish term for \"monkey\"). And although the theme of child soldiers is a weighty enough issue on its own, it's something with which Landes seems uninterested for its own sake. This can lead to a lack of emotion, which is almost certainly by design, but it makes it difficult to feel empathy for any of the characters, even Doctora.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this is hugely ambitious cinema with a lot on its mind. Straddling the line between the surreal and the barbaric, realism and fantasy, the seriousness of the adult world and the innocence of childhood, it's a singularly unique viewing experience, as beautiful, lyrical, and abstract in some places as it is ugly, crude, and realistic in others. Both a dire prediction for where an increasingly divided world may be heading and a foundation myth, _Monos_ speaks as much to our future as it does to the legends underpinning our present.","id":"5dd1f7072866fa00158ae5a8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dd1f7072866fa00158ae5a8","movie_id":417466}

The story is interesting and the parallels to America in the present day are welcomed, but there isn't enough tonal balance to contrast all the shadowy moodiness. The plot is on the more convoluted side, and you'd imagine that with it being a story about following a trail of clues, 'Motherless Brooklyn' would reward repeat viewings - but I'm not sure I would optionally sit through all of it again. There is nothing inherently wrong with this film, bar some odd edits and framing choices, and Norton tackles the material fairly well, creating a great tribute to the noir era of filmmaking. It sometimes treads the line of parody rather than homage, but for anyone in the mood for crime mystery in the vein of 'Chinatown' or 'L.A.

{"author":"JonGon92","content":"On June 10th, 2014 the terrorist organization ISIS seized control of the Iraqi city of Mosul. For two years they controlled it with an iron fist until it was retaken by the combined forces of the Iraqi government and people. With so much fighting, suffering, death and destruction how does one tell the story of Mosul and those who fought it? Writer and Director Dan Gabriel found a way by following journalist Ali Maula and his crew as the interview influential figures and follow them into battle in his documentary Mosul.    The film begins nice and slow, establishing Ali Maula and how Mosul had come under the control of ISIS. It doesn\u2019t take long for the film to grab your attention as it goes into visceral detail about how the innocent civilians suffered under ISIS. The stories the people tell are detailed and paint a terrible picture of the Hell they are forced to live in and the hate towards ISIS and hope they feel when the military comes through. However, Ali Maula takes an interesting angle in questioning whether or not many of the civilians re telling the truth. It is a sad thing to think but does show how much distrust and discord ISIS has sown into the country. The use of actual footage of the cruelty and violence make for a shocking and utterly disturbing watch. Gabriel doesn\u2019t pull any punches and though that does make the film hard to watch, it is not for the faint of heart, he does manage to make his point more poignant and memorable. The figures are offer a great insight into the events that surround the battle of Mosul. The most interesting of these figures are Um Hanadi and Captain Alaa. I found these two to be incredibly interesting and the stories of their who they were before the fighting and how they came to be the people they are. Hanadi is introduced early on and her stories are some of the strongest in the movie, how she took care of the soldiers under her command the people she saved as well as the harrowing missions she had to fight through and all she lost along the way. Captain Alaa\u2019s moments are by far the most harrowing as the crew follows him and his soldiers through actual battle. The footage of the war is truly incredible as the crew gets close to the chaos. The footage is energetic and exciting but nonetheless terrifying as the crew is in the thick of battle and destruction. Brave is an understatement for the crew had to go through to get their footage. With the stories, figures and the stories from civilians we are given a clear picture of the background and build up to the battle of Mosul. The runtime is short clocking in well under ninety minutes however this works in the film\u2019s favor. Not only does it still manage to perfectly fit in every story and bit of information, but the quick pace gives the film a sense of urgency and energy which makes the viewing direr and memorable.    Final Thoughts: It can be very difficult to watch, and it tends to be grim and macabre, but Mosul is a truly great documentary. The figures and civilians offer compelling and often disturbing stories and the crew manages to capture excellent shots of the war, the fact that they survived it is nothing short of a miracle. Mosul is a must watch and required viewing for all to understand what is happening in the world.

It's about how the city of today was built on the cruelty, prejudice, lies, and unchecked power of yesterday.\r\n\r\nLethem's novel is a fascinating and quintessentially postmodern narrative, fracturing the relationship between the physical and the temporal by taking the sensibilities of 1950s gumshoe noir and supplanting them into an end-of-century _milieu_. On the other hand, the 1957-set film is more literal, less interested in playing with form. Written for the screen, produced, directed by, and starring Edward Norton, this two-decades-in-the-making passion project asks how much corruption are we willing to forgive and whether truth and ideals even matter in a world in which there's a direct confluence between power and amorality. However, far too in reverence to films such as Roman Pola\u0144ski's _Chinatown_ (1974) and Curtis Hanson's _L.A. Confidential_ (1997), _Motherless Brooklyn_ is your average noir mystery \u2013 a likable but flawed protagonist begins what seems like a fairly straightforward investigation, only to be led down a rabbit hole of corruption and power games, until he's in the midst of an elaborate political conspiracy. And whilst it's aesthetically impressive (the period detail drips off the screen) and the acting is universally excellent, the film can be spectacularly on the nose and didactic. It also moves at a snail's pace, and Norton is never really able to generate any sense of urgency, making the whole thing feel laborious, and, ultimately, rather pointless.\r\n\r\nNew York City, 1957. World War II veteran Frank Minna (Bruce Willis) runs a small PI firm, employing Tony Vermonte (Bobby Cannavale), Danny Fantyl (Dallas Roberts), Gilbert Coney (Ethan Suplee), and Lionel Essrog (Norton), all of whom Minna rescued from an abusive orphanage when they were still children. He's most fond of Essrog, who suffers from what we know today as Tourette Syndrome \u2013 uncontrollable tics and the tendency to blurt out random words and phrases, which becomes worse when he's nervous. However, he also has a photographic memory. As the film begins, Essrog and Coney are listening in on a clandestine meeting between Minna and unidentified parties. When the meeting becomes contentious, tragedy strikes, and although none of Minna's staff know who he was meeting or what he was investigating, Essrog determines to get to the bottom of the case, slowly unearthing a labyrinthine conspiracy involving local government, urban redevelopment plans, and housing relocation programs. Along the way, he encounters Laura Rose (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), an activist campaigning against gentrification; Moses Randolph (Alec Baldwin), a powerful real estate developer who plans to expand New York's road network and build multiple new bridges despite the fact that to do so, he'll have to demolish several lower-income neighbourhoods; Paul (Willem Dafoe), an engineer who has a history with Randolph; Gabby Horowitz (Cherry Jones), the leader of the activist group of which Laura is a member; a brilliant but mysterious jazz musician (Michael K. Williams); Julia Minna (Leslie Mann), Frank's wife; William Lieberman (Josh Pais), Randolph's right-hand man; Lou (Fisher Stevens), one of Randolph's thugs; and Billy Rose (Robert Wisdom), Laura's father and the owner of a jazz club at the centre of the mystery.\r\n\r\nAnyone familiar with the novel will immediately recognise that Norton has made sweeping changes, not just in terms of relocating the story to 1957 (thus making explicit what was so indelibly postmodern in the book), but so too in terms of plot and character. The most significant addition is Moses Randolph, who's clearly based on New York's so-called \"master builder\" Robert Moses, the man largely responsible for the city's high-way infrastructure, the departure of the Brooklyn Dodgers to LA, the development of Long Island, whose controversial philosophies regarding urban redevelopment continue to be implemented all over the world, and who once held 12 civil service titles (including President of the Long Island State Park Commission, Chairman of the New York State Council of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, Secretary of State of New York, Commissioner of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, and Commissioner of the New York City Department of City Planning) despite never being elected to public office. Operating with almost complete autonomy from regulatory oversight, Moses was a narcissist obsessed with power, and an amoral racist, and so too is the character in the film. Indeed, although the film is ostensibly based on Lethem's novel, it contains more than a hint of Robert Caro's magisterial Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Moses, _The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York_ (1974).\r\n\r\n_Motherless Brooklyn_'s most obvious strength is its aesthetic, about which I really can't say enough. The production design by Beth Mickle (_Drive_; _Only God Forgives_; _Lost River_), the art direction by Michael Ahern (_Stake Land_; _Arbitrage_; _The Drop_), and the costume design by Amy Roth (_Top Five_; _Two Night Stand_; _Indignation_) are all exceptional, contributing to the nuanced and immersive period-specific tone, with the milieu feeling lived-in and completely authentic.\r\n\r\nNorton's direction is, for the most part, straightforward and unfussy, but one visual motif he uses several times is shooting directly from Essrog's POV. First-person shots in cinema are infrequent enough that when a director uses the technique a few times, it stands out. What's most interesting here is when Norton uses it \u2013 three scenes in which Essrog is lying on his back either currently being beaten up, or having recently been beaten up. It's a nice (if somewhat unsubtle) directorial choice, drawing us directly into Essrog's experience, but only when he's at his most vulnerable. On the other hand, the tonally inconsistent use of dream scenes is far less effective, feeling as if they're from another film entirely.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the decision to set the film in the 50s, it actually makes sense. One of the reasons the novel works so well is because the modern setting clashes with the mannerisms of the characters, the style of the dialogue, the cadences of the plot, all of which are straight out of classic 40s and 50s noir. The effect of this is quintessentially postmodern \u2013 a self-reflexive pastiche that's drawn from both the 50s and the 90s, and yet which belongs to neither. And although this works tremendously on the page, Norton argued (correctly, I think) that to try to replicate this on film \u2013 have the story set in 2019 (or even 1999), but told in the manner of a classic noir \u2013 wouldn't work, as it would send mixed and confusing messages to the audience.\r\n\r\nAnd so, he simply relocated the story to the time-period which underpins the style of the novel. With this in mind, the film features many of the trappings of classic noir \u2013 the world-weary private eye, the laconic voiceover speaking directly to the audience from an unspecified point in time, the seemingly important clues which ultimately lead nowhere, the seemingly irrelevant clues which ultimately lead somewhere, the smooth (so smooth) jazz score, the smoky (so smoky) jazz clubs, the chiaroscuro lighting (albeit very restrained), the antagonist who seems to see all, the political corruption. There's even a scene in which Essrog finds an address written on a pack of matches. About the only thing missing is a femme fatale, although there is a woman who may (or may not) know more than she's letting on.\r\n\r\nFor all its thematic importance and laudable aesthetic aspects, however, I found _Motherless Brooklyn_ disappointing. For one thing, there's the pacing, which is so lacking in forward-momentum that the story is practically somnolent. The narrative is unfocused and flabby, needing at least one more editorial pass, occasionally doubling back on itself and wasting time giving the audience information we already possess. Partly because of this, it's a good 20 minutes too long (at least), and much of it feels like padding \u2013 characters that do nothing, clues that lead nowhere, scenes which don't advance the story or develop the characters. I understand Norton wanted to let the material breath (the novel is around 300 pages), but there's a difference between giving the characters and themes room to develop and stalling for the sake of it, and so much of the film feels like the latter.\r\n\r\nThere's also a significant disconnect between the politics and the detective story. In _Chinatown_, everything feels organic \u2013 the personal and the political are intertwined, with the political elements never feeling artificially shaped so as to fit a generic template, or the genre structure never feeling artificially bolstered with extraneous political elements. In _Motherless Brooklyn_, however, Norton is never really able to integrate the two, leading to a kind of identity crisis, with the film unable to find a comfortable middle ground \u2013 in trying to be both a noir mystery and a societal commentary, it ends up as neither. Another issue is that because the novel features 50s values displaced into the last years of the century, the endemic racism is deeply disturbing \u2013 society today is more enlightened about such things, but here's a novel in which characters are acting like it's 40 years prior despite being set in a modern _milieu_. This is a vital part of Lethem's postmodernist deconstruction of power structures. However, with the film set in the actual 1950s, the racism just comes across as period-appropriate window dressing, losing virtually all of its thematic potency.\r\n\r\nAn old-fashioned detective story with a lot on its mind, Norton's passion for the material is self-evident. However, that passion hasn't translated into an especially good film. Void of almost any tension, although it looks great, _Motherless Brooklyn_ fails to unify its genre elements and its political preoccupations, resulting in a film unsure of its own identity and unable to make us care about much of what it depicts.","id":"5dfd92d565686e0015918e73","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dfd92d565686e0015918e73","movie_id":504562}

This duality, between the familiar and historical aspect, punctuates the whole film, provoking a clear conflict in the \"documentary\", making it a work of fiction.\r\n\r\nIn the real life, the main character was never black, but in the film, the discourse of humanization and equality, loses space for the victimization of this criminal, responsible for several brutal murders during the Period of Military Intervention in Brazil (1964-1981).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when political and ideological discourse seeks to be superior to the production of a work of art, we have only the production of a mediocre film, disguised as a documentary that seeks to present only one facet of Brazilian history in this period.

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps:\/\/www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI don't even know how to start this review\u2026 Marriage Story is one of those movies that stays with me long after I've finished it. I've been thinking about it a lot, and it's undoubtedly one of the most realistic dramas I've ever seen. That's due to the award-worthy performances of Adam Driver (Charlie Barber) and Scarlett Johansson (Nicole Barber), but also because of Noah Baumbach's incredibly layered screenplay. In addition to this, Baumbach is undeniably one of the best directors of the year. With the help of his DP, Robbie Ryan, he sets the platform for Driver and Johansson to shine as the astonishing actors that they are.\r\n\r\nSome people watch films to forget their daily issues. Some just want to have fun. Some want to learn more about a particular true story. However, there's not a single person alive who wants to watch a movie and not be able to leave the theater (or, in this case, their couch) entertained. Marriage Story has such an emotionally complicated premise that it's tough to convince people to sit and watch. I mean, who wants to watch a divorce develop throughout more than two hours? Who wants to watch two people who were once in love with each other become the worst of themselves? Yelling, fighting, court, custody, lawyers\u2026 It's not exactly an attention-grabber.\r\n\r\nI imagine people who went through the same situation getting triggered and remember a phase of their lives that was probably one of their worst. I'm writing this because I've seen some negativity towards people who simply don't want to watch Baumbach's depiction of a depressing event. It's perfectly understandable if anyone decides to skip this one, especially if it hits too close to home. In my case, I've never gone through a divorce (hopefully, I'll never will), and usually I can \"enjoy\" this type of sad, frustrating, bittersweet films (Manchester by the Sea, A Ghost Story) for what they are, no matter how tragic.\r\n\r\nIf I had to choose one-word praise: realistic. There's no way around it. The palpable emotions are the main reason why this story works so well. Only people who have never been in a relationship of any kind can't understand the moment when a fight starts to escalate, and the couple begins to say terrible stuff at each other that they don't exactly mean. The exaggeration and over-the-top arguments are part of every couple's life. They can occur due to a hundred reasons related to stress, work, accumulation of little things, or simply because it's just not a good day.\r\n\r\nMarriage Story doesn\u2019t deliver a hopeful message or a sweet story because that\u2019s not what divorces are. It\u2019s not difficult to imagine how hard it is to separate yourself from the person you love(d) for years without end, even more when there\u2019s a kid involved in the process. Baumbach could have followed the genre cliches and provide moments of pure happiness, but that\u2019s not something that happens during a situation like this. It\u2019s a heart-wrenching phase to live through, and I believe that this movie is going to be thoroughly analyzed in film school in the next decade or so.\r\n\r\nTHE scene with Driver and Johansson going at each other exponentially harder and heavier criticism-wise is one of the most emotionally powerful dialogues of the millennium. The raw emotion and the physical movements that both actors can bring into the fight are absurdly impressive. Their chemistry is so inexplicably real. I never, not even for a single second, thought that I was watching fictional characters. Nicole and Charlie can very well be our neighbors or part of our family. Baumbach's use of long takes really elevate every single sequence, allowing the protagonists to move around the set and actually act.\r\n\r\nTechnically, there's no better acting this year than what Driver and Johansson deliver. Both are always moving and doing a lot of things while giving their lines. Making dinner, drinking tea, going to the bathroom, chopping a carrot, blowing their nose, standing up, sitting down, walking around the room, crying, smiling, laughing\u2026 All of this in a single take! Several times!! Scarlett shows more emotion throughout the runtime than her counterpart, but Adam proves why he's the frontrunner at the 2019's Oscars. His restraint when Charlie is trying to be polite even though he's mad, or his explosive behavior when his character decides to finally let go (excellent build-up), are some of the attributes that make his performance my favorite of the year.\r\n\r\nNot trying to diminish Johansson's display. Both deliver career-best performances, in my opinion. Both deserve every award that exists. The supporting cast is also impeccable, and I know that Laura Dern (Nora Fanshaw) is probably going to be nominated. Still, the two leads are so engaging and captivating that I couldn't be impressed with anyone else. The only person to rise to the main actors' level is Noah Baumbach himself. With the best screenplay of 2019, he offers the audience an incredibly complex story, filled with subtle details and exceptional dialogue.\r\n\r\nHe controls the movie's pacing beautifully, and he knows the right moments to insert a little joke to lighten up the dark, depressing mood. My only issue with the film has to do with its replay value. We all have been through this situation: watching a fantastic movie, only once, and never again. Marriage Story is going to be one of those films for me. I love everything about it, but I know the chances of a rewatch are very, very small. It's a profoundly unsettling story, super uncomfortable at times, and I really don't want to go through the sadness and frustration all over again.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Noah Baumbach delivers what I believe to be its career-best flick, Marriage Story. With the best screenplay of 2019, as well as one the best directions, this is the closest the world is ever going to get to a realistic depiction of a divorce. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver also give the best performances of their lives, elevating every single scene, dialogue, argument, or joke. The long takes allow them to shine and actually work as actors, moving around the set and doing domestic\/job tasks, while delivering their lines. Technically, both Baumbach and the entire cast are absolutely perfect. It's an extremely emotional narrative, very depressing, sad, and even uncomfortable at times, which might scare some people off, especially if they've been through this. Despite its replay value being affected (a rewatch is very unlikely), it's a phenomenal lesson in storytelling that stays with us long after it's finished. Easily, one of the best movies of 2019. Don't miss it, and try not to cry.\r\n\r\nRating: A","id":"5deeb495688cd000172077fb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5deeb495688cd000172077fb","movie_id":492188}
{"author":"Gimly","content":"I don't have a kid. I've never been divorced. Or even married. Though I guess I was once a kid myself, I'm not the product of a divorced couple. I'm not even the product of a married one. Everyone I know who has gotten married or had kids did it before I met them, or stopped hanging out with me almost immediately afterward. Everyone I've ever met who got divorced either did it before I met them, or is someone I stopped hanging out with beforehand. So I don't come to the subject of _Marriage Story_ with a wealth of experience, which means it doesn't exactly scream \"relatable content\" to me.\r\n\r\nLet me start where it's easiest and everyone seems to agree: The performances. Everyone in _Marriage Story_ is pretty great, none of the characterisations changed my life, but I get it. As a chance to display what these actors are capable of in a mundane setting where all that matters is their performance, yes, absolutely, _Marriage Story_ has buckets of success.\r\n\r\nOutside of this though... I'm not even going to say that it \"fails\" elsewhere, just that it didn't win me. I like bleak movies, I like movies that make me feel something, even if it's sad. But _Marriage Story_ isn't really that. It poses you the question of whether both Charlie and Nicole are good or bad people, and shows you each from their own and other's perspective. The ending seems to imply that they're good, or at the very least both good and bad (and aren't we all?) but that really doesn't matter very much when we just spent all this time watching both of them be horrible. I know that's life, that's real, that's people, and blah bl-blah bl-blah, but that's little consolation when I've just spent two-plus hours of my life being not at all compelled by a bunch of people being awful. Being awful convincingly, to the actors' respective credits, but in this setting that is not my idea of a good time at the movies.\r\n\r\n46%\r\n\r\n-Gimly","id":"5e214f45397df000169797df","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e214f45397df000169797df","movie_id":492188}

Then every bit of marketing material afterwards showed the hand almost immediately. Ma's a headcase no doubt about it and that great act 2 twist we had waiting in the wings was ruined. Then I actually watched the thing, and, no, it's totally fair, because the escalation on her craziness is pretty much complete by the end of day 1. Things from the first trailer that I thought could maybe sow of doubt towards making the audience dubious about her intentions, in the actual movie take place **after** she's already commited murder in broad daylight. So my expectations were off, that's on me. All that aside though, _Ma_ really isn't that great. It is okay, not terrible by any stretch, but probably doesn't merit a revisit.

Her character delivers a monologue where she\u2019s explains the issues in her life that\u2019s all shot in one take, which brilliantly displays her acting chops where she naturally shifts from emotion to emotion - it was impeccable.\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast were all fantastic. Lauren Dern, Ray Liotta, Merritt Wever, Julie Hagerty, and Alan Alda were all brilliant and really bounce off the energy from Driver and Johansson. Even the child actor held his own between these juggernauts of actors.\r\n\r\nNot only are the performances the strongest element of the movie, but so is the writing. Every character is so uniquely fleshed out that the conflict feels so incredibly raw. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I was so glued to the movie from start to finish. One of the best screenplays of the year.\r\n\r\nThis is the first Noah Baumbach movie I\u2019ve seen from him and I am aware of his other work, just haven\u2019t got around to watching them. However, I feel like this was the best introduction to him as a director, because he crafted such a sympathetic look on marriage dissolving away. We don\u2019t see the full relationship, but we do get to hear Nicole and Charlie individually describe what their love about each other, while there\u2019s a montage that flash\u2019s through their routine life together with their son. Nothing visually striking in the presentation, but not once did it feel stale.\r\n\r\nThe score from Randy Newman was terrific and fitted wonderfully with the movie. I loved the aspect ratio as it added a lot to the overall mood of the movie. When the two go head to head in the custody battle - that doesn't mean they\u2019re enemies. They still talk to each other as if they are still a thing. It\u2019s also hard to pick aside, because you understand where each of them are coming from, and even if you do choose, you still feel bad for either one.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: Any other relationship movie ain't sh*t compared to this.","id":"5e2f2d271685da0011e9cffc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2f2d271685da0011e9cffc","movie_id":492188}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"_**Very bleak and somewhat compelling \u2013 a film I admired more than I liked**_\r\n\r\n>_The basis for the Stakhanov movement was first and foremost the radical improvement in the material welfare of the workers. Life has improved, comrades. Life has become more joyous. And when life is joyous, work goes well. Hence the high rates of output. Hence the heroes and heroines of labour. That, primarily, is the root of the Stakhanov movement. If there had been a crisis in our country, if there had been unemployment \u2013 that scourge of the working class \u2013 if people in our country lived badly, drably, joyless__ly, we should have had nothing like the Stakhanov movement._\r\n\r\n- Joseph Stalin; Speech at the First All-Union Conference of Stakhanovites (November 17, 1935)\r\n\r\n>_Nothing has contributed so much to the corruption of the original idea of socialism as the belief that Russia is a socialist country and that every act of its rulers must be excused, if not imitated. And so for the last ten years, I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement._\r\n\r\n- George Orwell; Preface to the Ukrainian edition of _Animal Farm_ (March, 1947)\r\n\r\nWritten by Kantemir Balagov (_Tesnota_) and Aleksandr Terekhov (_Matilde_) and directed by Balagov, _Dylda_ [_Beanpole_] is inspired by (although not based on) _The Unwomanly Face of War_ by Svetlana Alexievich. An oral history of the experiences of Russian women who fought during World War II, the book was originally published in 1985 in a heavily censored version, after Soviet authorities told Alexievich she should be writing not about \"_filth_\" but about victory (her uncensored original text was eventually published in 2017). When she was announced as the winner of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Literature, the chair of the Swedish Academy, Sara Danius, called her writing \"_a monument to courage and suffering in our time_\". And so we have _Dylda_, which has a hell of a lot of suffering, and a smattering of courage. We've seen countless stories (many of them superb) about men who have fought in war, only to find themselves unable to reintegrate into society upon the cessation of combat. _Dylda_, however, is the story of two such women, looking at the crippling effects of post-traumatic stress disorder in an era before the condition was fully recognised. And whilst one has to admire the emotional and ideological sincerity of the filmmakers, and the craft on display (it looks amazing, with the production design some of the best you'll ever see), for me, _Dylda_ was a somewhat disappointing experience, adding up to something quite a bit less than the sum of its (often exceptional) individual parts.\r\n\r\nLeningrad, 1945. In the days immediately after the defeat of Nazi Germany, the city is attempting to recover from the longest and most destructive siege in human history \u2013 beginning on September 8, 1941, the \u0411\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430 [Siege of Leningrad] wasn't lifted until January 27, 1944, a period of 872 days, during which time somewhere between 1,200,000 and 5,500,000 people died. As the film begins, we're introduced to Iya (an astonishing debut by Viktoriya Miroshnichenko), a former soldier invalided out of active duty several years prior. Shy, socially awkward, with pale features, white hair, and standing well over six-foot-tall, Iya is the eponymous \"beanpole\", who suffers from a severe case of concussion-induced PTSD that manifests itself as random episodes of total paralysis. A nurse in a hospital for wounded soldiers, Iya is especially close to Stepan (Konstantin Balakirev), a patient paralysed from the neck down, and the disillusioned but kindly hospital administrator Nikolay (Andrey Bykov). Living in a small one-room apartment with her son, Pashka (Timofey Glazkov), life is tough, but not unbearable, at least not until a horrific accident changes everything for Iya. Meanwhile, Masha (Vasilisa Perelygina, in the film's second exceptional debut performance), who served with Iya and whom Iya may be in love, returns to Leningrad unexpectedly. Suffering from her own PTSD, which can cause her to be uncharacteristically cruel and selfish, Masha is horrified to learn of the accident and begins to push Iya along a path of rectification that could destroy both of them.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, you'd be hard pushed to find fault with _Dylda_. The opening shot, for example, establishes the economy of Balagov's visual (and aural) language \u2013 before we see anything, we hear a strange clucking sound that's difficult to pin down. The film then fades in on a BCU of Iya, in the midst of one of her seizures, during which she makes the sound. So here we are, the very first shot, no dialogue, no establishing context, and we've already learned vital information about the character. Also in terms of the film's aesthetic, Sergey Ivanov's production design is especially laudable. The film is mainly confined to the hospital where Iya works, her apartment, and the nearby streets, with each location telling its own story \u2013 the hospital is grim and underfinanced, the apartment is modest but homely, and the streets are cold and alienating, the aftereffects of the Siege still very much apparent. Despite everything looking completely authentic, the exteriors weren't shot on location, but were sets built for the film, making it all the more impressive. If you were enamoured with Dante Ferretti's work for Martin Scorsese's _Gangs of New York_ (2002), you'll definitely appreciate Ivanov's work here. Along the same lines, Olga Smirnova's costume design is also exceptional, working in tandem with the production design to create an over-all tone of sombreness, but also resiliency.\r\n\r\nThis tone is helped immeasurably by the use of colour \u2013 or rather the avoidance of colour. The film's palette is extremely drab, dominated by grey, dirty yellows, some white, and, especially, a sickly green. There are virtually no blues, purples, or reds for much of the film. Indeed, the most colourful moment is literally the very last image, with Balagov bringing together the oft-seen green and the recently introduced red in a thematically fascinating way that comments not just on that scene, but speaks to what may happen to the characters after the film ends.\r\n\r\nA word of warning regarding the aesthetic, however. Balagov and cinematographer Kseniya Sereda often shoot in long takes, affording the audience nowhere to hide from the suffering on screen. One such example depicts one of the most harrowing and disturbing deaths I've ever seen \u2013 a scene which goes on and on and on without a single edit, driving home the abject and random horror of what we're witnessing, especially insofar as the shot starts with an altogether different tone from where it ends up. Because of the lack of editing, each person's realisation of what they're seeing will occur at different moments, with the shot extremely tough to get through. Another example, although not quite as disturbing, is a sex scene (if you can call it that) shot from above, and again in a very long take. Balagov's intention here is obvious enough \u2013 horror and pain shouldn't be sugar-coated but presented in all its unpleasantness without any directorial hand-holding. But, man, that death is like something out of William Blake's nightmares.\r\n\r\nThematically, the film is about broken people trying to put themselves back together, much as the city around them is trying to do the same thing. In the film's press kit, Balagov says that the characters, \"_like the city they live in, are mangled by a horrible war_\". The fact that the siege was lifted and the Germans defeated means relatively little in the day-to-day lives of those for whom the experience of combat has eaten away a part of their soul. The Leningrad of the film is a place where many of the norms of society have eroded, where any sense of Utilitarianism has become secondary to the mechanics of survival. A good example of the condition of the city is found when Iya brings Pasha to the hospital to amuse the soldiers by making animal sounds. However, when one soldier asks him to bark like a dog, he doesn't seem to understand, and another soldier points out, \"_where would he have seen a dog? They've all been eaten._\" The Siege has fundamentally altered the reality of the city in terms of both the macro (Leningrad itself) and the micro (the inhabitants). Very rare is it that we see such an unrelentingly bleak depiction of the utter ruination of war, and the filmmakers must be commended for having the courage of their convictions.\r\n\r\nFor all its laudable aesthetic elements and thematic complexity, however, I was disappointed with _Dylda_. I have no problem with bleak stories; in fact, generally speaking, I'm drawn more to bleakness and pessimism regarding the human condition, not just in cinema, but so too in fiction, theatre, poetry, and painting. So it wasn't the bleakness that turned me off. Rather it was simpler than that; more structural than narrative. For starters, I found the film too long, feeling padded in places, especially in the sense that Balagov tends to let scenes run a few beats longer than they need to. A tighter edit would have improved the pace immeasurably. The aforementioned death scene is very long, but it works _because_ of the length, affording the audience no respite. Other scenes, however, simply ran long without much in the way of thematic justification, often leading to a sagging of the narrative trajectory, sometimes to the extent of draining scenes of any potency they may have had. On occasion, Balagov can also be far too didactic, overstating emotions and literalising internal conflicts. At the same time, some of the most important plot points come across as contrived. Additional, the film is both front and end-loaded, with the best scenes and most interesting themes coming in the first and last acts. Unfortunately, much of what's in between is unfocused and flabby.\r\n\r\n_Dylda_ has proven a huge critical favourite and has been showered with awards \u2013 it won Best Director and Best Film in the Un certain regard section at Cannes and it was Russia's entry for Best International Film for the 2020 Academy Awards, making the December shortlist, which narrowed the field from 93 to ten, and expected to make the final five. So, I freely admit I'm swimming against the tide in saying I didn't really like it. I can certainly celebrate its craft, its thematic sophistication (that Balagov is only 28 seems almost impossible given the thematic maturity), its acting, and the way it isn't even remotely interested in conforming to prescriptions adopted by more mainstream films. And ultimately, although I didn't especially like _Dylda_, and was somewhat disappointed by it, I certainly admired the hell out of.","id":"5e04316dd236e6001698231f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e04316dd236e6001698231f","movie_id":517148}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nGuillermo del Toro's pair of Hellboy movies were always pretty acclaimed by both critics and audience. So, if a reboot was in the works, it had to be way different from the originals or, at least, capable of separating itself from them. Neil Marshall's film is definitely distinct, but not in a good way. Sadly, this is one of the worst movies of the year, so far. David Harbour tries super hard to bring this story to safe haven, but his outstanding performance can't fight back all of the painfully long and repetitive exposition dumps, an editing worthy of a Razzie Award (if they had such a category), and cringe-worthy comedy bits.\r\n\r\nThe trio of writers failed in almost everything. Even Hellboy, as a character, becomes a caricature of himself at one point. Milla Jovovich, who is not a bad actress at all, offers such an over-the-top display that only comes off as cliche, cheesy, and the complete opposite of menacing. Obviously, her extremely villainous script doesn't help. Sasha Lane (Alice) is the only one who actually portrays a likable character (excluding the protagonist) and delivers a compelling performance. Daniel Dae Kim is also good as Ben Daimio. Unfortunately, a talented cast is not enough to overcome the undeniable screenplay issues, which tells a convoluted story, filled with heavy exposition through annoying flashbacks (I lost count of how many there are).\r\n\r\nThe rock'n'roll score doesn't always work, becoming uneven and making some transitions just weird. However, credit where credit is due, it does make the action sequences a lot cooler. There are some great action moments where Hellboy shines, but overall they are ruined by sloppy editing. Honestly, I don't know how Marshall can direct such beautiful one-take fights (or \"stitched one-take\" sequences, like one towards the end) and horribly edited ones in the same film, so many times. The visual effects disappoint as much as they impress, but Hellboy's makeup and costume are, at least, on-point. In the end, the story and the characters are the two pillars of any movie, and Hellboy fails to deliver a well-written and captivating adventure, as well as compelling characters.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Hellboy is a huge misstep in Neil Marshall's filmmaking career and he's going to have to work hard to get another opportunity at a blockbuster. His film is already suffering losses at the box-office, which proves that the interest in the reboot of this franchise is not big enough to warrant a sequel. Admittedly, it has its good moments and David Harbour embodies his character seamlessly, carrying the movie for as long as he can. Nevertheless, a good cast and some occasionally cool action sequences are not enough to fight back writing issues, uneven soundtrack, cheesy comedy, heavy exposition dumps, and the worst editing I've witnessed this year, so far. It's a headache that most people might not find worthy of the price of admission...\r\n\r\nRating: C-","id":"5cb5b93592514108cef3c677","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cb5b93592514108cef3c677","movie_id":456740}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Despite the less than stellar ratings this movie has received I have to say that I quite liked it actually. It is a much more violent, gory and adult movie than the previous Hellboy movies and this is probably contributing a lot to my appreciation of it. I so dislike when they dumb down a story or character just because the bean counters think they can get more kids to watch it and thus make more money. Or worse, because they want to cater to the easily offended whiners.\r\n\r\nThis movie starts off already in the first scene where the language make it clear the easily offended should have stayed home. It continues in the same manner. It is indeed a quite violent movie with a lot of gory effects. At least for a movie based on a \u201cregular\u201d US comics book character. When the big demons are released towards the end of the movie and the human casualties mount the movie becomes quite inventive in the various gory ways a human can be killed.\r\n\r\nThen we have the scene with the \u201cbirth\u201d of Hellboy which is, luckily, fairly true to the original story and shows not only Nazis but doesn\u2019t resort to any SJW dumbassery and tries to obfuscate parts of the Nazi uniforms. Instead the swastika is displayed as it should be. That should be enough to get most SJW whiners to shit themselves. Needless to say there is not much politically correct preaching in the movie either which is a relief.\r\n\r\nThe story is fairly okay. Nothing really to write home about but not really bad either. The action is, obviously, quite good. Hellboy himself is played fairly well by David Harbour and Ian McShane is not bad at all as Professor Broom. Milla Jovovich never really shined as The Blood Queen though.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things that where not stellar as well though. That warthog looking changeling which played a central part of the movie was often just ridiculous and the outburst by Hellboy and rant about why humans and demons could live in piece or something was completely unnecessary. Also, I felt that Hellboy was on the receiving end of the clobbering a bit too much. It was really not until the six-month-after scenes at the very end that he really displayed the self confident ass-kicking character that I would like to see him as.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I quite liked the movie and it\u2019s a shame that it didn\u2019t get better ratings. That Rotten SJW tomatoes gave it shit ratings was expected of course although even with their new censored user rating system they didn\u2019t manage to get their \u201caudience\u201d to get in line with their \u201ccritics\u201d. 17% critics rating while over 50% of the audience gave it a rating of six or more. Big fail again RT.\r\n\r\nThe after scenes made it quite clear that they hoped for a sequel but with the poor performance I do not think that will happen. A shame if you ask me.","id":"5d5d92536743fa0016703c4b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d5d92536743fa0016703c4b","movie_id":456740}
{"author":"Sheldon Nylander","content":"If Guillermo del Toro\u2019s version of Hellboy is the imaginative grand symphony, this version is the discordant heavy metal little brother. Based on \u201cThe Wild Hunt\u201d and \u201cThe Storm and the Fury\u201d storylines in the comics doesn\u2019t save it, either.\r\n\r\nLacking the Del Toro\u2019s vision, the character and monster designs are pedantic at best. David Harbour plays the titular infernal hero and while at first the costume design seems grittier than Ron Perlman\u2019s Hellboy, it becomes clear very quickly that, while Perlman became the character and almost seemed to meld with his costume, Harbour seems to be fighting his costume. It\u2019s like watching one of the most uncomfortable and anxiety-ridden wrestling matches one can imagine. I kind of felt sorry for Harbour as he\u2019s a good actor with the right material, but he got handed such terrible material to work with. To his credit, it\u2019s clear that he does try to sell it, but when you\u2019re selling crap, it\u2019s still crap.\r\n\r\nThe characters come off more as caricatures. Their relationships are so basic and one-dimensional even if they exist that we find that we don\u2019t really care. And that\u2019s the major problem. The stakes aren\u2019t built up enough to make us care. It\u2019s a good versus evil comic-book film and we don\u2019t really care whether the good guys live or if the bad guys win. Making the audience care and identify with the characters should be the bread and butter of \u201cHellboy.\u201d Instead, we\u2019re given a cracker and told to run along and play.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t bother unless you are a major fan of the comics or the actors and simply HAVE to see it. Even then, you might want to consider steering clear as it could taint your love for these.","id":"5dcbd79579a1c30013444adf","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dcbd79579a1c30013444adf","movie_id":456740}

That's about it.\r\n\r\nAs famous for his on-field brilliance as his lavish lifestyle and volatility off the pitch, Maradona lived (and continues to live) his controversial life very much in the public eye, whilst maintaining a different personality behind closed doors. A complex web of contradictions (religious but hedonistic; humble but arrogant; frugal but materialistic; respectful but condescending), much as he did with Ayrton Senna, Kapadia depicts Maradona as uniquely and supremely talented, the only person on the planet who could do what he did as well as he did it. And much as he did with Amy Winehouse, Kapadia emphasises that Maradona was only in his early twenties when he found himself with the world at his feet, unable to handle the fame, and charting a course towards an inevitable fall from grace.\r\n\r\nBut there's another, more important similarity between the trio; all three were destroyed, in one way or another, by their talent - Senna died in a Formula 1 crash in 1990 at the age of 34, Winehouse succumbed to alcohol poisoning in 2011 at the age of 27 after years as an alcoholic and drug addict, and Maradona became a victim of his own success; in the prime of his life, his career imploded amidst legal trouble, vilification in the press, controversy on the field, an illegitimate son, cocaine, bans, and association with the Camorra and people such as Fidel Castro, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Somehow, he survived it all, going on to manage several teams, including his beloved Argentina, and although the film ends on something of an unnecessary downer, and although the narrow focus on the period from 1984 to 1992 will be sure to disappoint those looking for a more conventional overview of the man, the fact is that it's in those few years where the legend was really born, where it reached its apotheosis, garnering never-before-seen levels of adulation, where it was subsumed by a lifestyle that would make Caligula look parsimonious, and where it ultimately self-destructed.\r\n\r\nMade with the cooperation of the man himself, Kapadia was granted access to Maradona's personal video archives, building the film from over 500 hours of never-before-seen footage. This is actually the second time a documentary filmmaker has been allowed into the archives, the first was Emir Kusturica, whose _Maradona by Kusturica _(2008) is a more conventional bio than Kapadia's take on the material. Wisely, Kapadia only uses footage which Kusturica did not, so there's no overlap between the two films. In terms of that video archive, in an era long before mobile phones and social media, how did Maradona amass such a vast collection? It turns out that when he signed for S.S.C. Napoli in 1984, his agent at the time, Jorge Cyterszpiler, hired a camera crew to document every aspect of Maradona's life and career, resulting in a library of footage shot with unprecedented fly-on-the-wall access.\r\n\r\nKapadia and his regular editor Chris King begin the film with some brief biographical material about Maradona's childhood and his time at Asociaci\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tica Argentinos Juniors (1976-1981), Club Atl\u00e9tico Boca Juniors (1981-1982), and FC Barcelona (1982-1984), before focusing in on some of the major events of the next eight years - his arrival at Napoli in July 1984 for a then world-record fee of \u00a36.9 million, when he was welcomed at the Stadio San Paolo by 85,000 excited fans; his disappointing first season, with Napoli finishing eighth in Serie A; the 1986 FIFA World Cup, in which he scored both the greatest goal of all time and one of the most controversial, ultimately leading a very average Argentinian squad to victory; the birth of his illegitimate son, Diego Sinagra, in September 1986; the 1986-1987 Serie A season, where his performances helped Napoli win their first ever league title; his growing association with the Giuliano crime family and his spiralling cocaine addiction; the 1988-1989 UEFA Cup, where he led Napoli to their first ever European title; Napoli's second Serie A title in 1988-1989; the 1990 World Cup, in which Maradona found himself in the unenviable position of lining out for Argentina against Italy at the San Paolo - a pressure-cooker situation that wasn't helped when he said in an interview a few days before the match that Naples wasn't really Italy, and that he expected the Napoli fans to cheer for Argentina rather than their national team; his vilification in the press after scoring the penalty that put Italy out of the World Cup, and the Napoli fans turning on him with a never-before-seen level of vitriol; his April 1991 arrest and 15-month suspension for testing positive for cocaine; and finally, his low-key departure from Napoli for Sevilla FC in July 1992. A _cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre_ on a scale never before seen in football, before they turned on him, Maradona was treated like a god by the passionate Napoli fans, who erected religious icons dedicated to him all over the city, painted his mural on the sides of buildings, and hung pictures of him in their homes, right beside their paintings of Christ.\r\n\r\nOne of the things the film does exceptionally well is simply to remind us just how insanely talented Maradona was, with a great deal of kinetic footage of him plying his trade. Never the finest physical specimen, he was only 5'5\", stocky, and not especially intimidating. However, as is mentioned in the film, his greatest asset wasn't his insane acceleration and speed, his difficult to disrupt low centre of gravity, his physical resiliency (there are countless shots of him being fouled, only to scramble to his feet and keep on going), his dribbling ability, passing ability and\/or scoring ability, or even his fabled left foot - it was his brain. His genius was not unlike that which one finds in chess grandmasters; whereas his opponents and teammates could look at a situation and calculate where the ball might be in five seconds, Maradona could look at that same situation and know precisely where the ball would be in ten seconds, maybe in fifteen seconds. His bursts of speed were unlike anything the sport had ever seen, nor has there been anything comparable since, but it wasn't just that he could waltz past defenders like they weren't even there, it was his ability to choose exactly the path he needed to take to put himself in the best possible position after he'd passed them. The pitch-level footage Kapadia has chosen illustrates this brilliantly, as Maradona moves with a dexterity and grace belying his appearance, and suggesting he has mastered time and space, bending the continuum to his will. If you've never seen him play, prepare to be truly amazed.\r\n\r\nAs one would expect from Kapadia, the aesthetic design of _Diego Maradona_ is exceptional. The opening scene is especially attention-grabbing - set to a pounding disco soundtrack, the film begins with what appears to be a car chase through the streets of Naples, like a cross between Peter Collinson's _The Italian Job_ (1962) and William Friedkin's _The French Connection_ (1971). Racing through narrow streets at breakneck speeds, the scene is shot from within one of the cars, and is intercut with snippets mapping out Maradona's childhood in the Villa Fiorito shantytown, his early professional career, his arrival at Barcelona in June 1982, his ankle break in September 1983, and his departure for Napoli in 1984. In this sense, the montage and the 'car chase' dovetail into one another, because what we're actually looking at is Maradona's first arrival at Napoli, his journey to the Stadio San Paolo on July 5. It's an unexpectedly frenetic opening to a documentary about a footballer, speaking subtly to the excess and fast living to come.\r\n\r\nThis idea of foreshadowing darker times ahead continues in the presentation of his chaotic press conference later that day, when a journalist asked him if he was worried about Camorra influence at the club, only for club president Corrado Ferlaino to demand the journalist be removed, and a brawl nearly breaking out. And as with the opening scene, the chaos of this moment will find many parallels over the next eight years. Also impressive is how Kapadia distils much of the weight of Maradona's career down to that decisive penalty against Italy in 1990. Fiction films about football often end with a penalty kick because it's really the only part of a game that can be dramatised and played for tension - think of films as varied as John Huston's _Escape to Victory_ (1981) and Maria Giese's _When Saturday Comes_ (1996), both of which feature climatic penalties. Here, the penalty is real, as is its symbolic cultural significance, although it certainly doesn't spell the end of the story.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons the clips of Maradona on the pitch work so well is because of the excellent sound design - every tackle is accompanied by a thud, every fall by a crunch, every kick of the ball by a deadweight thunk. Every contact is given weight and unexpected impact, adding an impressively constructed element of subjectivity to the material - we hear it as Maradona himself may very well have heard it. It really helps sell the immediacy of the footage, which is miles away from the more distanced and sanitised coverage we're used to on TV. Indeed, Kapadia's decision to focus almost exclusively on choppy pitch-level footage over the more objective shots used for broadcast is one of the most successful elements of the film \u2013 really working towards selling the experience of actually being on the pitch in front of 80,000 fans.\r\n\r\nAs the eagle-eyed amongst you will have noticed, unlike both _Senna_ and _Amy_, _Diego Maradona_ includes both first name and surname in its title, and whilst this might seem like a superficial element, it's actually of huge thematic importance. The film's central conceit is that Diego Maradona was, in essence, two personas; there was the quiet and unassuming street kid who just wanted to help his family and have fun (Diego), and there was the global superstar, with a different Rolex for every day of the week and women whenever he wanted (Maradona). The film posits that Maradona was a construct built by Diego to help him deal with his fame and the concomitant pressure, essentially acting as a shield so Diego could feel safe. The problem, however, as several people attest, was that over time, Maradona began to take over from Diego, even away from the cameras, and as Diego receded further and further into the shadows, Maradona became increasingly unpleasant and self-absorbed. It's a fascinating way into his psychology and a deceptively simple bit of extremely revealing psychoanalysis.\r\n\r\nThe main theme in the film is that Maradona's skill made him a god, but what happens when a god comes crashing down to earth, exposed as a mere mortal, a flawed human, just like the rest of us. Perhaps wisely, Kapadia doesn't focus on any one incident as breaking Maradona, suggesting instead that his illegitimate son, the 1990 World Cup, the cocaine addiction, the Camorra ties, the suspension, all had a cumulative effect, and it was the totality that nearly destroyed him. However, Kapadia is clear that the downward spiral began in 1986 with the birth of Diego Sinagra, whom he wouldn't acknowledge as his son until 2016. Drawing attention to the media frenzy that resulted when Cristiana Sinagra revealed the affair, Kapadia ensures to let us know that his wife, Claudia Villafa\u00f1el, was pregnant with a child of her own during the scandal, whilst Maradona adopted a policy of deny, deny, deny. In relation to the Argentina-Italy game, whilst Kapadia is unequivocal that the Napoli fans overreacted, turning on their hero because he dared to play for his national team, he is also clear that Maradona's calamitous pre-game interview didn't help matters. In this sense, although Kapadia flirts with the image of Maradona as a man betrayed by an intrusive press and a fickle public, ultimately it presents him as neither hero nor villain, but as someone caught up in a hurricane partly of his own making.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, perhaps the most obvious one is how narrowly focused the film is, with a good 90% set during his tenure at Napoli. Some brief time is given over here and there to his early years and his closeness to his parents, but it's relatively spartan and leaves you yearning for more. For example, the film barely touches on the infamous brawl that Maradona instigated (albeit after he was incessantly provoked) in the 1984 Copa del Rey final contested by Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao, a brawl which involved every player on each team, most of the subs, many of the coaching staff, and even ground staff, and which led to the fans throwing objects at the players and at one another, ultimately resulting in 60 injuries, all in front of King Juan Carlos I. Some footage is shown, but there's no context. What happened had its origins several months previously when Maradona suffered a broken ankle after a bad tackle from Andoni Goikoetxea Olaskoaga. The break briefly threatened his career, and during the final, Goikoetxea repeatedly fouled and taunted Maradona. None of this is explained in the film. There's also only the briefest of mentions of the 1994 World Cup, when he failed another drug test (this time for ephedrine) and was sent home in disgrace, never to play for Argentina again. Likewise, there's nothing whatsoever on his coaching career, during which time he took Argentina to the 2010 World Cup. The film is also relatively silent on why the rest of Italy felt such disdain for Naples and Napoli (some of the chants are truly epic). We're told about and shown the hatred, but there's nothing about where that hatred came from or why it was so pronounced. The film also ends on an uncessarily downbeat note, with Maradona overweight and disillusioned, tearfully confessing his many transgressions on Argentinian TV. Such an ending was entirely avoidable given that the man is still alive and seems to be holding his demons at bay.\r\n\r\nThis aside, however, _Diego Maradona_ is another exceptional documentary from one of the world's finest documentarians. The trump card is splitting Maradona's persona into two constituent parts \u2013 hedonistic superstar and unassuming family man \u2013 essentially mapping out the difference between the person and the cult of personality. Avoiding hagiography, the film paints him as far from perfect, but so too is it a fitting tribute to, for my money, the greatest player who will ever play the game. A man whose hubris and arrogance nearly destroyed him, nothing he did off the pitch will ever nullify his perfection on it. Ultimately, the film is about how exceptionalism can corrupt, with every misstep he made writ large for all to see. Kapadia translates his chaotic career into compelling drama, and ultimately guides it to the same location to which he took _Amy_ and, to a lesser extent, _Senna_ - a story about an individual which speaks to the volatility and fickleness of fame, with one eye on the corruptive potential of genius. But more than that, it charts what can happen when these two elements combine, creating a perfect storm that may allow for moments of transcendent brilliance, but which ultimately exacts a very steep price.","id":"5d8166742dc44e0025787918","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d8166742dc44e0025787918","movie_id":536841}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nDon't worry. This is going to be a pretty vague review. Right now, as I'm writing this sentence, I'm still processing what I saw and how am I going to explain how I felt without spoiling a single tiny thing. First of all, it's such a mix of feelings. On one hand, I'm extremely happy that I was lucky to be alive during this epic time and that I was able to follow these characters that I love and care about so much. On the other hand, I'm obviously sad that it finally reached the end of this (hopefully) first incredible saga. There are no perfect films and one with so many heroes will always have struggles balancing it all (Infinity War already had this issue). \r\n\r\nHowever, the Russo brothers did everything they could to deliver a phenomenal story, and they did. I don't think this could have been any better. Its last hour exceeds any expectations. It's epic, emotional, action-heavy, and it has one of my favorite shots in the entire history of cinema. It's pure magic, and the VFX team will surely get an Oscar for it. The action reminded me of the biggest Lord of the Rings' battles, and it was impeccably filmed, filled with riveting and chill-inducing sequences. Nevertheless, don't expect this high-intensity feeling throughout the whole runtime. The other two acts are a slow-burn build-up to a payoff that's going to make you pretty much either \"love\" or \"like\" this movie. I absolutely love it! \r\n\r\nThis is easily one of the best MCU films, if not my new number one. I can't deny that the 3-hour runtime has some unnecessary scenes, but even if they don't have a significant impact on the plot or even in the characters, they still contribute to the enormous build-up. Seeing this family that we grew up with just talking with each other or having lunch, at the same time that they deal with the consequences of Thanos' snap, is inexplicably captivating and heartwarming. Characters like Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) and Steve (Chris Evans) supporting each other is simply beautiful. Their comradery and chemistry are worthy of some tears here and there.\r\n\r\nSome people didn't really enjoy Infinity War so much due to the lack of screentime that some characters had. This time around, there are fewer characters to work with, so the balance is better. Everyone gets an important role, from Captain America to Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) to Nebula (Karen Gillan), and even Rocket (Bradley Cooper). Every single character has a major moment. If you take one out of the movie, it just doesn't work anymore. This is not only great work from the directors, but also from the writers. \r\n\r\nChristopher Markus and Stephen McFeely are not even going to be remembered because fans will always think of the cast first. Most of them will also remember the directors. But the writers?! If I stand at the door of the theater at the end of the film and question everyone about who are the writers, I strongly believe most of the audience won't know. Every dialogue, every sentence, every word carries so much impact on the narrative. Literally, I cried and got chills just by hearing two freaking words with the perfect timing in between. The amount of grief that the words of the ones who've lost everyone and everything carry is palpable and, for me, those are the most emotional moments of the movie: seeing how everyone is suffering from their own losses, not the deaths themselves.\r\n\r\nThe humor is mostly on-point, but it's still connected to my only real issue with the film, which is the second act's tone. From the moment the team decides what to do, we already know that this is a 1 in 14 million chance of success like Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) said, so the stakes and pressure are massive! With this level of tension, I didn't expect such an \u201ceasygoing\u201d and \u201cfunny\u201d vibe throughout, except for one particular sequence. They do a great job once again of pairing up certain Avengers together, but most of them go through these too comedic plot points for such a crucial and serious mission. Fortunately, this act carries enough action and emotional drive to make this problem not that big of an issue.\r\n\r\nVisually, this is arguably the best-looking superhero film ever. From the mind-blowing visual effects to the gorgeous cinematography, everything is perfect. The costumes are gritty and muddy when our heroes are in a battle, their faces are all filled with blood, and I have no words to describe how jaw-dropping that last act is. I can't wait to change my desktop wallpaper once THAT shot is available. I dropped a single tear just by looking at it. No one talks, no one does anything. It's just an amazingly beautiful image. The score is epic as hell. So much that I'm listening to it right now as I'm writing this review, and I'm getting chills all over my body. \r\n\r\nI can't really write much more, to be honest. I will acknowledge the cast because they are brilliant. Each and every single member delivers an outstanding performance, but if I had to choose the ones that both surprised me and had the most impact on me, they would be Johansson's, Evans', and Robert Downey Jr's (Tony Stark \/ Iron Man). \u201cNew\u201d characters like Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) blend seamlessly, and the payoff is unbelievably satisfying. In terms of predictability, it goes more or less as I expected, but it still carries a few surprises throughout. Nothing is ever like we imagine or theorize about, so expect the unexpected, and don't judge a movie by if it fits your crazy, unrealistic theories that never crossed the producers and directors' minds in the first place!\r\n\r\nAll in all, I don't know what to do now. The only thing I'm sure of is that I want to see it again, as soon as possible. The last hour is f*cking insane. I couldn't fall asleep properly because I couldn't stop thinking about it. Endgame surpasses all expectations. It's everything I wished for and so much more. I could easily spend a whole day at the movie theater and watch three sessions in a row. It's that good. One of the best comic-book films of all-time, without a single doubt. Thank you to Kevin Feige and everyone who worked hard to bring the MCU to where it stands now. I can't even think of how are they going to produce something at the level of Infinity Saga. Maybe they never will. Maybe we'll have to wait another decade or two for something like this. Until then, see you at the next Endgame screening! Enjoy! Oh and #DontSpoilTheEndgame!\r\n\r\nPS: it's not a perfect movie, I know. It doesn't exist one. Yes, Endgame has some issues regarding its pacing and tone, but I would be lying to myself if this isn't everything I dreamed of. I felt the same way with Civil War, regarding the rating to give, and I ended up giving it an A after a first viewing. As soon as I watched the second time, I changed it to an A+. I don\u2019t need to wait for that second viewing with Endgame \u2026 And thank you to my audience for being incredibly respectful. No yelling, no crazy laughs, no stupid people doing stupid stuff. Thank you so much for not ruining one of the best cinematic experiences of my life!\r\n\r\nRating: A+","id":"5cc307bfc3a36809ab86e2fd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cc307bfc3a36809ab86e2fd","movie_id":299534}

{"author":"garethmb","content":"The epic Marvel Saga that started over ten years ago has been building up to the inevitable clash with the powerful tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin).  Last year\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d set the stage for the highly-anticipated conclusion; \u201cAvengers: End Game\u201d and at long last it has arrived.\r\n\r\nPicking up shortly after the events of the last film, the Avengers must deal with the aftermath of what Thanos has done. The team is naturally divided between wanting revenge, wanting to set things right, and just wanting to take what they have and go on. \r\n\r\nAs time passes and they struggle to accept the reality of their situation; an unexpected individual returns and with them comes the seeds of a new plan to make things right. Naturally Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is skeptical but eventually warms to the possibilities of the idea thanks to a new scientific breakthrough that makes it possible.\r\n\r\nInspired, Tony sets out to put an elaborate plan in motion that will allow the team to try to fix things and to stop Thanos once and for all.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an extended and at times nostalgic heist where various members of the team work to assemble the pieces needed for the plan as they believe they only have one chance to make things right.\r\n\r\nThe film is essentially three acts in one. The first deals with the recap and expansion of their situation and the planning. The second act is basically a heist where action and comedy are blended with some touching moments.\r\n\r\nThis all leads to the final act which is the FX laden set piece where the ensemble cast gathers to fight the forces of evil in a battle to save the Universe.\r\nThe film is epic in scale and length as it clocks in at over three hours but the movie is filled with so much content that the time goes by quickly and you have a hard time believing three hours have elapsed.\r\n\r\nIt is also a difficult film to review as you cannot recap elements of the film in any great detail without giving away elements that are sure to delight the fans. Suffice it to say that my only real issue with the fil and it was minor; was that it took a while to get to the action but at least there was plenty to keep you entertained along the way.\r\n\r\nAs this phase of the Marvel Film Universe winds down and plans are put in place for the next five years; \u201cAvengers: End Game\u201d is a satisfying conclusion to the epic saga that was started many years ago and weaves elements of many of the past Marvel films into an entertaining tale which features all of the best elements that have made the series of films such big hits.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5","id":"5cbf94670e0a266b96fba5ef","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cbf94670e0a266b96fba5ef","movie_id":299534}
{"author":"Gimly","content":"Hey, so, just some really quick thoughts I wanna get down, 'cause it's after 1 o'clock in the morning, and I wanna get some sleep so I can wake up well rested to see _Endgame_ again.\r\n\r\nPutting it out there right from the get-go, _Avengers: Endgame_ is my favourite MCU movie. It's my favourite movie of the year too, but I've only seen like ten or so 2019 releases, and this is the 22nd Marvel Cinematic Universe film, so that seems far and away the bigger deal. I can't say it's perfect, there's some conflicting stuff within its own runtime that really doesn't seem to gel (though a re-watch may prove me wrong on that), and it's not like every moment was the no-holds-barred-zero-exception best version of that moment from start to end. But God I loved this thing.\r\n\r\nI will say this though, the reason that I loved it, is this thing is fan service galore. If you do not care for the franchise's 21 movies preceding this point, then _Endgame_ is not the movie to turn you around on that. That may come in a future installment, but this one is a culmination. It's the end of _Infinity War_ but also Phase 3, but also a wrap-up and genuine ode to\/send off for everything that Marvel has done over the past 11 years. That to me was incredible, and I am eternally greatful, but I cannot imagine it working for people who have no vested interest in these characters.\r\n\r\nTo me though? My first 9 out of 10 rating in **three years**.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Ridiculously strong appeal.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"These kind of movies are among the few movies that I can be bothered to go to an actual theater to watch nowadays. For most movies I just wait until they come out on disk (preferably Ultra HD Blu-ray if it\u2019s available) and watch them on my home theater rig. So this weekend me and the kids went to the theater to watch Avengers: Endgame.\r\n\r\nI have to say that it was better, even much better, than I feared. I really feared that the SJW retards at Marvel would take this opportunity to completely re-organize the Marvel universe to their liking. Like how they completely ruined both professor Xavier and Wolverine in that abysmal Logan movie. Luckily, this did not really happen. Maybe the financial reality of their failing SJW comics and Disney doing a bit of culling of the most extreme of the Marvel retards, the ones who fail to understand that super hero movies are meant to entertain and not be their personal agenda channel, are starting to take effect.\r\n\r\nIt was actually a quite good movie with plenty of action, some humor and, of course, lots and lots of special effects. Even the story made somewhat sense, at least in the context of a Marvel movie, even though the writers resorted to time travel.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of somewhat dark and grim but I guess that was to be suspected. It cheered up as it moved along and then ending \u2026 well to me at least it was mostly satisfactory.\r\n\r\nI was not too thrilled about the \u201cnew\u201d Hulk although I warmed up to him a bit during the film. Thor? The less that is said about him the better actually. The rest of the merry bunch was in pretty good shape and I am quite happy that we did not get to see to much of Quill\u2019s usual shenanigans. I really hate that character.\r\n\r\nI was quite positively surprised at the huge and quite cool battle towards the end. I was thinking, or rather hoping,  that at some time they were just going to reverse Thanos\u2019 crap and that would be it but instead we get to watch another huge confrontation with pretty much everyone involved at the end. Very cool action and FX indeed.\r\n\r\nThere were some silly plot holes of course. As always when writers resort to time travel. An obvious one would of course be that, when they knew they only had enough Pym particles to complete one trip for each person why did they just not go back in time to get more the first thing they did? Especially since they later did exactly that. Also, Captain Marvel (in her new SJW hairdo) flies through a barrage of fire, smashes through Thanos\u2019 ship like it was nothing and then struggles to combat Thanos himself? There were a bit of this silliness spread around but not too much for me to be bothered by it.\r\n\r\nThere were a few casualties of which I am saddened by two of them. I think at least one of them was unnecessary and probably agenda based. I also strongly disliked the rubbish with Captain America at the end. He has never been one of my favorite characters so I do not really care much about him being around or not but that rubbish sob-scene where he hands over his shield to a \u201cpolitically correct\u201d person was really unnecessary. I guess it must have been put there to appease the Marvel SJW retards.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my bottom line is that I was greatly entertained by this movie. It had all the good stuff, real super heroes, action, special effects and not too much of the crap that has been spewing out of Marvel the last years.","id":"5cd7cf4ec3a3681d16c096ba","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cd7cf4ec3a3681d16c096ba","movie_id":299534}

{"author":"Bhargavi Chandrashekar","content":"Sachin Ravi's debut directional is warm, funny, smart, intelligent, entertaining, convincing and also tad longer. Apart from our Narayana (Rakshit Shetty) It is Achyuth Kumar, Balaji Manohar, Pramod Shetty, who steals the show. Hmm, what? No, I didn't forget to mention Shanvi Srivastava. One cannot forget her performance nor her characterization, something which is more enlivening. However Bhatru's cameo goes unnoticed. Rakshit Shetty's acting seems to be forced at a few parts. Idk whether it was deliberated or not.\r\n\r\nThe film is induced with an atmospheric experience (Thanks to Karma Chawla's cinematography and Sachin's editing is a major plus) as they display very pleasing visuals with the splendid color grading and spaced out background score (by Ajneesh Loknath who always surprises with his remarkable works) with the circumstanced music to keep you hooked into the treasure hunt.\r\n\r\nThe resulting blend of evolving sensibilities with top notch production choices creates an the interpretation that respects the vogue that the film set in while suiting current attitude & trend. It delivers everything that a fan could want in a film. It's a cinematic epic that displays the talent of everyone involved in the project. On the other end the Climax seems to be a bit rushed, which, if it had worked this could have been the quintessential movie that the fans of Rakshit Shetty always dreamed of.

My wife & I had this discussion before viewing. It basically comes down to two options (assuming the events in \"Infinity War\" weren\u2019t just a dream): magic or time travel. All I\u2019ll say is: What they came up with was in ways reminiscent of the plot convolutions of \"Back to the Future II\" (1989).\r\n\r\n\u201cEndgame\u201d (2019) begins strong with the devastating reality of half of all living beings in the Universe suddenly vanishing.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"When I watched the 2014 Godzilla movie I was less than impressed as can be seen from my review here.\r\n\r\nWhen watching this one I felt it was marginally better.\r\n\r\nTrue to the Hollywood standards today, or perhaps lack thereof, the script writers just had to try and squeeze in a lot of green bullshit about how we destroy the planet and something has to be done bla bla bla.\r\n\r\nInteresting enough though, the way it was done, actually made the green fanatics the bad guys in the movie. Whether that was intentional or the writers was too stupid to realize it I do not know.\r\n\r\nThe story is essentially about how one green fanatic in particular releases the \u201cTitans\u201d as they are called in the movie and uses them to wreak havoc, killing millions, to \u201cbalance things\u201d and start a new world. That is your typical green fanatic although with a bit more means than usual to implement his deluded fantasies. Of course Godzilla, with the help of a few clear minded humans, comes to the rescue. That\u2019s pretty much it. As I wrote, a typical substandard Hollywood script.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this movie better though is that the implementation is not so shit full of absolutely stupid and unintelligent sequences as the 2014 movie. The implementation is actually not that bad. The action sequences are really quite good and there\u2019s plenty of big ass monsters in this movie.\r\n\r\nI also quite liked that cool super-carrier airplane that the Monarch crew flew around in.\r\n\r\nAs despicable as the previously mentioned green fanatic is, the role was nicely implemented as well as the main protagonist and most people around him.\r\n\r\nThe part about kick-starting Godzilla after he was wounded by detonating a nuke in front of his nose was a bit silly though. So was the hole it\u2019s to hot and radioactive for drones as well as for a nuclear submarine so let\u2019s send in a guy on foot. Seriously?\r\n\r\nAlso the after scenes where life magically sprouted everywhere the Titans had wrecked havoc was more than a little stupid.\r\n\r\nIf this hadn\u2019t been a cool giant monster movie with a lot of special effects I would have scored it a lot lower.

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nAs some of you might know, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is one of my Most Anticipated Movies of 2019. Not because I expected it to be a beautifully written, heartfelt story with fully-developed characters who I would immensely care about. I was incredibly excited because it\u2019s freaking Godzilla and from the few images that I had seen, it looked absolutely stunning. I didn\u2019t need an Oscar-worthy screenplay or amazing performances. I just wanted a decent and logical (this last word is important) narrative with reasonable characters, and tons of monsters fighting to the death against each other. So, my expectations were neither complex or as high as some other people might have.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I left the theater extremely disappointed. I can\u2019t deny the impeccable VFX and the infinite amount of wallpaper-worthy images spread across the entire film. Some scenes are filled with jaw-dropping cinematography, astonishingly gorgeous monsters, and the fights feel so real that the sound design alone takes you to the edge of your seat. However, when the two pillars of any movie (story and characters) are so far away from even remotely working, there are no technically perfect aspects that can save the film from a disaster. I wrote this exact last sentence a few weeks ago regarding Game Of Thrones, and I will stand by it. I\u2019m always the first guy to praise exceptional filmmaking skills, but if I have to choose between a technically seamless movie, and a film with a fantastic story and fully-developed characters, I have no doubts that the latter is the indisputably right choice.\r\n\r\nUltimately, that\u2019s the huge problem here. The screenplay is loaded with some of the laziest exposition scenes I\u2019ve seen in the last few years. Characters continuously have some sort of presentation to explain something in a completely unpredictable conversation randomly. Generally, a movie like this always has some kind of cliche secondary characters who are either a nerdy scientist, a comic-relief guy, a duo of bantering personalities or a military general who always wants to attack something, even though everyone knows it\u2019s not the most intelligent decision. King of the Monsters has all of these types and more! More?! Seriously, Michael Dougherty and Zach Shields overstuff the narrative with so many unnecessary, useless, stereotypical characters who stretch the overall runtime and extend the periods between the massive fights, turning them into minutes of complete boredom.\r\n\r\nI yawned during a Godzilla blockbuster. Yawned. How sad is that?! I really enjoyed Gareth Edwards\u2019 2014\u2019s Godzilla. At the time, the most common complaint was that there wasn\u2019t enough Godzilla in it. Most of the characters were well-written, despite that some could have been more fleshed out. King of the Monsters is (kind of) the other way around: there are dozens of monsters and bone-crushing, titanic fights, but they literally forgot to write a captivating story with compelling characters. In the first installment, even though I also wanted more Godzilla, when he actually shows up, I was so freaking excited! Since I had to wait for the third act to watch the Titans fight, the build-up that was generated and its payoff actually made the time spent with the human characters worthy.\r\n\r\nThis sequel was doomed from the moment the characters were written. There are a lot of fight sequences, and I wrote above that unnecessary characters extend the periods between these scenes. The dilemma is that those periods need to exist, making the whole thing look like a double-edged sword that the director is trying to avoid. On one hand, you can\u2019t have an action set piece after another action set piece consecutively, otherwise, these will lose impact over time and become monotonous, so you need to spend time with the horribly-written human characters. On the other hand, you can\u2019t have dumb characters with unclear motivations on-screen for long periods, otherwise, the audience will fall asleep of tediousness or get annoyed, so you have to insert a massive fight sequence again, hence making the audience gradually lose interest in those scenes.\r\n\r\nKing of the Monsters continuously repeats this cycle of going from one situation to the other. No one wants to have back-to-back fights because they\u2019ll lose the impactful energy, but no one wants to waste their precious time listening to exposition-heavy PowerPoint presentations from characters no one is going to remember their name. I can\u2019t even remember the main characters\u2019 names, and I watched the movie yesterday! I can\u2019t blame the cast, everyone gives good performances. Millie Bobby Brown (Madison Russell) continues her path to become one of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars (in less than 10 years, she\u2019ll have an Oscar in her hands, I guarantee you that). Kyle Chandler (Mark Russell) does more than what was expected of him with such a lousy script, and Ken Watanabe (Dr. Ishiro Serizawa) is the only one who delivered a solid performance AND had a suitable character (fruit of the previous film). Vera Farmiga (Dr. Emma Russell) is connected to the worst character of the movie (atrociously irrational decisions made by Emma), and everyone else is pretty much one of the vast cliche secondary characters.\r\n\r\nThey had five years to write a straightforward narrative with simple characters. No fan neither wanted or needed a brilliant, groundbreaking screenplay. Dougherty and Shields delivered one of the worst scripts of the year, one filled with exposition, cliche characters, and a runtime that turned out to be way too long for someone to tolerate all of the dreadful dialogue. I don\u2019t know if it will clearly end up as one of the worst films of 2019, but it\u2019s definitely one of the biggest letdowns. All in all, Godzilla: King of the Monsters didn\u2019t meet my expectations (and mine were pretty fair), not even close. Visually, it\u2019s one of the most striking movies I\u2019ve seen this year, and that can\u2019t be dismissed. From the massive fights with the Titans to the impressive wide shots, Dougherty had a gorgeous diamond that he just needed to polish with a rational and simplistic story, like it was a soft, clean cloth. Instead, he used a hammer\u2026\r\n\r\nRating: C-","id":"5cf00e1e0e0a262318caefaa","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cf00e1e0e0a262318caefaa","movie_id":373571}
{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Very loud, very dumb, and very entertaining_**\r\n\r\n>_And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another. The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it. And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, \"Arise, devour much flesh.\" After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, whic__h had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it. After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns._\r\n\r\n- Daniel 7:3-7\r\n\r\n>_Behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth_ [...] _And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea_ [...] _And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, \"Who is like unto the beast? Who is able to make war with him?\"_ [...] _And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world._\r\n\r\n- Revelation 12:3-13:8\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed Gareth Edwards's 2014 _Godzilla_. Sure, there were plot holes through which you could drive an entire fleet of trains carrying nuclear weapons, it featured coincidences that stretched believability even by Hollywood's standards, the human characters were paper-thin, and it took itself very, very seriously. But I enjoyed it. As Edwards had already proved with his debut film, the superb _Monsters_ (2010) and as he would subsequently prove with _Rogue One: A Star Wars Story_ (2016), he has a knack for wedding large-scale CGI grandiosity to stories that feel contemplative and personalised. And I don't care how long this franchise may run, and how many films get churned out, Godzilla's mic-drop moment, when he holds the female MUTO's mouth open and breathes blue fire down its throat will never be topped in its \"holy shit\"-ness. Ironically enough though, what I admired most about the film is the same thing that a lot of people disliked - the fact that Edwards kept Godzilla's appearances so fleeting; it took over an hour before we first saw him, and then he got only seven minutes total screen time. Personally, I thought it was a masterclass in directorial restraint, and it had the effect that when the big final fight came, it hit home on so many levels because here, finally, we were getting to see the big guy throw down. Remember when Hulk Hogan was the WWF champion for three years running? He didn't wrestle on every show, he didn't even appear on every show. So when Wrestlemania came around, and we knew the Hulkster would be headlining, it meant more than if we'd just seen him the week prior. Same thing with _Godzilla_. However, I understand why some people were unimpressed that a film called _Godzilla_ featured so little, well, Godzilla!\r\n\r\nThe third film in Legendary Entertainment's \"MonsterVerse\" franchise, _King of the Monsters_ is a direct sequel to Edwards's film (although sadly, he doesn't return as director), and sets up Adam Wingard's _Godzilla vs. Kong_, which has already wrapped shooting, and is scheduled for release next summer. However, whereas Edwards held Godzilla back and made the action feel smaller by focalising it through the human characters, new director Michael Dougherty (_Trick 'r Treat_; _Krampus_) essentially inverts that formula, putting Godzilla front and centre for pretty much the entire runtime (there are four big fight scenes within the first half-hour alone), and shooting the action in such a way as to make it seem as grandiose as possible. Indeed, he told Collider, \"_I would call it the_ Aliens _to Gareth's_ Alien.\" And although Dougherty isn't half the director that Edwards is, _King of the Monsters_ works pretty well in a braindead summer action movie that's wall-to-wall giant monsters fighting one another kind of way. Sure, there are significant problems (all the best shots are in the trailer, the plot is beyond laughable, the characters are so thinly sketched as to make those in the first film feel Shakespearean, clich\u00e9s abound, the talented cast is wasted), but all things considered, I enjoyed it, as it accomplished exactly what it set out to accomplish, and you really can't fault a film for succeeding at its primary objective.\r\n\r\nFive years since Godzilla defeated the MUTOs, many more creatures (newly dubbed Titans) have been found throughout the world, all in various forms of hibernation. In charge of studying and protecting them is the private company Monarch Sciences (introduced in a fledgeling state in Jordan Vogt-Roberts's _Kong: Skull Island_, which took place in 1973). As the film begins, Monarch employees Dr. Ishir\u00f4 Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Dr. Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins), both returning from the previous film, are attempting to convince the Senate that under no circumstances should control of the Titans be turned over to the military, something with which Admiral William Stenz (the great David Strathairn, also returning from the first film) strongly disagrees. Meanwhile, in China, paleobiologist Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) watch the awakening of the larval form of Mothra. However, when Mothra becomes distressed, Emma is able to calm it using the ORCA, a device which monitors the Titans' bioacoustics and transmits a dominant \"alpha signal\" capable of placating them. Soon thereafter, eco-terrorist Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) and his private army storm the facility, stealing the ORCA, and kidnapping Emma and Madison. In response, Monarch track down Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), Emma's estranged husband, and co-designer of the ORCA, hoping he might be able to help find Jonah. Mark and Emma lost a son in San Francisco during the fight between Godzilla and the MUTOs, and whereas Emma came to feel the Titans could help humanity, Mark became convinced they should all be eradicated. Meanwhile, Jonah heads to the Monarch facility in Antarctica and unleashes the only non-terrestrial Titan, a fearsome three-headed dragon codenamed \"Monster Zero\", but whom ancient humans knew as King Ghidorah. Arguing that humanity has brought the planet to the point of destruction, Jonah believes that if the Titans are awoken, the ensuing conflict would wipe out most of human civilisation, allowing the planet the time it needs to heal. And so, with Ghidorah awakening the various Titans throughout the world, Godzilla emerges to stand against him.\r\n\r\nWith production wrapping on _King of the Monsters_ in 2017, and with two release dates scrapped, the film was beginning to accrue some pretty bad buzz. Then that magisterial first trailer dropped, showing Mothra spanning her glorious wings scored with a remix of Claude Debussy's \"Clair de Lune\" from _Suite bergamasque_ (1890) and promising a film of pensive apocalyptic goings-on. It was the sort of trailer to turn even the biggest naysayer around. The good news is that all the best bits from the trailer are in the film. The bad news is that most of the best bits from the film are in the trailer.\r\n\r\nGodzilla was originally created by Tomoyuki Tanaka, Ishir\u00f4 Honda, and Eiji Tsuburaya, and first seen on screen in 1954's _Gojira_ (released in North America in 1956 as _Godzilla, King of the Monsters!_, a reedited version of the original with additional scenes and new actors). Over the last six decades, he has appeared in all manner of films and TV shows, from action flicks to eco-metaphors to kid's cartoons to comedy to whatever the hell Roland Emmerich's 1998 version was. Conceived in the wake of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru incident, Godzilla was intended as a metaphor for the destructive power of nuclear weaponry. Thematically speaking, the highpoint of the \"Kaiju\" (Japanese for \"strange beast\") genre thus far is probably Hideaki Anno's _Shin Gojira_ (2016), which was a political satire inspired by the Japanese government's response to the 2011 T\u00f4hoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident.\r\n\r\n_King of the Monsters_ has one eye on its themes too (a dire warning of oncoming eco-disaster, biodiversity, co-existence with other species, military impulsiveness, the insignificance of humanity compared to the vastness of nature), but really, the sermonising, exposition-heavy script by Dougherty and Zach Shields, from a story by Max Borenstein, is so badly put together, with the characters' motivations so poorly delineated, that any thematic concerns dissipate into nothing. Part of this is that the narrative simplifies Godzilla's 'morality'. Traditionally, Godzilla is inherently benevolent. However, in the 2014 version, Edwards muddied this concept brilliantly, depicting a monster that was fairly indifferent to humanity and was far more concerned with the biological drive to reassert his alpha status. In _King of the Monsters_, both Godzilla and Mothra are fundamentally good, and they wish to protect humanity from Ghidorah, which is more binary and not nearly as interesting a position to take.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, the film does address the fact that through inattention and greed, humanity is on the brink of ensuring its own extinction. Jonah, of course, believes that giving the earth back to the Titans is all humanity deserves, and is exactly what the planet needs (it's revealed early in the film that the Titans leave behind biomatter which results in the rapid growth of vegetation). For her part, Emma compares humanity to a virus, and the Titans to a \"fever\" that could eradicate it. Elsewhere, obviously with one eye on the issue of American isolationism under Trump, as well as the unstable geopolitical situation, Serizawa states, \"_sometimes, the only way to heal a wound is to make peace with the demon who caused it_\". The problem with all of this is that the script is so ham-fisted and poorly structured, the eco themes so preachy, and the organic integration of those themes into the action so lacking, that they come across as background irrelevancies at best, and distracting moralising at worst. And in any case, the film ultimately undermines all of this in favour of reaffirming the clich\u00e9d old notion of human perseverance in the face of adversity.\r\n\r\nAs we're discussing the script, another problem is repetition. For example, on several occasions, Godzilla is getting his ass handed to him, only to make an 'unexpected' comeback, whilst not one, not two, but three characters sacrifice themselves for the greater good (all at different times), resulting in none of the sacrifices really meaning anything. There are also some hideous clich\u00e9s. At one point, on their flagship the ARGO, the Monarch people are listening to Godzilla's heartbeat, which is becoming weaker and weaker, and Dr. Rick Stanton (a criminally underused Bradley Whitford) implores, all earnest-like, \"_c'mon big guy_.\" It's supposed to be a moment of great pathos, tapping into the audience's empathy for Godzilla. Instead, at the screening I attended, everyone laughed, so clunky and self-serious was the moment. \r\n\r\nAnother scene that doesn't work, although in a completely different way, is the death of a major character; it happens so suddenly, amidst so much chaos, with the camera not even focused on them, that in the very next scene, the film has to show us their face on a monitor with the word \"Deceased\" written underneath. Not exactly the best way to handle a major death. There's also a (predictable) twist based on what could charitably be called ill-defined character motivations. The character of Mark is also peculiarly written. Played by the top-billed Kyle Chandler, he has precious little to do for most of the film other than look at monitors with a concerned expression, coming off more as a fed-up dad than the protagonist of a Kaiju film. There are also far too many scenes of characters standing on the bridge of the ARGO, spouting expositional word-dumps at one another, oftentimes even narrating their motivations. In any case, not a single character in the film comes across as three-dimensional, with not a hint of interiority amongst the lot of them. Additionally, because the scale of the fights is so massive, and the humans so poorly written, Dougherty is unable to make the characters seem even remotely significant. This was another area where Edwards did well, marrying the spectacle with smaller human drama, but Dougherty allows the spectacle to overwhelm everything else.\r\n\r\nThere are also some hilarious spatial hijinks going on. I get that the ARGO is supposed to be a super-advanced high-tech mobile fortress, but it seems capable of flying from one side of the planet to the other in about ten minutes. From Colorado to China to Bermuda to Antarctica to Mexico to Massachusetts, unless the ARGO is capable of transportation, there's some _Game of Thrones_-level compression of distances going on. Related to this is that Zhang Ziyi plays twins (Dr. Ilene Chen and Dr. Ling Chen), who we never see together. Except I didn't even realise there were two of them until I read a few reviews. Sure, I noticed what I thought was a singular character appear to be in two places at once, but because the ARGO had already been globe-hopping all over the place by that point, I just put it down to the film's lack of geographic realism. The fact that it's so easy to miss that there are twins is spectacularly bad writing, especially considering they're supposed to be a modernised version of the Shobijin, two fairies that speak for Mothra. Also, Aisha Hinds as Colonel Diane Foster, O'Shea Jackson Jr. as Chief Warrant Officer Jackson Barnes, and Thomas Middleditch as Dr. Sam Coleman may as well not be in the film at all, so little are they given to do. The same could be said for most of the Titans. Apart from the central tag-teams of Godzilla and Mothra facing off against Ghidorah and Rodan, most of the rest (including those newly created for the film - Baphomet, Typhon, Abaddon, Bunyip, and Methuselah) are seen only in news reports and a montage that plays behind the closing credits, although a few do turn up for one scene.\r\n\r\nBut for all that, however, I thoroughly enjoyed _King of the Monsters_. Although the trailer does promise what the film can't deliver, aesthetically, there's a lot to admire. The sound design by Erik Aadahl (_I, Robot_; _The Tree of Life_; _A Quiet Place_) Brandon Jones (_13 Hours_; _The Shallows_), and Tim Walston (_The Incredible Hulk_; _Pacific Rim_; _Chronicle_) is suitably deafening, and the cinematography by Lawrence Sher (_The Hangover_; _War Dogs_; _Joker_) has a well-judged sense of scale, especially in the 2.39:1 3D IMAX format. This is complemented by the editing by Roger Barton (_Gone in 60 Seconds_; _Pearl Harbor_; _The Grey_), Bob Ducsay (_Season of the Witch_; _Looper_; _Rampage_), and Richard Pearson (_The Bourne Supremacy_; _Quantum of Solace_; _Iron Man 2_), who maintain the rhythm of even the most chaotic action scenes. And even though pretty much the entire film takes place at night in the midst of a storm of the Titans' own making, it never becomes difficult to follow or see what's happening. \r\n\r\nThe film also does some interesting things with colour. Whereas the palette is predominantly mixed when we're with the human characters, the Titans are coded in binary elemental colours: Mothra glows blue as a larva and gold in her final form, Rodan reflects the hardened red of the lava from which he emerges, Godzilla is the green of nature, Ghidorah is a neutralising dark brown. There are also some extraordinary individual shots (most of which have unfortunately been spoiled by the trailer); Mothra spreading her wings for the first time, Ghidorah perched atop an erupting volcano with a crucifix looming in the foreground, the reveal of Godzilla's lair. And the final shot is a goosebumps moment with which no Kaiju fan could possibly be dissatisfied. Purely at the level of craft, this is a hugely impressive film.\r\n\r\n_Citizen Kane_ it most certainly isn't, but who expected (or wanted) it to be. The key to really parsing the film is to consider the context, looking at what it was trying to be. And in this sense, it's a success. Sure, the script is hideous, and Dougherty is no Edwards, struggling to accomplish what Edwards seemed to do with ease; bring his own personality to the spectacle. However, if you approach it for what it is, a dumb summer blockbuster about large monsters punching each other, you'll like it just fine.","id":"5d782b6d39549a001097184a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d782b6d39549a001097184a","movie_id":373571}

From having to score drugs to selling a sex doll, these kids get into all kinds of ridiculous hijinks that provide only a mild laugh now and again.\r\n\r\nMy main problem here is the rehash. Why? \"Superbad\" is a far superior movie, probably because of the knowledge the characters bring to the table. These kids know next to nothing about the world, a fact that's played up to a maximum extent time and again. By the end of the movie, I was ready to throw my hands up in the air saying \"Alright! I get it already.\" And the characters don't really develop to a significant extent. They remain just as naive at the end of the movie as they were at the beginning.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we wind up not just with a rehash of \"Superbad\" but a rather stagnant one at that. It can be cute at times, but overall we learn nothing along with the characters and our lives are not richer for having seen this movie. It's a cute diversion, but nothing else. Take it for what it is, or don't. My recommendation is that if you have anything else to see, you're probably better off seeing that instead.","id":"5dd9c62b3faba00015fcb2ee","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dd9c62b3faba00015fcb2ee","movie_id":521777}

For whatever reason I pretty consistently find it genuinely funny. Probably says more about me than it does about _Good Boys_, but whatever, it's fine. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._","id":"5e0956455aadc400122eaaa7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e0956455aadc400122eaaa7","movie_id":521777}
