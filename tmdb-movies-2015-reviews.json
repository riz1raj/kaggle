{"author":"Reno","content":"**Influential of surroundings on one's character development.**\r\n\r\nIt was a bit surprise film, because I did not get the film plot in the beginning. I did not know it was about gay. Well, it was not entirely on that theme, but comes there after so many turns in the tale. So this is a coming-of-age and to discover sexuality theme. Also very neatly points out how a person develops his character by the influence of his surroundings. Even if it all begins with a small mistake or playful thing, in that small age, it all looks very serious, especially a character like in this film.\r\n\r\nDespite it was a cinematic, that might be true in real life. The parents as well influence their kids to grow up in a better path. So parenting fail too was highlighted in here. It was unfortunate how the father character was turned out at the end. That is the moment I could not decide whom I'm rooting for. It was like, seemed nobody's fault, but out of the guilt and frustration, emotion bursts out and things happen which is what this film focused on.\r\n\r\nGood performances, a well shot film. One of the nice LGBT films I've seen. Only on the reality side, it worked, but not as an inspiration. Though one can consider it an awareness film. I feel it should be watched, but not as a must see. Because of so many issues it centres, like a boy growing up facing them, what he becomes was revealed in its message. I think it's good for watching once.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"590124a4c3a36810d7002a73","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/590124a4c3a36810d7002a73","movie_id":353728}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> He's obviously the same person, but his intentions are?\r\n\r\nI enjoyed the director's previous works like 'Combat Girls' and 'Wetlands'. Those were young women oriented subjects, yet filled with sensitive topics. But now he turned his focus towards the screen adaptation of a bestselling satirical novel of the same name about Adolf Hitler. Well, this is not his best work, not a bad movie either.\r\n\r\nQuite fun to watch, but not logical, especially the basic ones. Since it mocks a most hated person in the human history, there's no issues on portraying him in whatever angle they wanted, because nobody cares. Yet the film talked some serious current issues of Germany.\r\n\r\nThis is like when 'Borat' meets 'The Dictator'. A man who wanders around a city looking for some answers. That's none other than Adolf Hitler, who wakes up in the middle of where some young kids showing their football skills for a tv programme. Then he embarks to learn where he's and what year it is. Meets a person who helps him and ultimately end up with some tv guy where they begin their journey throughout the nation making videos before landing in an actual tv show. The man who killed millions of people wants the best for Germany and its people, how he turn things around were narrated in a quite interesting perspective.\r\n\r\nThe initial narratives were like the aimless, that tells us what people think of the Adolf Hitler's return. Looked like most of them were shot like a documentary style, outside the official shooting spots. You can see lots of real people's faces were censored. We know that he wanted to be an artist, but he draws some funny sketches in this. Likewise there are many scenes about his qualities that were dragged in to make fun out of it.\r\n\r\nCan people accept the words of one who is considered a villain. He came from a different timeline, but he quickly absorbs the situation and gives some important tips that should come into force. From the common people's perspective, it is an entertaining product, but from the political viewpoint, there are stuffs to consider severely about.\r\n\r\n> \"When you have rats at home, it is called not a clown but an exterminator.\"\r\n\r\nTo me there's nothing controversial about this theme. When he failed, the final pages of his history book were written by his enemies. Otherwise, there's no difference between him, Alexander and Genghis Khan. Every greatest kings who ever lived on the earth dreamed of conquering the world.\r\n\r\nI think the present world is same, except the form of conquering is changed, like some want to rule the world with their strong economy like the US and some are on their cheap industrial products like China. Like that all the other nations are on the top of the chart with something in what they're good at.\r\n\r\nAdolf Hitler was a politician, not a king, but he had his reasons for his actions. So if we go by the rule books, nothing seems rational. To me this film was a decent entertainer, I just wanted to enjoy what it offers and I think I did. I advise the same that you should not mix up this with the reality. Because that might take us to the unwanted territory.\r\n\r\nHe's the same person who came from the past, but I was keen to know his intentions, especially what the writer intended to draw out of him. Because he's alone, not with his army, so he had no power, but his interaction with people brings up some discussable topics. I'm not a German, but it made me think when he spoke about current issues that Germany is facing. Every nation has to think about its internal affairs to improve it, you can't live forever with the past shame.\r\n\r\nThis film might be a comedy, but you can't ignore some of the points the main character talks. I felt the movie was a double strike where people can have some laughs and in other side to learn the reality of the state. This the best satirical film about Adolf Hitler I've seen after the Charles Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator'.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"570fc615c3a3684ff1001c62","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/570fc615c3a3684ff1001c62","movie_id":318917}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A family in the grief, at a different level.\r\n\r\nA multi-nationally produced film, especially you can call it a European product, but an English language film that takes place in the New York. The story of a husband and two sons of the famed war photographer who recently died in a car crash. So the film is focused to tell how they are going to cope with their loss, especially the little brother who has differences with his father. They all kind of drifted away from each other, but without an alternate they have to come together to go through it.\r\n\r\nThis is not a usual mourning theme, but sometimes I felt they forgot they're in mourning. Because the narration quickly shifts to various topics like the birth of a child, a new affair and trying to impress the girl whom the boy has a crush. So with all this, I completely witnessed a different type of film than what it had said. That's not bad, just a refreshing and with constant moving back and forth in in time to disclose some key events.\r\n\r\nMainly the portrayal splits into three to cover those three family members and each has its own specialty. Something like a film for older people, middle-aged and teens, all the these contents smartly joined together. Apart from the good show from the cast, the director did his best as usual, but this is not up to the par with his other works. For a watch this film definitely would do good. Since it's not a Hollywood, you won't have to worry about American film clich\u00e9s, because it was developed much better and ends better.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"57c8b2ec92514148e0000aad","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c8b2ec92514148e0000aad","movie_id":157827}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The story that was narrated backwards!**\r\n\r\nThis was from the director of 'Irreversible'. This story was told in backwards. It opened with a married couple having sexual intercourse and after a phone call, the flashback rolls. Which begins from that point of the story where it stands to where it all began as per the film character who recalls all the events. Actually, it was impressive idea, not that reverse way storytelling, but how the characters were drawn. And then the story was very simple, like the film '9\u00bd Weeks', the drama and the sex parts shared the remaining narration alternatively for like every 10-15 minutes.\r\n\r\nI wanted to like it, but not convinced with the blend between both the drama and sex scenes. They should have developed and blended them together better. Especially since the storytelling was reversified, one of the major plot holes is not solved or revealing what could have happened to that particular character on which this plot was developed. If you are not concerned about the storyline and looking for adult contents as in a film, not as a better porn film, then you might enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThe other major issue was the length. Two hours long for an adult film means teasing and testing your patience. It should have been under 90 minutes, that would have speeded it up a bit. The actors were decent. The film poster was so hot, it will drag you to watch this film. But I would say not to expect big, either adult stuffs or from the dramatic segments. Within its frame, it delivered, but for me it was an average and a little below.\r\n\r\n_4.5\/10_","id":"5887db46c3a36859e0004612","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5887db46c3a36859e0004612","movie_id":292431}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> It gets closer to the legend's personal life.\r\n\r\nA few movies about Yip Man were made in the past, but Donnie Yen's 2008 version rewrote the history. Because the craze about martial arts in the last two decades and of course digital world made it to reach every corner of the world. Followed by a sequel and its massive hit, then came many unofficial versions to this series that set in a different timeline of the martial art legend's life.\r\n\r\nWith this movie, the narration gets lots closer to tell the personal life of Yip Man. But in the first half, like the previous two films, focused on the social issue. Yip Man is fighting for the children's education, when a real estate tycoon plans to replace the school building to a commercial complex. That's it, later the story begins to take us to the random events like a man who's hungry for the best fighter in the town title who end up challenging Yip Man to face him. From there, it's all about Yip Man and his ill wife where the movie switches from action mode to sentimental.\r\n\r\nThat's not what we expected from a man who's famous for his martial art. Surprisingly, this different approach in storytelling was refreshing. Saving school, the clash for the title and ill wife, so the overall movie was like had three episodes and each dealt on a different motive. Being a biopic and also a martial art movie, it exploited the theme fairly.\r\n\r\nI can't say Mike Tyson's acting was so good because it was weird him to speak Cantonese. He was in a minor role, but his presence was a big boost for the movie. If we see him in an action movie, then we all know what to expect and it did not fail to fulfill our wish.\r\n\r\n> \"There's nothing more important than the love of those by your side.\"\r\n\r\nThe stunts were not as good as the previous two films and they were too short as well, but technically looked so perfect, especially locking horns between Tyson and Donnie Yen was like head-to-head confrontation between Hollywood and Hong Kong. The other reason to shorten stunts in the movie was to get closer to the legend's personal life. After the survival and fighting the foreign forces, now the time to focus on his own life issues.\r\n\r\nThe first two films were breathtaking, no one can doubt that. I don't know why it took so long for this third movie, but it still worked. Yet not the best in the trilogy, but remained very close to them with unlike storyline and action sequences. I was disappointed for not continuing from where it ended in the 2nd part. I mean the story has a clean flow, but not what I expected, like, I wanted Bruce Lee and the grand-master coming together.\r\n\r\nActually, I never expected the third installment, I considered it was one of the best duologies you could find in world cinema. But I'm happy they made this one and I'm very much sure there will be fourth. So at least I can expect the Bruce Lee's part in the Yip Man's life story. I was waiting for that from a very long and I believe it won't let me down this time. All the above, I'm looking for the official announcement.\r\n\r\n7\u00bd\/10","id":"56f3f2b19251410e640007b0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56f3f2b19251410e640007b0","movie_id":365222}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> What matters here is the message... If you won't mind anything else.\r\n\r\nI am a film fanatic, so like everybody else I seek entertainment in the films I watch. But if it delivers a message or gives a lesson, I'll take it as an inspiration, no matter what category it belongs to.\r\n\r\nI mean I belong to no religion, but there are many good things about them other than wasting time in the temples and churches for the fantasy things. So that is where this film comes in, even for the non-believers.\r\n\r\nIt might be about a Mormon related theme, that does not mean it is a propaganda or anything, but obviously that's how it looks like. In fact, it is a very enjoyable film, not just for the kids or the women, but anyone and mostly for the families.\r\n\r\nBecause it was not about the god stuff, it was about the human bond and having faith in each other to work together. In many parts, that's what the film characters express through the dialogues and makes us comfortable for further viewing.\r\n\r\nThe story was narrated from an atheist teen girl's perspective, but her condition of life had an impact for telling a beautiful and semi-emotional tale. It was a quality of the television product, mainly because it is PG rated.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful cast and shot in the nicest places. So just enjoy its contents as a human being with the emotions and ignore the religious stuffs if you think it is overshadowed by that. Because, because of watching it you won't turn a Mormon in an overnight.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"5752eb0492514166f5002a9d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5752eb0492514166f5002a9d","movie_id":339928}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Jumper: There and back again.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of similar themes, but 'Jumper' will be the first anyone can remember. Its not a time travel theme, but a space travel film. Don't assume the outer space, very much in our Earth's atmosphere space travel like a supernatural.\r\n\r\nThis is a slow fantasy-drama about two teen siblings who are living in an isolated location and their inherited ability to cheat space within their sight. What goes wrong when they just want to play with it, but it's forbidden by their strict father is the rest of the story.\r\n\r\nIt is a weakest writing for a movie that borrowed an idea from the others. Failed to capitalise and falls into an average list. There is no particular performance to point out, but Kiernan Shipka is who had more screenspace and was decent with her show.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing much to talk about the movie, the dialogues were very rare and too short. A simple drama, mostly boring for its uninteresting under developed scenes. Surely a watchable movie, but does it worth spending your time? I don't think so, thankfully it was not the worst film I've ever seen.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"56d9a275c3a3681e440256df","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56d9a275c3a3681e440256df","movie_id":323435}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Some discoveries come at the last hours of the life.\r\n\r\nWhen a movie is based on the play, setting wise it will be a tight narration. But the advantage is, movies can expand its screenplay in the natural world where stage plays has a limitation with the fake backgrounds. And obviously movies can reach any corner of the earth in the todays digital world while plays are for a limited live audience. So I think that is how this play turned into a motion picture, importantly, it was funded by the government and all the above it won a couple of Australian Academy Awards.\r\n\r\nIt was a cancer themed thin comedy-drama with a little road adventure in the backdrop. A story that follows a 70-year-old cab driver Rex from Broken Hill. He has never been outside his town until he finds he has a cancer, so he takes a 3000 kilometer drive to Darwin looking for a doctor who can help him with his suffering. At the dusk hours of his life, he encounters some strangers and many stuffs for the first time. So this film is all about his final and best experience in the end of the life journey.\r\n\r\nI like sentimental films, I chose it because I haven't felt the emotions through my heart for a movie in the recent time. I expected it to fulfill my desire, but it only fell short. To me it was a decent movie in the first half, but it got better in the next half. The opening was kind of slow and dry, the cast was totally unfamiliar to me. I needed time to get used to a sudden change of accent after watching so many Hollywood flicks. Because you know we don't watch Aussie movies everyday and so the style of comedies differs with the different region.\r\n\r\n> \"You want everything to be black and white, but it's not. It's gray.\"\r\n\r\nThe best thing ever happened was the introduction of the characters Tilly and Julie. One is an aboriginal and the other is a British who joins Rex, the Aussie. They are the main source for the story to grow in the right direction. Because of them the narration had a subplot to focus their perspectives as well. Without them definitely it would have been a worthless flick.\r\n\r\nThe end was not at its best. It hat many options, but they decided to finish it in an uncertain manner. Since it was a road movie, I also anticipated exhibition of beautiful Australian landscapes, that never came. I understand they don't want distraction from the main plot, because this was one of those films that took time for the characters to settle down. Even though it approaches the conclusion, the characters had kept deepening in its development.\r\n\r\nMy upset with the movie was, it was a quite different from the usual cancer films. Precisely to say, it was very weak in the exhibition of character feelings. Certainly it won't make you weep. Just like one of the lines at the beginning that says 'everyone gets cancer', the movie was too casual like this is a regular thing. But the scenario where the story sets in and takes us with it was exceptional. I have a hesitation to recommend it, but it is a good movie if you're okay with the thing I expressed which are lacking.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd\/10","id":"56c09ed292514170aa005e40","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56c09ed292514170aa005e40","movie_id":337958}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Seeking help from a crazy person.**\r\n\r\nWhen you see this film poster, that gives an impression of it is some kind of a B movie from the Hollywood. Yes, if it was from the United States, but this is a Georgian film that dominated by English dialogues. Because it is a tale of three young American tourists and theirs unexpected little revenge game that emerges in an unexpected circumstance. Very thrilling, despite it was stretched too much, especially towards the conclusion.\r\n\r\nIt is a similar theme to those like 'I Spit on Your Grave' and 'The Last House on the Left'. So this film does not suit everybody, this is particularly for the adults. You know the psycho character makes uneasy for some viewers like families. I don't know why one should watch it, whether for an entertainment or pleasure from the tortures. Anyway, my anticipation was nothing, because I did not know what kind of film is this. But saw it and I think it is an okay type, particularly being made in and by a Georgian.\r\n\r\nSo when the three American tourists end up camping in a remote place, one of them learns that his girlfriend cheated on him. As a revenge act, he sets up his friend in a landmine and leaves behind along with his girlfriend. How those two struggles to escape from unhurt or whether is it a possible to attempt is the event that follows. The remaining narration is focused to tell when an unexpected help comes their way and from there where it takes us is a little suspense before the finale commence.\r\n\r\n> \"This Georgian hospitality is wonderful. In the States you'd be lucky for somebody to even open the door.\"\r\n\r\nDon't expect it something like 'Kajaki'. But it is the same category film and I liked how a small film like this was improvised its screenplay decently. At a same time, the doubts arise as is it really possible or would it happen in the real world? Who knows what kind of a crazy person is wandering around us, especially in a remote place like in this film. But the film comes to the point by revealing all the event carefully. I mean there's only two events, but how they are developed. Especially the end was expected, but still leaves behind a message how worthy the vengeance is.\r\n\r\nSince I don't know the cast and crew, it is natural to anticipate a good story over the actors and their character displays. Particularly one of the main characters, the American one looked alike Aaron Paul. No need a source to learn it is a low budget film, but I liked the production quality. I had seen lots of foreign film, I don't recall that I ever saw a Georgian film before.\r\n\r\nSeems they are not popular in the international arena, so a small film like this is a lot if it reaches the global audience in any platform, even it does not meet the success they were expecting. Just a simple recognition is what worth a lot for them to grow and I think this film did that. Especially for being an English language film is the reason. Even many European film industries doing the same, like making an English language film occasionally.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in a crime-thriller, you should try this. But I warn you, it is not a Hollywood or a Korean, but still an acceptable for where it comes from. So like I mentioned in the very first paragraph, don't expect too much after seeing its poster. It is a different film, but also there are many tense scenes if you are focused enough to understand the situation in the story. I've mixed feeling while suggesting it, so I won't do that and I can't declare it is one of the worst either. If you get a chance you should try, otherwise don't bother.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"581cf407c3a3681d76001296","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/581cf407c3a3681d76001296","movie_id":329556}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> When the knights rise after the fall of their master.\r\n\r\nI had a feeling that I know this story from somewhere else like a deja-vu, but more than that I felt it should have been a ninja story than the knight's. So when I checked the crew list and I found the Japanese director who made 'Goemon'. That's not at all, it was indeed a version of the Japanese classical hit 'The Loyal 47 Ronin'. Honestly, I haven't seen that, but have seen the other versions like the Keanu Reeve's recent '47 Ronon' et cetera.\r\n\r\nIt was the story of a group of knights led by Raiden played by Clive Owen. After their master was tricked to death by a corrupted minister in the court of law, everyone thinks the knights would avenge for it. But that does not happen and as the years pass, slowly the hope fades away. And then comes a twist with some good action sequences before the end credits roll up.\r\n\r\nIt was a great story, but the transforming it from a ninja tale to a knight's did not give that solid revenge seeking effect. Because the ninja fights are kind of stylish, because the stunt choreography and costumes for ninjas has changed in the present scenario. Whereas the knight's remained same for the decades, that means it was a very normal like a medieval European sword fight. So you can call it a realistic, yet there's a filmy thing which lacks in it.\r\n\r\nThat's fine because the entire film was almost a slow drama. So don't assume it is a complete action film. In that perspective, it will definitely disappoint a few viewers, but I think it is still worth giving a try. The cast and the production were awesome, but still there's something is holding back it to the B movies list than an A. And finally, seeing the way it ended, I think there will be another film to follow.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"574374dac3a3685c3200004b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/574374dac3a3685c3200004b","movie_id":308504}
{"author":"slayrrr666","content":"Having survived a brutal serial killer, a woman attempts to get back to her daily life and routine with a set of friends from her work to help her get through it only for her beliefs that he\u2019s still hunting her to force her into extreme actions to save her friends from the killer.\r\n\r\nThis was quite an intriguing and enjoyable take on the slasher formula. One of the film\u2019s best features is the fact that there\u2019s quite an original and intriguing storyline here that answers a rather important question not many really have answered. One of the more believable aspects here is that this one explores the idea of a tormented and traumatized survivor which makes for a really interesting storyline about her abilities to cope with the situation and how it has now impacted her life, an idea that really needed exploring and features some rather novel ideas about what happens afterward. Her paranoia and delusions about what\u2019s happened manifests in not only the extreme isolation in her life but also plenty of rather nice freak-outs about whether or not he\u2019s really come back including the scenes of her at the laundromat or hanging out with them at the bar when he appears to her which all showcase the  extreme lengths she\u2019s fallen to in her current state. Aside from this, there\u2019s still plenty to enjoy here with the film\u2019s rather stylish action, which starts with the concluding moments of the chase at the beginning which signals the start of her condition out in the woods where she finds the bodies of her friends and has to deal with the killer attacking her in order to get away, the few freak-outs she has while at her work with the thought of the killer attacking her as well as the scenes of them at the art gallery where it\u2019s proven that she was psychotic all along and goes after them in the gallery which has some solid stalking and slashing that\u2019s really nice and brutal. These here are quite nice enough although it is somewhat troubled. The biggest issue is that for the most part, this one doesn\u2019t really play like a true horror film rather than anything else. This one is really more of a character drama more than a horror film so for nearly all the movies\u2019 running time it doesn\u2019t do much of anything throughout here and seems to be a character study that doesn\u2019t contain all that much action at all. This isn\u2019t a huge detriment but it\u2019s more of one for those that like more traditional fare rather than this one.\r\n\r\nRated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.","id":"58be083a9251413435007440","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58be083a9251413435007440","movie_id":347848}

Especially Cola, the man who made the instruments. Like some other low-budgeted documentaries, perhaps too much is crammed into the running time(in this case more than 85 mins. was needed) and becomes disjointed or a side note without depth on occasion but that's also the beauty of independent documentary film making, it goes it's own way. An unlikely opportunity for the children to say the least and a stark contrast to the reality of life in Cateura.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Teen POWs in the post WWII Denmark.\r\n\r\nA Danish war-drama that was inspired by the historical account, but all the characters were fictional. Remember this title for another six month, because I am confident this film will make a journey to the west coast of the USA to compete at the 89th Academy Awards in the coming February. I have seen many foreign films, but I'm not this much positive for any others. If this film fails to make, then that would be a great disappointment despite having no idea of what are the other four films. So this is just for now, my stance may change later.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the film was heartbreakingly amazing. The WWII stories I had seen those told from the perspectives of the Australian, Japanese, Korean, Russian to African and European to the American western sea, Hawaii. And this is a Danish story, sets in just after the end of the war where prisoners of the war were used to clean up the mess. In the opening the teen German POWs were trained to defuse the land mine explosives and then later the unit was handed over to the Danish sergeant Carl Rasmussen where they are all going to work in one of the west coast landmines that was used to defend the Scandinavia by the Nazi. That is the story told how it all ends in the remaining parts.\r\n\r\nThis was like another 'Kajaki', but not actually a war film. Using of the prisoners as the labourers is a violation, according to the Geneva rule. That's the point of the film, focused to reveal the inhume act. But it was not anything like 'The Railway Man' 'Unbroken' or the 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'. Watching a film about the brave soldiers inspires us and bring patriotism, but in this those teen kid screaming whenever something goes wrong really brings heartache. So not everybody feels comfortable with it, especially the family audience. But there were lots of edgy moments and you would never know what events follows.\r\n\r\n\"If they are old enough to go to war, they are old enough to clean up.\"\r\n\r\nIt was shot is the real location, and I think that part contributed to depicting the actual atmosphere where most of the POWs lost their arms and legs and some exploded into many pieces in the air. It was a simple narration, but the visuals talked itself more than anything else. All the actors were outstanding, especially those 4-5 German teens and of course the Danish sergeant Carl. I think the Carl's influence had more impact, after seeing the opening scene where he went outrage and beat up those German soldiers returning home.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of small twists, but there are some scenes which are not easy to get over. Even though we know those were just fake, but that does not work once you totally into the story deeply. This is a different kind of emotional film, something you rarely experience. The director who is also the writer must be appreciated for handling it perfectly. Especially keeping the screenplay uncomplicated and between the two nations, where in the real event involves the British officials. I have never seen his other films, but this one will define him forth and the people are going to recognise him. So I hope he'll keep up doing such level films in the future.\r\n\r\nI have never seen such film, I mean seen some where the kids were tortured, but this was very unique and totally a different perspective for that takes place in the backdrop of the WWII. Especially the Germans perspective is the very rare kind. So I'm kind of thinking if Germany picks 'Look Who's Back' for the Oscars, the contest between these two would bring two different moods. At this point I don't remember any Danish film I have seen so far in my life other than this one which I feel is the best Danish film ever. I mean, come on, who would do such film where your own nation, if not the whole nation, the one who represent was shown in the negative shade over the Nazi Germans. This is definitely one of the best films of the year. Highly recommended.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"57c8b872c3a3685c00000d84","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c8b872c3a3685c00000d84","movie_id":335578}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Not far from losing the birthplace of human civilisation.**\r\n\r\nNot everybody's pick of the year. Everybody does not know this film even exist. This is the director's ambitious project, to depict on the screen the world he had come from. So it is much an awareness film about struggling rural society. Usually critics favour this kind of film. But not to be watched for the entertainment purpose. Surely you will be bored to death. This is a challenging film to watch that tests your patience. Even I had a slight trouble finish watching it, but at the end I'm satisfied for it is what it is.\r\n\r\nAverage film's runtime, so if you have been focused since the beginning, particularly without any interference, then that's good. You will get the characters and their condition, which is most important in this film. There's no complication to understand it. It is a simple story, but very realistic portrayal like a documentary film without any background commentary. Centres on the falling rural economy and how people are coping with it. I think this is a very essential film for todays people from big cities to understand the situation of the other side of the human civilisation.\r\n\r\nThe film does not focus on entire village, but follows a small family. It is a place where they all depended on the sugar cane that grown in the field. And it is about a harvest season, everybody's working hard, but not paid enough for their effort. A man who had left the place and family behind a long ago returns. The purpose of the visit is his son who is very sick. So from his perspective the film reveals why he had left the place and the trouble the villagers facing, economically as well as environmentally.\r\n\r\n> \u275dI couldn't stay here and see all of this disappear before my very eyes.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe message was loud and clear. The film does not simply shows sympathy, but falling apart countryside due to multiple issues including poverty and pollution. There's no separately layered narration to highlight them, but the family this story is based on revolves around most of those matters. I would say, it was a good writing, keeping in order and going after big topic. The director did a wonderful job. I would also say watching a film like this is definitely not a waste of time. But how far it reaches and people come to realise will be a big question. Because such small films are easily ignored globally.\r\n\r\nWhen we discuss about harming the environment, it is always cities and industries are blamed. But the truth is every corner of the earth where humans have settled down is causing the disruption in the order of nature. This film is one of the good examples of getting rid of clich\u00e9 in such theme and trying to be honest. The amount of disturbance in nature might be less, but the outcome is the same. I think such film should be recognised in the bigger platforms. This is the age we live in where awareness needed about the awareness films. What we have become.\r\n\r\nA heartbreaking family tale, as well as their concerned environment, the film covered two topics so brilliantly. Well performed actors and I liked the locations. Even though the places are polluted, especially during the harvest, such quietness is very relaxing. I do remember in my childhood during visiting grandparents in their village, sitting lazily after having a lunch under the shades of a tree on a hot summer day was so cool experience. Now we're losing that, and I think that's the closest what this title means. The final frontier, the edge of world where humans and nature meets. Like I said the film is not for everyone, watching capacity wise, but its concern everybody. If you are okay with slow pace narration, then you should try it.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"591b5fedc3a36840aa067cd1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/591b5fedc3a36840aa067cd1","movie_id":336669}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Too slow and dramatised superhero flick, but acceptable.\r\n\r\nI can't say I liked the previous films and not this one. In fact, I kind of enjoyed watching this reboot. It was much better than what I have heard about it. At least it did not sound like a loud and lousy like any modern sci-fi flicks, chasing bad guys, bombing cities and downing buildings. But as a superhero and sci-fi film, it had its moment, only at the end.\r\n\r\nObviously the film was too slow and dramatisation was a backslash keeping the youngsters (audience) in mind. I actually expected hefty stunt sequences. Without actions, a superhero movie is like a limbless spider and toothless shark. If the web and tooth are the superpowers, then they must handle it quite smartly. So that is where this film failed to be a clever. This film had 4 superheroes and until the climax they were impotent. Which means the only superhero movie in the recent time that meant for older people. Precisely to say, if you are a 30+, you might enjoy it as I did. I know I can't talk for you and what kind of movies you like, but I know todays youngsters who refuse dramas and accept action-adventures.\r\n\r\nI agree it did not deliver as it should have been as a theatrical feature where surround speakers are ready to give us a breathtaking sound mix. I felt it some kind of a television episode. Because that is how the modern television series are presented. Personally, I would like to say that don't mind my words and the review, because I usually enjoy all the films I watch. So this one was average to me, but definitely not a bad and I won't slam it. Though I recommend it for old people who does not like modern high-octane stunts.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"566ee1a19251415ec500f899","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/566ee1a19251415ec500f899","movie_id":166424}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> When they had each other...\r\n\r\nI anticipated an emotional tale from the director who is quite famous for it, and yes, it was, but not as I was looking for, yet I still liked it for portraying a beautiful father-daughter relationship. It was not like all about the happy scenarios, but it began with a tragedy and then moved to narrate a father who struggles to provide a better life for her daughter when his health was getting worse every day. In another layer, the story focused on the grown up daughter who struggles as well, but to get close to the people which affected since her childhood days with her father.\r\n\r\nRussell Crowe played an energetic father like he was in his 30s, especially when he shows the affections to his daughter. The little girl who played the daughter role as well so fantastic. The disappointment was as usual Amanda Seyfried like any of her movies. I like her as a human being, no offense but not as an actress. Apart from her portions, it is not a bad movie.\r\n\r\nIt was about one father and one daughter, but the title was plural. You should see the movie that has a simple explanation for it. The girl and her father's story should have been the entire movie. With some catchy moments between them would have made it an awesome product. As expected the end was emotional, and another layer's end was terrible which was obviously Seyfried's. I wanted to like it, but I can't. This movie would bring a mixed response that you can't decide whether you liked it or not, but mostly you might respond positively.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"571cd99cc3a36864e0005840","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/571cd99cc3a36864e0005840","movie_id":254172}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Three men like the three different seasons in a woman's life!**\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderful drama, I have been waiting for such film to come and since its release, I have been looking forward to this day. The romance is the theme of the film, so not the entire film as what it looks like. Based on the one and half century old novel of the same name and the fourth film adaptation. I have seen only 'Tamara Drewe', but that was altered to the present era, other than that I've not seen any other version. Still, I believe this will be remembered as the best one so far.\r\n\r\nI would say Carey Mulligan is the British version of Jake Gyllenhaal. Because they both make fine films, I admire their selection of the films. Mulligan was so brilliant here and in addition to that, Matthias Schoenaerts was equally good. They both made this film look so poetic, and so supporting cast including Michael Sheen and Tom Sturridge contributed well.\r\n\r\nIf you like periodic drama, then you probably would enjoy it. The story was excellently told. The three layered romance was narrated like three that happens in the different seasons. Like landscape change, how humans too transform was quite neatly briefed for over two hours. One of the best films in the recent time I've seen. The director of 'The Hunt' did a great job. If you like Jane Austen's kind of story narrations then you must try this, so I highly recommend it!\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"57f410a9c3a36805600004d5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57f410a9c3a36805600004d5","movie_id":250734}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I was actually not having great hopes for this movie giving how Hollywood have screwed up with a lot of my favourite super heroes (Spiderman, Fantastic Four, Dare Devil and a few others). Having said that maybe there was still a glimmer of hope given that some of their latest Marvel work have been rather okay. Unfortunately this is not the reboot of the Fantastic Four that I, and a dare say the fans, hoped for.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I do not understand is why the dumbass script writers that Hollywood employs always have to change the basic story of a set of characters that have a solid fan base? There was nothing wrong with the original story, and thus origin, of the Fantastic Four and the source of their powers. Maybe I am just old-fashioned but still.\r\n\r\nThe second gripe I have with this movie is the nonsensical stuff with members of the Fantastic Four, especially Ben, being deployed by the US military. It is just so clich\u00e9. Lazy script writing plain and simple. Unfortunately this also causes the movie to not really feel like it is a Fantastic Four movie. The team is split up and it is not until the very end that they actually become a team, gets a headquarter and so on. Big fail as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nHaving said all that, I do not think it is as bad as some people claim. There are some good stuff in there. The story is not all bad after all even though it is not exactly to my liking and the special effects are quite okay. One thing that annoys me with the story is that the role of Reed is really diminished and he is never really allowed to show of his powers. Yes, I know, there are some \u201cstretching\u201d moments but, well, meh! To add to the pain the actor cast as Reed is, in my mind, totally unconvincing.\r\n\r\nThe bad guy is also somewhat underwhelming and thoroughly predictable. As I said a classical Hollywood concoction aimed towards the less intelligent viewers. I do not understand why Hollywood seems to be so bent on repeating the same mistakes over and over again?\r\n\r\nWell, as I wrote, the movie is not as bad as some people claim but it is far from great. Given the abysmal reviews I am afraid that we will not be getting a sequel which is a shame. This is one of the (few) Marvel comics that I read as a kid (in Sweden we did not get treated to that many of these kind of comics) so it is indeed a bit of a disappointment that they managed to screw this movie up\u2026again.","id":"5a85c0770e0a2653b3024b57","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a85c0770e0a2653b3024b57","movie_id":166424}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Inside the Hollywood, from the young generation perspective.\r\n\r\nThe original series had a quite successful run for almost a decade. I haven't seen that, after seeing this film now I want to try it. So this movie is like a bonus episode for its fans, and for the cast and crew it was a reunion for the one last time. But I want a sequel, because I kind of liked it without familiarity with the original story and its characters. Anyway, it did not give me any trouble in understanding, particular this story. But obviously I know I am missing something in those scenes that directly has something to do with the series.\r\n\r\nWhat a simple tale about the film industry. It actually centered on a bunch of Hollywood actors and producers. When a lead actor wanted to direct his next film for the new production house, he gets a green signal, but the problem arises after production halts in the half way due to exceeding the original budget. All the struggle they go through, especially the studio head who acts between the filmmakers and their financiers is what narrated in this film.\r\n\r\nI don't know what they thought of this those who saw the series, but to me it was a pretty good comedy. Because I had no pressure to expect or to compare it with the original material like they do. The cast was wonderful. I got quite an unexpected and enjoyable twist. Since it was related to the motion pictures, some big film personalities' cameo brightened the overall film. If you want your watch to be a perfect, go through from the beginning, but like I did, you too can have a good time without viewing the series. That's not a recommendation, but a small suggestion.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"574375fac3a3685c4a000057","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/574375fac3a3685c4a000057","movie_id":188222}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Enakkul Oruvan is an avant-garde thriller that is not afraid to tease us with its fractured narrative, a heartfelt tribute to movies, a meditation on our lives and our dreams, and a traditional romantic film. And, if you are the kind of person who is into celebrity trivia, you will also find meta narrative here (a romance between two actors that starts off well and then sours) because the lead is played by Siddharth. This is quite evident in a press meet scene where his character has an outburst after he is grilled on his personal life.\r\n\r\nThe story revolves around Vicky, an usher in a rundown single screen theatre, who pops a pill that he is told will put him to sleep and make his dreams feel real. Vicky begins to dream that he is a film star, Vignesh. Characters from Vicky's world also find a place in Vignesh's world. Divya, the pizza waitress he loves, becomes Divya, an upcoming model-actress with whom he gets into a relationship. His caring theatre owner Durai becomes Vignesh's trusted manager. Then, there is a loan shark and his men who become gangsters in the dream. The director visually differentiates the two worlds by showing us Vicky's life in colour and Vignesh's in black and white (it's a dream!). There is also a track involving Vignesh in coma and an investigation into his state, which centres around the mystery pill Lucia, which is what Vicky takes! And then, there is a twist in the tale that makes us reevaluate everything that we have seen till then and question what is real and what isn't.\r\n\r\nThe film is a remake of Pawan Kumar's Kannada film Lucia, a mindtrip of a movie. This film doesn't quite capture that film's ambitiousness and visual pizzazz but still makes for a solid effort, especially for a debut film. The track involving the cops was better integrated into the plot in the original and the performances, especially of the supporting characters, lack the effortlessness of those in the original. You only have to look at John Vijay, who goes over-the-top even by his standards, to realize what is missing here. Siddharth as the usher Vicky takes some time to get used, especially because he is a good-looker and his effort to go de-glam (with a painted face) makes it somewhat of a studied performance. But the unassuming personality of the character is hard to ignore. In contrast, he comes off better as Vicky, the film star, where smugness is an asset, though the scene in which he opens up during an interview is moving. Still, Sathish Ninasam, in the Kannada film, was more believable, and we keep wondering what someone like Dhanush would have done with this role. Deepa Sannidhi (who looks like Samantha in certain angles and only reinforces the meta angle) has girl-next-door looks that both her characters demand but the costumes are too Gautham Menon-chic for a middleclass girl who works as a waitress at a pizza outlet.\r\n\r\nSanthosh Narayanan's affecting score and the uncanny sound design (by Vishnu Govind and Sree Sankar) make up for the lack of energy in some of the scenes. This is true especially for the scenes in the first half, which feel aseptic and do not seem to breathe life. It is as if the director and editor had what they needed but couldn't find the correct beat. But, in the second half, the film settles down and grows a heart that starts beating faster and faster as the film progresses towards the climax, and when it ends, it envelopes us with warmth that is genuine and well-earned.","id":"5502fbd6c3a3685ba6004b3e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5502fbd6c3a3685ba6004b3e","movie_id":307002}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"For some films, the bar is set lower and you get a genuine sense of gratification when it manages to cross it. En Vazhi Thani Vazhi is that kind of film but by the time it ends, all that we feel is murderous rage \u2014 for it not only manages to sink below the bar but digs a pit, and keeps going deeper and deeper into the ground. \r\n\r\nThe film is about a trigger-happy cop, Vetriselvan who shoots criminals, takes on his higher-ups, shoots more criminals, takes on powerful, corrupt politicians, and shoots more criminals. In the beginning of the film, we are told that he has been part of over 20 encounters, and by the end, that count must have easily gone beyond 200. He has no remorse about killing a human being and is basically a rock (it helps that he is played by RK). In one scene, a kidnapper dangles a kid from the fifth floor of an under-construction building and drops him. What does Vetriselvan do? He starts shooting at the criminals, we get a shootout and that's it. Did the kid survive? If not, how does Vetriselvan feel about it? We don't get any answers; instead, the film breaks into a song! \r\n\r\nThe romantic track is even better. The heroine, Vetriselvan's moraponnu, has, pasted his face on top of all our movie stars in the posters that adorn her room and romances him by singing that she's a moon not touched by Armstrong and is a mix of Cleopatra, Marilyn Monroe and wait... Sherlyn Chopra! Surely, she can't be that desperate! \r\n\r\nWikipedia says that the film is apparently a remake of the Bollywood film Ab Tak Chhappan but we doubt if Shimit Amin or anyone associated with that film is likely to go to the court claiming copyright. They will all be only eager to assure us that this is an entirely different film, if only to protect the legacy of their film. Excruciating is the word that defines this film as it is the psychological equivalent of having your nails pulled out of your finger one by one. Somewhere Vijayakanth must be laughing at us for making jokes on him when we are being tortured in such fashion.","id":"5502fb50925141282f003c40","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5502fb50925141282f003c40","movie_id":329143}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A look at a childhood life in the conflicted zone.\r\n\r\nAn anti war movie set in the Kosovo region of Serbia. Its about the minority Christians living in a remote village. The others are moved out from there except a family of three - a boy, his father and grandfather who lived there for generations refused to leave. The movie depicted the threat they are faced every day in their life. But the tale was seen through the boy's eye as he's the only one kid from his community with no friends.\r\n\r\nCo-produced by Germany, it was sent to represent Serbia for the 2016 Oscars. It was a slow beginning, but ended on a high note. A sensitive theme, but very well made movie. It is hard to imagine living a life in this part when it was surrounded by conflict that can burst out anytime. To move around the places, you need a protector, an armored vehicle to transport.\r\n\r\nActually the movie won't show any major violences, especially the face-off between two ethnic groups. Maybe that's for the best and to avoid fresh intrigue. The film aimed to spread peace message through the friendship. So the story focused mainly on the kids and their perspective on the issue. But that's not at all, to the end, the narration shifts to a different location and lets us know how the past follows them to haunt the rest of their life.\r\n\r\n> \"Tell the bishop that if he's a true Serb he should not be afraid. He can saddle his horse, won't ride in that armored vehicle.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a 90 minute long movie, yet I felt it ended very early. Because the pace was good and only due to the realistic approach it looked kind of dull, but all the way it engaged with the story development and with the new characters till the final act. Very interesting story progress, for every few minutes it begins to take a new turn, so hard to guess where it is heading or how it's going to end. The lines were calm and cool, even the shoutings, but when I suddenly hear gunshots, that's really aloud and created a severe panicking atmosphere like that something wrong might going happen. Reason for that is, the place was kind feels peaceful zone, at least for us as the viewers who don't know the earlier events.\r\n\r\nI liked the kids' performances, obviously the boy in the lead. It is a children's movie, because they acted in it, but the theme is a little strong for the kids to watch, I think PG required. The location was great, the camera work was excellent, some of the distant shots and its angles were so good. The overall movie was better than I anticipated, especially the third act was a lot more suspenseful, but kind of displeased with the editing in that part. Because they aimed for a twist to present scenes in the non chronological order. I think that was unnecessary for a this smoothly going narration, but it was not that bad at all.\r\n\r\nActually, I took some time to realise how good it was, only after a quick recap about what I saw and to guess what the filmmaker is trying to say. Believe me, initially I thought it was a decent, but was way better and I think a fine  message deliverer. It is a little unheard movie for many of us from the southeast Europe, yet worth a try once you came to know about it.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"56d9afb5925141429100a763","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56d9afb5925141429100a763","movie_id":333846}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"The film is clear in its intentions right from the beginning. It clearly puts across the message that it is going to make you laugh as much as it is going to make you feel poignant. However, the audience is thankfully spared of all the emotional hullaballoo (but if you are the kind that cries at movies, you may want to go hug your dad after this one). \r\n\r\nSathya (Ramesh Thilak) is an paramedic at a hospital and his best friend is the cheery Arumugam (Arumugam Bala) who is also the ambulance driver. He is in love with Kavya (Aashrita), who is from a family that is well off. Sathya, who pines for his father who passed away, is a man of principle, and one who loves his job. Which is why, when he is offered a cushy job to take over his prospective father-in-law's business, he has second thoughts about where his relationship is heading. It is at this juncture that he comes across Kailasam (Vijay Sethupathi), a 55-year-old man suffering from acute chest pains. He picks him up from a remote area, in his ambulance. They set out on a journey to take Kailasam to the hospital. \r\n\r\nThis is where the story picks up. Naturally, one is used to seeing a hero in all his regalia - flashy clothes, a stylish swagger, with an attitude to match. Vijay Sethupathi as Kailasam is far from it, and yet, manages to deliver a performance so convincing, one almost forgets that he is not really a 50-something man. As Kailasam, Sethupathi brings out the nuances of an old man - someone who is respected in his community, yet has quirks that can drive you up the wall. Interspersed with comedy, and a little bit of sentiment, his character is adorably annoying. The relationship that he builds with Sathya is slow - hesitant at times and obviously over-the-top at others. However, at the end of it, the audience is not left clueless - their relationship is surely that of a son who is looking for a father figure and a father, who is looking for a son to love. Ramesh Thilak as Sathya seems to have realized that he has plenty of scope to perform and he hasn't let the opportunity go waste. The actor has tried hard and worked towards his character and it shows.\r\n\r\nDirector Biju Vishwanathan's unusual narrative deserves a mention. The director has tried to keep the flow as natural as possible, but there are many times when subtlety seems to have taken a beating, or in some cases, forgotten altogether. His cinematography however, is breathtaking. Refreshing new angles, a brilliant use of landscape and colour, every frame is a work of art. Justin Prabhakaran's background score is nothing to write home about, although the songs seem to have struck a chord already with the audience, with a couple of hummable numbers.\r\n\r\nOverall, like an orange mittai, the film too is bittersweet. The biggest plus of the film is its run time - a mere one hour and forty minutes, which seems to be more than enough to narrate this interesting story. The film ends on the note that 'the journey is the destination', which about sums up the feeling that you get while watching this film.","id":"55e0264892514177d4001e33","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55e0264892514177d4001e33","movie_id":320906}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Oru Naal Iravil is mostly a faithful remake of the Malayalam film Shutter. The protagonist, Sekar (Sathyaraj) is someone who has made it in life all by himself, toiling hard in Singapore. But he is also unfairly prejudiced and chauvinistic. He suspects his teenaged daughter of having an affair just because he sees her talking with her friends and fixes a rushed alliance, turning a deaf ear to the protest of his wife.\r\n\r\nA drunken night with his friends lead to a moment when, out of temptation, he solicits a call girl (Anumol) he comes across on the road. He is helped by Soori (Varun), an auto driver, who does odd jobs for him in the hope that Sekar will get him a job in Singapore. They take the woman to the empty property that is part of Sekar's commercial shopping space, which is also adjacent to his home. Promising to return in some time, Soori leaves them there leaving the place locked. He meets Sethubharathi (Yugi Sethu), a down-on-luck filmmaker, who had left behind his bag (containing his new script) in his auto, but is caught by the cops for drunken driving and the duo is forced to spend the night at the police station.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Sekar starts fretting over Soori's absence and with the day having dawned, finds himself trapped with the prostitute, and facing the prospect of being caught at any moment.\r\n\r\nWhat's refreshing about Oru Naal Iravil is how it manages to keep us thrilled even with seemingly mundane events. The script is a crafty one, where even a single event can result in a domino effect on the lives of the characters. Soori's chance conversation with a pimp leads to a mention of it during a drunken session, and that tempts Sekar to seek the services of a call girl. And a harmless peg in an earlier scene leads to the characters finding themselves in difficult situations. It's a film where every moment is crucial to the plot and every scene is shaped by how it is edited, and we can see why editor Antony would have been attracted to make his directorial debut with this film. The interval block is an excellent example of this. We see a shutter being opened and the shot cuts to Sekar cowering in shame at being discovered, leaving us in the edge of our seats. But when the film resumes, we see what is finally happening, and leave a sigh of relief. Antony uses this technique quite often and after a time, it starts to feel manipulative, even though it is effective at times. The filmmaking never manages to build tension than what's inherently in the script. The performances, too, feel, just functional. Sathyaraj is the right fit for the role, but he is made to act slightly over the top and we never get emotionally attached to this character. Much to our chagrin, it is often the busy score that tries to inject tension into the scenes.\r\n\r\nAnd some of the coincidences - like the relationship between the filmmaker and the call girl - are distinctly cinematic. The filmmaker character actually is a stand-in for the audience, and his travails come across as forced. Similarly, the resolutions are rather too convenient. The episode is a moment of revelation for Sekar (he not only learns about himself, but also about the people close to him), but it is hard to believe the muted reaction of his family member, who learns of his predicament. There is not even a confrontation! In the end, we come out feeling underwhelmed as the film never fulfills the promise of its premise.","id":"5653d587925141701b001c5b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5653d587925141701b001c5b","movie_id":368285}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Traditional Treat.\r\n\r\nForsaken is directed by Jon Cassar and written by Brad Mirman. It stars Kiefer Sutherland, Donald Sutherland, Brian Cox, Michael Wincott, Aaron Poole and Demi Moore. Music is by Jonathan Goldsmith and cinematography by Rene Ohashi.\r\n\r\nThere's a group of words bandied around for this one such as generic, clich\u00e9 and formulaic, and most assuredly these can not be argued about. For this is very much an old style traditional Western, the plot featuring a retired gunslinger being pushed into action again - while he tries to reconcile with his estranged father - is a hard core staple of 1950s Westerns. But what is wrong with having a traditional Western in this day and age as long as it's produced with skill and grace? The answer for Western lovers is nothing at all.\r\n\r\nThis is a beautifully mounted picture, fronted by father and son Sutherland's - which adds heartfelt emotion to their scenes together - and boosted by gorgeous cinematography (making it a Blu-ray must), it's a genre piece of worth. Crucially it knows what it wants to be, it has no pretence to be anything other than a traditional Oater for lovers of such. The villains are sneery and scenery chewers - apart from Wincott who is a gentleman dandy type - and the good guy is wonderfully broody and reflective. Pacing is fine, the story has good drama and the finale excites as we hope it should.\r\n\r\nIn summary, nothing new here of course (except maybe Cox's out of place language!), so expectation of such would be foolhardy, but a smashing Western it be. 7\/10","id":"58c1c77e9251411d5d0094c5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c1c77e9251411d5d0094c5","movie_id":354110}
{"author":"Wong Kentir","content":"\"Focus\" blends two different movies in roughly equal measure. One is a movie about con men, scam artists and hustlers, in the tradition of \"The Sting,\" \"Ocean's Eleven,\" \"House of Games\" and \"Shade.\" The second movie is a romantic comedy between two people who are strongly attracted to one another, but who cannot and do not trust each other. \r\n\r\nThe movie about con men is brilliant. The hustles and scams are clever and cleverly executed with excellent skill and tradecraft. Dramatically, the double-blinds and double- crosses are well executed. The players con their marks, one another and the audience with finesse and aplomb. The cinematography, choreography and editing are crisp. The reveals are plausible within the film's cosmos of reality. \r\n\r\nThe romantic comedy is not bad. One can understand and believe the attraction between the two characters. Will Smith's character is hunky, clever, confident, successful and wealthy. Margot Robbie's character is gorgeous, sexy, vulnerable, clever and charming. But the major plot points in this boy finds girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl back subplot seem contrived, while the intriguing aspect of their relationship (How can two con artists with a history of deceiving one another learn to trust one another?) isn't explored in a satisfactory manner. Instead we get a breakup for reasons that are never explained, a repeated gag involving a wallet, and a massive coincidence that leads the audience to believe one of them has a hidden agenda involving the other. The relationship between them works best when they are conning one another, but it needs resolution. \r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is beautifully done. Cinematography, locations, wardrobe, make-up, editing, audio -- everything is polished. It's a movie that merits a second or third viewing, not only to see the cons played out, but also to appreciate some of the subtle foreshadowing.","id":"54f326be9251416b35003e43","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54f326be9251416b35003e43","movie_id":256591}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Kicked off well, kept the momentum, but the end was...\r\n\r\nIt's a Will Smith's movie, anyway, I was going to watch it, but when the initial cast dropped out, followed by a couple more, simply intrigued me. Actually, I enjoyed the film, but did not like it because of the bad ending. It was a good twist, except the shooting thing. An example how a tiny part can decide the entire movie's fate.\r\n\r\nWell written crime-drama, with a touch of romance. After all the obstacles, the final cast were at their best. Heist movies always excite me because of the involvement of the tricks and thrills. Nicky, a con artist who recruits a small time thief, Jess to work with his gang. When the job and the romance advancing smoothly, an unexpected split happens. So the years passed, when they meet again, what comes is the crux of the remaining story.\r\n\r\nThe first half let us know what kind of character the Nicky is. His overwhelmed dedication for his undertaking and his reliable team's the focus. Overall, it was the best portion of the movie, and the next half goes for the giant kill, but lacks enthusiasm. More like a revenge or jealousy type narration, but only until reaching the climax where it tries being a very clever and happen all the things at a brisk pace.\r\n\r\nThe film was better than I thought, after learning it was criticised, mostly very badly. Would have been a bit better if the writing was cautious for the crucial parts. Importantly, like I said the end part. 'Yes' for the entertainment it provided and 'no' for one of the best products of the year,\r\n\r\n6\u00bd\/10","id":"56043a189251416e95003594","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56043a189251416e95003594","movie_id":256591}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Campaigners, candidates and the citizens, everybody on the streets of Bolivia.**\r\n\r\nThe film was okay, but you have already seen it. This is the same old story where in America, the presidential running candidates do everything they can to win the precious votes, but here it takes place in a different country. Not bad actually, but disappointment is the American influence. Now I tell the truth that it was inspired by the real event. There's already a documentary film made, but now they altered it little and made a political-comedy.\r\n\r\nThe two campaign runners from the United States goes to Bolivia to aide two different candidates and becomes themselves confront once again. To gain the momentum, they have to go any length, so the fun begins when each others pull their legs. But who's going to stand ultimately and with what tactic is to be revealed in the next half of the film.\r\n\r\nI think, except the American characters dominance, the film was refreshing like the locations, supporting cast wise. But actors like Sandra Bullock, Billy Bob Thornton et cetera holds the key. Obviously the star power is one reason and the other is for keeping the real event's touch. The film does not work for everyone, it did do nothing for me. The director of 'Pineapple Express' failed to deliver. But it was a bad screenplay, underdeveloped or maybe lacks some good lines and strong scenes.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> The first love and the first heartbreak.\r\n\r\nThis is the very closest movie to my favourite Thai teen rom-com 'A Little Thing Called Love'. In fact a few scenes are almost resembling, including the main characters and love quadrilateral. So there's no wrong if I call it the Taiwan version of that movie. I thought I am going through again in another language, but I was not uninterested to sit for it because it was a beautiful story that I can re-watch numerous times without losing any interest.\r\n\r\nRemember its not the same movie, but only a similar themed flick, or maybe a highly inspired by that. This film had its own share of story and character developments. The third act was obviously a bit stretched, but twist came at early in that section and turned this tale into entirely different from what we thought going to happen. Except the second conclusion (I mean the real time ending, not the flashback's) which was so old fashioned.\r\n\r\nI found some similarities with my life and that Thai movie I mentioned, because that was based on the true story of everyone's first love and so this one. So finding a slice of your life in it is very much possible. The story of an ordinary girl, but it opens with a young woman recalls her school days after discovering her successful life was seen differently by others from her back. That takes us to the early 90s, like every girl in the school how her crush on a most handsome boy on the campus changes the course of her romance life after receiving a prank letter that states she must forward it to others.\r\n\r\n> \"When we say it's okay, it means it's not okay.\r\n> If we say I am fat, that means we hope you can tell us you're not fat at all.\"\r\n\r\nObviously it is a girl movie from a teenage girl's perspective narration. But as a movie fanatic, I never had any issues with such kind of movies or any others and to like them openly. Basically, I watch any movies because I want to be an all-rounder, not to stick to my age or what I'm. This movie simply reminds my school days and would do same to you as well. The school culture is different from European and North American to the rest of the world, especially in Asia. But if you're from South, Southeast or East Asian, you will get familiar feeling with this film and that will helps you to like the movie a lot.\r\n\r\nIn a few parts it lost its reality touch to, you know things that happen only in movies, especially as I said the ending and scenes that tried hard to bring laughs. You love this only for the flashback narration. The first and the last 5 minutes were ordinary. Everyone's performance was phenomenal, totally engaging storytelling. In this particular movie it was not about how much predictable, even if you feel deja-vu, but how it pleases you with those quirky atmosphere. A youthful Taiwanese film I liked very much since 'You Are the Apple of My Eye'. It does not look like it was made by an incoming director.\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of fun, but on the emotional side, it was slightly weak. But overall it was one of the best coming-of-age movie of all time and recently I have seen. It's already gained a cult status from youngsters that you can find fan made arts across the web. Don't give up on this if you are an adult or adult male, entertainment should be the preference and what comes beyond that is not your choice, but the natural response from your inside. Despite the length of the movie, it had an energetic pace with fine music and heartwarming scenes. In general, I recommend it to all, especially if you like teen romance.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"56e6fd8c92514143f3001cc6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56e6fd8c92514143f3001cc6","movie_id":354072}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A tale of four sisters living under the same roof.\r\n\r\nIt was based on the manga series. This is from one of the best directors from Japan that I am familiar with his works. I have seen some of his previous films and I loved them all, but sadly not this time. To be honest, I'm not the fan of this kind of movies, but I have watched them a lot before and liked them a lot. This movie is totally made for the film critics and film festivals, but winning awards that I never understood how.\r\n\r\nThey call it an art film, but not everyone going to enjoy it. There's no entertainment in it, nor inspiring. It was like someone's real life portrayed on the screen yet not a documentary. I mean it covered everything, every bit of that person's life, even that was not so important, but only to kill the run time. If you want to try it, make sure got lots of time, especially watching it with patience is very essential.\r\n\r\nSo what I meant was this film is completely out of cinematic experience like what a film fanatic, families least expect from a movie. It was without the twists, turns, thrills, sad, happy, romance because of too much realism. In one word, it was a straightforward narrative. There will be no exciting developments, nor easy to predict.\r\n\r\nIf someone is going like it, that might be mostly out of courtesy, and maybe for the cast and their performances and the respect for the film making or maybe they're somewhat close to this story. But individuals have their own reasons why they liked it, likewise I'm writing this review to say why I did not like much. Other than that, I don't see anything special in it to praise this product.\r\n\r\n> \"I'll be in your hands from now on.\"\r\n\r\nDon't accuse me that I'm totally bashing it, actually to me it was an average movie, which mean I did not hate nor liked. The best thing I found in the movie was the characters. Four sisters living under the one roof with love and care for one another. But the movie failed to focus them all equally by leaning too much on only a couple of characters. Like the title say obviously it centres on the 14 year old Suzu who's the youngest among and the newest member to join the house. But that did not bring the best story out of that character, at least not as what I hoped for.\r\n\r\nThe photography was good, the locations were beautiful, especially in the opening that rural Japan. A brief view into the Japanese culture, especially the lifestyle of the young independent women. Frame by frame it gives the feel of you are watching an anime movie. I think I might have loved it if it was an anime, because usually a young girl or a boy theme is always a success.\r\n\r\nIn this kind of film making, it is always the combination of the characters and the story. The characters were fantastic in this, but the story was not, hence I was disappointed a bit. I never interested in the gossip about someone's life. Maybe that's why I did not like this because I felt like it was someone's life which is nothing to do with me.\r\n\r\nYou know normal life is too boring in reality as well as to see in a movie. But I still respect the movie, that's why I did not consider it a bad film. I won't suggest it, but you might like what I did not because of the different taste in the movies. So all I say is choose it carefully, don't let the ratings and the reviews deceive you, including mine.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"572a02c9c3a36808fc002b55","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/572a02c9c3a36808fc002b55","movie_id":315846}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"There have been considerable political films throughout the years that have shrewdly exposed the cutthroat game of politics and the sharp satire was immensely felt without question. In satirizing the underbelly of deceptive politicking\u2014whether domestic or foreign\u2014there has to be a strong sense of cynicism and truth with caustic humor as the foundation for the perceptive microscope examining the outlandishness.  There can only be a certain elite class of films that demonstrate such penetration and probing into the political spectrum of strident skepticism.  After all, not many pundit pictures in the arena of political turmoil can effectively skewer the consciousness of doubters willing to go along in the authoritative malaise of our so-called policymakers.\r\n\r\nSure, not every attempt at political satire will hit its mark in stride and freshness. Classic offerings such as Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Dr. Strangelove Or : How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb  or even lighter and impish selections as Barry Levinson\u2019s Wag the Dog or Mike Nichols\u2019s Primary Colors  have proven to possess the right touch of roving ridicule to convey its point of naughty outrage and reflection.  In David Gordon Green\u2019s well-meaning but repetitive and lightweight political put-on Our Brand is Crisis we revisit the familiar behind-the-scenes corruption and chaos all shielded by political white-washing. The trouble with Crisis is that it does not have the convincing and energetic punch to compete or compare to the class of other films that have touched upon these familiar shady political themes with more forceful bite.  \r\n\r\nIndeed, Our Brand is Crisis has its witty moments and it is cheeky enough to tip toe through its see-saw penchant for tension and ticklish situations. Plus, the casting of the Oscar-winning Sandra Bullock (known for both her forte into dramatic and comedic turns) as a glib and weary consultant called into action seemed like a suitable fit for the resilient actress. Still, Our Brand is Crisis merely dabbles, drips and drags at revealing the American presence of political operatives in a South American country that cries corruption in its flawed political system. Hence, there is nothing really juicy or jolting about Brand that would suggest a distinctive or dire take in its observation as political pretentiousness as usual. \r\n\r\nOur Brand of Crisis is the fictionalized account based on Rachel Boynton's 2005 documentary that is similarly titled. Boynton's narrative solely focused on the 2002 presidential election in Bolivia. Well, director Green and screenwriter Peter Straughan imagine their big screen version of Boynton's exposition with Bullock at the helm as \"Calamity\" Jane Bodine, a once crafty-minded consultant called back into service after experiencing a nervous breakdown and retreating to an idyllic existence away from the political spotlight.   \r\n\r\nPulling Calamity Jane away from her resting mode based on the urgency for her input into the Bolivian presidential scene are current consultants Nell and Ben (Ann Dowd and Anthony Mackie) whose hats are thrown in the ring of former president and now senator Pedro Castillo (Joaquim de Almeida). They need Calamity Jane's pit bull prowess to ensure that their candidate Castillo can prevail over the favorable and formidable likes of political rival Rivera (Louis Arcella). However, Calamity Jane's stamina is tested by the Bolivia surroundings making her constantly queasy. Also, the candidate she is representing in Castillo is not exactly her cup of tea either.\r\n\r\nCalamity Jane's blunt blueprint for putting the failing campaign of Catillo on track over the popular front-runner Rivera is quite effective in manipulation. The plan: Bodine must invent for Castillo an imaginary \"crisis\" for the country in an attempt to put some cloudiness in the less experienced Rivera's booming candidacy. Any emerging conflict to baffle the country into panic will ultimately benefit the veteran Castillo over the wet-behind-the-ears endearing Rivera. It is a dirty agenda but hey...Jane Bodine is the mistress of madness and there is a reason why she was summoned to get involved and parlay Castillo to victory because her tricks and tactics have some shifty merit attached. Whether authorizing bogus and negative ad campaigns against Rivera or stirring up concocted panic to swirl around doubt that can question Castillo's opponent's qualifications Bodine certainly does not leave any rocks unturned in her relentless quest to put her assigned candidate over the top in the polls. \r\n\r\nOne cannot possibly overlook Calamity Jane's other motive for jumping on board and aiding the Castillo camp to triumph over his celebrated Bolivian rival. Apparently at stake is the former alcoholic Bodine's bruised ego, unflinching competitive nature and regrettable incompleteness cause by one Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton). Candy was instrumental in defeating Bodine in a previous political showdown so now it is her turn for redemption as she seeks to hand Candy some humble pie as her candidate must defeat his candidate (yes, Candy is working for the front-running Rivera) as the battle of political wits resurfaces on Bolivian soil.      \r\n\r\nIn a sense Our Brand is Crisis is challenging and ambitious with its concept of American political outsiders enforcing their superior will and ways on a foreign country as they subject an already pressured people and government to more scrutinized and mischievous practices beset by seemingly corruptible Yankee intruders. But this is the main problem because Crisis never rises to the occasion of following up on the interesting dilemma it wants to poke a stick at with cautionary, dark-seeded chuckles.\r\n\r\nStraughan's screenplay is too pedestrian and soft to tackle the outcry set forth in allowing these seedy American political strategists to manipulate, malign and woefully motivate the political process being shaped in a foreign country they are conveniently using for their own beleaguered backyard. Why not take a hearty potshot at such nerviness pertaining to the American political machine interfering abroad? And even if this is what Crisis was doing in its raucous skin the film still did not dig deep enough to find any resolution in such perceived outlandishness. \r\n\r\nIn order to be an enticing political satire the presentation has to show some bold and blunt sentiments behind its proposed purpose of cynicism. Our Brand is Crisis simply hints at its misplaced naughtiness without adding any decisive meat to the bone of contempt. Is Bullock's calculating political strategist a cold-heart villainess without morals or practical and procedural iron woman playing an appropriate mean round of political poker? Is there more to former President Castillo's stint in office the first time around that may have caused second thoughts in the public's minds not to trust him with executive power once again? Also, Crisis seems mighty clumsy and awkward at times in its balancing of dramatic effect and comical lapses. \r\n\r\nIf anything Our Brand is Crisis can be likened to the handling of a fancy gun. Sure, it is impressive to look at hold momentarily in your hands. However, when it comes to actually pulling the trigger the question remains will it convincingly shoot real bullets that make an impact or settle for delivering routine blanks on the spot? In this case Crisis should never have left its holster. \r\n\r\nOur Brand is Crisis (2015)\r\n\r\nWarner Bros.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Not another lesbian romance, but a fight for the equal rights!\r\n\r\nNot long ago I saw 'Carol', thankfully it is not another that and better than that. It was based on the documentary short of the same name about a real life same sex couple who fought for the equal rights and the pension benefits, while one of them was treated for cancer. It is a great drama about fighting for justice than the romance as it states, but that part as well very impressive.\r\n\r\nEllen Page and Julianne Moore, both were awesome, except Moore was a bit old. By seeing them I felt being a lesbian is sweetest than straight, hetero and even gay. The first half was all about the relationship, but very decently narrated romance tale. And in the next half once Steve Carell enters the scene, the film diverted to another side of the story. All the actors were very good, including Michael Shannon.\r\n\r\nObviously the story was predictable and that is expected often in a biography. Because if they want to alter it, then they should pen a very cleverest script the audience never saw one like that before. I think telling a true story as it is is the point and that's what this filmmaker did. So don't complain about the storyline, just consider whether it is inspiring or worth a watch for other reasons.\r\n\r\nFor me it was almost a sentimental piece, but the second half story compromised and then I realised what this film was trying to say. Underrated film of the year for sure. Anytime I suggest it, especially for the grown ups and with a neutral mindset, because it is not all about the same sex romance, but the battle for equality in society.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"57a37579c3a36832b800751c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57a37579c3a36832b800751c","movie_id":306745}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Respond to Avengers? All the folklore characters in one place!**\r\n\r\nA much better film than I expected. There's everything in it, all the popular folklore characters in one screen. In addition to that the aliens have also made into it, totally something new. Do think only Marvels bring all its superheroes in one place, see this some B movie did it as well. Since you know where this film belongs, I mean like a second string film, you should expect to a same level in order to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nFirst, the writer and director did a good job, followed by the actors. There were three main characters and they were distinct from each other. The supporting cast as well, so good, many decently known names were in that. The story as well had some good twists, since so many concepts was merged, predicting the scenes were kind of impossible. Anytime anything might happen, but overall it was a very well done film. So an enjoyable film with a few laughs.\r\n\r\nIt is the best year so for if you like B movies, Recent films like 'Cooties', 'Scouts Guide...' and a few others, you won't get a treat like this every year. They all are not top notch, but very entertaining, even if you rate them average. So what I'm saying is, this film is not those big production house's big projects, but it delivered to its capacity and you must keep that in your mind while watching it. I can't suggest it, but I hope you watch it.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"57ed88f2c3a3686cf8000447","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ed88f2c3a3686cf8000447","movie_id":218784}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is one of those movies where the French decided on an English name but for some inexplicable reason the original English name was not good enough for them. So in France it is called Fast & Furious 7 but I believe it is called Furious Seven in the US. Typical French way of doing things I am afraid.\r\n\r\nThis movie is probably not for everyone. It is very typical for the latest Fast & Furious movies though. The movie can be summed up by explosions, fast cars, fighting, did I mention explosions, repeat until credits roll. For me it was just what I expected and just what I wanted from this particular movie as well. If you are into fast cars, lots of action and explosive special effects and a bit of male macho talk then this movie will please you just fine.\r\n\r\nThe gang is back. I have to confess that I like both Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson even though they are rather far from Shakespeare material as far as acting goes. For this kind of movie they are perfect though. Unfortunately Dwayne Johnson was absent for a good chunk of the movie. When he came back from his brief presence in the beginning of the movie he did so with a vengeance though. I was actually expecting to dislike \u201cMr Nobody\u201d but I have to say that I quite liked him.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that this is a macho action movie there is at least a small kernel of story in there. It is a classical revenge story but it is embellished with enough material to make it fairly decent. Well, decent within the confines of this kind of movie of course. Seen from a reasonable point of view the entire movie is of course totally ludicrous. The stunts are really cool but if you sober up from the adrenaline feast you rather quickly find a lot of the stunts pretty far out. Like jumping between buildings in fancy cars and such like. Even if we skip the most ridiculous scenes there are plenty more to nit-pick about. Like the fact that those old, but cool, American cars that Torretto drives would not have a chance in hell against his more modern adversaries unless possibly if the road was entirely straight.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**To rediscover one's passion.**\r\n\r\nThis is an under-noticed inspiring tale. A biographical sport film based on an American gymnast Ariana Berlin. Like in any sports, after suffering from an accident or injury, how they fight for their comeback is the purpose of this film. It opened with a brief intro of her childhood, like what gymnastic means for her. She was not alone, but grew up with it alongside her close friend, Isla. The timeline of the story was on the crossroad of her life, just a few steps away to become what she had dreamt of. But with an unexpected event, her dream comes crumbling down.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this is not like any other sports film you have seen. But yes, a few parts resembles on what all the sports films have that in common with. So it is a very similar kind to the recent film 'Bleed for This', except a different sport. I have seen some good gymnastic films, including the recent 'The Bronze', but this one was a unique experience. Because all those films are focused on heroism. Like too unrealistic or intentional, how one overcomes from all the obstacles. Everything's about achieving something big. Unlike those, this was more about passion for the game.\r\n\r\nBesides, the road to come back, everybody needs a confident boost. One never knows where and how it strikes him. You might think it would be the coach, parents, friends or maybe a counselor\/mentor, but that part was the unusual of this film. It was none of them, but hip hop. Seems these two are not so far away from one another, especially they align in the case of physics, but totally falls in a different category. The fusions in any events are not rare, even in professional level in this modern world, but how does it work is the interesting part. A part of innovation. I would say it was nothing special, yet quite enjoyable.\r\n\r\n> \u275dSometimes when the front door gets slammed in your face, you have to go through the back door.\u275e\r\n\r\nIt had a good opening, and after the initial setback which is to set up a platform for the rest of the story, the middle section picked up well from it. Not that the film scenes were unpredictable, even though reasonable. Yeah, I was not sure which way the narration is heading. It was quite jumping all around till the third act to commence, then it sets its target firmly. Probably where you would get disappointed is the Ariana's dream. Her passion wins, but not her ambition. The end is where all the viewers would have their eyes. How it all going to end and what kind of message it reveals was much simpler, yet, like I said earlier, inspiring.\r\n\r\nOne of the best sport-films of the year. It was fun as well. I felt the dance parts should have given more attention to. Anyway, it was not primarily a dance flick, but had enough influence to say close to one. So don't watch it expecting it to be one, but gymnastic. If you like that game, particularly an aspirant, or any sports aspirant with a roadblock, it'll motivate you to keep on trying. Totally an unexpected film and I'm glad I saw it. Surely I would suggest it if anybody asks me for some good sports and biopics.\r\n\r\nGood casting, pretty faces in the front row, if you are a guy. I don't know much about gymnastics, but I know the lead cast worked hard for the perfection. At least to be close to it. I hope Ana Golja and Sarah Fisher would do more films in the lead. They were very impressive in their respective roles. The real Ariana appeared in a guest role roles. A decent writing and direction, but it was the fine storyline that held them up, alongside performances. I liked all the gymnastic stunts\/displays. The runtime and the pace of the narration was perfect. Overall an appreciable film. Usually biopics are must see, so I hope you consider it.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"597e0a80c3a368539701c061","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/597e0a80c3a368539701c061","movie_id":298582}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Between the childhood and adulthood.**\r\n\r\nThe director's feature film debut. From Guatemala, selected to represent the Oscars in the previous year (2016), but did not make. The film was based on the real about a small Mayan family living closer to the active volcano slope working in the coffee plantation. A perfect depiction of hardship of life, but from the perspective of a teenager. The life between adulthood and childhood, and for the lack of the knowledge of the real world, how they are misled was the film's purpose.\r\n\r\nI liked the film, no question about that. But it did not start like that. I hate films showing cruelty towards animals. It does not matter livestock, wild animals or anything else. The exception is only for the nature documentaries which does not involve human. So it all started with a strong dislike for the film. I was not sure I about writing a review for it. But the film convinced me with the later parts. I was not expecting it. In the end, I felt a very good film became a just above average because of one bad sequence.\r\n\r\nThe film follows the character Maria. The seventeen year old girl was promised to the one who works in the city. But she wants to leave the place, country to the United States. That's when she begins to have her sexual urge. Following that, she develops a relationship with a boy from the coffee plantation. The consequence is the bigger price she has to face. With numerous challenges, not just her, but the whole family should overcome it. So how they are prepared for it and other following struggles revealed in the remaining narration.\r\n\r\n> \u275dHe's probably living in the United States in a big house with a garden, like those in the magazine. He must speak English by now.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe film highlights many things. One of those was how the poverty ridden, illiterate people are misguided. The indigenous Guatemalan people that showed in this film really amazed me. Okay, the girl made a mistake, but how her family reacted to it was a surprise to me. Being very cultured, I did not expect that. In fact, I thought it could turn into a thriller, particularly in its finale. But the entire film was a drama and finding a solution to solve the issue as the way it flows. Then comes the misconception which drags the family into more trouble.\r\n\r\nAt that point of the narration, the film was close to the end. But an unexpected twist made its way. The part where desperation takes the front seat. With all the sudden, everything was resolved, but good or sad is to know, one must watch the film. Like the filmmaker, the casting was also new faces. The storyline seems simple, but where it sets in was the challenge the cast and crew excelled. The original title Ixcanul means volcano in Mayan language, but it is a force looking to explode is the correct definition, that's explained by the director.\r\n\r\nIt is one of first Guatemalan films for me. I'm very impressed with the story, the performances, locations and the overall film. It is not just a film festival product, it is like any Hollywood or the rest of the world cinema that qualified to call a good film. So if you are watching lots of regular films and got bored, you can try this for a change. A different language, different setting, but a situation every culture, ethnic had seen, that now you can learn how it all confronted by these people. Just like the film 'Tanna', but not all the same. Excluding the opening part I complained about, this is a nice film to check it out. But I won't mention the word recommended!\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"598caad0c3a3686b6e000fa5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/598caad0c3a3686b6e000fa5","movie_id":320001}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The art of cooking while living among different seasons.**\r\n\r\nThe second part of the manga based film, 'Little Forest'. One of the best duologies and one of the best food films I've ever seen. Literally, it was a four part film series with the seasonal topics like summer, autumn, winter and spring, but you would see it is like two episodes from each film which opens with the same intro. Which briefs about the place where it set in, and then go straight to its business.\r\n\r\nBasically, you can call this a mini-series, that's how in the west they call such film concepts. There's already a Korean version is in the making, due in the mid 2018. It was simply outstanding as the previous one. And one should watch them both continuously as the opening statement says for your better understanding.\r\n\r\nWinter, what do you think the farmers would do in this season. I really don't know. I haven't come from such place. All I think is skiing, building a snowman or slippery roads. That's why this film impressed me. Something letting us know what we never knew. Ichiko had her own plan. I guess most of her counterparts in the Japan would do the similar task to counter the harsh weather. That the art of preserving the fruits and vegetables, as well as making the seasonal dishes using them.\r\n\r\nNot everything is just the indoor activities, but utilising the outdoor gifts like the snows to preserve the precious ingredients and growing vegetations are admirable. Cultural significance, like gathering and sharing their produce\/harvest, totally give another glimpse of how the Japanese do. On that aspect, this film quite stays away from Ichiko in a few sections. The other characters take over for a brief. That remains a bit mystery. The film never went deep digging her personal life, particularly what happened between her and her mother. So it never cared to say further as the narration proceeded towards the end.\r\n\r\n> \u275dI'm pretty lenient when it comes to cabbage white butterflies. But I show no mercy to caterpillars.\u275e\r\n\r\nSpring, you can call the season for rebirth of all plantation. The white visuals would be replaced by the green everywhere. Not just the plants, but also the zoological lives like butterflied et al thriving. There's one problem with that despite they are considered beautiful, those are pest according to the farmers. Ichiko reveals her own experience with her mother when she was a kid. But when it comes to her in the same position as her mother, what is her counter measure can be observed.\r\n\r\nAs for the food theme, it was a complete satisfactory film. But the story, the personal life of Ichiko was not explained well. I believe the original source could be well detailed, particularly about her mother. I always wondered about her mother, being an average mother, but an excellent cook who really inspired Inchiko to follow the same path. Remembering from her childhood and trying to recreate the same dish with the taste, in some cases, experimenting with the new ingredients, once again you will be mouthwatering.\r\n\r\nI loved both the film, and I wished for another installment. Gosh, why do it has to be only two films. It was a great direction. It was beautifully written for the screen and the locations, mind blowing. All the four seasons very pleasing to see on the screen. From the hot summer to autumn, cold winter and the spring. One year cycle of the seasons, as well as how the humans adapted to cope with the changes in the nature was well picturised. Beside the sub-topics, other than the film's notion were nicely placed in the parts of the narrative.\r\n\r\nI've said almost everything about the film(s) in the previous review. Because I did not expect anything different in this part. Just the same flow, but different season and dishes. Also the farming, according the seasons was the highlight of the film. The performance was great, though, as I said it all looked like a documentary film of the real lifestyle in the countryside.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen many documentaries about the Japan, so that's one the reasons why I overjoyed it. I know a couple of people who love cooking and they are indeed good at it, despite that's not their profession. I'm thinking to gift them this Blu-ray. You might have seen many food flicks, but this is different and a must see. So don't miss it!\r\n\r\n_9\/10_","id":"59bd94569251413551018bc6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59bd94569251413551018bc6","movie_id":336026}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Some teachers inspire outside their class as well.\r\n\r\nOnce I was in love with the Hong Kong films, it is my favourite Asian film industry after the Japanese, but I haven't seen any recently. Somewhere on the web I caught this film poster and I followed it to the movie database. After learnt about it I have had the urge to watch it. The most of the Louis Koo's films I saw were either action or thriller, and it is neither, as well as he's in a small role, a supporting one.\r\n\r\nIt was based on the true story that centres a kindergarten in the rural Hong Kong. The school with a long history is now facing a threat of close down due to just five students with no teachers. All the kids hail from the poor families. After knowing this from the television a former elite headmistress Lui, who is now recovering from the surgery decides to put a hold on world tour with her hubby to take the position that offers a very low pay. So the remaining is the story that tells her effort to make the school to stand on its own, but whether it happen or not is what brings the end.\r\n\r\nI did not know it was a melodrama, but it was not that kind of deep sentimental film that makes you weep like your dog just died. The narration was so smooth, from the introduction of the main characters to the development to the conclusion. From all, the surprise came from the children's performances. What, they all definitely are under five years, but stunning display. And their lines were like the matured adults, which is what kind of defines it a movie, otherwise no doubt that its an inspiring drama.\r\n\r\n> \"I afraid they'd fight when I'm gone.\r\n> They may kill each other and I won't see them again.\r\n> Then I'll be all alone. I'll miss them.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not all about the school, but about the personal lives as well those who comes in the main narration. While the Lui's attempt to provide everything in her capacity, reveals by focusing why those five kids' family is unable to send to another kindergarten. Like a movie with the multiple layers, but only after the first half where it takes the stretch.\r\n\r\nIt is a good family movie, well received by the audience as well as by the critics and saw a domestic box office success. The highest grossed local movie in that year. Definitely it won't give you the impression of the freshness in the concept. You might have seen the similar flicks in other languages, but the point is to publicise the event that occurred on the other continent with the different characters and the different kind of struggle with the backdrop of the different society and its culture.\r\n\r\nIf it was not a biography, then I don't know how much the original story was altered for cinematic version. All the three acts' were in the perfect order. I love tearjerker films, but sadly I did not wet my eyes for this and I won't expect the same from you. A movie to feel its depth through your heart. So I had a good time with it, I began my 2016 with this one and I hope you too get what you're looking for from this.\r\n\r\n7.5\/10","id":"568a34a49251411334020834","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/568a34a49251411334020834","movie_id":332980}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The early days of James Dean in the filmdom.\r\n\r\nIt was based on the real life story of a young Hollywood star, especially during his early days of the acting career. In the 50s when a photojournalist was looking for a break, he ended up doing a story on James Dean. Initially who hated him, later gives a nod for the interview and so this story begins that focused on the time they spent together.\r\n\r\nA simple story, but a very long film. It was neither inspiring nor annoying. It was just like anybody's story around us, that's really boring. Because he was kind of an unfriendly and his tale that told in this film was very dull.\r\n\r\nMaybe if you like James Dean and his films, especially interested to learn about him, then you might like this film. But to me this biopic was just okay. Neither I enjoyed it, nor disliked. Yet to see his films which are very small numbers, then I might change my mind about this film, so till then what I said will remains.\r\n\r\n5\/10","id":"57375593c3a3683fa300118c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57375593c3a3683fa300118c","movie_id":300153}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Something new I never expected from the Hungarian film.\r\n\r\nI loved 'Citizen Dog' and this movie falls under the same category. I haven't seen many Hungarian films, but recently I saw and liked 'White God'. After seeing the overwhelmed responses to this, I think I anticipated a lot only to get disappointed. I'm not completely upset with it, I liked the story, maybe I expected more cute and innocence like an Audrey Tautou character from 'Am\u00e9lie'.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of fun that you could feel the movie is not simply trying to impress you, but begin to evolve to build a fine storyline and a better conclusion. The deaths, inclusion of a Japanese character, songs and a fairytale is how the concept was developed that became the centre of the narration.\r\n\r\nAt a time I felt a little too much use of them is why my interest on this slightly declined during the watch. I definitely won't consider it a bad movie, but only felt it should have been a little better in the storytelling. I might have not liked it as much as other similar films, but it's a superior quality, with the good performances. I think anyone who enjoyed 'Citizen Dog' and 'Amelie' should try it with the low expectation.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"56a4ccde925141524c001cd5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56a4ccde925141524c001cd5","movie_id":326333}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> About a little boy who believed he can change the world.\r\n\r\nI was two minded after seeing its trailer. Because I'm pretty much convinced it is a B movie. But that's not the issue, I usually put my faith on them and take my chances. So what bothered me was the film contents, because the trailed roughly reveals what kind of movie it is, from that I reckoned it should have been a big production house's product. Hence, I believed the visuals could be disastrous, but that was not the case. In fact, it was a remarkable standard, one of the reasons for the movie's success, despite there are no list-A actors in the full fledged roles.\r\n\r\nThe boy was much better in the movie than I judged his performance in the trailer. He might have appeared in a few television episodes, but this was his silver-screen debut. A wonderful display and I believe he would bag more projects for this. It was a family film, an emotional drama set during the United States entry into the World War II. Takes place in a small western coastal town called O'Hare about a 7 year old boy Pepper, nicknamed Little Boy who's willing to do anything to bring back his father alive from the war. On the effort he takes up a series of task which later stuns his town and the whole country.\r\n\r\n> \"Do you believe you can do this?\"\r\n\r\nThe Fascinating thing was, the blend between the real occurrence with the fictitious attachment. People might believe it was based on the real, but it is not. Like I said the graphics were very crucial that matched to any big budget films, unfortunately it was a small portion, but definitely a big deal. It talks about lots of interesting stuff which is inspiring, partially funny and also a children friendly film. Especially it explains quite clearly the difference between religious beliefs and magics which is obviously little kids never understood. So it could help to learn something from other than the textbooks.\r\n\r\nThe plus points were the consequences of war (any war), how the people can get affected by the war, bullying, racism and misbelief. On the other hand the minus was too much ingredient in a little movie, fortunately clicked so well. As usual, it was knocked down by the critics who never recognised the art of sentimental works. If you are not one of them or their followers, you are going to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nIf it had some big names in the main cast, especially for the father and brother characters, then it would have been roared louder and helped the international markets. As being one of the finest storied movie that highlighted our past mistakes, sadly terribly failed at the box office, but very much could get a cult status because particularly families loved this one so far. Not highly, but simply I recommend it and one of the must see from year 2015.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"563a4d97c3a3681b610233ed","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/563a4d97c3a3681b610233ed","movie_id":256962}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"As with his first film Raattinam, KS Thangasamy opens Ettuthikkum Mathayaanai with an act of violence. We see a CCTV recording (the year is 2009) of a young man being beaten to death but then the film moves forward the present and we see Natesan aka Natty and his family shifting to Tirunelveli. And for the next hour or so, all that we get are his romance with Sarah, a hostess for the local cable channel. Then, Natty's dad, a cop, is murdered by an unknown gang and the interval twist reveals us that it was Tamizhselvan, the brother of Natty's dead friend Prabha, who also lives in the town. And, he is planning something even bigger! Tamizh's grudge has something to do with Prabha's death and how Natty becomes a part of it is what the rest of the plot is all about. \r\n\r\nAs was evident in his debut, Thangasamy is a low-key filmmaker and many of the incidents in this film play at a pitch that is lower than what we would normally find in our films. Take for example the manner in which Sarah's family gets to know of the romance. Tamizh's wife, who is a supporter of the lovers, arranges for a meeting between their mothers and broaches the subject. Natty's mother tells her view and Sarah's mother expresses her reservations and then she decides to check with her husband. There is none of the shouting and name-calling that we are used to in most films involving lovers from different religion. Similarly, when Natty's father dies, the family just tries to move on. As we saw with Thirudan Police some months earlier, Natty gets his father's job and becomes a cop but the young man doesn't brood over the loss or plot revenge. He just keeps doing his day-to-day work. This kind of pragmatism is what makes Ettuthikkum Mathayaanai refreshing but it is also the reason why the film doesn't seem as exciting as it should. \r\n\r\nAlso, too much time is spent on the romantic track between Natty and Sarah, which essentially should have been a sub-plot. There is even an overlong episode involving a migrant worker that seems to have been included only to show that our attitudes towards these people need to be changed. Interestingly, this is the second film this week (after Kaaki Sattai) to touch upon this subject. Thus, the juicier revenge angle feels rushed and the villain's character seems underwritten. As in Raattinam, the acting leaves much to be desired (the lip sync is even worse) and we wonder how better actors might have shaded these characters. The lively score by Manu Ramesan props up the scenes to a large extent but as we exit, we can't help feeling underwhelmed.","id":"5502fc0ac3a3685ba200516f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5502fc0ac3a3685ba200516f","movie_id":280881}

OK, it is just a stupid vampires story but, this is just toooooooo bad.\r\n\r\nI've not read the book but I suspect the fail is not just in the movie but that it is adapting something that is already bad from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe worst is that I kind of liked Dornan in his role in Fallen but this movie has made me realize what a short range of performing resources he has. Dakota Johnson is not too bad, though. The acting is OK, it is just that you hate such an stupid character.\r\n\r\nOne more to my very narrow list of movies in which I have seriously thought stop watching by the middle of it.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I am probably going to be a bit provocative here and say that, in order to like this movie one has to rise above the expectations of this being just another mindless revenge\/slasher movie where you park your brain in the lobby before sitting down.\r\n\r\nIf you keep your brain in gear, especially the artistic part of it, you might like this movie. The plot is simple enough, perhaps a bit illogical at times, but it is wonderfully implemented from a cinematic point of view. Some people have referred to David Lynch when reviewing this movie and there is indeed a \u201cLynchesque\u201d feeling over it.\r\n\r\nPersonally I found the movie beautiful. I read some people saying it was too dark. Well, I guess I am glad that I got my new OLED TV in time to watch this movie since I am sure my old LED-LCD would have struggled with the many dark scenes. On the OLED the image was wonderful though. The somewhat eerie night scenes were so enjoyable to watch. Yes one could of course nitpick and say the lighting was unnatural but come on, the entire story was a bit far-fetched so just enjoy it for what it was, a nice piece of imagery.\r\n\r\nThe story is a bit weird. A guy who has gotten his wife and daughter killed by a set of psychopathic young men trains a (very) young girl for years to take revenge. That is of course a bit convoluted. Why not just wack them himself since he seemed to know what he was doing when it came to inflicting all kinds of hurt? Okay, I get it, because the script writer thought that would be too boring. Fair enough.\r\n\r\nThe actors are doing a decent job in the movie. The lead character is maybe a bit too much of a baby-doll character but she is still doing a good job of her role. The four bad guys are doing a good job of being creepy and sadistic. There are plenty of unanswered questions though. For example, how did he get his hands on the girl in the first place?\r\n\r\nI actually think the movie was a bit short. I guess it was a bit short on money as well and maybe it is related. Anyway, I feel that, once the \u201chunt\u201d had started that more could be done with it. When the ending approached I felt it to be a bit rushed to be honest.\r\n\r\nBottom line, I liked this movie. It was cinematically beautiful, a bit weird (in a good way), somewhat creepy, and decent enough story-wise. Maybe it is really a bit short of four stars but it is closer to four than to three.","id":"59142f98925141572300a5b1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59142f98925141572300a5b1","movie_id":277558}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Trained to be a final girl, to finish it off the transgressions.**\r\n\r\nThe storyline is not bad, even though it is a very familiar concept, but it was not developed smartly enough with scenes and twists and all. The characters are fine, but I was not convinced with the casting. Not everybody, only Breslin. I have been watching her films since she was a child artist, only her recent film are not that great, or even simply good to appreciate her involvement. I blame her choices of the film and its filmmakers. As for this, it's clearly visible that she's not physically suitable to do such role. This kind of film is for Chloe Grace. For me she's more a Disney product.\r\n\r\nThe other actors were not bad, especially those four fellows in the negative roles. There's nothing to talk about Wes Bently, he was like in a guest role. When it comes to the film story, it does not make any sense at all. Okay, training a person from the very young age to be terminator is very interesting for a film. But when the assignment was given to that person, as per how it all took place in this film, I thought it was unnecessary. Because it could have been dealt in an easy way. So just for the film, they took the hard way and shed some blood.\r\n\r\nHappy part was, the film did not look so boring. The setting was too dark, they avoided other unrequired characters to enter into the frame. So to focus everything on those few ones and made an attempt to shape up the film as much possible best. I would have liked it if it was a little better in some sections. In the end, I'm not fully satisfied, so I don't think it is worth a watch. Instead, you should check out other similar concept films like 'Hanna', 'Nikita' et cetera.\r\n\r\n_4\/10_","id":"5887daa392514162f20045b4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5887daa392514162f20045b4","movie_id":277558}

This is not about two women falling in love and their relationship complications, but the family of one of them who struggle to accept after knowing their daughter is a gay. The daughter wanted to marry her sweetheart and start a family. So how things shape up within the family, who lose, who gain and what happens at the end is the remaining.\r\n\r\nThe title says it is a Jenny's wedding, but the wedding is a small part, the rest is all about Jenny's family. While portraying the family about how they're coping with the news, I liked how the film focused one at a time and their way of coming out of the frame they're in. Mostly it was the perspective of the women, because the writer was a woman, so she knew how to carve it. That's why the father's part slightly lacked the exhibition, nevertheless, that's the only male character that has to be so tough.\r\n\r\nSuch a wonderful narration, totally an unexpected movie. Surely one of the underrated movie of the year. The cast was fantastic. Among all the characters, Alexis Bledel's role was disappointingly shorter. Anyway, she was not that important, but the rest of them had played their part exceptionally. Great dialogues, sometimes emotionally gets us. Is there any best gay themed film for families, I've not seen quite good as this one. I definitely recommend it.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"570fc488c3a3684ff1001c21","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/570fc488c3a3684ff1001c21","movie_id":342474}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"The film opens with quick-cut scenes of Arun in his current scenario. His friends, a group that's involved in theatre, too, pop in and out of the frame, setting the story in the present. When the group comes across a dud of a guy trying to express his love to a girl, juxtaposed cleverly with a similar movie scene running on a telly in a cafe, Arun gets this idea to make what they all are passionate about - theatre and drama - their profession. So, they all start setting up elaborate scenes to bring together 'romantically challenged' people in love. So far, so good; you wait to see director Vijay live up to the promise he showed in Madrassapattinam and Saivam. And so, even if the odd, elusive feeling that you've seen something similar (read Ilayathalapathy Vijay in Shahjahan) flashes by, you want to push it aside and enjoy the scenic visuals, and those cleverly spaced close-ups; you want to see what happens next. The pacing is good, and a semi-serious, often broody Arun and friends manage to elicit a few laughs.\r\n\r\nAnd then, the movie goes into flashback mode at a point that forces Arun to contemplate his college days, and the love he lost, and that is when the plot starts to disintegrate. What one thought might be parallel stories at the start (the present, the past, and the varied play scenes the cast sets up), converges into a cliched excuse of misunderstood love. To top it, though debutant Keerthy looks like a collegian, one does find it tough to accept Vikram as one. That apart, the cliches just pile on, and the plot starts dragging its feet as the pace slows down considerably. In fact, when the movie cuts back to the present again, and Vikram starts to deliberately mess up the staged scenes, for a moment, our sympathy actually veers towards the other guy, who is for sure going to lose his money, and his love. And by the time the 'twist' comes, you're wishing Vikram just get over with it. For, from the moment the film bangs you back into the present (well, there's a war scene of sorts playing on the TV in the background), till the end, there is no progress in the story - it's just an extended series of ploys the hero adopts to make sure his love doesn't fall in love again.\r\n\r\nMind you, Vikram does look good in parts - the hockey scene is one of the best in the movie, his dance steps are fluid, and he actually does the broody part better, but the problem with Idhu Enna Maayam is, instead of letting the plot rule screen and take the conclusion to another level, Vijay has tried to fit every scene, including the climax, into a pre-conceived, tried and tested template that leaves the actors no choice but to fall in line with the banality.","id":"55e0267ec3a368269b001c55","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55e0267ec3a368269b001c55","movie_id":330415}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A relations getting ready to face its ultimate fate!**\r\n\r\nThis is a US-Thai collaboration. Ninety-nine per cent of the film was shot in Thailand, but full of American cast. They are not well recognisable cast. Precisely to say, a B movie. And we all know the first rule watching such film, that never expect anything. But if it serves, even least would be a good achievement. Sometimes they do surprise us too. In this case, it was not. It was average, though not bad as you might have heard.\r\n\r\nYep, it was very slow. Especially in the opening segment. A bit confusing as well. Within 10-15 minutes, that problem was solved. Yet the pace of the story posed a great annoyance. So if you get over with that, then you might find it an okay film. As I said, for a such small film, the effort was not bad. That includes the actors. Except the story. Very familiar theme, characters and the whole scenario. You could predict most of the parts, but you know when there's a diversion, you can't say which way particularly it Would head. That's I'm saying because of the ending.\r\n\r\nErik, Joanna, David and Miranda are the central characters. But primarily it focused on the relationship between Erik and Joanna. They are an average young American couple. It all starts when Joanna concerned about her work project. She needs to go to Thailand, and as per the plan, Erik meets her later as what the title meant. So there will be a few weeks gap between them. That's where the tale takes a twist. Being parted, their relationship put to a test. So when finally they meet up again, what will be their position regarding their relationship, is what discloses to us.\r\n\r\n> \u275dYou were just accidentally funny.\u275e\r\n\r\nVery challenging first quarter to watch, and so the following one. But once you passed that, its a watchable film. Worth a watch too, though not a must see or for everyone. As I always say, if you had seen plenty of films themed romance and relationship, then this will be in some way another boring repetition. But if you watch films rarely, then you need to be patience, in order to enjoy or like it. In the end, I'm saying it again that is not a bad film, they just did not make it in a right way. Trimming a few scenes to make it a quick and shorter film would have made a trick.\r\n\r\nAs for the story, I feel sorry for Joanna. Of course she did not handle the given situation. But she had a professional pressure. And while fully engaged in that, the people took advantage of it. Then, if you think of Erik, it was mostly a case of misunderstanding and self-discovery. So any tale, especially in romance and relationship, these things are the basic ingredient to lay a platform. The writers should have seen beyond that and tried to add a little fresh perspective.\r\n\r\nI hope the director had learnt a lesson. This is his first feature film and I felt he was good, except he did not get best screenplay. I mean the basic story was good, but the screenplay lacks for the production level. What it needed was a bit cheerful. Because the entire stretch was so serious. All it talks about the relations, tried to develop even in a small gap. What I meant was, the narration has a flashback. Not a single flashback, but pieces that attached throughout the film. Those flashback pieces come into play only when the story was going other direction, to remind us with the previous account, how it was before to this point.\r\n\r\nA big disadvantage watching it was the intentional scenes and its dialogues. You predict them or not, but surely they have deliberately done them in that way. Particularly in the scenes of jealous, misunderstanding, taking advantages. After watching the whole story, at that point when it reached the final stage, minutes away to conclude, you could still anticipate or curious to know how it's going to end. But that's not a twist or even close to one. For a poor start and average middle part, the final act was fine. Just fine. I would say a fitting end. I always happy to give a try the B movies, and so I did the same for this. But blaming things around it is unnecessary, if you knew the risk you're taking, otherwise don't watch it.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"59dbeb35c3a368620006699e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59dbeb35c3a368620006699e","movie_id":427648}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"144 acknowledges that its story is partly inspired from writer Sujatha's Vasanthakala Kuttrangal, involves a bunch of characters, each with his own quirks. There is Rayappan (Madhusudhan), a jeweler, who has stumbled upon a cache of gold bars; small-time thief Desu (Shiva), an expert lock-picker who has a tendency to get caught easily; Kalyani (Oviya), a call girl who is Desu's accomplice and his \"could-be\"; Madhan (Ashok Selvan), Rayappan's driver who is in love with his boss' daughter Divya; Ravi Varman (Munishkanth), a speech-impaired artist who does the dirty work for Rayappan; and Feelings Ravi (Udhayabhanu Maheswaran), a gangster who gets emotional after punishing the people who have crossed his path and keeps a doctor by his side.\r\n\r\nThe plot is set in motion when Rayappan tries to sell the gold to their actual owner. This brings Feelings Ravi onto the scene, as it is the gangster (who safeguards the illicit wealth of the rich) who was the caretaker for the gold when it was stolen. Ravi Varman stumbles upon Rayappan's secret and a quirk of fate sees him teaming up with Desu and Madhan and stealing the gold. This is made possible because of the curfew enforced in their village, Erimalaikundu, which is involved in a decades-long one-upmanship with the neighbouring village Poomalaikundu.\r\n\r\n144 is being promoted as a Soodhu Kavvum-meets-Mundasupatti kind of film, and the description fits only to an extent... in the sense that it has a bunch of inept criminals trying to commit crime (as in the former) and a quirky village is the setting (as in the latter). You could also call it Mundasupatti-meets-Rajathandhiram and you wouldn't be wrong as like that crime caper, it also about a gold heist that involves an elaborate set-up and planning. But the filmmaking is more Mundasupatti, with noticeable rough edges that keep reminding us that this is a first-timer's film and lacks the sophistication (it is an exposition-filled film) of both Soodhu Kavvum and Rajathandhiram. But that isn't necessarily a bad thing as the elaborate explanations enhances its accessibility and stops it from turning into a niche film like the other two. And the director, G Manikandan makes up for the lack of visual flair with wackiness that is distinctly homegrown (his superb visual twist to the term lip-lock is an instant classic), and confidently spins his yarn like an experienced raconteur.\r\n\r\nThere is so much to like in this film, when you look past its initial hiccups, which includes a cliched but unconvincing romantic track between Madhan and Divya \u2014 though, we get another wonderful early Rahman-ish duet, Poove Pooviname (after Mundasupatti's Kadhal Kiliye) from composer Sean Roldan. The other love story \u2014 between Desu and Kalyani \u2014 is handled better, and both Shiva and Oviya perform their scenes with the right amount of flippancy.\r\n\r\nBut the success of the comic portions depended on the actors and they shoulder the task admirably. Much like he did in Soodhu Kavvum, Ashok Selvan plays it straight and fits the part. This is Udhayabhanu Maheswaran's big break and as Feelings Ravi, he is a riot. And despite the lack of speaking lines, Munishkanth (aka Ramdas) manages to be funny. But it is Shiva, who keeps the laughs coming with his terrific comebacks and one-liners. His segments are so ridiculous that we notice the humour quotient dipping whenever he is not in the scene.","id":"5665640cc3a3685121001cd3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5665640cc3a3685121001cd3","movie_id":367846}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> When the man and the nature overlaps.\r\n\r\nA semi biographical adventure-drama from China directed by the French director known for 'Seven Years in Tibet'. He was chosen after many Chinese filmmakers refused to take the project, because of the dedication it required. The film highlighted the outcome of the two ethnic groups, Mongols and Hans overlapping with the mother nature. The film should have been one of the best in the line of 'Siberia Monamour', but there a few things that did not work in its favour.\r\n\r\nIt was just like the 'Embrace of the Serpent', based on a person who went to a distant place with a motive, but learnt another thing. Especially realsing the value of the native people and their land and culture. The main character was totally resembling to the Brad Pitt's role from 'Seven Years in Tibet' and very inspiring. You learn nothing by observing afar, you have to get in and get along to gain knowledge of the place. So you have to be one of them in order to see through their eyes of the place and then would find its true identity.\r\n\r\nThe tale begins in the late 60s during the China's cultural revolution. Two young students from Beijing sent to a remote place in the Inner Mongolia to teach the locals read and write. Instead, one of them gets interested in wolves and decides to study them by raising a cub. During that time, the confrontation between the wolves and for the human encroachment of their natural habitant determines the future of the grassland. The ultimate face-off between them ends with the emotional.\r\n\r\n> \"The problem for us Mongols is that our history wasn't written by us, but mostly by our enemies.\"\r\n\r\nWhen you don't belong to that place, you should not intervene in its natural order. The China's history is always bad when it comes to the land grabbing, either it is the ongoing South China Sea dispute or the Tibet and thousands of others. This is such a film made by China itself that spotlights their wrongdoings. Just see the film to know how much different the Mongolian, especially the nomad culture and the Han-Chinese. They' both saw the mother nature with different intentions. So imposing one land's rule to another does not work and that's the film's most important message.\r\n\r\nVery sad the film was not realistic since it was based on a real story. Visually it was very good, especially the locations were spellbinding and used so well to tell a story, but the animal behaviours were too silly, something like that happen in the children's stories. Then there's evidence the animals were harmed during making it, so feels uncomfortable in many scenes and I won't advise kids to watch it if they're very fond of the animals. In that angle this film got a completely a wrong motion picture rating. If you are a light hearted, you should as well turn away from it. Because even though they won't show the killings, in a few segment they were just graphics and make-up, but still you are definitely going to feel the pain, very disturbing film.\r\n\r\nIn a few scenes, feels bad for what Mongols regrets for letting the Hans to do all the terrible things to their land despite at one stage of the history they were more superior than them. At least the film ended on a positive note, only because of the alteration in the screenplay from the controversial book. It was originally selected to represent the previous Oscars, but soon it replaced with another to avoid the International humiliation. I think the film was not that terrible, but not being true to the book was the issue. It is very hard to suggest it, it might upset you for the various reasons, so all I can say is choose wisely.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"57951efc92514142690041b1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57951efc92514142690041b1","movie_id":309302}

Now she's an old and American citizen, but after her sister's death the possibilities favours her when she meets a young lawyer. So these two sets a journey on one focus, that is to reunite with the family's art. How? That's the story of this beautiful movie to tell.\r\n\r\nWell, the story was a very good one as inspired by the real, but looks a so simple drama as a film, even the twist and turns. Only if it would have been a better narration, at least in a few important portions, the awards would have been poured on it rather just praises. Anyhow Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds combo were excellent, but individually she ruled and he was a low key performance. Though the overall movie wins with the inspiring characters than the narration.\r\n\r\nThe two different timeline stories edited into one random presentation. One is the past events and the other is the present that reveals simultaneously Maria's struggles. Really, it was better than I thought, one of the best drama with the backdrop of the world war 2.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Inspired by the comics to defeat an enemy.\r\n\r\nIt was made in the style of the 80s movie and the story sets in the future, that mean in the late 90s. If your childhood were the 90s, probably you would have seen plenty of the 80s sci-fi films and this one is dedicated to the fans of that era. Kind of semi-superhero movie like 'Super' and 'Defendor'. Other than that this film has nothing to do with 'New Kids Turbo' and its sequel 'Nitro' as I initially presumed it might the third in the series.\r\n\r\nI thought it was a pretty cool flick, so much fun. Sort of replicates the recent 'Mad Max' film, but both the flicks came into the production at a same time and this one is not all about the chasing or even a road flick. So I think it just inspired by the previous trilogy from that franchise, where automobiles are replaced by the BMXes here. Kind of eco-friendly movie!\r\n\r\nAs the many post-apocalyptic themes depicted, this one as well prioritised about a regional conflict for the source of water. A territory where a ruthless man controlled it and he kills who pose a threat to his crown. There comes an act of revenge from a boy and a girl along a man who challenge him. Who's going to that win the battle is what the finale of the movie.\r\n\r\n> \"A man never knows how strong he is\r\n> until being strong is the only choice he has.\"\r\n\r\nThe first impression was the movie is for all, especially for the kids, but once the action parts begin to take place, my stance has changed. There are no high-end stunts, but too much of blood and gore. Although, nothing was so serious, somehow keeps entertaining and sometimes slightly disgusting, but the momentum was held at a moderate pace throughout the film.\r\n\r\nThe character Apple was so sweet and cute who actually lifted the movie's spirit with her funny, bubbly part, but also disappoints to learn the what's her kind is. Pretty much she helped to bring faintly a romantic atmosphere around which I was not expected. A simple story and a simple twist with the good characters and the fine supporting visuals.\r\n\r\nDefinitely an above average, but still not that awesome, excepting it is very enjoyable for the first watch. The filmmakers were the quite newcomers, but proved enough with their abilities, under a limited budget to give an acceptable standard flick. If you are okay with the B flicks, then it won't upset you, except you are not familiar with those types. I think it will hit a cult status moving into the next decade and so on among the B movie fans.\r\n\r\n6.5\/10","id":"568a3311c3a3680e01003f7b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/568a3311c3a3680e01003f7b","movie_id":310135}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Now who would think that the kiddie-inspired, Science Fiction post-apocalyptic \u2018Turbo Kid\u2019 could motivate one\u2019s appetite for nostalgic cheese-ridden action yarns? Well, the directing\/writing trio of Francois Simard, Yoann-Karl Wissell and Anouk Wissell deliver the devilish gaudy goods in this frolicking futuristic fantasy that begs for audiences to reminisce about such off-beat and clich\u00e9d guilty pleasures that are so goofy-minded and gory but infectiously high-spirited for one\u2019s disturbed liking.\r\n\r\nInstinctively, \u2018Turbo Kid\u2019 looks to shrewdly ridicule the jolting junk cinema with its homage to such trashy treasures ranging from the lopsided likes of gems \u2018The New Barbarians\u2019 and 2019,  \u2018After The Fall Of New York\u2019 to even saluting high-minded 80\u2019s roguish schlock such as the international cult favorite \u2018The Road Warrior\u2019. Fortified with kinetic kookiness and an off-kilter preference for its cockeyed convictions, \u2018Turbo Kid\u2019 generates an appealing penchant for cheeky outlandishness that we all relish in our taste for low-grade, salacious cinema.  \r\n\r\nAstutely, \u2018Turbo Kid\u2019 sets out to do what it is compelled to do and that is to trigger the hungry imagination for yesteryear\u2019s yearning for those gloriously cheapened, low-budgeted cornball capers that oddly registered with the fanboys\u2019 appreciation for convoluted, sensationalistic big screen cheeseball escapism that this unruly genre provided on many occasions for the sanctioned unintentional chuckles.  The gruesome threesome of Simard and the Wissells refreshingly never shy away from the bombastic serving of violence and hokey-minded hedonism  that are the true trademark of throwaway entertainment at its finest.\r\n\r\nAs the lone wolf adolescent in the distant future of 1997, the orphaned Kid (\u2018Degrassi: The Next Generation\u2019s Munro Chambers) survives in a tattered world defaced by ominous components of Mother Nature (namely acid rain) and the aftermath results of nuclear destruction. The existence for The Kid, frankly speaking, is bleak and nothing to write home about enthusiastically. Nevertheless, he keeps himself engaged with what he likes to do consistently whether it is chilling out in his bomb shelter-style quarters, riding freely on his BMX bike or browsing comic books\u2013particularly his favorite issue of \u2018Turbo Man\u2019 .\r\n\r\nOf course things become quite interesting for The Kid when he meets up with the ever-so-quirky Apple (Laurence Labeouf), a young woman whose strangeness and mysterious backstory becomes an attractive magnet for the soon-to-be daring hero. The opportunity arises for The Kid to show his heroic chops (much like his idol Turbo Man) when his galpal Apple\u2019s safety is jeopardized by resident fiend Zeus (Michael Ironside). Not only does the diabolical Zeus kidnap Apple but looks to manipulate and dictate the region\u2019s precious water supply. Naturally, this does not sit well with the miffed Kid as he already harbors resentment towards Zeus based on past unkind dealings with the Villainous One.\r\n\r\nAs luck would have it The Kid discovers what appears to be Turbo Man\u2019s powered costume and arsenal of skills. Conveniently, this is enough to transform the youngster into a formidable force to take on the dastardly Zeus, restore the honor of the loopy Apple and save the day in general. Not too bad for a wandering cad that escaped his reality in a reliable comic book only to become a real-life comic book rescuer in the form of his worshiped mentor Turbo Man.\r\n\r\nSure, the mayhem and mockery is indeed over-the-top and as lame as the proceedings are in reality one still cannot stop from looking away. \u2018Turbo Kid\u2019, with its bloody wackiness in tow, toasts its creative absurdity proudly. The corrosive camp factor works because the mindset is geared for unapologetic subversion into a flagrant fantasy that wears its badge of debauchery with sordid honor. The exaggerated and bizarre displays of colorful chaos as drowned out in crazy-minded outfits, challenging bike chases, manufactured doom-and-gloom predicaments and the basic plodding of good versus evil make \u2018Turbo Kid\u2019 an ambitiously naughty and boisterous delight. Clearly, the filmmakers demonstrate their affinity for the aforementioned off-balanced furious-minded fluff of the 80s and early 90s that invaded video shelves the same way weary soldiers approached the unknown shores of Normandy.  Combative, unconventional and guaranteed to impale one\u2019s exposed guts on a spiked iron fence \u2018Turbo Kid\u2019 is weird and wonderful if only for the afterglow of basking in the art of dimwitted decadence so lovingly realized in the not-so-forgettable impulsive retro flicks of shining shame from the years past.\r\n\r\nTurbo Kid (2015)\r\n\r\nEMA Films\r\n\r\n1 hr 33 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Munro Chambers, Laurence Labeouf, Michael Ironside, Edwin Wright, Romano Orzari and Aaron Jeffery\r\n\r\nDirected by: Francois Simard, Anouk Wissell and Yoann-Karl Wissell\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: Unrated\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction\/Post Apocalyptic Action and Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)","id":"562080e59251411e1f001cf7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/562080e59251411e1f001cf7","movie_id":310135}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Debutant director Arokiyadoss has the right material \u2014 a political satire \u2014 for Goundamani's comeback film, but the patchy writing and crude direction take away the sting, leaving us with a film that has to ride solely on the strength of its leading man and nothing else. In better hands, 49-O could have become a 'talking point film' because its subject is socially relevant. It talks about the importance of farmers, their troubles, farm lands being easy catch for real estate developers, political corruption, cash for votes, and the ineffectiveness of our electoral system.\r\n\r\nBut these ideas have not been woven together properly seamlessly (the scenes have an episodic quality about them) and have also not been transferred properly to the screen, so that it ends up as a preachy video that is anything but cinema. Take for example the scene where Savuri has to talk about how his villagers have been swindled, why 49-O is a toothless (\"Bomma kaththi\" as the character puts it) electoral option for voters and raises valid questions on the electoral process. It should make us empathise with these characters and angry at corrupt politicians, but what we just do not feel these emotions. For contrast, one just has to look at the scene in Kaththi where Vijay talks about the plight of farmers.\r\n\r\nArokiyadoss seems to have been content with getting a 'yes' from the reclusive Goundamani that he doesn't seem to have bothered much about the script. The comedian does what is expected of him and in fact, the film shows that he still has it to deliver zingers that can make us laugh and also think, though age does seem to have mellowed him to an extent.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> The same old romance formula, but a woman's version.\r\n\r\nI never saw the trailer, but I thought it was Rebel Wilson's film, that's who I saw on the poster and decided to go for it. In the movie she never came, then realised I was tricked or I failed to pay attention while choosing the film. So then, who the heck was this actress. Never seen or heard before, Not so romantic or funny, totally boring. I thought She might be Will Ferrell's sister. I'm kind of frustrated because of either the movie or the actors were not excited to keep going with my watch.\r\n\r\nThis is the same old story, but instead it's a woman's version. A playgirl loses the someone who loves her sincerely for what she's and later finds the one true love of her life, but it ends in a disaster due to her past. So how everything is going to be fixed is what brings curtain to the narration.\r\n\r\nIt might be a well known plot, but a well crafted movie as well by one of the best comedy filmmaker who has given many awesome ones. Despite his effort to make it big it is also his bottom of the list from his filmography. Well, not all the actors were so bad, John Cena was so funny with his gay jokes, but lot like in a guest appearance. The basketball superstar that I don't know him. Definitely better than average only if a quality movie like this would have had a proper lead actress. I think some people would find it hilarious, but not to me and I wanted to like it, but I couldn't.\r\n\r\n5\/10","id":"564778259251413ae1003dc2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/564778259251413ae1003dc2","movie_id":271718}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Okay, so maybe cinema life has not been so kind to hunky hotshot Taylor Lautner in the aftermath of the phenomenon \u2018Twilight\u2019 film series that had a majority of hysterical young female admirers drooling over their bags of stale movie house popcorn. The good news for the youthful muscled Romeo is that there will be \u2018Twilight\u2019 tarts lining up just to see Lautner read the middle section of your Aunt Mabel\u2019s phonebook. In the derivative and disjointed street thriller \u2018Tracers\u2019, the chiseled Lautner will certainly be a draw for the hormonal honeys out there looking for an excuse to scream at the top of their hysterical lungs. As a vanity vehicle for the ex-Twilight lothario the underwhelming \u2018Tracers\u2019 may very well take a backseat to the option of watching the film\u2019s star recite the aforementioned phonebook.\r\n\r\nThe best sell in \u2018Tracers\u2019 is indeed Lautner\u2019s kinetic physicality for athletically bouncing around in a synthetic, boneless urban suspense piece. The doubts are not questioned in Lautner\u2019s labeling as being an impressive physical specimen. After all, the performer certainly gives it his all in assuring that his fitness and finesse are on display to charge \u2018Tracers\u2019 with a sense of fueled urgency. It is too bad that director Daniel Benmayor oversees a fast-paced but flaccid actioner that offers a skimpy story in between the impressive gymnastic gestures of Lautner\u2019s harried character.\r\n\r\nSo what is the fundamental foundation that feeds the relevance of \u2018Tracers\u2019 existence? Well, in addition to showing off the streetwise marvelous moves as demonstrated by the movie\u2019s lead star, the gimmick involves acrobatic movements known as parkour. Hey, \u2018Tracers\u2019\u2026the mid-80s called and it wants its outdated fad back! Sure, the art of parkour was indeed an instrumental wonderment that gave distinction to the awe-dropping French import \u2018District B13\u2032 but, in the case of \u2018Tracers\u2019, the stunts looks woefully repetitive and never really gives any considerable flavor to the strained action or transparent storyline.\r\n\r\nNew York-based bike messenger Cam (Lautner) zips through the streets much like an errand bullet from a shaky gun. The cluttered and busy streets of the Big Apple does not stop Cam from doing what he does best on bicycle wheels in terms of darting to his assigned destinations. However, the crafty Cam receives some considerable heat when he is targeted by tough Chinese gangsters to whom he owes some big time money. Cam\u2019s antagonistic street thugs are not too patient with the beleaguered biker to grant them an expected payback. Bottom line: Cam needs to pay up or he and his loved ones will pay the ultimate price by being snuffed out from the street-minded riff raff.\r\n\r\nThings start to look up for the compromised Cam when his accidental bike crash results in his meeting (and inevitable attraction) to the fetching bad girl Nikki (Maria Avgeropoulos). The \u2018parkour princess\u2019 was ducking and dodging the cops prior to her rimmed run-in with Cam. Nikki, both sensual and sinister, triggers Cam\u2019s imagination and spoils him instantly with a new bike, not to mention his introduction to her parkour partners-in-crime, a bunch of high-flying, graffiti-loving street renegades that spend the majority of the time leaping and flipping on the city\u2019s concrete surfaces. Nikki\u2019s clique seem to hop and bop more convincingly than a twitchy kangaroo with a hot foot. Alas, Cam has a new crew and has adapted to the physical philosophies of parkour where he predictably excels at without question. Even the hyperactive group\u2019s leader Miller (Adam Raynor) is tickled by Cam\u2019s ability to soar in the air and make the hardened urban streets his personalized pouncing playground.\r\n\r\nIn its own clumsy way, \u2018Tracers\u2019 is well-intentioned because it strives to promote the art of parkour in the spirit of all those conveyor belt break-dancing movies that the studios kept churning out in the mid-1980s. There are some spunky and well shot scenes with New York\u2019s edgy landscape as the convenient backdrop for action-packed mischievousness. Plus \u2018Tracers\u2019  is\u2026um\u2026Taylor-made for the fit-looking Lautner to showcase his inherent athleticism on full display for the masses (read: the ladies) to be awed over with wonderment. Nevertheless, \u2018Tracers\u2019 never taps into anything innovative or creative to go along with the aerobatic awareness that the movie pushes so eagerly.  The flat and thinly-veiled story, patched-together montages of parkour-inspired pluckiness, the toothless tease of an eye-rolling love triangle among Lautner\u2019s Cam, Avgeropoulos\u2019s Nikki and Raynor\u2019s Miller and the ambivalence of Lautner\u2019s Cam to stroll in the garden of trouble-making tendencies all renders \u2018Tracers\u2019 as a weak-kneed crime caper that ironically lacks any genuine animated bounce-and-pounce.\r\n\r\nGranted this flimsy, frenetic vehicle is structured for Lautner\u2019s on-screen fitness skill set but the spotty material never quite capitalizes on the star\u2019s charisma or potential to enhance the skimpy plot with some meaty revelation. The stunning Avgeropoulos serves as automatic eye candy but her Nikki never manages to muster up any mysteriousness or cunning curiosity pertaining to her \u2018dangerous diva\u2019 persona.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the pulsating platitudes in Benmayor\u2019s impish but incomplete tumble-and-rumble tale is without a noticeable trace.\r\n\r\nTracers (2015)\r\n\r\nSaban Films\r\n\r\n1 hr  34 mins.\r\n\r\ncast: Taylor Lautner, Maria Avgeropoulos, Adam Raynor, Rafi Gavron, Sam Medina, Luciano Acuna Jr., Josh Yadon and Johnny M.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**About a man who has nothing to lose and a man who can't afford another failure!**\r\n\r\nIt was based on the book of the same name, which was originally inspired by the real events. But there's a striking resemblance between this and the Truman Capote story. About a man who is serving in prison for slaying a family and his encounter with a reporter\/writer. And so their relationship strengthens as they sit together to discuss about each others life event. That is the main film, which covers the majority of the film, but feels like they revealed nothing much, particularly for our convince, yet the story moved forward.\r\n\r\nFor the Truman Capote, there are two films, including the one I liked 'Infamous' and the other one is 'Capote'. Besides these two, there's another title called 'In Cold Blood' that reveals the other side of the event, before Truman enters the scene. So that's what I'm interested after watching this film. Because right now they preferred to portray a struggling writer and the crime parts were not given any importance. That means it is basically about a reporter\/writer doing a story\/book.\r\n\r\nIf they decide to make that one with the same cast as a prequel, then James Franco gets into an action which probably would give a good reason behind such crime where in this film the viewers can't end watching surely what really happened. Both, Jonah Hill and James Franco was really impressive in this. Felicity Jones had the small presence, but was in a main role. It was a feature film debut for the director and he was well managed to make it decently. Overall, for me, it was a good film, not the best, but can be watched once.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"5887dc69c3a36859ec0047f2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5887dc69c3a36859ec0047f2","movie_id":245706}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Recycled theme with the bike and Parkour stunts.\r\n\r\nI think the first time I saw a movie that had Parkour in it was the 'District B13'. After that plenty of flicks came, among them this one as well. The movie was about a struggling young bike messenger who meets a girl belong to Parkour gang. Later he joins them that changes his fate, but whether he gets the girl or not, that tells with the thrilling story development and some amazing stunts.\r\n\r\nEver since the 'Twilight' series, I wanted Taylor Lautner to make his foot steady in his acting career. Because I was rooting his werewolves gang in that movie. His last movie I saw was three years ago, 'Abducted' that did not go well. At least this one looked much better, but not enough. Like always I hope he comes back stronger.\r\n\r\nConsidering this film, the story was as old as the cinemas. A reused plot, there's nothing new. More like another version of 'Point Break', but everything was under a limit. Adding the Parkour and bike stunts to it, gives somewhat a new flavour. The young actors and fresh faces were highlights. From coming under the B movie category, it is simply a nice entertainer, but appraising from the out of that, definitely a disappointment. In the end everything is how you look it and what you get from it.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"5697a69ac3a3683aec002170","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5697a69ac3a3683aec002170","movie_id":290764}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Spending one final quality time with an old friend.\r\n\r\nIt is not that hard to describe, I mean the entire story in a couple of lines, but scene by scene it embarks on the different level. A very ordinary tale that takes place in less than one week time, at a same time it catches your attention in a gentle manner. A perfect movie with the balanced contents. I admit, this is not what I expected, but still delivered the same quality differently. It takes us to the various locations to capitalise the concept and gives an idea how the real people in the real world express during their distressed time. I think I kind of liked its rich screenplay and the overall production quality.\r\n\r\nThe movie was very slow, definitely need patience to watch it. It opened in a snowy Canadian residential area and soon begins to follow a middle ages man called Tomas saying goodbye to his family to board a plane for Madrid to meet his old pal, Julian. This unexpected visit gives an opportunity for Julian, a single father to open his heart to talk about the future plan, especially for his loving dog, Truman. The rest of the movie follows their lead by revealing some of the unknown to about each other.\r\n\r\nYes, the title name was a dog character. It took some times to figure it out why and how important was this name for the movie. Almost the entire watch, only in the end scene, it all made sense. Besides, that is the part I fell for it, I think it was the best way to conclude.  I love this kind of theme, this is where my softer side unfolds and feel the depth of the character or the tale that intended to strike emotionally. But the thing is, it was not a tearjerker drama as I wanted or it should have been.\r\n\r\n> \"People don't know what to say to me.\r\n> They smell death and they get scared.\"\r\n\r\nAnother unique narration that dealt with having friendship in the front row for its simple ride. It might be a plot that evolved around two friends' four days wandering everywhere, but covered family issues as well, especially the father-son relationship for a brief time, but strongly. It took all the time in the beginning, but the second half was very interesting after it makes you comfort with the characters and enough story development to move on from there.\r\n\r\nIt was a less fun, but a more meaningful movie than I thought. All the comedies were dark, it is unfortunate not to have even a small smile. The main source for it was the argument caused by the differences between the friends over what they decided to do, but in the end held back to normalcy as the character were matured and had a good understanding.\r\n\r\nSo the comedy is only the tag that attached to the movie, but it was a very absorbing topic on its progress till the final minute. Yet, I'm very upset with a sex scene that definitely out of the synchronisation with the rest of the story. When everything was going so smooth it appeared from nowhere like a twist in the tale, I felt that was totally inappropriate. And also that 100 seconds changed the fate of the movie from a PG-13 to R product, though there was no strong nudity.\r\n\r\nIt was effortless, but exceptional performances, especially by the leading two including the Argentinian superstar Ricardo Darin. And I don't forget the dog in the title role, but sadly his screenspace was very short. Obviously this movie is not designed to impact on all the viewers, so it is going to fail to satisfy a few, especially for its slow presentation without a cheerable background score. That means I suggest you to choose it carefully, by learning what the movie offers against what you actually want from it. But overall, it is surely worth to give a try.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"56cdf05d92514152ab00017b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56cdf05d92514152ab00017b","movie_id":341744}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"In this age of instant protests and calls for ban, Adhik Ravichandran, for a debutant, is audacious enough in having made this romantic comedy that sends up things that the so-called upholders of culture hold sacred, and where the romance is mainly fuelled not by heart but by hormones and plenty of alcohol. One of his two heroines offers a drink to the hero and asks him to use her as the side dish, while the second downs two beer bottles at the same time and tells him to piss off when he tells her not to drink. One doesn't mind admitting that she has had sex after breaking up with him and the other accuses him of not trying to make out with her. One character tells the hero that virginity is as dead as dinosaurs! And despite behaving like the average Tamil cinema hero (who considers TASMAC a home away from home, lectures women on morals while lusting after them all the time), his hero comes across as a sap who always finds out that he can never command the interest of a woman.\r\n\r\nThe film is about Jeeva (a very convincing GV Prakash who seems to have lost the inhibition that could be sensed in his debut, Darling), who falls in love with his childhood friend Ramya (Anandhi). When she breaks up with him, he instantly chooses to go out with his other childhood friend Aditi (Manisha Yadav). But she, too, ditches him, and now, Jeeva goes back to wooing Ramya, little realising that the game has changed. His uncle Visu (VTV Ganesh) and Ramya's aunt Simran (Simran) try to help him out and act as his love gurus, though they clearly see him for what he is \u2014 a pathetic loser.\r\n\r\nThe best thing that can be said about Trisha Illana Nayanthara is that it is unabashed about being crass and sexist and wears its 'A' certificate as a badge of honour. There are innumerable innuendos (at one point, Ramya says, \"Naan onna thorandhu kaataren\") and adult comedy (Jeeva makes out with a doll as practice) and misogynist dialogues, but they do not come across as exploitative but rather harmless fun. And the film also has moments of genuine absurdity (like three pregnancies happening at the same time with an MGR-like figure taking charge, a psycho who pops up now and then to throw bricks at everyone) that prove us that the director clearly knows what he is doing.\r\n\r\nBut the blatant pandering to the fan bases of Ajith and Vijay (an unfortunate trend in Tamil films of late) becomes rather annoying after a point. And the uninvolving songs (save for Mutham Kodutha Maayakaari) and a sub-plot involving Simran and her scientist husband (Yuhi Sethu) only make the film longer than it should ideally be.","id":"5604b75e925141027f001166","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5604b75e925141027f001166","movie_id":346667}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> He's a gifted writer yet different from others around him.\r\n\r\nI think it was a sensitive subject for a movie, especially to be made in Hollywood. Communism and United States are like two opposite poles. So portraying an American who supports it is a challenging task for any moviemakers. But the director of 'Meet the Parents' did a great job. Yep, you don't have to take sides while a watch. Of course, the movie discussed the issue of conflict over the types of ruling system, but it was only in the initial part that kind of looked strong. While the story advancing, that topic completely weakened and concentrated more on other stuffs. So don't expect it to be a fight for the constitutional, but a wonderful biography of one of the talented screenwriters in the history of Hollywood.\r\n\r\nCommunism or Democracy, whatever you support that does not matter here to choose whether you want watch it or not. Because this movie very smartly outlined how people are affected when they believe differently from the majority of others around. In the opening, I thought it could be an anti-hero tale, but later it transformed the angle of presentation and indeed in the end the main character turned into a most likeable one.\r\n\r\nI liked Dalton Trumbo, not for what he preferred to support, but how he handled it all. The rival group is who made it a big concern, otherwise he is a neglectable for his egoist nature. Bryan Cranston was amazing in the title role. It's his best in the lead role, after only to the 'Breaking Bad'. Hope he's going to make more lead role films now after. Kind of of inspiring flick, of course, from his professional angle. Definitely one of the best films of the 2015 and deserved its Oscar nod.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"56cdee2b92514152bc000174","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56cdee2b92514152bc000174","movie_id":294016}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**When journalism becomes limbless!**\r\n\r\nA surprisingly good film, you can compare it with the Oscar winner 'Spotlight'. But it was not popular as that one, because it was about the American politics, so seems the world did not care much. However, going down in the domestic market was a very sad. It was directed by the newcomer and he did a wonderful job, even for penning a good screenplay. But it was based on the memoir by Mary Mapes called 'Truth and Duty'.\r\n\r\nIt's a journalism theme, sets in during the months before the 2004 presidential election. It was focused on the CBS's famous news series '60 Minutes Wednesday' where its episodes reveals some of the copy documents how George W. Bush altered them get into the military in the 80s. Soon the producer to the host, everyone who involved in that show receive a backlash. In the remaining parts, it aims to disclose how the claimer decides to fight the issue and would they succeed?\r\n\r\nCate Blanchett was never attracted to me, but I never doubted her performances. So in this, she was amazing and quite physically looked beautiful. One of her great character display, and it should have nominated for the various awards, but I don't understand why it was discarded totally. The other actors too were awesome, Especially Robert Redford was superb as a news anchor. He's a bit old, otherwise I would have expected him to play Don Trump in a movie, maybe a biopic or comedy.\r\n\r\nLike the film revealed what happened to Mapes, I think those invisible and powerful men made this film does not get into the spotlight. But as I've seen, I say it's a must see film of the year, if you're interested in the US and its politics. How the story ends is sad, but I've seen other journalism films that highlights their strength, whereas this one was opposite. I loved the lines Cate delivered at one of the final scenes. I hope you watch it at least after reading my review.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"57d30d11925141548d0008bc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57d30d11925141548d0008bc","movie_id":300693}

Is it a way of exorcising her demons? Or something sinister?\r\n\r\nYou can see and feel that there's a real good film here trying to get out, a meditation on a number of things that only victims of heinous crimes can truly understand. There's interesting observations on sociopathy, fractured family values and loneliness, but in spite of the sterling efforts of Pike to make it work, it's constructed so poorly, too often wearisome, and it cheats by not paying off on the slow- burn approach. The final revelation only makes you realise that it has taken an hour and half of film to achieve what American Mary did in 20 minutes! Add in that Nolte is utterly wasted and that Fernandez simply isn't strong enough for the role (he's the guy that isn't Joaquin Phoenix), and you got one messy movie that's best avoided. 5\/10","id":"57430ca7c3a3686ffd001ec2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57430ca7c3a3686ffd001ec2","movie_id":333381}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> When the case needs a physical evidence, but it can't reach to get one.\r\n\r\nWell, it is an investigation theme, something like the Oscar winner 'Spotlight'. After a teen girl Angela was reported of the sexual abuse, a detective named Bruce takes a special interest in solving the case. With the help of a psychologist, lots of ugly truth comes out. But the lack of the solid evidence makes the case slowly slip away from his hands. While his desperate effort to find whoever behind it, it only affect more Angela and her family. So how the story end is told with a twist in the third act.\r\n\r\nIt was inspired by the real events of the late 80s. About the rise of the Satanic culture when panic was among the peoples of the United States. One of the best investigative films, with well developed mysteries around the plot. I found hard to predict, especially the twist was simple, but unexpected. Ms Watson was okay, but Ethan Hawke was excellent. From an awesome filmmaker, another wonderful film, yet not anywhere near to his other great works.\r\n\r\nWhenever a film based on the real, especially about crimes reveals the truth, we the people believe it and pour our supports to the victim. In that perspective, this film tests our capability to understand between the good and bad. Sometimes the things are not what it is supposed to be because of the overlook. Such theme was this that neatly narrated on the screen.\r\n\r\nI know this is not a masterpiece, but I don't understand why it is very underrated. This is actually a better psychological-thriller you would find in the recent time.

In addition to that, it also entertains, so there's your reason to go for it.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58013b63c3a36848f8000b28","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58013b63c3a36848f8000b28","movie_id":308084}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The flea, the flay and an offspring.**\r\n\r\nIt's shocking to find how much this film was underrated. Certainly it is not a fairytale like from the Disney production. That mean not for the children, but for the adults. Based on the collections of tales by some 17th century Italian poet. All the tales blended together so well, You won't even feel the familiarity with the original tale, because the modifications were at its best. So I appreciate the writer first, and then the director, followed by the actors.\r\n\r\nSince the film has a multiple story narrative layer, like three, the opening and the ending was common to all. But soon after the initiative, the tales go separate ways with its own twists and turns and conclusion, till again falling back in the line to finish it off the film. First a royal couple tend to do anything to have their own child. After many years, having no luck with the pregnancy, they now follow the instruction given by a necromancer. The result is most certain, but not without a negative effect.\r\n\r\nThe desperate couple sacrifices greater to have a child. The remaining story takes place in the few years later where a royal born child and his mother have differences. A fresh complication arises that puts the mother again in a tight spot. How it is going to be solved narrated in the following parts.\r\n\r\nIn the second story, the king of a hill castle is obsessed with his new insect pet. That leads him to neglect his own daughter who is dreaming of getting married and have a great life. But the things are not going well between father and daughter with her mother's absence. When the king comes to realise that, he comes with an agenda to achieve two things in one shot. That does not please his daughter, and soon she ends up in the hands of an ogre. The remaining is to tell us what happens to her in a thrilling way.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a father's responsibility. If his wife was alive, their daughter would have been taken care at best. Compared to the others, this tale gets more exciting and edgy, even the locations. Of course they have used blue\/green screens, but still beautiful like the one from the top of the castle scene. I liked the casting for this, particularly the princess part.\r\n\r\n> \"The equilibrium of the world must be maintained.\"\r\n\r\nThe third tale is about a lustful king. One day when he hears a woman singing in a beautiful voice, the next minutes he lands on her home's front door, not knowing the woman is aged and has the wrinkle skin. But she and her sisters play along hiding behind the door and asks for a favour in order to win them back, I mean one of them. So how the rest of the story develops and who gets what, followed by a twist, it comes to an end.\r\n\r\nIt is a spectacular film. But not visually as the fairy tales told in the present Hollywood films. Particularly, it minimised the computer related special effects. So it was more realistic, yet you will get that fantasy feel with how the tales shape up. It's a black comedy, and that's an absolutely well done part. You know designing the dark humours are not an easy task and this film has three layers, though not all of them has them. The conclusions were so perfect, reminds us the happy and sad are the parts of our life.\r\n\r\nOver two hours long film, there's no drag in the narration. The length is because of the three tales and each one was narrated with a pretty good pace. But still it gives the impression the film is slow and that's for being silent like less background score in the most of the parts. From Salma Hayek to Toby Jones, Vincent Cassel, all were so good. The casting was the advantage for the film to shape up well. Since it is an international project, that will help the global audience to their comfort.\r\n\r\nThe director's first English language film and I think I'm going to keep an eye on his future projects. Certainly I have not seen such film like this, not in the todays cinema. The film was like in the old days. It does not deliver a couple of quick jokes and\/or breathtaking visual effects, but the depth of the tale was good. The writers, director did not hesitate to add extra minutes to get what they wanted. I would have liked it if another layer of the tale was included and extended for another 30 or more minutes. For the grown ups, I suggest it not to miss, you won' get a film like this often.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"58446d659251416a8000c996","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58446d659251416a8000c996","movie_id":314405}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Romeo-Juliet of Tanna island tribe.**\r\n\r\nThe film is this year's version of 'Embrace of the Serpent' at the Oscars. Yes, it is one of the five films to clash for the tag of the Best Foreign Language Film on the behalf of the Australia. Though the entire film was shot on Vanuatu's Tanna island and Nauvahal was the language spoken in it with the natives performing the film roles.\r\n\r\nThis was really a stunning film. I had a misconception during my childhood that all tribal people, mostly from the deep jungles are so cruel just like the North Sentinel Island people. I never visited such place or met such people, but some documentaries and feature films taught me many things. This is one of those films to highlight them and their culture.\r\n\r\nThe people from the Tanna island rejected to adopt the outside culture just to save theirs, which is used to be thousands of years old. Everything was taught to their kids, from hunting and gathering to the growing fruits, vegetables and livestocks. But they too have rivals with their neighbour tribe that sometimes end with casualties on the both sides. This film was a romance-drama, when the young couple's love was rejected by their elders, how they fought for it, which forced to bring a reform in their custom was told.\r\n\r\nThis is like the Vanuatu's version of Romeo-Juliet tale. While watching it, my heart was pounding faster. Because since I don't know these people and their traditions, I thought something terrible going to happen sooner or later. The film did not have any strong violence, but the storyline led to such situation often. Even in the final stage, they silently ended the narration with a message. But remember this film was based on the true story that took place in the 80s.\r\n\r\n> \"Our tribes are the last keepers of Kastom. We have to hold it tight to survive.\"\r\n\r\nTheir performances were natural, since the events of the film were based on their daily life. So they knew what they were doing. It was an advantage for the filmmakers, like they were making a documentary, despite they wrote the screenplay for it. Everyone played their own real life character to depict the actual event. Particularly the lead ones, Dain, Wawa, Selin and a few others were impressive. Awesome cinematography, as well as background score. The locations were amazing, including that live volcanic mountain. Despite their presence in the region for centuries, it looks untouched and wild.\r\n\r\nThis film is what something you won't see in your daily life. It was not a romance like in our society, but men and women falling in love in any culture\/society are the same. The film was not entirely a love tale, but step by step it gets there. In the initial parts, it was an introduction to their customs with a little fun. Followed by revealing they are not alone. Then comes the turn in the story where the remaining parts have a new fast paced thrill look.\r\n\r\nMy point is we have seen hundreds of romance films, but this is one of those rare ones where 90 per cent of the world never going to meet these real people in their lives. So thanks to the filmmakers for giving this beautiful precious film. The first feature film for the documentary filmmakers and it made into the American Academy Awards. A great achievement, especially recognising such film by the Australian film society, as well as the Academy juries for nominating it.\r\n\r\nI'll be looking forward and cheering for them on their red carpet appearance. Though this film has a less chance over Denmark's 'Under Sandet' which is the front-runner. Don't mind that, just watch this film, because it is worth on its own merit than watching it after winning an award. Recommended!\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"58b098b4925141751f000cbd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b098b4925141751f000cbd","movie_id":359151}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Roaming around Tehran in a taxi for 80 minutes.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the unique film, and the filmmaking I have seen. It is a docudrama, starred and directed by Jafar Panahi. It is my first film of his and I'm very impressed. I also learnt he was banned from making movies and to leave the country since last 5 years. But he took all the legal route possible to keep making them, and this movie is the result of it. He had made a couple of them before this, but with this he came outdoors to capture the streets of the Iranian capital.\r\n\r\nThis movie entirely set in a taxi, well, the cameras never leaves the car, but car roams around the city, Tehran. A real time movie that runs for nearly 80 minutes. There's no open or the end credits other than the title texts and some statements. The story was very interesting, that I don't know whether it was scripted or factual, but the planning was so good to shoot it in a low profile.\r\n\r\nAll the actors except the director were non pros. That definitely needs a loud applaud, because the outcome tells the quality of their exhibition. It gives a glimpse of the life as a taxi driver who sees the city through his eyes and meets the people. Some scenes were extremely funny, some were dark humours and some were thoughtful. Each time when a new character enters the frame, a new topic has brought with them and discussed, that mean the movie is totally engaging with a variety that keeps you hooked till the final.\r\n\r\n> \"We already have the world record of hangings after China.\"\r\n\r\nI think the end was very smart, because of that kind of conclusion and no post-production credits, I thought that's how the archives were smuggled out of the country and made it ready. But no one knows the truth how it all has been done, otherwise Jafar Panahi would have landed in a trouble. A rare gem and one of the best of 2015 that you must try it if you are a film fanatic.\r\n\r\nInitially, I mean before decide to watch it, I was not sure it will reach my expectations. When I sat for it, the experience was different and now I am extremely happy for giving it a try. Opinion might vary about the film, but the effort must be appreciated. Especially in a circumstance where the filmmaker has everything against him, I meant legally, but came strong in what he believes is his passion. That is inspiring and also for a risk he has taken really paid off.\r\n\r\nIt won a few Internation Filmfare awards and that's how I actually came to know about this. I'm positive this film won't disappoint you as well, well, if you are not looking for twists and turns like an intelligent or a big budget film. As I said, I could have not asked a better than this, a very simple yet entertaining movie.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"56cdf0fa92514152ab000194","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56cdf0fa92514152ab000194","movie_id":320006}
{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"The Invitation incites audiences to attend the most anxiety-inducing dinner party ever. Grief. The melancholic turmoil of loss. A catalyst for unwanted prominent personality alterations that change the very fabric of who we are. Each individual experiences sorrow and subsists through a variety of different methods. Some forgive and forget. Others harness the inability to progress, experiencing a stumbling block of anguish as they continually inflict psychological suffering upon themselves. It is irrefutably the most difficult emotion to overcome, and can overwhelm the strongest of personalities. Kusama\u2019s thrilling episode of \u2018Come Dine With Me\u2019 gradually explores the weight of life itself, simply by allowing a group of long-time friends the chance to discuss such a topic. Yet, what enables Kusama\u2019s slow-burn thriller to elevate itself into the top echelon of effective profoundness, is its simplicity.\r\n\r\nThere are no extravagant plot devices. No sublimely utilised twists. And certainly no misplaced character conveniences. By equipping grief and depression as a manifestation of the narrative, Kusama was able to demonstrate her incredibly astute direction through natural plausibilities. Will, portrayed accurately and captivatingly by Marshall-Green, exhumed indications of paranoia. A heightened consequence of his raging anguish. Constantly questioning the actions of other characters, such as locked doors, barred windows and unknown guests, he assumes the role of the audience\u2019s perception. We, as the viewer, examine and query each character reveal and emotional complexity simultaneously to Will\u2019s interrogative persona. He, essentially, is us. Instantly allowing viewers to relate to him in this unusual circumstance.\r\n\r\nSomething is not right with this dinner party. He feels it. We feel it. But his instincts are muted by the other guests, naturally due to his heightened state of sorrow, in order to maintain a civilised appearance. That, right there, is the representation of depression. Forced to hide what we really are enduring, with despondent thoughts circling our synapses. It\u2019s abundantly intelligent on Kusama\u2019s part, who elevated the screenplay to the stratosphere of uneasy, anxiety-inducing storytelling. With the assistance of Shore\u2019s cinematography, constantly blurring the outskirts and backgrounds of frames to enhance personable abandonment and solitude, Kusama hosted one of the most engaging dinner parties I\u2019ve ever attended. Inviting a naturally diverse cast of actors, ranging from different ethnicities to sexual orientation, who inhibit their own character qualities.\r\n\r\nAn array of components culminating in a third act that switches from first gear to a gear with incalculable speeds. The wine was served, my heart rate increased. I required a towel, I was sweating that much from anxiety. Ignoring the last minute of the feature, which was an eye-rolling moment to say the least, a slow-burn thriller such as this utilises a substantial amount of foreshadowing as its narrative device. Unfortunately, it is inescapable. However, Hay and Manfredi do their utmost best to keep the conversation flowing during times of prognostication. Shapiro\u2019s score is also worth mentioning for its sharp string-based chords that increase the chance of sweaty palms.\r\n\r\nThe Invitation, from the offset, is an incredibly simple thriller. Games are played, wine is served and a few arguments are bound to occur. However, if you cut through Kusama\u2019s simplistic exterior, you\u2019ll find an extraordinarily intelligent dinner party that evokes a powerful emotional connection. Just, y\u2019know, think twice before accepting an invitation...","id":"5e20665be004a6001398f289","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e20665be004a6001398f289","movie_id":306947}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Another peculiar dystopian tale set in the future.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of the Oscars nominated movie 'Dogtooth'. If you are familiar with his signature movie, you will find it so good. This is not the best movie I had seen that set in the future, but like any other it was another dystopian tale. A black comedy-romance with a decent storyline, performances and overall a nice entertainer.\r\n\r\nThe pace was very depressing, but I kept hooked to it for its frequent unpredictable scenes. The first act took place in a hotel which is the introduction to the odd world and the situation where the plot opens. When it moved to the 2nd half, especially after Rachel Weisz come into the frame, the entire scenario changed to atypical romance mode and kept that way till the last with a simple twist in the finale.\r\n\r\nColin Ferrell's character was something like the one from the movie 'Her'. But not the same movie, or the theme, except the combination of the genres. It was a good movie, I enjoyed it, but not as much as others say they did. IMPO, it is a one time watch movie for its peculiarness.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"56f3e9ae9251411a94002784","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56f3e9ae9251411a94002784","movie_id":254320}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Looking for a new start while the past is on the tail.\r\n\r\nThe 2016's Golden Globe nominee and also Finland's submission for the Oscars in the same year, but failed to get into the final five. Produced by the Baltic nations that set in when Estonia was a part of the USSR in the early 50s. It chronicles the story of Endel Nelis, a man who's on the run arrives in a small town called Haapsalu to teach the school children sports.\r\n\r\nAs his life is in danger, he intends to keep a low profile for a while. But seems everything is turning around him against him when he decides to teach his students fencing. It brings a large attention to the surroundings. Then comes a time where he must confront what he's hiding from which brings an end to the narration with little extended end part that reveals further details about the later event.\r\n\r\n> \"It's good to have them focus on something, keep them occupied. It takes their mind off things.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a very short story, but somehow the movie managed to run for the 90 minutes with a good pace. It did not cover the entire life story of Endel Nelis, but a small slice. So you definitely feel desperate to know about his past, but this film does not compromise on that. It has a great background score, and overall it is a very inspiring movie.\r\n\r\nThe actors were so simple, but very good in their parts. Other than the lead character Endel, the two kids Marta and Jaan were excellent. The romance was as its sub-plot, but the theme was sport so all the concentration on the fencing and nothing else. In a couple of sections it feels so cliche, but since it was based on the real, there's nothing to do about it than accepting it.\r\n\r\nFencing is not a popular sport in the world, so it is good to see a movie about it, but sadly it was not internationally well recognised. Like I said earlier the story was quite small, so I can't describe it in a large scale. I think I said everything I wanted to. In its limitedness the movie was pretty impressive. Not everyone who saw it going to suggest it for you, but it is worth a try.\r\n\r\n7\u00bd\/10","id":"57029336c3a36856a50033df","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57029336c3a36856a50033df","movie_id":322488}

The real loneliness.\r\n\r\nHowever, this movie's plot was too straight-forward as I see. Nearly every action proposed by the sorts of parties and organization was execute, taking the story forward without stagnation. But this also made everything look too artificial.

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"'The Martian\u2019 is definitely in the creative wheelhouse of filmmaker Ridley Scott whose Science Fiction sensibilities are grounded in colorful futuristic fantasies that tiptoe in grand whimsy.  The veteran auteur responsible for such pop cultural high-minded spectacles in \u2018Alien\u2019, \u2018Blade Runner\u2019 and even the mixed bag reception of \u2018Prometheus\u2019 certainly brings a sophisticated and thought-provoking vibe to the probing aura of \u2018The Martian\u2019. As with other Scott-helmed productions, \u2018The Martian\u2019 settles nicely in its majestic scope that taps into visual wonderment, humanistic curiosities, technical impishness and the surreal spryness of the SF experience.\r\n\r\nThe exploratory nature of \u2018The Martian\u2019 is its own noteworthy mission. Scott arms his frothy planetary odyssey with a sense of thematic inquisitiveness and intelligence while meshing human consciousness and scientific forethought. Clearly, \u2018The Martian\u2019 is astutely meditative and one can thankfully block in their memory banks some of Scott\u2019s mediocre misses (anyone care to recall the monumental mishaps in the form of the flimsy \u2018The Counselor\u2019 or the unintentional laughfest that was \u2018Exodus: Gods And Kings\u2019?). Rightfully so, \u2018The Martian\u2019 shares its crafty crater of similarities with other space-place spectacles that resonated with the imagination and innovation such as the Academy Award-winning \u2018Gravity\u2019 and the under-rated \u2018Interstellar\u2019. \r\n\r\nQuite frankly, \u2018The Martian\u2019 is elegantly arresting in its sheer skin for both the character studies and the major plight involved (particularly anchored on the shoulders of star Matt Damon as the contemplative lead) as well as the trademark Scott-induced flourishes that incorporate crisp and cunning visual special effects and a sweeping musical score that invites a transfixing hold on one\u2019s indelible spirit.\r\n\r\n\u2018The Martian\u2019 is the film adaptation of Andy Weir\u2019s best-selling tome. Scott\u2019s disciplined direction and screenwriter Drew Goddard\u2019s ambitious vision of Weir\u2019s compelling written material seemingly gels in convincing, cerebral fashion. The premise is not wildly original as it revisits the familiar foundation of a lost soul in survival mode trying to take on the treacherous surroundings with philosophical conviction. Nevertheless, this does not make \u2018The Martian\u2019 any less formidable in its soul-searching perspective. Scott\u2019s narrative on individualism and isolation with a tremendous technological tilt truly registers with boisterous bounce. Amazingly, Scott has assembled a capable and committed cast that are dedicated to making \u2018The Martian\u2019 look resourcefully skillful in its masterful mischievousness. Sure, The Martian\u2019s lengthy running time is staggering but it is compelling enough to invest in its meandering, adventurous narrative.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate nightmare (or perilous predicament\u2026take your choice) has been realised for one stranded space traveler in Mark Watney (Matt Damon). You see\u2026poor astronaut Watney had the misfortune of losing contact with his commander in Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and the rest of his crew when undergoing a scientific expedition to examine the terrain on Mars. Courtesy of an unexpected freakish storm Watney is separated from his comrades and believed to be dead as a result of the hazardous weather conditions on Mars. Lewis and her associates have no choice but to head back to Earth as searching for Watney may prove to be futile and endanger their lives as well.\r\n\r\nThus, Mark Watney is basically his own forced-upon version of \u2018Robinson Crusoe On Mars\u2019. There is no option for Watney but to allow his major survival instincts to kick in while striving for his jeopardised livelihood on the unpredictable and treacherous Red Planet\u2019s jagged landscape. Despite being stuck in hostile territory, Watney must use his background skills as a trained botanist to cultivate the scarce food he must rely on for his unconventional nutrition. The only \u2018companion\u2019 that Watney has to relate to rests in the recorded device that captures his harried thoughts through video diaries (at least this is more practical than what Tom Hanks\u2019s \u2018Castaway\u2019 character had in his possession with inanimate object best buddy, Wilson the volleyball).\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the devastating news about Mark Watney\u2019s possible death far beyond the reaches of home hits his colleagues understandably hard as tributes start to pour in remembrance of the seemingly dearly departed space pioneer. Soon, there is some measure of hope when NASA officials that include head honchos Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels from TV\u2019s \u2018The Newsroom\u2019), Vincent Kapoor (the Oscar-nominated Chiwetel Ejiofor from \u201912 Years A Slave\u2019) and Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) find evidence that Watney may be alive and ready to be rescued. Naturally, a sense of urgency is warranted to retrieve the weary astronaut without causing too many public relations waves. This puts press aide Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig) into damage control mode in particular.\r\n\r\nOkay...so it is not as scenic as Yellowstone National Park but the rocky region in THE MARTIAN still has some unassuming charm, right?\r\nOkay\u2026so it is not as scenic as Yellowstone National Park but the rocky region in THE MARTIAN still has some unassuming charm, right?\r\nImportantly, \u2018The Martian\u2019 is clever and carefully conceived because it does not have to rely on the excess baggage to convey its entertainment value in a series of hyperactive and hedonistic happenings. Ridley Scott is soundly methodical in presenting a low-key terrifying tale of loneliness and resiliency and what it takes to handle the pressure of adversity when there is no glimmer of humanity around to reinforce or remind one of such psychological obstacles. The intriguing factor here is the science-friendly serving of intelligence and insight that builds up the audience\u2019s appreciation for the underlying suspense. Interestingly, the conflict approached in \u2018The Martian\u2019 is not so much the back-and-forth high-scale struggles of man versus outlandish creature or an over-the-top diabolical deviant out to destroy the world in cartoonish fashion. No, the genuine combative and confrontational war of will is contained in one vulnerable man\u2019s ability to face the unknown grounded in both doubt and determination. Hence, Scott has made a palpable thinking man\u2019s Science Fiction exposition rooted in articulated forethought.\r\n\r\nDamon more than holds his own as the disillusioned botanist\/astronaut out on an ominous limb as his doomed odyssey of uncertainty is something that the common viewer can embrace and relate to without question. The perceived opulence in \u2018The Martian\u2019 is not contained in the film\u2019s production values per se (Scott has made previous movies with more visual vitality and purpose) but subtly showcased in the concepts of  knowledgeable tidbits concerning food rations, mathematical equations, crucial time tables, planetary probes, NASA-themed procedural techniques and aerodynamics considerations.\r\n\r\nHopefully, \u2018The Martian\u2019 is not dismissed as a foreign alien in the minds of ardent movie-going SF enthusiasts looking for a realistic and soulful space-age adventure with a refreshing backbone of scientific curiosity and candidness.\r\n\r\nThe Martian (2015)\r\n\r\n20th Century Fox\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 35 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Donald Glover and Benedict Wong\r\n\r\nDirected by: Ridley Scott\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction\/Space Adventure\/Science and Fantasy\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** 1\/2 stars (out of 4 stars)","id":"5619f70d9251415d3100129c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5619f70d9251415d3100129c","movie_id":286217}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Be cautious about what you're signing for!**\r\n\r\nDo you remember the Kubrick's film 'A Clockwork Orange', well, I'm not saying it is the same or similar film or storyline, but it reminded how it affects those people who are involved in a similar kind experiment. This is not too violent like that film, but it has its share where some might feel uncomfortable. Except in the opening and some other parts, the entire film takes place in a single location, most likely a studio setting. That part was well done, including the screenplay and direction. One of the rare films, about the rare subject, in some way it is a must see, but seems not suitable for everyone.\r\n\r\nIt is a nice concept, but it was based on the real. It all begins when a university professor decides to conduct an experiment in the summer holiday where some students came forward to be the part of it. It is a two week long project, so the first day goes off well and then the real problem begins when a small incident leads to a series of others in the following days. How the remaining days goes and what were the results of the experiment is disclosed in the later parts.\r\n\r\nThere are many edgy events; I thought it might get ugly at some point of the narration, but stayed real and ended with a good intention. It is a collection of good performances, everyone did their parts well. Particularly those student cast. Not many of them are famous, but the film provided quite an equal share of screenspace. It is not just an entertaining film, a character study as well. First of all, it is not a usual story, so if you decide to watch it, expect accordingly. I think it is a good film to give a try for once.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"57f40ca5925141398a000208","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57f40ca5925141398a000208","movie_id":308032}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Some people really change. From the outside.\r\n\r\nIf you watch this, I think you definitely bring the recent 'The Cobbler', 'The Deaths of Ian Stone' and many other high-concept films into the frame. Yep, it had a zero innovation, but smartly redesigned to bring a different outcome. Actually, it was based on the online film\/series (aka social film) of the same name and also heard it was very similar to the book 'Every Day' by David Levithan. My thought is, it did not stand up to my expectation, but very easy to follow and overall, I think it was not a bad movie.\r\n\r\nIf you are a fantasy film fan, then you should try it. A very fascinating fictional movie, that associated with romance. That means it's not your regular emotional-romantic-drama from Korea, but well pitched over all the complication in a relationship when a person is suffering from such a strange disorder. Just like the films 'The Time Traveler's Wife', '50 First Dates' and other similar ones about relationship problems.\r\n\r\nThe first one hour was so good, like everything happened in that period itself. From a simple introduction to a few of fun stuff, until the romance track takes over. The next half was kind of a drag, none any interesting events take place other than keep going blindly like it lost its way out. In those stages, most of the scenes would appear as you are anticipating. Somewhat weaken its strength in storytelling. Since this theme was atypical, on that basis, it makes a vast difference to keep us to stick with it.\r\n\r\n> \"People say true beauty lies inside,\r\n> but first impressions are equally important.\"\r\n\r\nAnyway, once you begin to watch an unusual love story like this, definitely you can't end it in the middle without knowing the conclusion. I feel, the end was okayish, no twist as you will know in the earlier itself, where it is heading. So nothing special at all, but it finishes it off quite a simple way. The only annoyance is that it was a 2 long hour movie, should have not exceeded more than 90 to 100 minute mark. What I'm saying is not an issue of falling into the boredom, but a stretch that should have remained short and sweet for a lovely film like this.\r\n\r\nThe actors were excellent, but the interesting thing among them was those who are all played the most important role, Woo-Jin. I have seen plenty of high-concept flicks, but I have never seen so many actors (definitely more than 100 actors) playing a same role in a one movie. The appearance was kept changing, but the director did a good job to keep them all at the same pace and intensity to bring Woo-Jin as a single character in behaviour.\r\n\r\nThese days, there's a high expectation for the movies coming out from the Korea. There are vast people around the world who follow either staggering crime-thriller or the sweet romantic-comedies from this region. I know when they take this up, they expect it to better Hollywood and European films. In that perspective, it will disappoint them, because I felt it was a great concept that fell into an ordinary for a few reasons. If you keep your mind narrow, then it might make your time worth spending for it. Personally, I liked it, but my only concern was the third act and a bit lengthy.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd\/10","id":"56b384c09251415320000cce","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56b384c09251415320000cce","movie_id":338729}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Caught between the national duty and a personal affair.**\r\n\r\nA biographical film set in the 17th century about the queen of Sweden. If a film was made based on the real means it has to be something very important thing to tell us like about the person or the historical events surrounding that person. It is a good film to learn the history of that part of the world if you do not belong there, and even for the natives with less knowledge about it. Multi- nationally produced film with a decent cast and production in the English language despite a Scandinavian tale.\r\n\r\nBesides, it is also a lesbian theme and one of the oldest real account I have seen in a film. Even today, not the whole world accepts it with the open arm. So on that perspective, I was curious about the film. Not to know how the film was made, but how they are, the real people dealt with such sexual concept in those days. Particularly, how the people around reacted to it. On that topic, the narration was not explicit. That means watching it expecting one of the best among its kind is a disappointment. But the film offers more from other angles of importance.\r\n\r\nAfter her father's death, the young Kristina was trained all her childhood to be the next ruler of the Sweden. When she came of age to take the crown, her aim is to mark the presence of Sweden all over the Europe. She's a fine sword woman, but also very interested in philosophy and art. But she has never been so confused as one day when she felt something for a woman in her court. She begins to learn more about it from an expert and on the other side, her duty to the nation and its people seems not getting better. How the fate of Sweden and her personal life collides covered in the remaining parts.\r\n\r\n> \u275dI know how to set a bear trap, how to clean a musket, but I don't know how to place my lips on yours.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe film was not received well. Critically failed, but it was not that bad if you ask me. Yes, it was boring in parts, due to lack of progression. There's lots of things happened in the story, yet seems was not enough to impress its viewers. Especially switching between national duty and personal affairs strongly collides. Thus leaving both the subjects behind half baked. The real events took place for decades was put into a hundred minutes film did not justify. It's particularly about picking the right story segment to add in the screenplay and the some of the parts looked fine, but not the overall film.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people might find it a propaganda. Protestants, Roman Catholic, I don't know which way it leans, but started with one way and ended with another. So it could be the end that counts. On the humanitarian ground, morally, all looked fine to me. So if that's what made this film to become prey, then it's a totally wrongly judged. Otherwise the film is acceptable for being a biopic, telling the truth. Of all the kings and queen of the world we learnt about, Kristina is different and one should know about her for that. I feel she was very modern and modern in the wrong century.\r\n\r\nBorn in the royal family, had all the power, it's very sad how her fate has changed at the end. But that's not the end of her tale. There's more to reveal, though this film covered only that takes place in the Sweden and being the ruler. I'll be happy if a sequel was made to tell her latter life and self-discovery. I'm sure it would be more a philosophical, but some people might raise the voice propaganda. Since this flick did not do well, that's not going to happen, I guess.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons I wanted to watch it was Sarah Gadon. She was in one of the main roles, but had a less preference. The other actress was really good and she was almost in every frame of the film. It might not be the best film to represent the LGBT, but it had its share and definitely a decent film from all the other angles. Should have been better, that's what those who saw it would say and so am I. Once watchable, but it does not have quality to I say the word, recommended!\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"598caa739251411058000e57","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/598caa739251411058000e57","movie_id":329829}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A cop vs an evil scientist! The ultimate clash!\r\n\r\nThis is definitely your regular Indian style film, but the script was top notch, that's the vast difference you would find in this. It was a cop-thief clash theme something like the Korean film 'Veteran'. Initially I thought it might be a remake of some Korean film, because it looks like a Korean thriller, but after learning that it was an original, I was amazed. Because, you know, the director has a nick name called remake Raja. He's known for bringing the Telugu blockbuster to the Kollywood. That's not bad and I'm not against remakes, he sure did do a wonderful job with those projects to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe actors were brilliant, especially like everybody saying Aravaind Swamy in a negative role stole the show. The plus point was minimizing the musical track. I mean the narration was not interrupted by unexpected and unnecessary musics and dances like usual Indian films does, except on one occasion I think. The two and half an hour was too long, but that's the average Indian film length and totally worth it.\r\n\r\nNot easy to predict, but in a few segments you would know what might come in the next scene. Because it might be an awesome film for the Indian audience who are seeing it for the first time, but in the world stage it is just an above average with partial clich\u00e9. There were a couple twists, the ending was excellent too, and looks like a follow up might come. My only disappointment was they missed a wonderful opportunity to make this film more realistic in the line of 'Unnaipol Oruvan'. Instead, they opted to narrate it more commercially appealing way.\r\n\r\nSo if you are an Indian or watch regularly Indian films, you would find it great. I was impressed with the film's promotions and it did well at the box office. Now it is getting remade in a couple of other languages, I hope they would as well do well. The brothers; the lead actor and the director did many projects together, but this one was a very special and will be a game changer for their respective career. So you might need to check it out if you haven't seen it yet. I'm not saying it is a masterpiece, but if you know Indian cinemas, then would learn how unusual it is.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"5787c51192514131bd00101a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5787c51192514131bd00101a","movie_id":280165}

It was the boarding school break and everyone heading their home, but a couple of girls stay behind as they have no other choice. While waiting for their parents to pick them up, those few days do not go well with them. What it is and how the story ends, you should watch it to learn.\r\n\r\nIt is not a must see, or even it does not look fresh enough. Though very dark and there's a moment it peaks with its suspense. But it could not hold any further, or keep us expecting what might come. Both the tales that told parallely was distinguished at the end with a small twist. But not everything was fully explained. So you will be disappointed a bit on that ground on overall film.\r\n\r\nThose young actresses were really good. Roberts and Shipka who never meet given the best performances in their respective roles. An horror with a less traditional narration. Feels familiar, but not really as entirely. Because if you don't know what its genre, you could anticipate a regular drama-thriller, but they manipulated the genre very well that you won't fully able to unpuzzle, even after the end.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> What would you choose to do if you get a second chance in your life.\r\n\r\nI think it came at the right time. The recent report says there are lots of athletes around the world from the different sports failed their doping tests. But this story sets around the 15 years ago, which was based on the real sportsperson's life story. Lance Armstrong, a cyclist from the Texas and his record breaking back to back wins at the 'The Tour de France'. The film narrates a tale that what he chose to do with the second chance of his life.\r\n\r\nA very interesting biopic, but kind of confusing over what kind of revelation the film is. I mean whether inspiring to fight back the disease, especially what he contributed to the poor and orphan cancer patients, or cheating the game to become a fame. So what I think is it has the both positives and negatives. I liked the balanced screenplay, that is very smart for a controversial person like this.\r\n\r\nIt's like a modern 'Robinhood' tale. But here, he's not stealing from the rich, instead he cheats the game. Those tricks were unbelievable. That's not the right thing to do, but that's what he's good at. Ben Foster was amazing, I'd seen him doing lots of supporting roles, but for this he's the posterboy. This film is a great example that the lies cannot go on forever, sooner or later the justice will be done. People hate him and so this film. There are others who like him as well, but I'm neutral and people like me has to go through a hard time to rate it.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd\/10","id":"57375a34c3a3686f3b00009e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57375a34c3a3686f3b00009e","movie_id":271736}

Cue lots of crash bang and wallop, digital blitzkrieg and Vin with a glint in his eye in spite of not having the emotional paths required for the role. In support are Elijah Wood, Michael Caine and Rose Leslie, all of whom arguably come under the miscast banner.\r\n\r\nThere's some smart ideas at the film's core, the nightmares and dreamscapes narrative smarts particularly hint at what might have been a potent asset to the pic.

Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Lee, Walton Goggins, Tim Roth, Micahel Madsen, Demian Bichir and Bruce Dern. Music is scored by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by Robert Richardson. \r\n\r\nWyoming, wintertime, and an assortment of suspect characters are holed up at Minnie's Haberdashery while a blizzard rages outside. Soon enough suspicions and ugly human traits come to the fore... \r\n\r\nTarrantino is on a Western\/Southern\/Oater\/Civil War kick these days, here following on from Django Unchained, this is set just post the Civil War. Proudly homaging genres he loves, he throws all his trademarks at The Hateful Eight for glorious results - that is on proviso you happen to be a fan of his in the first place. \r\n\r\nPicture is split into two halves. First half sets up the characters who come to be at Minnie's, the conversations are pungent with Tarrantino's caustic and comedic writing, the characterisations equally so, whilst we have been treated to some absolutely gorgeous Colorado vistas. There's a constant sense of mistrust in the air, while racism, misogyny and political fall outs pulse away in set up scenarios. \r\n\r\nThen it's the second half, where after a wee bit of narration that had me thinking my Blu-ray player had somehow started playing The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, hell then comes to Minnie's! It quickly becomes evident we have been part of a Tarrantino parlour game, a game of Clue - cum - Ten Little Indians, only in a Wild West setting, and with blood, bones and bile in full effect. \r\n\r\nThe whole thing is wonderfully stylish in the way that Tarrantino is known for. The cartoonish horror mingles with more biting observations on humanity, the violence shocks to get a reaction from the viewer, for better or worse, and always there is humour, where Hateful Eight proves itself to be one damn funny film. \r\n\r\nMorricone scores it as cartoon horror with Western strains, and it's magnificent, it sounds like the evil twin to his score for The Untouchables. The cast are super (though a couple of them are not given much to do), with Leigh standing out, and Messrs Jackson and Russell hold glorious excessive court. Costuming is most appealing, as is the set-design for Minnie's. And director QT?

{"author":"Reno","content":"> It's a women's revenge movie, definitely not a 'Transporter'.\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds of reasons to say it did not look like a fourth film in the 'Transporter' series. One such was the cast, especially the title role that replaced Jason Statham and the rest as well not very convincing. The stunts were just good, but sometimes it was annoying. The overall movie is even worse than the 'Agent 47'.\r\n\r\nFrom now on, this franchise will downgrade if they fail to bring back Statham. Recently plenty of franchise rebooted than ever, so I thought the fever hit for this one as well. But no, it is simply a next installment and worst part in the series from a far distance.\r\n\r\nI'm not against bringing a bunch of fresh faces and crew on board, but the structured planning was not good. The storytelling and especially it is missing the originality, the stylish tone that set by Mr Statham. That's how everyone remembers this franchise. All I wanted was to upgrade to a higher level by carrying the original legacy.\r\n\r\nI think, 'Transporter' is a trilogy. The following ones are simply the B films from the tier-two filmmakers to experiment with their skill under the limited budget.

It\u2019s as if Mel Gibson decided to update \u201cThe Passion of the Christ\u201d by 1600 years.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, the movie is set in Puritan New England as a family is banished from the larger community and has to make their own way out in the wilderness.

I'm not that into documentaries compared to the feature films I watch on the regular basis, but time to time I try if I get interested after learning what it's all about. Likewise, I found this one, though it is not a science or nature theme that I usually prefer than anything else. I have enjoyed many murder mystery films, but this one is a documentary. So I wanted to know the experience of watching the real story with real clips and interviews of real suspect, witnesses and what the victim's family says about it.\r\n\r\nThis was about one of the America's most talked crime of the previous century. It took place 50 years ago, on 13th March 1964. A young woman was murdered where nobody came to rescue her. So after all these years, the younger brother of the victim, who was a very young boy then did not remember much of the event and following incidents, is now trying to investigate and if possible to get a new perspective of that dreadful day. His journey begins in search of truth.\r\n\r\nLike any documentary films, it started off without notifying us what's going on. But very soon the basic information revealed. Bill Genovese, who is on the wheelchair tells us what he little knows about his sister Kitty. Then the focus goes back to the day she was murdered. She was alone on the street, but there were plenty of eyes that witnessed from a nearby apartment building when a man approached Kitty and what followed was a horror. No one came forward, otherwise an innocent soul would have been saved.\r\n\r\n> \"For years, I avoided the details of that night, because they were just too painful, but it's worse not knowing the truth.\"\r\n\r\nAfter debating about the crime like the motive to commit it, the film right away turns its all focus on what's wrong with those who saw it, but failed to do anything. Bill meets some of the witnesses and gets their perspective. The stories of how they saw it and how they reacted to it. Unfortunately, many of them are passed away as it was a half a century old incident. Bill, as well as the filmmakers tried their best to get useful and fresh info, but the investigation did not go anywhere as we expect in a feature film.\r\n\r\nThe sad part of this film is there's barely any original clips, except a few personal archive footages of the victim. Because CCTV cameras were not found anywhere near the crime scene like todays world, not even 911 was existed. They say, this crime was one of the reasons to implement the 911 concept. The incident impacted the US big, to fight crime after many debates to introduce many other precautionary measures. This topic was also used for the college thesis and other researches. So basically it changed the system that America began to fight back.\r\n\r\nIt was an outrageous event, but this film lacked something. Like I said the visuals, how that night would have looked like. They should have recreated it, instead revealing everything orally. Particularly the same event described by different people who witnessed it, that was this film's notion than the crime as the title hints. So pretty much succeed in its quest, along with Bill, who led his one man research team. As a documentary film, it is a fine product, but nothing like the feature film's murder mystery. So don't go for it with such expectation other than eager to learn the truth in a realistic way. So, recommended, but only for the selected audience.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58f15996c3a3681a3d005629","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58f15996c3a3681a3d005629","movie_id":356332}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The standoff between the man and the last beast.**\r\n\r\nAfter the stunning performance in the 'The Admiral: Roaring Currents', the Korean superstar Choi Min-Sik is back for another unique film. This time he donned in a hunter's avatar and his role was pretty inspiring. From the director of 'New World' and second time working with the same actor. Reading this kind of story might work well because of we individually visualise them as what we want. But turning them into a film is a tough task because they're one man's vision and not everybody share the same perspective, hence the disagreement surface. So I think the director did his best with the kind of screenplay he had, I would say the whole team effort was good.\r\n\r\nDuring the Japanese rule of Korea in the 1925, a fine hunter who lives with his son in the forest near a village has given up hunting since his wife's death. But when the Japanese army chief obsessed with one particular magnificent tiger that lives in the mountains of Jirisan, summons all the hunters to get it. All the attempts go in vain, until the Japanese soldiers and Korean hunters team up and go after that last living tiger. The battle between the man and the beast only brings the bloody war that's going to change forever whoever involved in it.\r\n\r\nI was excited to watch it after learning about the plot, because the Korean experimental films are quite fascinating as they are made in the most realistic way. Take an example of 'Mr. Go', the same visual effects team behind this film as well. They did pretty awesomely, but it was a much harder job than the big ape they had created earlier. Though, in a few shots it was below par, at a time very much comparable quality to the recent CGI tigers such as Richard Parker and Shere Khan from 'Life of Pi' and 'The Jungle Book' respectively.\r\n\r\n\"Respect the mountain and take what it gives you.\"\r\n\r\nThe film was kind of mix of reality and fiction. From the human perspective, all the narration was quite rational and historically matches. Like humans hunt animals for pleasure and its skin, teeth, nails et cetera. As from the tiger's perspective, it turned out to be a little fiction, because of the animal showing same or equal emotions as the humans. Animals do show emotions, but not in the human way as it was shown in the film. That makes it a bit unrealistic and out of proportion. That would work in a pure fantasy film where this one comes under thriller that was targeted for adults with strong blood and gore. Otherwise, it would have made a great anime.\r\n\r\nApart from those disappointments, I find the film was much better if not as what I anticipated. The actors did their part so well and so the crew members behind the camera. The cinematography was good, captured some beautiful landscapes, but I don't know some of those shots might be digital creation. The length a bit long, due to engaging screenplay you won't feel you're forced to sit for that long.\r\n\r\nFor the action sequence fans, this film offers a good entertainment, but depends who you're cheering for. As for the conclusion, I did not get it properly, because it was an understanding term rather giving a full explanation. So viewers can have a different opinion and everything might make sense. (Be careful, this following line might contain spoilers.) For my understanding the tiger and the hunter decide what they should have done years ago should be done now.\r\n\r\nI might have mentioned it somewhere the film is suitable for grown ups. Even for an adult like me, knowing it just a fake and graphics felt a bit too much brutality. There is a scene where a boy was eaten alive by a pack wolves. I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking, what kind of audience they're targeting. The overall writing should have been improved, making more realistic way like how the natural world animals behave. It might work for some people with a minimum guaranteed entertainment, but little children should stay away from it. From my side, I go for 50-50, neither I suggest it nor encourage to skip it.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"57d30d90c3a3681ff7000959","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57d30d90c3a3681ff7000959","movie_id":363093}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"The psychological chiller \u2018The Inhabitants\u2019 may unfairly be dismissed as yet another atmospheric haunted house frightfest for consideration. It would be a shame to automatically assume that this daunting horror gem was anything but creepily imaginative and stimulating. Thankfully, the filmmaking siblings Michael and Shawn Rasmussen put an ignited and distinctive spin on the conventional ghost story formula with their taut homegrown New England-based fear fable. Absorbingly chilly, methodically intense and suggestive, \u2018The Inhabitants\u2019 succeeds with its bare-bones blend of gory mythology that taps into the realm of nostalgic ghouls, witches and possessed sacrifices.\r\n\r\nWhat makes \u2018The Inhabitants\u2019 so ambitious in its harrowing presentation is the eerie ambiance that the Rasmussen Brothers bring to the table that showcases the historic and regional flavor of its colonial New England-set naughty narrative. There is an innate appreciation for both the historical setting of the skin-crawling exposition as well as the enthusiasm and borrowed influences of other revered spooky spectacles that \u2018The Inhabitants\u2019 skillfully incorporates into its morose mindset.\r\n\r\nThe Rasmussens (credits include their screenwriting credentials for 2011\u2019s John Carpenter\u2019s \u2018The Ward\u2019) craftily dishes out a hauntingly rich and robust sophisticated edgy sideshow that surprisingly has a freshness to its subtle jolting twitches and turns. Sure, the occasional and obligatory horror-induced conventions are applied due to the nature of the genre (ie false alarms and sudden jump cuts, hysterical music cues, shadowy imagery, intrusive video feeds, etc.) Still, the Rasmussens manage to deliver the gruesome goods despite the frequent clich\u00e9d sinister techniques. If anything \u2018The Inhabitants\u2019 is a breath of welcomed air in comparison to some of the big-budgeted mainstream Hollywood horror flicks that hide behind empty grandiose gestures of seediness without concentrating on the instrumental boundaries of what makes for an intriguing and delightfully insane story. There is a devilish and engaging intimacy about \u2018The Inhabitants\u2019 that makes its viewing quite infectious and involving.  The spell-binding performances, provocative and crisp-shot photography and the riveting slow-burn of staged madness all leads up to the pulsating payoff. Dutifully, \u2018The Inhabitants\u2019 is well constructed as a creepy and caustic caper in its low-key, compelling shell.\r\n\r\nThe sordid shenanigans stem from behind the whispering walls of Salem\u2019s seemingly quaint and cosy March Carriage Bed and Breakfast Inn. This rustic resting spot has been identified as one of New England\u2019s oldest homes. So it is without question that the good ole\u2019 March Carriage Bed and Breakfast has its built-in mystique and traces of mayhem. In fact, we do get a hint of the inn\u2019s suspicious reputation when we witness a couple bedding together in their bedroom on an unidentified grainy monitor.\r\n\r\nEnter Dan and Jessica (Michael Reed and Elise Couture Stone). The young and attractive married couple are about to take over the ownership of the dubious March Carriage Bed and Breakfast Inn from the aunt-niece tandem of Rose Stanton and Gretchen (Judith Chaffee and Rebecca Whitehurst). However, as energetic and accommodating as Gretchen is at giving her family\u2019s inn the ultimate shoe shine of compliments the property-purchasing lovebirds cannot help but notice the disturbing demeanor of her Aunt Rose as she maintains a glazed look and mumbles nonsensical quips ranging from uttering her late hubby Norman\u2019s name (Pete Wishnok) to the references of \u2018the children\u2019. Both Dan and Jess have no choice but to chalk Gretchen\u2019s disoriented aunt as a mere eccentric old lady.\r\n\r\nAs the married twosome, along with their pet dog Wiley, settles into their new home\/business they are taken in by the scenic place and the surrounding woods and streams that encompass their new homestead. Jess even decides to visit the local library and do some research on the March Carriage Bed and Breakfast Inn as she pours into the book with hungry knowledge.\r\n\r\nSoon, the honeymoon phase with the inn begins to gradually crack and it begins when Dan is called on the road to attend a vital business trip. Of course, this leaves Jess alone on the posh premises for the very first time. The snowball effect of disaster starts to mount gradually. First, Jess runs into a band of shifty teens in the woods while walking Wiley. Upon returning, Jess explores her home and cannot help but feel freaked out by the random household occurrences that range from the washing machine operating at scary will to Wiley\u2019s sudden odd behavior in scratching at the bedroom door as if someone was lurking on the other side. Yes, this is the case as the audience witnesses the glimpses of the youthful garish apparitions appearing in darkness. Could they possible be \u2018the children\u2019 that Aunt Rose was babbling about in shock? Predictably, doom and gloom is near when Jess finally succumbs to the presence of these youth-oriented ghastly ghost stalkers behind closed doors.\r\n\r\nWhen Dan finally comes back from his business venture, he cannot help but notice the change in his usually chipper wife as she now appears notoriously distant and robotic in her icy, blank-staring make-up. Even Dan ponders as to why his four-legged companion Wiley is so withdrawn and lethargic. Dan, in his attempt to get to the bottom of his now weird wife\u2019s terrifying trance, makes a few of his own discoveries in the unpredictable house. For one, he uncovers a secret surveillance system that has tracked and recorded all the movement for the zombie-like Jess and the various guests in the inn. Secondly, Dan awkwardly connects the dots and instinctively decides to pay the demented Rose Stanton a timely visit in the hospital for needed feedback only to be met by more detached reactions by the hysterical senior citizen. Will Dan bite off more than he can chew when continuing his quest for the now possessed Jess and the hellish house he once proudly called his castle?\r\n\r\n\u2018The Inhabitants\u2019 crackles convincingly because the film\u2019s leads in Couture Stone and Reed are intoxicating as the victimised sacrificial lambs defined on two different levels of dreary disillusionment. Couture Stone\u2019s Jess is the bubbly beauty turned bizarre beast and one cannot take their eyes off of her transformation into the tormenting she-devil in disguise. Couture Stone is sensual yet sadistic and she leaves you wanting more cause of chaos and conflict from her hedonistic hands. The Rasmussens effectively use the devices of anticipation and antagonism to heighten the tension accordingly. The film\u2019s elegant musical score compliments the moodiness and adventurous overtones of chills and thrills.\r\n\r\nOverall, \u2018The Inhabitants\u2019 has not explored any new territory that one has not seen countless times before in slash-and-dash cinema. Nevertheless, this stark and resourceful vehicle works its challenging mundane, impish magic and a few of the major boofest releases from La La Land should take some pointers on how to enthrall an audience with low-budget but high-praised creative calculation.\r\n\r\nThe Inhabitants (2015)\r\n\r\nGravitas Ventures\r\n\r\n1 hr. 29 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Elise Couture-Stone, Michael Reed, Judith Chaffee, Rebecca Whitehurst, India Pearl and Pete Wishnok\r\n\r\nDirected and Written by: Michael and Shawn Rasmussen\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: NR\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror\/Psychological Thriller\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)","id":"5619f93bc3a3681c280018a6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5619f93bc3a3681c280018a6","movie_id":359255}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Like Stalin Ramalingam's Kaadu, Thoppi also deals with tribal people and their way of life. It is set in Kurinjimedu, a remote village in a mountain, where reside a clan of robbers, led by Suruttu Saamy, a veteran robber, who is also their priest. As we saw in Vasantabalan's Aravani, thievery is these people's way of taking care of their stomachs and they perform it with ritualistic fervour. But not Sithan. A 20-something fellow, Sithan aspires to become a cop (we even get a back story on why he badly wants to be one) and acts as an informer for the local police, who are always the first ones to be pulled up whenever a robbery is committed in the surrounding areas. \r\n\r\nSithan is befriended by inspector Kuzhanthaisamy, who uses him to solve crimes. The Minister for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments orders the cop to find a stolen film reel box (the film is, of course, Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum), and Sithan finds out that it contains rice pulling iridium and submits it to the authorities instead. This angers the cop and the minister wants him dead. Meanwhile, Sithan gets into a tussle with Suruttu Saamy, which eventually results in him losing out at the police trials. And, Kuzhanthaisamy gets an opportunity to get rid of him and murders him. What happens following this is the suspense. \r\n\r\nThoppi unfolds as a flashback with a constable narrating the tale of Sithan to the new inspector, who has come to the hill station after the mysterious deaths of the previous two inspectors. Youreka has most of the elements to give us a whodunit in the vein of say, Murder On The Orient Express. Were they murdered by the community angered by Sithan's fate or did they actually two commit suicide? Or, is there something else at play here? But this subject needed a tighter script, sharper filmmaking and better performances. Instead, we get scenes that seem routine with performances that are at best functional and visuals that remind us of many recent rural films. It doesn't help that the cinematography is by M Sukumar, who also shot Mynaa, Kumki and Mosakutty, so the film's visual tone is hardly different. \r\n\r\nThere is some offbeat humour that comes across well. One character takes orders for school and college certificates, passports and gives doctoral degrees, even to the cops. In one scene, representatives from the traders association give Suruttu Saamy insurance money so that their shops will be spared. And, at the police recruitment trials, when a superior officer remarks on the poor numbers, a cop wittily tells him that everyone goes to IT these days. \r\n\r\nAnd the ending is somewhat of a surprise. We think we more or less know how it's going to turn out but the revelation on who actually committed the murders is unpredictable. But we keep wishing for the scenes to be more impactful. And, the central conflict of the cop's inferiority complex and his growing jealousy isn't brought out well. The director has complained that the producer has cut scenes considerably in the second half without his knowledge and thus ruining his film. Perhaps, the director's cut was more engaging. For now, we have to settle for a film that is modestly engaging but doesn't fulfill its initial promise.","id":"5502fb0ac3a36826b9002e3a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5502fb0ac3a36826b9002e3a","movie_id":330411}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> What we choose against what fate chooses for us.\r\n\r\nBased on the old Spanish play about a wedding tragedy. It all sets in the rural Spain and tells the story of a bride who involved in a love triangle. It takes us back to her childhood day to reveal us her crush on one of two friends, but feudal between the friends families puts her in a tight spot. Especially as growing up knowing she has to choose one of them to marry. Finally the time comes to that, the day is set for the big occasion, but an unexpected twist brings a chaos during the celebration and the old rivalry awakens among the young generation.\r\n\r\nIt was a little dull narrative, mostly because of the quietness and lack of depth in both the character explorations and the story. I might say it is only a finishing touch work, we can't get any details we want for a better understanding, especially the past events remains slightly mysterious like how it all began. That's fine, because they thought they chopped away the boring stuffs, and yes they did, yet that did not bring any good result either.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this film's focus was the three friends who grew up together, so this story is only about what happens around them. Beside them, the old woman who often appears is a puzzle that's need to be explained. But I assumed she's kind of witch who manipulating the peoples mind to go against each other.\r\n\r\nSince it revolves on a wedding event, I was desperately looking forward the ceremony to begin. That's the other reason I felt letdown for it to delay. Until then the pace was too slow to keep myself engaged with this, but once the celebration began, it lit up my mood and followed by the conclusion that came with a light speed. So I kind liked the third act in the entire narration and according to me, that's the best part of the film.\r\n\r\n> \"Bitterness is the worst punishment of all.\"\r\n\r\nThere's nothing much happens in the story section, we can easily know what's coming up next after the each scene. Because like I said, there's no great developments, everything was about getting ready for the marriage and during the marriage. It is like learning everything about it prior to the watch, yet the final scene, the solution was stronger than I expected. For an end like that I expected tearjerker atmosphere. The emotions showed between the characters, but for the viewers those are ineffective.\r\n\r\nShot in the cool places, I mean it looked like a semi-desert that did not bring the Spanish atmosphere of my knowledge, but blended well with the story. The character executions were fine, even the direction was good, but the writing was a disappointment. This 80 year old story needed a serious update, because the presentation was very stylish, but the tale was so simple. Yes, it looks so simple to follow, but complicated to fully understand it.\r\n\r\nJust keep in mind that it is not a romance nor a revenge film, but a slice of equal both. About other things as well like love, life, family, culture, especially the three main characters linked with, such as the bride's choice, the groom's fate and the their friend's deception. This is definitely not an entertaining film, not for people like me, but what I call it is a story to decode. Like in the line of 'Enemy', 'Upstream Color', 'Borgman' et cetera. There're lot more about it than what actually the story tells, but only discussing with others who had watched it will bring the details out. Honestly, I was not very impressed with this, certainly not a bad film to ignore it completely.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd\/10","id":"572a035bc3a36808fc002b60","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/572a035bc3a36808fc002b60","movie_id":350849}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> While an evil force slowly possessing them, the family bond is put on a test.\r\n\r\nThe film was based on the collection of a series of the real events that takes place in the 17th century New England. The story of a farmer family who came across the ocean, but now lives on the edge of the forest after denied permission to build a house in a village. When the newborn baby disappears in a thin air, the family begins to experience the mysterious events. Without a clue about the happenings, the evil force begins to possess them while the unity of the family is tested.\r\n\r\nWow, finally a wonderful horror-psychological-thriller. Usually horror films are the worst kind compared with other genres, because most of them overly rely on the sudden sound\/noise and gore. But there are many awesome horror films I had liked which were better story than the graphical presentation, like this one. So I love good narration than those try to scare me with make-ups, stunts and sound mixings.\r\n\r\nIt was a limited cast film, sets in a beautiful remote place and the language was awesome that perfectly suits for the horror theme like this. Everyone's performance was brilliant. It is just a one million dollar film and the entire film was shot within a month. The records are not matter when the writing and the direction were top notch. Especially for a first timer it was a remarkable achievement.\r\n\r\nA simple plot, developed greatly and the suspense was the highlight. Yet viewers expect more explanation, but I'm happy for what it is and it should not go deeper than that which might spoil its unique flavour. Not just horror film fans, everyone should try it if they're capable to handle the slow narration. Finally, like usual, here I won't ask for a sequel, because it'll make an amazing one off film than the dozens of crappy follow ups.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"5752f8509251410915000042","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5752f8509251410915000042","movie_id":310131}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"There is no doubt that the majority of horror flicks being churned out for the big screen incorporate a grand and glossy look that feels majestic in all its expressive macabre tendencies. Sure, the elegance of a fright fantasy that pushes its visually sumptuous sheen will enhance the surrealistic gore with more eye-popping resonance. However, as much as opulence in presentation is a plus for horror and suspense yarns there is also the undermining element that takes away from such a crafty-looking creepy showcase--the atmospheric vibe of manufactured scares and the slight serving of a familiar but transparent storyline. Based on these sentiments one may come across the hollow leanings in The Hallow, a breezy-minded backwoods boofest that explores the same old tired recipe for the jeopardized state of the family union.\r\n\r\nIt is such a crying shame that The Hallow missed a golden opportunity to mesh its stunning and captive visual vibrancy with a decent domestic doom-and-gloom story that hangs its horrific hat on the legacy of a haunting venue with a shady past. Instead, The Hallow delivers a pedestrian fear-inducing fairy tale that never quite seems to stimulate beyond its impressive scope of shadowy aesthetics.  In fact, The Hallow is not known for its costly budget so it is more intriguing that this horror film confidently gleams in its polished appearance. Still, it costs absolutely nothing to conceive a meaty story and putting an emphasis on a goosebump narrative that could have been more charging and challenging in its storytelling should have been the instinctive order of business. \r\n\r\nIrish filmmaker Corin Hardy (slated to direct the upcoming remake of \"The Crow\") shows some creative and technical promise in his first feature film The Hallow. Hardy certainly is not the first (and will not be the last) movie-maker to borrow and blend some of his pulsating parts from other widely known and obscure fright genres. Hardy does have an eye for skillfully conveying the edgy moments and tapping into the tension that The Hallow flirts with so impishly. Again, if there was a notable twist of tawdriness or something that could propel The Hallow from its occasional stagnation of the usual sedate chills-and-thrills scenario then Hardy's finely colorful and calculating creepfest would have been marvelously realized as the pleasing twitchy \"reel deal\". \r\n\r\nOf course by now horror fans will recognize the premise to The Hallow as it is an obvious and overused clich\u00e9 in fright fables concerning the welfare of a family moving to a seemingly reasonable place with its overflowing share of demonic activity attached to its rancid reputation. Naturally, the residence in question has to be isolated in the middle of a wooded wonderland. Family man Adam Hitchens (Josprh Mawle) relocates his loved ones from lively London to the cluttered and mysterious forest surrounding a quaint millhouse in Ireland. Hopefully, the Hitchens clan will enjoy their new surroundings without incident. How silly of them to think so, huh?  \r\n\r\nInnocently, conservationist Adam starts to roam through the woods often with his toddler son Finn accompanying him on his assignments for tree inspections. However, Adam's venture into the wooded wasteland does not sit well with many of the locals especially neighbor Colm (Michael McElhatton) in particular.  Everyone feels that the unsuspecting Adam is risking the fate of their entire safety by intruding on \"the hallow\" as he invades this mythical menace's personal space of routinely walking through the forest region. Indeed, Adam is warned by Colm and others about his tendency to tip toe through the forbidden forest. Soon, a wake-up call for Adam and his wife Clare (Bojana Novakovic) is acknowledged when gruesome discoveries in the woods are detected (such as a dead deer as a curious research specimen) and the creatures from the nearby woods are now retaliating against the Hitchens crew. The payback is a costly price to pay as the hallow's creatures look to control the psychological strings of their precious child Finn. This form of intimidation is too much to handle for the family as they much now protect Finn and their own interests from succumbing to the creep-like clutches of the deranged hallow.   \r\n\r\nHardy, who co-wrote the screenplay along with Filipe Marino, does brandish some squirm-inducing sequences and the fear content in The Hallow does provide its cherished moments of twisted, low-key winces and uneasiness. The so-called madness behind the mythology of paranoia that runs so rampart in Hardy's expose of child endangerment, environmental curiosities and old-fashioned haunting hedonism seems rather ambitious and interestingly tied together in one naughty knot. Nevertheless, Hardy's valiant attempt to juggle these fear factors simply feels standard in a horror show that had viable potential for pushing its caustic buttons more convincingly. From Martijn van Broekhuizen\u2019s fetching cinematography to the serviceable special effects that actually shine in this chilly production, The Hallow is a good-looking and competent chiller but it mere settles for meager jolts without going full force and complimenting its technical tenacity. \r\n\r\nThe performances in The Hallow are steady and the tingling sensation that overcomes both Mawle's Adam and Novakovic's Clare in the middle of the creepy conflicts are effective more times than not. Hardy's sparkling frightfest had the aforementioned noteworthy visual ingredients but the tepid tale needed some penetrating punch to its psychological jawbone. A walk through The Hallow's wicked woods should be met with a thick tree trunk of terror and not with a mere branch of a customary yelp. \r\n\r\nThe Hallow (2015)\r\n\r\n\r\n1 hr. 37 mins.\r\n\r\n\r\nStarring: Joseph Mawle, Bojana Novakovic, Michael McElhatton, Gary Lydon, Michael Smiley\r\n\r\n\r\nDirected and Co-Written by: Colin Hardy\r\n\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror and Suspense\r\n\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars) \r\n\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng","id":"5647a300c3a36826080048d9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5647a300c3a36826080048d9","movie_id":312831}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The food comes first. The life's later or maybe never.**\r\n\r\nThe title reveals everything, but still you must watch this to know how everything going to take place. Life on earth is meant for survival of the fittest, but the human evolution changed that idea and again, what happen when the rules we are used to have changed back to the original? This is a post apocalyptic theme set in somewhere in the Britain and revolves around three people who are fighting for their survival, everyday.\r\n\r\nThe feature film debut for the director, who also managed the screenplay quite superbly. You can find many similar films, but everyone of those has its own story with the backdrop of various threats and other issues to deal. Also, when the circumstances differ, the following events take a different lead. Thus giving the viewers a new perspective and entertainment.\r\n\r\nThis is nothing like those I had seen. It was too rough and tough in revealing stuffs to the facts of its state of condition. I mean the humans have lost the trust between one another. You might say that is common in all the post-apocalyptic films, but this is very good at details. A silent film, like background score was almost zero, so the appeal was stronger in every those thrill scenes like it was real or some kind of a documentary film.\r\n\r\nA man is living alone in the middle of the forest, grows his own vegetables and always be an extra careful from any outside threat. Then one day a woman and her daughter comes looking for food to trade with their valuables. The deal does not go well between them, but somehow they all manage to gain trust and start to live together. Obviously there's always an issue of food shortage, so how they are going to handle and followed by many other troubles brings an end to the tale.\r\n\r\n> \"The only thing I have caught in there walked on two legs.\"\r\n\r\nA minimal cast film with less dialogues, but totally a visual storyteller. I liked the film, but not my favourite, just a fine thriller. The actors are not very popular, but still they are familiar faces and I liked the film because of them. Critically acclaimed and well received by movie goers, but the common people who are vital for the commercial success let it down. It was nominated for the BAFTA awards in the newcomer writer\/director category, but did not win.\r\n\r\nThe film's main plot is the food. The human population grown so fast during entering the twenty first century and again fallen rapidly due to the shortage of food which is obviously directly affected by pollution and other issues. So the theme was right, but not everybody gets that message. Because most of who watch it expects entertainment and nothing else. I hope that would not be your excuse to ignore it.\r\n\r\nThe film was shot in Northern Ireland, in a couple of places and its surroundings. It is slow, but steady in what it wanted to tell us. It's not a question about how familiar the theme is, but how different and obviously how different people tackle such situations is what this film focused to tell us pretty dramatic way. \r\n\r\nWhen I say the poster, I thought it was like a native American or south American's story. Mainly because of the haircut that gave the impression like that I saw from other films. The synopsis gave a different perspective, so I found it more interesting than before. Then I watched, with a low expectation after knowing it was not received well. But I surprised and come to know this is not a bad film as they have said. In fact a very interesting perspective on how these three people struggle with what they have got in front of them. I am not saying it's a must see, but definitely not the worst, so I suggest you to do small research if you are confused to try this title. If you ask me, I would say just go for it.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"580e48f3c3a3685990001a09","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/580e48f3c3a3685990001a09","movie_id":329004}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A quadrangular high school love story!\r\n\r\nThe first mistake we all make is to expect it to match with the type of films what Isao Takahata, Hayao Miyazaki, Mamoru Hosada and few others direct. I meant thematically; either sci-fi, fantasy or the drama with the teen or the tween characters in the lead. Because technically this was a wonderful animation, but I was not impressed with the story, otherwise as usual, my writing would have been very long with the film quotes and other discussions.\r\n\r\nFor the beautifully sketched characters like this, the film totally wasted an opportunity. Should have been a beautiful love story or a pure fantasy, but it was a bit of uninspiring school drama that I kind frequently lost interest while watching.\r\n\r\nI remind who wanted to watch it that it was a simple story which was like some kind of a television episode. The fantasy parts were too small to notice and the love story was very boring to emotionally feel it. It might suit for those who're seeking matured contents in an anime fantasy-romance than a cute and quirky narration. My point is it is for adults than children.\r\n\r\nOverall, it failed to reach my expectations, but the online film rating says many has liked it. So don't mind me if you're considering it, but my review causing confusion. Because you should not have to feel what I felt, everything I said in the review is from my personal viewpoint. So I believe your opinion might differ from mine.\r\n\r\n5\/10","id":"57436a27925141541f002abe","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57436a27925141541f002abe","movie_id":364111}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Home is where the vengeance is.\r\n\r\nA stylish Aussie revenge-comedy that is adapted from a novel of the same name. Just superbly built screenplay on a tragedy that occurred some time back, but the movie reveals it only in the third act. About a woman who arrives in a small town where she was born and slowly gains popularity among the young women who seeks her stunning costumes to impress their counterparts. The town divides over her return, but why all the hate is the mystery that the movie going to solve for us in its entire narration.\r\n\r\nThe location and the settings were fantastic and it brought a western feel because of the Australians hot and humid weather. Kate Winslate was very good, her role simply reminded me Juliette Binoche from 'Chocolat'. I have heard people saying it was emotional, but I did not find it like that. Instead, I had fun watching it, not like I had the open laughs, but felt joy and satisfaction for the time I spent for it. My initial thought was it could be overrated, but after watching it proved I was wrong. This is one of the best Aussie movie I have seen in the recent years.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"5729feffc3a36808f8002b33","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5729feffc3a36808f8002b33","movie_id":298382}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Think carefully before attending your ex's party invite!**\r\n\r\nMy first impression was, not another 'The Perfect Host'. And it is not, but the same category. This is a comeback film for the director after the average 'Jennifer's Body' that released half a decade ago. Some people liked it, but for me it was an average film, because I've seen the better one. Still, I appreciate the effort, like handling the narration. You know these days viewers are bit clever, they begin to predict from the early stage, so this story quite interestingly upheld the suspense.\r\n\r\nTill the final act it keeps developing, not the story or the characters wisely, but the event where the plot evolves. A at a same time it leaves behind some clues about what might come later. That part is very confusing, I did not know what to believe and what not. Because I don't want to be a fool when twist happens. This was a lot dramatised and when the crucial event comes into play, the pace increased. The first 80 per cent of the film was what I enjoyed, but the twist ruined my party and then the final scene was so smart. The best way to conclude for such a thriller.\r\n\r\nThere are none tense moments, except in the final segment, but the curiosity of the event's states gets higher like particularly everybody is waiting for the twist to come. That's where some people would be disappointed. If you are not expecting too much, you would enjoy the remaining part as well. There's nothing to praise about the actors, all were just good. The script should have been a bit smarter in some parts. For one time watch it will do fine, that's what I favour.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"580e4691c3a3685998001721","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/580e4691c3a3685998001721","movie_id":306947}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A teen girl's sexual exploration.**\r\n\r\nWell, the first thing is this film is not for everyone. Because the contents were too strong for being a teen theme. That means it is good for the grown ups to watch. The story of a 15 year old girl in the 70s living with her mother and small sister. It begins when her sexual urges takes off, her first with a middle aged man. So she documents everything and besides, with her close friend's support, they together explore even more options. Being a minor and yet her real life to commence, what she plans for the future determines the remaining developments.\r\n\r\nThe performance by Bel Powley was amazing. She was the perfect choice to play that role despite she's older than the role. There were many nudes and sex scenes, but was not that strong, especially when compared with the similar themes of the present era films. The pace had lots of ups and downs, but the progression was on the right path which actually saved the film.\r\n\r\nThe story was just fine, no complication to understand and also not easy to explain, but in a short, it was a teenage girl's sexual exploration. Everybody gets into that stage of life, but only few courageously opts a path to accomplish. And for some, it is an open opportunity that makes them to get there than intentionally make that move. I felt the film was well adapted from its book and directed by a newcomer, Surely worth a watch, but again I'm saying that it is not for everyone.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58013a54c3a36848f5000a45","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58013a54c3a36848f5000a45","movie_id":250124}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A comedy about to pull off the first ever Golden Tux.\r\n\r\nIn any movie if you see a sidekick rule, that has to be the Kevin Hart. He can handle the whole movie by himself and this film is a great example. It totally surprised me, I expected it to be an average film, but it was an awesome comedy. We have seen plenty of bride and groom and marriage related comedies, but this was a slightly different yet a fantastic treat.\r\n\r\nI don't think it was wonderful because of the jokes alone, but unique characters and actors who performed them were brought the fine outcome. I felt like I know what's coming, but the ending was simple and smart.

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Traditionally, horror films and psychological thrillers follow a predictable path in their themes of dot-to-dot suspense. Rarely does a suspense piece deviate away from the formulaic blueprint that make these types of flicks the familiar frightfests they are in conception. However, the crafty Joel Edgerton, as the juggling movie mastermind sporting directing, acting and writing credits, provides the mind-bending goods in the refreshingly titillating \u2018The Gift\u2019, an edge-of-your-seat chiller that definitely is worth unwrapping with nervous anticipation. The ambitious moments in \u2018The Gift\u2019 are golden especially when the twists and turns are considered a solid fixture in the film\u2019s creepy conclusion.\r\n\r\nIt is understandable in assuming that \u2018The Gift\u2019 could have been yet another custom-made psychological thriller promoting the same hire-for-dire predicaments. Nevertheless, the insidious presence of Edgerton, along with co-stars Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall, as the Chicagoan married couple settling in their aesthetic-looking LA-based home elevates \u2018The Gift\u2019 as a stalker flick with captivating smarts and attitude.\r\n\r\nIt is actually a homecoming situation for Simon (Bateman) as he returns to his California town courtesy of his job-related executive rise within his computer security firm. The mover-and-shaker couple Simon and Robyn (Hall) settle into their impressive, spacious window-friendly place with a modern innovative appearance. When the couple decides to head out and do some furniture shopping they bump into Gordon (Edgerton). Gordon identifies himself as Simon\u2019s old high school classmate, something that catches the computer exec by surprise because he does not necessary recall the goatee-sporting Gordon right off the bat. The greeting is awkward but Simon politely acknowledges Gordon in an effort to appease him.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, jotting down the clingy Gordon\u2019s phone number is opening up a proverbial can of worms. Soon, Simon and Robyn would be hindered by Gordon\u2019s constant intrusive visits to their elegant home. Furthermore, Gordon adds to the creep factor by bestowing different degrees of generous gifts on the marital twosome. Gordon does not seem to take the hint that his unannounced visitations are smothering and rather bothersome to the lovebirds. The nervy gesture of Gordon hanging around is particularly worrisome because he seems to dominate Robyn\u2019s attention and time as Simon is away  at his lucrative job during the day.\r\n\r\nThe tension mounts for Simon and Robyn outside of the menacing interruptions caused by the mysterious Gordo. For starters, the pressure is on for the tandem to start a family as they hope to entertain the arrival of their first child. Secondly, Simon tries to best a rival at work to further his corporate ladder climbing into management. Thus, Gordon\u2019s bizarre gift-giving tendencies and continual pit stops in the couple\u2019s blossoming lives purely add to the stress and strain of keeping their marriage solid and conflict-free.\r\n\r\nThe Gift could have followed its road map to predictability and used the oddball Gordon as the doomsday dude that continues his twisted agenda without any rhyme or reason. Here is where Edgerton, as the aforementioned triple threat in directing, writing and acting, earns his creative stripes because he manages to flip the script on the viewers and causes them to comprehend the off-kilter motivations of this complex agitator. Is Gordon justified in his campaign to cause havoc for the corporate rising star Simon? Is Simon as squeaky clean as it appears? What is the backstory surrounding the nostalgic circumstances concerning Gordon\u2019s and Simon\u2019s past history as childhood classmates together? Can Robyn piece together the perplexing puzzle that involves the two men on different avenues to self-destruction?\r\n\r\nIt would be a disservice to reveal some of the shocking angles in \u2018The Gift\u2019 because the film certainly engineers must of its nerve-racking twists so cleverly to the point of describing too much of the dramatic layers may spoil the tension-driven surprise. The overall toxic message that is conveyed pretty much sums up Edgerton\u2019s inventive and piercing thrill ride. Be careful how you mistreat or dismiss someone from the past on the way up because you very well could tangle with them as one\u2019s fortunes could descend without a moment\u2019s notice.  Or to put it in simplistic street-wise terminology: karma is indeed a bitch!\r\n\r\nThe Gift (2015)\r\n\r\nSTX Entertainment\r\n\r\n1 hr. 48 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall, Joel Edgerton, Allison Tolman, Busy Phillipps, Beau Knapp, Wendell Pierce and David Denman\r\n\r\nDirected and Written by: Joel Edgerton\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Psychological Thriller\/Suspense and Drama\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s Rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n","id":"561a13c29251412c9c000277","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/561a13c29251412c9c000277","movie_id":328425}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A look at a boy's behaviour who was isolated from the society.\r\n\r\nThe entire setting reminds us the movie 'Psycho'. More or less it could have had made a good prequel to that, like the portrayal of Norman Bates' childhood. As an independent film from any previous narrative, it was quite good actually. Inspired by a novel that tells the story of a 9 year old boy who runs a motel with his father in a nowhere. In a lonely place where the customers are very rare, how the boy develops his behavious without social consciousness is what this movie is.\r\n\r\nTrust me, realism means this movie, but there's always flaws in a small budget film like this. If you always scan for logic, you can't enjoy any movie even in small quantity. Empty your thoughts and get into it, then there's a chance you might like it. I'm not saying it'll become your favourite, but the depiction was so good which was quite similar to the recent Austrian movie 'Goodnight Mommy'.\r\n\r\nIt is not a horror, but a thriller-drama. A terrifying theme, that means terror-horror, thus it called horror. Other than that there's no supernatural or sci-fi things in it. It was a decent movie to me, I felt it was slightly underrated. The turnaround in the storytelling was very good yet predictable stuff. The filmmaker must bring a sequel for it, otherwise I'll be very disappointed.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"570fbdde9251416d5b00055a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/570fbdde9251416d5b00055a","movie_id":257444}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> The puzzle behind the disappearance of the pranksters.\r\n\r\nI still remember the Jason Bateman's feature film debute as a director a couple of years ago. He really did good and now this is his second.

With some flashbacks, which reveals how these two grew up with their famous prank artist parents.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the opening scene, I was really excited and thought the film would be like this throughout. And then obviously it changed its course towards the mystery surrounding parts that set in the present time. But I did not feel those developments were bad, except the final act, especially the ending surely a let down. Actually, it was not bad, only expected a better one.\r\n\r\nThe story certainly created the atmosphere where the viewers begin their predictions.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Two women's efforts from two different timelines to save their loved one.\r\n\r\nIt was in the pre-production for over a decade, before reshuffle and recasting happened with the existing one. It was supposed to be an Indo-Aussie joint production, but later the Belgium production company joined the project. After the several hurdles it managed to get completed. It was an Anglo-Indian historical romance-drama, during the British raj in India about betrayal, coup, revenge and a journey movie. Also simultaneously set in the modern world focusing an archaeological couple who discovers a lost ancient Indian jewel in a shipwreck. From there the story gets a perfect beginning, later moves back to India.\r\n\r\nI don't understand what's with the Chinese music where the actual story take place in the 18th century India. It was so good and blends well, but that does define India or Indian culture while narrating its story. If you are not familiar with both Chinese and Indian musics, then it's not an issue at all. But that does not it, the names are Hindu and Indian soldiers with the Persian costumes, swords and other gadgets.\r\n\r\nHow the name 'Dragon's Throat' came to Indian geographical area and surname for the Indian characters in a wrong princely state. Like that, many stuffs make no sense, especially if you are from that part of the Earth. I think the research was very poor for making this movie. They should have hired an Indian musician and costume designer with an historian.\r\n\r\n> \"Love has many faces,\r\n> and one of them is jealousy.\"\r\n\r\nThe quality was top notch, the cast and their performances were excellent. But I could not stand for Bipasha Basu's facial expressions. She was always been in a sad face look, so depressing. That is the way her character was developed, so nothing wrong in her display. It was her international debut flick as well, and the launch was so disappointing. Because the story was very weak, maybe very silly. I have never seen the narration set in the ancient India other than in the Indian films. Quite amazing locations, and convinced with the visuals that how the 1700s' subcontinent would have looked like.\r\n\r\nThe major problem with this flick is that people can't get ending. How the time barrier was broken to pass through another timeline was never explained. The Hindu priest\/saint\/sadhu who blabbers about the space and time was a ridiculous than intellectual briefing. So this film owes lots of explanation to the viewers than entertaining them. I want to favour it, but I also want to be honest. The film was not like I was hoping for, very excited for the merge of historical subject with sci-fi, but did not stand tall. Thankfully, either it was not a bad movie of the year, I've seen even worse that I felt not to review. I won't recommend it, but there's a slim chance that you might like it, so choose it carefully.\r\n\r\n5\/10","id":"5661a6b39251417904007547","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5661a6b39251417904007547","movie_id":79698}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**When a secret long hidden makes its way out...**\r\n\r\nA very surprising Aussie film. Not all the Australian film makes big at the world stage. So this film was not known to many people, but I am lucky to watch this. The film was based on the Norwegian play called 'The Wild Duck'. It was adapted several times for the screen, but this is the latest and a modernised version. The first film for the director and he was amazing in handling the screenplay as well. \r\n\r\nObviously I did not know anything about the film. The cast looked good and also the storyline, so that's my reason to watch it. It began like a simple drama about a family who are going through a difficult time after the wood mill was shut down in their small town. Their's daughter, Hedvig, who is studying in the high school worries that she's going to lose her boyfriend if they move out of the town. That's not it, the narration had layers like from other people surrounding this small family and their perspective too has a big impact on the storytelling.\r\n\r\nNot just this family, but many from the town were out of the job and that leads to some unexpected decisions. Another family who ran that wood mill for nearly a century, welcomes their son, Christian from the United States who is having a tough time with his girlfriend and also to attend his father's wedding. He accidentally meets his childhood friend which is actually a Hedvig's father. They spend lots of time together and that's where a new issue arises. Christian reveals some hidden truth for the decades between their two families. Everything breaks loose and becomes impossible to fix it. From all this, the daughter is the one who directly get affected, but to learn how is why you should watch this film.\r\n\r\nYou won't immediately understand the meaning of the title. The film very smartly progresses like bit by bit with lots of suspense around. The best part is, it never reveals the actual secret at any length of the film, but still the viewers going understand the situation very clearly. That's really amazing, particularly the writing being so clever. I don't know the original material which is more than a hundred year old, but I loved this to tell the story in a smart way.\r\n\r\n> \"You do not need to be scared of the truth.\"\r\n\r\nThe characters were the best part of the story. The switching time was excellently done. Like the whole film is not intended to deal with one particular issue, but multiple. Everybody had something to deal with, some were personal and some were concerned for their whole family. The story always engaged with details, so there's no time for relaxation for the viewers. In the first half it succeeds to keep everything neat, despite the story developed from different angles. Because the end pulls them all together to conclude the tale on high. High mean, neither happy or sad, the timing when the twist takes place was a perfect setting.\r\n\r\nIf you are a melodrama fan, this must not be missed. I haven't seen a good tearjerker for a long time and then I found this one unexpectedly. I did not know the film would turn this way, but that's one of the reasons why I liked it a lot. The twist at the final act was kind of predictable if you were focused enough in the early part, but nobody gets a clear picture of how it all ends. That's the point. Despite how the film characters react when the suspense was revealed, we have our own respond too, but unable to deliver where it requires. That is funny, but the film gets very serious towards the final segment and you get no time to react, you will be like unmoved till the end credits roll up. But sensing a tragedy is certain.\r\n\r\nI recently saw 'Fathers & Daughter', that I anticipated something what this film offered. The story lines are completely different from these two films, but that father and daughter relationship thing, I liked very much from this one. Especially the emotions are the most crucial to narrate the tale and this film was way better in that perspective. Comparison between these two titles only on the sentimental side, other than that it's not fair to bring a debate on them. Anyway, both are the fine melodrama.\r\n\r\nThis film definitely would appeal strongly to the family audience and I highly recommend it to them. There's no strong nudity or the sex scenes, but thematically it goes some length to record the required event. Other than those couple of parts, this is a film for everybody. Very satisfied with the overall film. I might not consider it my favourite, but very close to be called one. Like I said the story was thoroughly written, so I'm feeling this film won't go unnoticed. I am not talking about it would find its audience, but the remakes. European, Korean, Bollywood, even a Hollywood version might come. So fingers crossed, but I suggest this one to watch if you are convinced with my review.\r\n\r\n_8.5\/10_","id":"580e4bf79251416e18001e56","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/580e4bf79251416e18001e56","movie_id":292010}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A film that differentiates the young and old generation.\r\n\r\nI would definitely say it is the director's best film. I have liked her other films, but this is a lot different from them. I mean it was well written screenplay with much better understood the contemporary world than just focusing on the relationships as usual. So the addition of digital world stuffs made all the difference and I completely enjoyed it. Don't think it would be another 'The Internship' as I initially thought, but slightly it is and much better everyway.\r\n\r\nYou are going to agree with me that the film's posters or the trailers were not very impressive as what the actual film did to grab our full attention. The two hours films are always a concern to me, but when a film like this runs for that long, I can even sit for another half an hour. Anyway, with this story and its runtime, the pace was incredible. When there's something interesting is going on, we forget to focus on the flaws and enjoy our time, which is what I exactly did in here.\r\n\r\nThis is not a comedy where you're going to laugh openly loud, it is a comedy in the sense of the set of characters the film has. I mean, the story is about the digital business and most of them who are into the computers are considered as geeks. So theirs world is nothing, but just hooked to their works and forgetting the actual world around them. Even for the someone in the next room, they tweet. For them to remind only they've changed, not the physical world and that's where our main character who is old and wise influence the younger generation people.\r\n\r\nSo the actors were undoubtedly the best thing apart from the direction and the story. The 73 years old Robert De Niro still impressing with his extraordinary character display. I don't know whoever was in mind when it was written, but this role perfectly fits none other than him. And then there's Anne Hathaway on the opposite side who equaled with De Niro with her part.\r\n\r\nFrom the narration point of view, it started with DeNiro's, but quickly around in the middle it took a circle to cover others as well. And then comes from the professional to the personal life topic when it was developed and brought a small family who were affected by the workaholic mother. So if you enter it expecting a comedy, probably you won't disappoint with what it delivers against your wish which is a heartwarming drama with some emotional moments. Surely recommended, especially the youngsters who're addicted to the digital world!\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"57c8b50dc3a3685bf8000ba7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c8b50dc3a3685bf8000ba7","movie_id":257211}
{"author":"talisencrw","content":"I know Ritchie gets a lot of flak for being a Tarantino copyist, but I really enjoy the films of the Brit that I've seen so far. They're great fun and more enjoyable than the grim-a-thons that the James Bond, Mission: Impossible and Jason Bourne franchises have churned out, though I love those as well. I thought the casting was a nice in-joke, pairing DC Comics' Superman with Marvel's Captain America, and I have loved Alicia Vikander's work since seeing her years ago in 'A Royal Affair'. I thought at the time she exuded both acting chops and sensuality out of every pore and would be a real monster if she ever went international--which she definitely has, both here and in 'Ex Machina'. Though I have never seen the TV series, I felt the camaraderie between the stars was refreshing, the car chases and other stunts were excellent, and, in a year most saturated with spy films (thankfully, for enthusiasts such as I), although it tanked at the box office, I for one hope it becomes a franchise.

{"author":"DanDare","content":"The Hateful Eight is Quentin Tarantino's eight film. Inspired by John Carpenter's movie, The Thing. We even have Kurt Russell mentioning going without sleep. However despite all the talking and there is a lot of chatter between some hateful people, it is an Agatha Christie style thriller.\r\n\r\nIn a snowbound post civil war wild west, Kurt Russell is bounty hunter John Ruth better known as the Hangman. He brings his bounty back alive so they can hang.\r\n\r\nRuth is taking back Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) a female captive with a big reward on her. He meets Major Warren (Samuel L Jackson) another bounty hunter and they decide to ride together to town and meet the new Sheriff who is due to show up.\r\n\r\nA blizzard means they have to stop at an inn. Holed up in the inn is Bruce Dern's confederate General Smithers, a bitter racist trying to find out the fate of his son.\r\n\r\nAlso there is Tim Roth's Mobray on his way to the same town as the Sheriff to be their new hangman. There are several other people hanging around the inn. Ruth is convinced that someone is not what he claims to be and is nervous.\r\n\r\nThe film has a lot of talk with suspicious, shifty people rubbing everyone up the wrong way. Tarantino wants the viewer to get complacent and then suddenly bang! He then shows you his hand.\r\n\r\nThe Hateful Eight is a twisted film with Tarantino's dark humour, mean characters and violence. However it is overlong and a mystery that might be too slow before it gets going.","id":"58b4c7fec3a3685ef7002ab2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b4c7fec3a3685ef7002ab2","movie_id":273248}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> The man is not ready yet for the eternal life!?\r\n\r\nThe first time when I saw the trailer, I thought it might be a female version or a close kind of 'Winter's Tale'. Though this is not a fairy tale, but a heartwarming sci-fantasy romedy. For every action in the movie they explained it very clearly, that's the indication of the involvement of the science, but mostly bogus for the present era. So that is where fantasy steps in.\r\n\r\nA beautiful concept with the wonderful cast. And again they did not make full use of it, lacked a deep exploration into the theme they have created for this movie. Blake Lively solely handled the movie and none others were up to the expectation, expect Harrison Ford in his about 5% of the screen presence.\r\n\r\nLike most of the guys, I am displeased with the ending. Till then I was enjoying the film, but later it ruined my mood. Because humans are always desiring for things which are out of his league and I'm human too. Since I'm not Adaline I was rooting her and I was disappointed once the twist at the end came. Later I accepted that, because it was a perfect conclusion regarding whatever I wanted.\r\n\r\nIn an entertainment movie, sometime we won't care about what's good and bad, but need some good pleasure for the time we spend for it. Especially in this kind of theme, which are out of reality, we usually love a happy ending. Because families want to leave the cinema hall with a good mood as it is indeed targeted for family audiences. So I am not going to spoil you by revealing facts about the movie, but I think you should watch it if you like modern world fantasy.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd\/10","id":"56477df4c3a3682611003f4f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56477df4c3a3682611003f4f","movie_id":293863}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Creative Western whodunit is an amusing black comedy, but also profane and repugnant***\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2015 and directed by Quentin Tarantino, \"The Hateful Eight\" is a Western about a cruel bounty hunter (Kurt Russell) taking an outlaw woman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) in to Red Rock, Wyoming, to hang. Along with a black bounty hunter (Samuel L. Jackson) and the new Sheriff of Red Rock (Walton Goggins), they hold up at a rural haberdashery during a blizzard with several dubious characters (Tim Roth, Demi\u00e1n Bichir, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern and Channing Tatum). Dana Gourrier and Zoe Bell appear in small roles.\r\n\r\nThis was Tarantino\u2019s second Western in a row after 2012\u2019s \u201cDjango Unchained,\u201d which ranks with the best Westerns of all time. This one\u2019s not as good, but it certainly has its points of interest, like the great wintery wilderness atmosphere, which is to die for. Moreover, the plot is intriguing. It's basically an Agatha Christie whodunit a la Murder on the Orient Express transferred to the Old West. Roughly 90% of the film takes place in the haberdashery and, less so, a stagecoach. It's basically a theater play masquerading as a movie and I found it a unique setting for a Western.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts out with spectacular Colorado winter cinematography highlighted by an excellent Ennio Morricone score, his first full-length score in over three decades (!). Compelling extended dialogues have always been Tarantino\u2019s strong suit; and so it is here. The amusing melodramatics are entertaining and the story keeps your interest despite the one-dimensional setting. Everything\u2019s SO exaggerated that you can\u2019t take it seriously. The movie\u2019s intentionally offensive and you have to roll WITH the excesses to be entertained; otherwise you\u2019ll hate it.\r\n\r\nOn at least one occasion the overindulgences don\u2019t work, like the disgusting fellatio sequence. I get that Marquis (Jackson) was lying to the other guy to compel him to draw, but we didn't need a visual on his fabricated story. It's sordid excess that has no place in a Western or any other movie, except gay porn, but Tarantino obviously included it in order to be \"edgy\" or whatever.\r\n\r\nThe excellent opening with the figure of Christ dying for our sins keys off the theme, which is humanity\u2019s fallen condition and dire need of redemption. The title, \u201cThe Hateful Eight,\u201d is a perversion of \u201cThe Magnificent Seven.\u201d The latter celebrates the noble and heroic whereas this movie parodies the base and odious. Tarantino is poking fun at our petty hostilities that separate us based on race, gender, sectionalism, faction-ism, envy and rivalry. Furthermore, men divided by hatred of culture and race can unite in hatred of something else, in this case misogyny.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 47 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B","id":"5b4e390bc3a36823de06552f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b4e390bc3a36823de06552f","movie_id":273248}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is a movie that I have to say that I have a bit of a difficulty in rating. Quite honestly I was sorely tempted to remove a star, or even two stars. Why? Because it is full of Hollywood nonsense, scientific errors, it is rather predictable and it did feel a bit like a Apollo 13 rip-off. Why did I not remove those stars? Well, it is rather entertaining even if, at times, I squirmed in my seat.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of with a somewhat implausible event where a unexpected storm hits the Mars camp which forces the ground crew of the Mars mission to hurry back to the launch vehicle before it tilts over. The launch vehicle gradually tilts a degree at the time. Is it just me finding this strange? Would storms on Mars defy the usual rules of weather dynamics that they would exert a constant pressure which would cause a slow but constant tilt of a construct like that. No gusts, no change in pressure? And why would it gradually tilt at all? Once the force would be enough for the landing struts on one side to leave the ground it would pretty much tilt right away. Okay, I am being picky so lets give that a benefit of a doubt for the time being.\r\n\r\nObviously one guy is lost during the dramatic events. This is equally obviously 100% predictable. The fact that the guy is still alive after the rest of the crew blasted off is obviously also 100% predictable but then, this you should have pretty figured out from the title of the move after all.\r\n\r\nA lot of the rest of the movie is following this guys quest for survival on Mars using the left over equipment at his disposal and the NASA crew on Earth trying to rescue him. Yes the NASA crew on Earth does discover that he is alive which, again, is pretty much predictable. Of course this gave Hollywood the opportunity to add a utterly dislikable political bureaucrat that is pretty much in the movie for one reason and one reason alone\u2026to be dislikable. Personally I just found him tiresome. But then, Americans seems to like these kind of people given the kind of trash that we see being pushed towards the upcoming presidential elections\u2026from both sides!\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of good stuff in the movie. Even though it is rather predictable there are some suspense in it, there are a lot of good scenery, and even though you pretty much knows what is going to happen you do feel like cheering for the hero. Given the script I think a lot of the actors did a rather good job of their roles.\r\n\r\nIf the script writers would have brought on some decent scientific advisors I would say this would have been a great movie but it was frequently goofed up with issues that was just stupid. Like digging down a nuclear reactor a few feet in the ground. What the f\u2026 good was that supposed to do? And the constant use of simple plastic and duct tape to seal the environment. Yeah, right. Sure, Mars do have some atmosphere so it is not vacuum we are talking about but then in other scenes they seemed to assume almost zero atmosphere and made quite a bit use of explosive decompression effects.\r\n\r\nOkay, okay I am probably nitpicking quite a bit here but, unlike many Science Fiction movies, this one tries to give an impression of being within the realms of realism and it is just too full of classical Hollywood mishaps for my taste.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote above I still think it is a movie worth watching. It has some suspense, it is well done from a photographic point of view and the actors are doing a decent job. I think 7 out of 10 stars is a fair rating but it should certainly not have more.","id":"56d97caac3a3682cef01144c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56d97caac3a3682cef01144c","movie_id":286217}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> One man show...\r\n\r\nI don't think the movie is worth a watch. There's nothing in it apart from Richard Gere's fine performance. If you still want to try it, he is the only reason to consider. You know performances alone can't save the movie, especially that theory did not work in this film. The story was very plain, it was about a man who's living with remorse and suddenly an unexpected thing happens that could help him to come out of his guilt fell, but it only gets worse in his every attempt.\r\n\r\nThe contribution from the rest of the cast was one of two reasons for the movie's downfall. They were okay, no complaint about that, but they were totally not visible like their existence means nothing other than to support the Gere's role. And the other reason was the scenes that lacked to imprint in the viewer's head with memorable quotes and\/or moments. I would say there's a dull atmosphere in the entire narration. It is not an entertainer, but can be a character study material.\r\n\r\n5\u00bd\/10","id":"571cd2dd92514115e2002e6a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/571cd2dd92514115e2002e6a","movie_id":328901}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Re-editing the god's creation.\r\n\r\nI was looking forward for this since it was from one of my favourite directors who is a very unique storyteller. This is a fantasy and a black comedy from Belgium that was chosen to represent the country in the last Oscars. This is where the critics overtake the film fanatic to like it more. It is a theme that revolves on what would you do if you get a power to write the laws of the nature. A complicated topic, because loopholes are inevitable, but the writer and director did not care much about that and narrated the tale what they just wanted to tell.\r\n\r\nThe story centres on an arrogant and abusive father who is also the creator the universe, especially the designer of the lives on the earth and this tale takes place in the Belgian capital, Brussels. When his bored and concerned daughter Ea, runs away from home to re-edit his creation as advised by her brother JC, he goes after her to ensure everything stay as he had planned. In an unexpected confrontation between father and daughter, in the end who is going to be victorious is the rest of the narration. Remember, there is a post credit scene, which opens the door for a possible sequel, but I don't think that'll happen.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> \"Giving men knowledge of their own death... Crazy!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful concept, but I don't think I liked the entire narration, though some of the parts were very interesting. Since it was a fantasy, logics are not required, but the lack of the basic explanation was the setback if you're a broad minded. This film is for the simple minds, especially after knowing the theme you should not anticipate a genuine tale with great adventure and stunts, particularly not visual extravaganza. It was kind of a drama-adventure, something like entering the world that created by you and experiencing all by yourself the positives and negatives of it.\r\n\r\nSomewhat it was a fun, so definitely not a bad film, but I felt it should have been a lot more than that. Kind of a missed opportunity and falls into a simplicity. All the actors were good, especially the little girl. But I think it's not suitable for the children on the ground of a film character who is associated with sex related stuff, hence it got a few brief nudes.\r\n\r\nThe God character was awesome, even though his acts are predictable I enjoyed the comedies delivered by him. The Ea's undertaking was more a serious and which tries to relate with the Chritianity, especially 'The Last Supper' after her decision to help a few selected people down in the earth over billions. All the above it was barely a magical film, so that's where you've to compromise than to expect crazy stuffs out of it. So in my opinion, it was not delightful as it looks nor the best work of this talented director, but a decent 2 hour long film.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"576d85acc3a368574a0006c0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/576d85acc3a368574a0006c0","movie_id":330764}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"Yet ANOTHER cabin in the woods flick, but it delivers the goods\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2015 and written & directed by DeShon Hardy, \"The Lake on Clinton Road\" chronicles events at the titular lake in remote New Jersey when three college couples go to a vacation home to celebrate. Things go horrible awry when they discover that the rumors of the lake being haunted are real. \r\n\r\nThe low ratings & reviews are inaccurate because this is a cogent cabin-in-the-woods flick. While it may be a low-budget indie with a no-name cast, the acting is convincing and the creepiness & scares are genuine. Moreover, the score is effective (with the soundtrack throwing in some rap sheet). The six youths travel to their isolated destination in typical celebration mode, but their frivolity palpably changes by the second half. People complain that they\u2019re an obnoxious bunch, but that\u2019s not true. They\u2019re just young adults out celebrating. So what? We\u2019ve all done it. \r\n\r\nThe two football guys (Richard Ryker & Anthony Grant) are great masculine role models, disregarding the customary cussing. They have good camaraderie, treat their women well, and don\u2019t abuse the chubby white guy, their amusing pal. Ryker is particularly a strong masculine protagonist. Speaking of the women, the director has a good eye for depicting feminine beauty without getting too tasteless. Leah Jones is mind-blowingly voluptuous while petite brunette Stephanie Marrone ain\u2019t no slouch; nor is the black girl for that matter (India Autry). \r\n\r\nThe bottom line is: The movie works well for what it is. It contains all the requisite staples and works them expertly into an entertaining brew. I\u2019d watch this any day over the cartoonish \u201cThe Evil Dead\u201d (1981), the over-the-top comical \u201cEvil Dead II\u201d (1987), the trashy \u201cCabin Fever\u201d (2002), the lame \u201cZombeavers\u201d (2014) or the too-creative-for-its-own-good \u201cCabin in the Woods\u201d (2012).\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a curiously overlong epilogue tacked-on after the end credits that\u2019s at least three times as long as it needed to be. I think the director just wanted to give some screen time to the two 12 year-old girls in the back seat, who are probably related to him. In any case, it shows a fresh group of giddy youths just before they\u2019re humbled big time; humbled or dead, whatever.               \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 20 minutes and was shot in Marlton, New Jersey & Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B+","id":"5aea0ab8c3a3682be800019c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5aea0ab8c3a3682be800019c","movie_id":353599}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Writer and blogger Cable Sankar's debut is a film a young woman who plays with fire out of desperation and just about manages to end up unharmed with some help from her boyfriend. After an initial misunderstanding, Madhu ( Arundhathi) and Shiva (Taman) fall in love. When Madhu's stepbrother is fatally injured in an accident, and needs a huge sum of money for the operation, in a fit of desperation, she switches her photograph with that of a reporter who is to be killed by an assassin. Her hope is that her family can use the insurance money to save her stepbrother. However, by the time she realizes her folly, the assassin paid to kill the reporter is after Madhu and won't stop till she is dead. \r\n\r\nIf there is one thing that Cable Sankar has to be appreciated for, it is for attempting a film that is centred around the heroine. This is a plot that could have easily been made with the hero as the central figure (guy gets into a problem and overcomes it) but he lets the actions of the heroine drive the plot forward. Madhu is the one who initiates contact with Shiva. It is she who is partly to blame for Arjun's condition. And, it is she who takes the decision to test fate. \r\n\r\nBut the film fails to make good on its promise, despite the interesting set-up, mainly because of a tired, overlong romantic track with too many songs and dull conversations that just sap the energy out of it. Some of the scenes have a serial-like quality (we even get a coldhearted stepmother), there is an unsuccessful attempt at humour ( Balaji, who plays the hero's sidekick, is as grating as nails on chalkboard) and the film takes a lot of time to get to the plot. \r\n\r\nThere is a parallel track to this love story where a minister's murder (which opens the film) is cleverly passed off as an accident and a cop investigating it unofficially. We are told about exciting stuff like orchestrated accident networks, chases on highways, and ingenious GPS devices. But the second half is largely a muddled thriller. The silent assassin is an archetype that can strike fear but here, he ( Vincent Asokan) is unintentionally hilarious. He just keeps chasing the heroine but in one sequence when she is so close at hand (and the hero far away to be of any help) he just limps away! In another scene, Madhu just about escapes after a chase and minutes later, we see her and Shiva getting all romantic in a hotel! Shiva's plan of letting Madhu be a bait to catch the assassin might have seemed credible on paper but from the way it unfolds on screen, it appears half-baked. Then there are the narrative conveniences \u2014 Madhu's insurance amount is Rs 30 lakh and that is exactly the amount her stepbrother needs for his operation; she just happens to have her photo with her to switch the photos; the reporter turns up out of the blue to save her when she is about to be mowed down; the person who ordered the hit on the minister is the same one who wanted the reporter dead and so on. For a movie about murders committed as accidents, this one has too many things happening by accident!","id":"5503000c92514174f6000f73","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5503000c92514174f6000f73","movie_id":280161}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> The truth determines our actions.\r\n\r\nI found this film when it was listed in the BBC news' top 20 films of the 2015. This film topped the chart, then how can I just ignore which is my prime world news feed. The fun part was I saw a South Korean film called 'Assassination' believed to be this, but very I soon realised the mistake. Anyhow, I loved the Korean film that I reviewed a couple of moths ago on this same blog.\r\n\r\nFinally, I managed to see this Mandarin film, but it was not anything like I've been expecting. Critically acclaimed film, but commercially failed because of the slow narration. Jointly produced by China-Hong Kong-Taiwan, but selected as a Taiwanese entry to the Oscars that failed to make a progress to the main event.\r\n\r\nNot everybody can easily follow this narration. Because this is not a typical historical film presentation with a clear introduction like in the background voice or in the texts, except in the opening that letting us know where and how it begins. The lack of the character development is the factor for all the complication. So I strongly suggest to read the synopsis before the watch and have a look at the film character infographic once finished watching.\r\n\r\nThe story sets in the 8th century China during the final years of the Tang Dynasty. When a well trained assassin failed to accomplish the mission directed by her master, she is sent to another province for another assignment where she starts to remember her past that she has some connection with her undertaking. With all the bad things happening in and around the royal family, state politics et cetera, the rift is inevitable that anytime the dynasty might fall. The remaining the tale reveals how the film ends with a realistic approach.\r\n\r\n> \"The way of the sword is pitiless. Saintly virtues play no part in it. Your skills are matchless, but your mind is hostage to human sentiments.\"\r\n\r\nI am a film fanatic, so basically I love all the films I watch. But I prefer entertainment the most, followed by the message, education, inspiration, true events et cetera. I had seen many films like this that I mostly ended up unsatisfied. Because a film without the background score as same as silent lullaby. Speaking of music, when the film was in the final scene there came a music which I compare to oasis. That's the beautiful sound I have heard in this entire narration. Slow camera panning and fixed cameras for minutes is what I disliked in it or any similar themed films.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the effort to preserve the historical account in a film format, but the type of narration matters a lot if they expect the audiences backing. A film like this is specially made for film festivals, surely critics love it and as I heard they did. I can't believe even if the film critics failed to recognise what would be the film's fate.\r\n\r\nSo it is a slow film then, but when the stunt sequences appeared, I was thrilled with my full attention. Well composed realistic fights, that's what anybody remembers when they think of Chinese films. But I warn you this is not a complete martial art film except now and then you encounter such scenes. It is not even a horror, but there was a scene with smoke which scared the hell out of me. I was not expecting such thing, besides, I was bored to death when this thing came I woke up.\r\n\r\nThe film was shot in the beautiful outdoor places. Apart from the stunts, I loved the landscapes which were just resembled the classical Chinese paintings. I did not find any performances that impressive. I appreciate their effort, but since the story was told without anyone's particular perspective, felt like everyone had equal scope for their roles.\r\n\r\nOverall, I did not like the film and I'm not suggesting it to anybody. But if you are interested in the Chinese ancient history or love the art films then you could try it. This is first low rated film to review on this blog which is I've been avoiding since the beginning, but decided to write for all kinds of rating now onwards.\r\n\r\n3\/10","id":"57603cf3c3a36849cf00302a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57603cf3c3a36849cf00302a","movie_id":253450}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The one who came back from the dead to avenge.\r\n\r\nThe movie was inspired by the real event that sets in the year 1823, United States. When one of the crew members of the hunters left behind after he was severely hurt from a bear attack, he desperately looks for a way to get back to the camp alive, especially to avenge for the death of his close one. The whole film was about survival in the wilderness and to avoid the native Americans. But the introduction in the opening was very brief and in the final act, it was another brief man hunt. Overall, it was an enjoyable movie for adults with some gruesome scenes.\r\n\r\nThe movie was made on a grand scale. Well written screenplay, good direction, the cast, music and the locations, but it would have been even awesome if it was true to the original occurrence. I felt it was cinematically overdosed, especially for the commercial purpose. The fans of Leonardo Dicaprio's overwhelming celebration created a huge buzz. In fact, it looks like the entire Hollywood is his fan and the Oscars given to him out of sympathy, because I have seen his best performances better than this in the past.\r\n\r\nThe length of the movie was a big concern, should have been at least 15 minutes shorter. But the visuals were fantastic, the CGI bear was almost flawless. There are plenty of reasons why this should not be missed, at a time the narration lacks the realism. Otherwise, it would have made a wonderful semi-documentary film. So don't have high hope on this, especially if you're no ones fans, but just love watching movies like me. A little bit overrated everywhere, but still this movie is good, just good, that's it, not a masterpiece.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"5729f349c3a36808f000288a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5729f349c3a36808f000288a","movie_id":281957}

{"author":"talisencrw","content":"This was an odd experience, as I just recently ended a self-imposed 12-year moratorium on relationships, due to a couple of bad ones I had within a short period of time in the early 2000's. It was very intriguing to see a type of dystopia exist in which 'singledom' was so vilified to the point of actually being against the law. I would never have previously thought that such a state of events was possible, but recent trends in 'political correctedness' on the one hand and both religious and political radicalism on the other means that, sadly, nothing is impossible anymore. I thought it was a remarkable idea for a film, and both the soundtrack and cinematography were outstanding. The bizarre script and bold direction brought forth some of the best acting I have yet seen from Colin Ferrell, Rachel Weisz and John C. Reilly, as well.\r\n\r\nI'm definitely looking forward to seeing other films by this brazenly original writer\/director.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A close look at generation and professional gap.\r\n\r\nHave I really watched a South American movie! This is not a doubt over the culture or the language the movie was rendered, but the basic plot was universally appealing. Wherever from you are, this story will look very familiar, you know the master-servant theme with jealous, dominance and other differences between them which intrigued after some unexpected incident. Don't assume it is a revenge flick, but a closer look at the daily life of a servant.\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful drama filled with some occasional dark humours. Frankly, I did not expect it to be this good after I heard it failed to make into the Academy Awards. Yep, this was Brasil's submission for the 2016's Oscars. A story of a live-in housemaid called Val. She opted this life to be apart from her daughter Jessica only to provide a better life for her. But things change, once Jessica decides to come and stay with her mother to apply for a college in Sao Paulo. That brings a complete chaos in the household due to the generation and the professional gap.\r\n\r\nIt was a casual opening, like Val was doing her daily routine. This was a very calm part, the story that introduced everything without complicating, especially keeping in mind the second half narration. The movie also digs every detail very closely, like how a maid behaves when her owner is not around, individual relationship with everyone in the house including the other maids and their personal desires.\r\n\r\n> \"She looks at everything. Looks like the president.\"\r\n\r\nBelieve me, if you ever had one, probably you begin to think them now by remembering any strange incidents from the past like what might be the truth. It is not like accusing them for something, but you know, sometimes we forget we're the same other than a thin line between us called the social status. That's where this film hits you hard and makes you feel regret if you have ever done anything wrong without knowing.\r\n\r\nIt was not like any other similar movies I have seen. There was only a small deviation, that's what it makes a special. Also, it was not completely a realistic boring drama if you're wondering about the pace. It was a steady tempo, but had the sufficient entertaining content, often makes us to guess the next scene and besides it had a tiny twist at the end. It was not a strong ending as one could have wanted, but it's the best one after the story took a turn in the final act.\r\n\r\nI don't know the cast or the crew, but the direction was top notch alongside the cast performances. Thankfully, it was not another sentimental drama with a struggling servant or the questionable relationship between a mother and her daughter. Very much within our perception like you know all this, but seeing it for the first time. The balance between everything was the best of it. Almost 80% of the movie were shot in a single location\/house and a few outside clips as the story demanded.\r\n\r\nThe Oscars might have rejected it, because there's only five slot and they found better five to fill the spot, but that should not be the reason you to skip this heartwarming movie from the country that hosting the next Olympic games. I feel this film is this year's 'Ida', unlike a nun's self-discovery before taking oath to the god, here a maid realises her mistakes and not being a good mother to her daughter which leads her to fix it by not repeating it. A movie that should be watched with the family, inviting housekeeper for the watch might help bond well. So definitely recommended, a highly recommended movie for the weekend gathering.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"56c0a14ec3a368180600bb61","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56c0a14ec3a368180600bb61","movie_id":310569}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> It's not about a GEEK, but somebody's DUFF.\r\n\r\nYet, another movie about an intelligent high school teen girl who socially unfit among others. After realising her issue, she fights back to regain what she was missing. This type of concept is extremely common, but initiating a fresh idea on where the narration can develop the plots and finishes off high note is the vital for a movie's success. This film had one of that and that is called the DUFF. You can find out what that stands for in its official posters.\r\n\r\nThe movie was above the average. The characters were great, but not the unique ones. Everything was enjoyable, I mean it was not a usual annoying teen movie. Well directed because he got a good screenplay that extracted from the book of the same name. The cast was good, nice performances and so it is official that Bella Thorne classified for those mean girl roles.\r\n\r\nAnyway the main character Bianca was so good. Whitman was too old for the role, but outclassed it. Carefully handled to get under the PG13, and it succeeds. So kids with the matured minds are pretty much allowed to watch it and I don't see any serious offensive to keep them away other than facts the film talks about. Overall a nice watch for sure.\r\n\r\n6.5\/10","id":"55b13438c3a368300200e7ad","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55b13438c3a368300200e7ad","movie_id":272693}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Lost in one world, found in another.\r\n\r\nMy last anime movie was 'Giovanni Island' and I did not end up liking much. I thought that was a decent movie with an intense WWII story told through the Japanese children's perspective. Since then almost half a year passed and now I saw this from the director of 'Wolf Children'. That was his career best movie, so I think the director wanted to follow the same footstep. Thus he ended up making this one which was quite similar theme, except the sketches were not as cute as that.\r\n\r\nLike one of the discussion topics on this title, it almost connects with the director's previous movie. Maybe something like Tarantino, who tried to connect 'The Hateful Eight' with 'Django Unchained', later dropped the idea for the characters that failed to merge. But here the reason might be the drawings which were somewhat different styles. And this one seems for teenagers and adults for having a little mature content when the narration reaches the second half.\r\n\r\nIt opened by a brief telling about the monsters and its world. Came back to the human society to focus on a 8-year-old runaway boy named Ren. While tailing a couple of strange creatures, he accidentally enters the monster world through a secret portal. Soon he meets a beast called Kumatetsu who is one of two candidates for 'the great master' title, decides to take him as his protege.\r\n\r\nSo the quarrelling begins between them for having difference in everything, but as the time passes, they bond well. Then comes a time for Kumatetsu to compete in what he was preparing for, and the boy who finds his own path. But somewhere when they were getting apart, an evil force brings them together to fight against it.\r\n\r\n> \"People who work hard sincerely will master it quickly.\"\r\n\r\nFelt like I was watching a comedy, that was until the first half. All the character intros were kind of normal, nothing grand, but later found a strong connection to each other and each were very unique in nature to remember. This part is where that suits better for children and what comes next was kind of opposite. Feels fun parts are over, introduces a few new characters as the narration takes as big leap as 8 years forward.\r\n\r\nThis middle section was like a re-launch, like a new story to begin. As a child character turns into a teenager, the movie attempted to fit with adultish stuffs. So there was a semi romance, but feels like the quite friendship track. This is where you think the movie lets you down, a time kill section. Due to the theme that designed to take place between the two worlds, this is very important for moving forward to the 3rd act. I think shortening around 5 minutes would have done good for the pace of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe final act is even more unlike to the earlier episodes that adds a wonderful special effects to bring the action sequence. Sadly the stunts were not as dynamic as I hoped, I mean it was too short especially if you love fights. The kid and the beast combo were like from 'Ernest & Celestine'. Whenever these two are seen together, that bring so much fun.\r\n\r\nBasically the movie outlines how humans are obsessed for power, who can go any lengths to clinch it and one of the ways is to let the darkness consume him. I already saw it twice. For the second time view it was even better and I liked it very much. Still, it is not the director's best work, as well as not a bad movie to just ignore.\r\n\r\nAfter Miyazaki announced his retirement, many anime fans, including me were heartbroken. I never found anyone who can replace him, but a very few names came closer that includes this film director. He already gave some hits, but right now all he needs is to carry on his consistency, and definitely his name would appear beside that legend. I need not to tell you that anime movies are becoming rare these days, so when one make its way and people who watched it says it is a good movie, then must grab it.\r\n\r\n8\u00bd\/10","id":"56f3f375925141351c000404","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56f3f375925141351c000404","movie_id":315465}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"For Mithran (Jayam Ravi), the protagonist of Thani Oruvan, a person's friend shows his character while his adversary shows his capacity. Mithran is a young IPS officer whose only goal in life is to find a worthy rival \u2014 a kingpin who is the root cause of all other crimes \u2014 and destroy him. He meets his match in Siddharth Abhimanyu (Arvind Swami, making a glorious return), an ambitious scientist-businessman, for whom money is all that matters. This is how Mohan Raja sets up the conflict in Thani Oruvan, an efficient thriller, which packs a mighty punch. Raja's films so far have been competent remake efforts, but nothing prepares us for the smart writing (the director has co-written the film with writer duo Suba, whose experience in pulp novels comes in handy as it did earlier this year in Anegan) and the sleek filmmaking we see here.\r\n\r\nThe plot kicks in once Mithran learns of Siddharth's plan of sabotaging a deal that would result in cheaper medicines for the poor and tries to thwart it without his knowing, but the wily Siddharth manages to succeed. Realizing that he has an opponent who will not stop until he is defeated, Siddharth begins a cat-and-mouse game with the cop. There are some terrific moments \u2014 the scene where an assassination plan swings both ways, the scene where Mithran discovers Siddharth has paid his place a visit, the scene where two lives depend on Mithran finding a bug, the scene where Siddharth negotiates with the chief minister. What is refreshing is that, to a large extent, Raja manages to avoid diversions in the form of romance and comedy. Mithran's batchmate Mahima (an ideal Nayanthara) is in love with him, but she isn't just a love interest. She is intelligent (a forensic expert) and fearless and an essential person in Mithran's battle against Siddharth. In fact, when he says that he is ready to give up his life in order to bring down Siddharth, it is Mahima who makes him see his flawed approach to stopping crime. Yes, we get some fun moments with Thambi Ramaiah, who plays Siddharth's father, but it is never at the cost of the narrative.\r\n\r\nThani Oruvan is a bit too long (Siddharth enters the picture quite late), there are leaps of logic (like the one involving a dubbed video evidence) that we are asked to turn a blind eye to, but such downsides are minimal. And even though it is a plot-driven film, the film gives us well-rounded characters, who lend the slightly far-fetched story plausibility. The film doesn't shy away from showing Mithran for who he actually is \u2014 an angry young man whose ideals have turned him into an almost psychotic person. Crime, for him, is an obsession. What keeps him grounded are his fellow cop friends and Mahima. Jayam Ravi's body language \u2014 the purposeful strides, the clenched fists, the stern face \u2014 displays the determination of the character but doesn't really capture the craziness of the character.\r\n\r\nBut Arvind Swami aces the role of Siddharth. He projects the insouciant arrogance that tells us not to be taken in by his classy style which hides the character's toughened hide, and it is no surprise that we even root for this character, the villain, when he makes his moves against the hero. 'Show me your enemy and I'll tell you who you are', the film tells us in the beginning. With Siddharth, the film shows that you could paraphrase that statement and get the recipe for a thriller \u2014 'Show me your antagonist and I'll tell you how effective your film is'.","id":"55e7bcc7c3a3682c5d000ec2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55e7bcc7c3a3682c5d000ec2","movie_id":280165}

{"author":"mattwilde123","content":"This was a really good horror film. The direction was very interesting and Robert Egger plays with darkness and shadows in a really horrifying way. The tension is unbearable at times.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is a bit hard to follow as it is very \"old\u00e9 English\" to add to the historical accuracy of the piece. The actors are all good at reciting this strange dialect and demonstrating the paranoia spreading through the family thanks to religion and superstition.The film is based on accounts and texts found from the era and so everything seen on screen has been taken from sources and barely been touched. Every part of the film seems authentic.\r\n\r\nIt is refreshing to see a film that doesn't really on jump-scares and annoying \"cattle-prod\" techniques to make audiences scared. 'The Witch' is genuinely disturbing without resorting to these techniques. It is very strange and gory when it needs to be. I also found these strange scenes quite fascinating and educational as the film almost seems like a historical document.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605","id":"58c16fb5c3a36825db00a96c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c16fb5c3a36825db00a96c","movie_id":310131}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> In a rage for revenge, the GIFTS can be our handy weapon.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it was well written by Joel Edgerton as well debuted as a director with it. That is only because of comparing with other over hyped crappy mystery-thrillers. Frankly, to me it was a decent flick that I enjoyed watching. Flaws, loopholes, whatever you call them, this film had so many due to lack of revelation of the earlier occurrence. While I tried to raise the questions on the issues I found, I also discovered possible answers for them. So either way it covers up as a little smartly, but in reality that does not make any sense at all.\r\n\r\nKind of a revenge movie, but I can't reveal more than that about the theme as it may spoil if you have not seen it yet. It was about a young married couple who moved back to their hometown after losing their unborn baby. They encounter one of their high school friends in a shopping mall and the relationship grows intensely on one end where the other side was indirectly denied. So what might happen when the grown up guys caught in a state like this is what brings the crux of the story.\r\n\r\nAs usual Rebecca Hall was so hot, Jason Bateman in a convincing act and Joel Edgerton, who was in a key role exhibited his part decently. Pretty good title as well. In the beginning it looked so simple, but while story moving forward the meaning was intensely unveiled.\r\n\r\nThe narration was kind of brilliant, because it won't let you take a side when clash begin to happen. At a time not quite easy to predict the scenes. This mystery-thriller was too much dramaticed and presented at a slow pace. Especially avoids the serious violences, but still covers a few that obviously required to shape up the film. Like I said it was not a special movie, but worth to choose and for a few people it might be an awesome flick.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd\/10","id":"566ee7e4925141738300eb82","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/566ee7e4925141738300eb82","movie_id":328425}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Not your typical treasure hunt film!**\r\n\r\nWho doesn't like treasure hunt films. They are always exciting with surprises. See this film poster, and the title is just perfect. That's what I expected, like if not another 'Indiana Jones', then 'National Treasure'. I was disappointed with that perspective. But realised it was unique with the most realistic approach. I've seen plenty of same themed films, but this one stood out to be one of the rare kind. This film is not fun as the others, but surely makes sense of what real treasure hunt means. Though the film did not take the complicated route to narrate the tale. Just a simple, small film.\r\n\r\nA man from a little middle-class family living in an apartment is approached by his neighbour guy who financially broke. All he wanted was some cash, so that he could go and look for treasure that his dying grandfather told him about. Now these two join hands for the unusual quest. They had to make all the pre-arrangement before jumping into it. Like hiring a metal detector and making it a weekend event for not clashing with their routines. So finally the most expected venture begins and how it all turns out are told with some fun filled tense climax.\r\n\r\nThis is a very slow film. Particularly those treasure hunt sequences became even slower than what one would expect out of it. Probably a film for matured audience. It is considered as a black comedy and yes, that's how everything unfolded. Though not all black comedies are same. I mean not everybody understands clearly why it is called that.\r\n\r\nIn my instance, I expected something else, but got another thing. In the end, I really enjoyed it. The initial story was unbelievable. I mean, if somebody approached me with a theory like that, not just me, most of the people won't easily want to be a part of it. Not because it is illegal, but does not make sense or gives enough reason to take part. It has to be convinced thoroughly.\r\n\r\n> \u275dWe've all got problems. You've got problems. I've got problems. A man makes his own problems. They don't descend from heaven.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe little Robin Hood story at the opening was relevant to how the film has ended. That character called Costi was an ideal man for a typical world. His belief to be a good person in the society, definitely gives the right message. But I did not think he would go for such a quest. That's the first twist. Then following that, seeing his desperate to succeed, more than the man who took him in, it kind of made fun, like of course black comedy. Especially during the hunt, the verbal fight between two out of three set a perfect tone for the rest of the tale.\r\n\r\nDefinitely not a predictable storyline. That's what kept my eyes open, despite frequent drops in the pace of the narration. I liked the dialogues, especially about the some of the technical terms. Like about metal detector, and the brief history about the Romanian communist era, including the Dos and Don'ts, what the law says about the treasures that has found. It was not like you take all the needed tools and the adventure begins. It excellently highlighted that the treasure hunt is not like one you have seen in the films.\r\n\r\nFinally, regarding the treasure, it comes in many forms. How this film sorted out that part was really cool. That's indeed a well written screenplay. It's not impossible to see such a film in Hollywood, but they won't make money, that's the difference. That is the reason why small film industries around the world shines with such little gems. This is the reason I want to explore the world cinema.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the development, in some of the parts, the film was not that logical. That's how it has to go, so it became what it is. As I said the end was really cool. I meant the post quest end. It had ended bringing a little smile on my face. Nice performances. The writer, director is the first to be appreciated. I haven't seen many Romanian films, but from those I've seen never disappointed, and so this one, a very satisfying film. My little advise is for those who wants to see it is expect it to be a drama than an action-adventure- thriller. Patience is another thing it required. Probably you would like it after watched it than while watching. But overall a worthy film.\r\n\r\n_7.5\/10_","id":"5a7702a4c3a36859cc048b59","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a7702a4c3a36859cc048b59","movie_id":334924}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"The Hunger Games creator and mastermind Suzanne Collins has brought to life the explosive and resilient heroine Katniss Everdeen (not to mention the resourceful actress stepping into her action-oriented shoes and consciousness in the form of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence). Now with the conclusive The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 ardent and casual fans of this imaginative and charged film franchise will get a chance to soak in the cinematic experience that has carried them through this durable trilogy. However, the question remains: does Mockingjay--Part 2 fulfill the adventurous swagger of its previous predecessors as it demonstrates its furious farewell in moodiness and mischievousness? Well, the answer is a resounding YES but some will still address the concept of the film's emotional and psychological leanings as merely serviceable to a string of feisty films that invited such passion, pronouncement and promise in its commentary on class struggle and societal survival means as a whole. \r\n\r\nThe Hunger Games cinematic installments (and of course Collins's riveting literary outlets) have always been a solid and secure movie-going moment because it offered what so few action-packed features entailed: a perceptive and honest if not hedonistic look at the politics in the human psyche set aside from the rough-and-tumble sequences of action and suspense. The Games that were played in the minds of the audience were intriguing, thoughtful, compelling and smart about its wits and wisdom. All The Hunger Games editions were message-driven and presented a special kind of indescribable opulence and openness that was refreshing. Sure, there are the highs and lows that comes with the territory when mapping out a showcase of sequels bound to stumble on its lapses in story and characterization. Still, for the most part The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 leaves the viewers wanting more but being compliant with what amounts to be the swan song for courageous cutie Katniss Everdeen's big screen legacy. \r\n\r\nIt is quite clear that The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 and its previous outings has carved a decisive niche into the Young Adult film fiction genre as one of the most successful and consistently received chapters that sparkled in its over-glow of gallant gumption and soul-searching turmoil. Indeed, Mockingjay--Part 2 does add its measurement of tension, radiance,  redemption and resolution. Importantly, Mockingjay--Part 2 maintains its reflective and steady balance of hope and rebellious vibes and Lawrence has not lost a single ounce of momentum in the few years since she donned the respectable defiance of the roguish Katniss out to settle a continuous score with the controlling powers-that-be.  Instinctively, labeling The Hunger Games motivating movie series as a pop cultural phenom would not risk the intention of sounding overdramatic because for the most part this film franchise has been a saving grace to the aforementioned Young Adult film fiction craze that has offered cemented substance in comparison to the soapy sentiments of the immense Twilight umbrella that spread like wildfire in the unguarded woods years before.\r\n\r\nAs one can imagine Mockingjay--Part 2 picks up where the first Mockingjay left off in its initial premise. Director Francis Lawrence (back at the helm) starts his narrative rather slow and plodding but builds up the sassy momentum as his on-screen victorious vixen Katniss Everdeen pounces on her latest exploits to expose and agitate the corruptible Capitol and its lead manipulator in the likes of the diabolical President Snow (Donald Sutherland). The good news is that the determined Katniss is finally reunited with her former Games companion and romantic partner Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). The bad news is that poor Peeta has been manipulated and convinced to view Katniss as an enemy courtesy of Snow's menacing minions. Automatically, this is the difficult wedge that puts a damper on Katniss's ability to go after Snow and his vile followers with Peeta serving as their brainwashed Boy Wonder with the forced hatred in tact. \r\n\r\nSo now the course is set for Katniss Everdeen to follow as she decides to pursue her intentions of gradually taking down the governmental negligence of Snow and his abominable administration. Naturally, Katniss needs the assistance of the rebels under the tutelage of District 13's President Alma Coin (Oscar-winner Julianne Moore) as well as the input from wily gamemaster Plutarch Heavensbee (late Oscar-winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman) to take down the dangerous and devious Snow and his governmental criminal cronies. Politically, the opportunistic Coin wants Katniss in her camp for the mere promotion of propaganda...something that just does not sit well with the feminine avenger.\r\n\r\nThe stakes are understandably high but Katniss is in company with the likes of her childhood sweetie pie Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and old-time buddy Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) as they join forces to combat the evil clutched of the Capitol. The bottom line: the venomous President Snow needs to be cut down in his treacherous tracks...plain and simple. \r\n\r\nQuite frankly, the beleaguered Katniss is caught up in the complicated web of a couple of political powerhouses in the insufferable Snow (that wants to destroy her) and Coin (that wants to use her reputation for marketing purposes) willing to go at it while using Katniss's exposed neck as the sacrificial pawn to determine their sense of twisted greatness. For the most part, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 does present a skillful display of confusion and identity and Lawrence's death-dodging diva Katniss Everdeen is the epitome of a Girl on Fire with flames of indecision and doubt burning all around her. Who can she trust? Who has the fortitude to stick with the plan and ensure that the tedious target of Snow is silenced for sure? Can Katniss overcome the obstacles of her great love Peeta's perverse distaste for her while battling one narcissistic leader as another one she is joined at the hip exploits her presence? There seems to be a constant continuity for conflict in warfare and wounded souls that elevates Mockingjay--Part 2 as a boisterous board game of physical and psychological movement. As usual, Lawrence's Katniss carries the animated strife on her dainty yet athletic shoulders with bouncy boldness. \r\n\r\nAfter four exhilarating films, The Hunger Games empire does not crumble but comes to a full scale halt as it understands the allegory claims for the distrusting contemporary times we all live in regarding the cynicism, abuse of privilege and the underestimation of the weary masses being led astray by the controlling elite of unassuming movers and shakers. The audacity of The Hunger Games odyssey was to get down and dirty about the give-and-take tendencies of a global society willing to challenge the authoritative scrutiny or kneel at its merciless ankles. Perhaps Mockingjay--Part 2 should not be perceived so deeply in its final revelation. Nevertheless, the effort in trying to do so should be acknowledged for an actioner that dared to approach such thought-provoking fodder within its bombastic boundaries. \r\n\r\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 (2015)\r\n\r\nLionsgate Films\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 17 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, Willow Shields, Sam Claflin, Elisabeth Banks, Mahershala Ali, Jena Malone, Jeffrey Wright, Paula Malcomson, Stanley Tucci, Michelle Forbes\r\n\r\nDirected by: Francis Lawrence\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction and Fantasy\/Action and Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars) \r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng 2015","id":"56523f779251417a760001d1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56523f779251417a760001d1","movie_id":131634}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A very pleasing action-comedy with the balanced sensitive contents.\r\n\r\nAnother brilliant action-comedy from Guy Ritchie. I never saw the 60s television series of the same name, but this was very convenient for his style of portraying the tough men showing off their strength. The actors were simply wonderful, two year commitment by the two lead guys for this project definitely payed off well and Alicia Vikander filled the feminine void perfectly. I think it was one of the best trio in the movies I ever seen, very powerful and I hope it lasts for a trilogy.\r\n\r\nThe story sets in the 60s during the cold war tension between the world's two superpowers. But the film's specialty was, it does not render clash between them, instead they come together to fight the rogue forces who plan blitz against them. Very humourous, highly entertaining with a swift pace and amazing action sequences.\r\n\r\nI don't think the narration had any unique twist and turn, instead I call it a smartly written screenplay. So the overall movie was so good, but not a top-notch. My disappointment came from the technical side in some of parts, especially the bike and car chase in the last quarter that you can clearly tell a fake (greenscreen\/bluescreen shot). Other than the main plot and its clever scenes, the movie did not offer distinctive features. Just taking away a \u00bd point is what places it on a line between good and average, but I definitely consider it a good.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd\/10","id":"56c090b092514170aa005c46","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56c090b092514170aa005c46","movie_id":203801}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> You a film prodigy? You know, I used to be a pretty good actor.\r\n\r\nYou can see here the desperate Shyamalan Attempt to get back to his old glory days. But in the last ten years he's not able to reach a decent success. Losing truth with big league actors and production house, so ended up doing movies with teens in his previous 3. So this one as well about two young siblings who goes to meet their grandparents from the rural. After the smooth first day the grandparents' unusual behaviour begin to scare the kids. In an attempt to find the truth, what follows is a twist in the tale.\r\n\r\nPG13 rated 'found footage' horror-thriller. But the story might be either real or fiction that never explains, because the boy in the movie wanted to do a project. Not that scary except in a couple of scenes. A better story, but the movie was okay type. The entire film revolves around four characters, but the two kids led from the front with their excellent act. It faired well at the box office, but honestly, I was slightly disappointed with everything from it.\r\n\r\nShyamalan is better than this, but he had a few chances to prove it that did not work out well as everyone expected. It's only a matter of time to give an unexpected hit and turnover in his career, that's what I'm looking for, but looks like not any time soon. I think this film was better than his recent ones that delivers within its limit, so I consider it is a one time watch film and nothing else.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"56e6f9109251417ea200135d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56e6f9109251417ea200135d","movie_id":298312}
{"author":"Oldnewbie","content":"MODEST SPOILERS\r\n\r\nAnyone as old as me will remember TV's \"Laugh In\" and comedian Flip Wilson's oft repeated line \"The devil made me do it!\" It became, like \"Sock it to me\" from the same show, a Buzz Phrase for the time.\r\n\r\n\"The Devil's Candy\" certainly fits into \"the devil made me do it\" category as far as character motivation. Here the devil makes one character kill and another paint dark disturbing pictures of which they have no memory of painting. But rather than clich\u00e9 us or bore us with the same old \"call a priest\" which we have seen a million times, the story plays out as a very human drama of one man dealing with what doctors would call a mental illness, and another dealing with an obsession that is costing him his family.\r\n\r\nYet do not think the film is without chills. Indeed it has some extremely disturbing and violent scenes! However these are done with a modicum of gore and blood so they are not gross out horrors; rather than true horrors as they let you in on what is happening just enough to worry your mind.\r\n\r\nThe film also makes a subtle statement about how we as a society fail to treat mental patients with violent pasts.\r\n\r\nActing all around is top notch.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Fighting the same witch twice in the 800 years!\r\n\r\nI have seen Vin Diesel in many avatars, from the sci-fi to action, adventure and thriller, they all suits him better, but this supernatural theme seems weird. There was lots of action, so it does not feel like a fantasy film, which is merely the idea of film concept. From the director of 'Sahara', the story of an cursed with eternal life witch hunter named Kaulder. Except the opening, the remaining film sets in the present New York city where he has to stop a witch who is trying to bring back the witch queen from the dead.\r\n\r\nIt was just another those films where the ancient meets the modern world. Okay, I agree a few films did impacted from the last two decades since the evolution of the CGI. Even though, they were not considered the greatest, in the meantime, I don't know where did this one come from. It was not based on any book, but I think just to make a few quick bucks using the star power. Other than that this film offers nothing new.\r\n\r\nYes, I liked the Diesel's presence in this, but he should not do films like this, except if the screenplay and role developed to his caliber. It was not a big box office hit, but merely survived and critically didn't. Even the film fanatics and fans of the star disappointed with it. Now I can't believe the sequel is announced, but I hope it won't take off. Anyway, it could become a decent television series rather than a film franchise.\r\n\r\nDiesel is the reason for this film to look okay and the story was maybe the hundredth time used. Come on we all know this story, but with a new cast and the settings, it looks different. So for me the film was an average, other than that, I don't think it is worth recommending to the others. If you still want to see it, then pick the digital 3D version where you can at least enjoy some special effects.\r\n\r\n5\/10","id":"57c8b10cc3a3685c00000a63","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c8b10cc3a3685c00000a63","movie_id":274854}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"These days one can find busy singer\/dancer\/actress Jennifer Lopez performing her judging duties on the small screen with the longtime singing competition \u2018American Idol\u2019. However, the still radiant and curvaceous \u2018JLo\u2019 found some time to gravitate back to the big screen and revisit the overplayed \u2018woman in peril\u2019 genre with her latest generic psychological thriller in director Rob Cohen\u2019s (\u2018The Fast And The Furious\u2019) \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019. Needlessly rehashed, rudimentary and titillating in tepidness, \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 is nothing more than a thin serving of the arbitrary \u2018damsel-in-distress\u2019 chick flicks that pop up and serve as throwaway conveyor belt melodramas. \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 will inevitably beg for obvious comparisons to ready-made Lifetime cable movies. Well, there are a decent amount of Lifetime movies that can actually give the limping \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 a run for its creative money.\r\n\r\nIn essence, Lopez is no stranger to these types of \u2018harried heroines\u2019 on the defense so she is quite comfortable in rollicking in the paper-thin premise of \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019. In forgettable 2001\u2019s \u2018Angel Eyes\u2019 and 2002\u2019s \u2018Enough\u2019 we witness Lopez\u2019s on-screen dilemma as the creepy men in her life are ominously drawn to her aura causing the heightened jeopardy at large. The case in \u2018Boy\u2019 is similar except that the delusional young man in question is as dreamy as he is deranged for the endangered cougar. Hey, he may be crazed but he is still cute, right ladies?\r\n\r\nThe reality is that we have seen this formula countless times before as \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 offers nothing fresh or feisty to the table. The teaspoon-sized tension is laughable. The run-of-the-mill steamy scenes are not even trashy enough to digest with notable suspense. Undoubtedly, \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 recklessly borrows from every psycho-thriller imaginable and still ends up looking bland and boorish. With all the loving-to-stalking fare out there past and present (ie \u2018Fatal Attraction\u2019, \u2018The Crush\u2019, \u2018Fear\u2019, \u2018Swimfan\u2019, \u2018Disclosure\u2019, \u2018Obsessed\u2019, etc.) the inclusion of \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 only clogs up the cinematic pipe in reference to this overdone genre.\r\n\r\nUnder Cohen\u2019s pedestrian direction and screenwriter Barbara Curry\u2019s spotty script \u2018Boy\u2019 tells the tale of an attractive middle-aged high school teacher named Claire Peterson (Lopez) whose bout with disillusionment will result in her tawdry affair with a neighboring handsome younger man in 19 year-old Noah Sandborn (Ryan Guzman from the \u2018Step It Up\u2019 movies). Before Claire falls into the arms of her youthful studmuffin she is riddled with conflict. For starters, her unfaithful husband Garrett (John Corbett, \u2018My Big Fat Greek Wedding\u2019) was banished from the house for his constant infidelities. Also, Claire\u2019s sickly teen son Kevin (Ian Nelson) is experiencing growing pains. At this point, Claire needs a positive boost in her existence as she trudges along both in the classroom and at home, where her personal life seems to be in utter shambles.\r\n\r\nWhen the hunkish Noah arrives on the scene to assist his ailing uncle across the street from the Petersons, he makes a lasting impression on the older Claire. Noah is helpful to Claire and becomes sort of the manly mentor that her son Kevin needs to capture his adolescent confidence. Of course, Noah\u2019s backstory is quite suspicious (such as his parents\u2019 so-called mysterious death) but the oozing charm and good company that the older teen offers the stressed Claire is too convenient to pass up. Noah is just too good to be true and Claire has found a young man worthy of entertaining both her and Kevin.\r\n\r\nThe yummy Guzman certainly is the teacher's preferred pet to Lopez's lonely educator in the generic psycho-stalker thriller THE BOY NEXT DOOR\r\nThe yummy Guzman certainly is the teacher\u2019s preferred pet to Lopez\u2019s lonely educator in the generic psycho-stalker thriller THE BOY NEXT DOOR\r\nIn the aftermath of a horrible date arranged by her close friend and school vice principal Vicky Lansing (Kristin Chenoweth), Claire lets down her guard and succumbs to her sexual urge for Noah in a hasty moment of passion. Realizing that perhaps her bedtime dalliance with Noah was a mistaken indiscretion Claire informs Noah that they can no longer go on and act upon their carnal connection. This does not sit well with Noah at all. Soon, Claire will experience the psychotic wrath of her scorned young admirer whose smothering need to be with her becomes hauntingly overwhelming. The stakes are dangerously higher when the forgiven Garrett re-enters the picture in an effort to win back Claire\u2019s broken heart.\r\n\r\nOverall, the low-budgeted \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 simply fills in the cheesy blanks with its amateurish jitters. Lopez\u2019s angst-ridden Claire has all the frightened chops of a ransom hayride during a busy livestock convention. The lackluster acting by leads Lopez and Guzman are not impish or impulsive enough to care one way or the other. Corbett\u2019s cheating hubby Garrett feels like a mere footnote in the flaccid proceedings. Chenoweth\u2019s Vicky is offered as a minor sidekick to Lopez\u2019s Claire and annoyingly buzzes around just to bridge the planted thrills.\r\n\r\nWith the baseless \u2018Boy\u2019 added to her film credits it appears that Jenny was never on the block.\r\n\r\nThe Boy Next Door (2015)  \r\n\r\nUniversal Pictures\r\n\r\n1 hr.  31 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring:  Jennifer Lopez, Ryan Guzman, Ian Nelson, John Corbett, Kristin Chenoweth, Lexi Atkins and Hill Harper\r\n\r\nDirected by: Rob Cohen\r\n\r\nRated: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Psychological thriller\/Romance and Suspense\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: * \u00bd  stars (out of four stars)","id":"5622f12c92514135b0000743","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5622f12c92514135b0000743","movie_id":241251}
{"author":"Matthew Brady","content":"\"My heart bleeds. But revenge is in the creator's hands\".\r\n\r\nThe Revenant is set in the 1820s, in the uncharted wilderness of America, Hugh Glass set out with a hunting party on an expedition. Glass was mauled by a bear and left for dead but through sheer will and to get back to his family, Glass survived - but that wasn't the only thing on his mind as he set out to payback the men who left him behind.\r\n\r\nI remember last year around January time when I saw the two images for The Revenant, with Leo holding a Kentucky Flintlock Rifle looking like he's not playing around. Those two images straight away caught my interest. I then found out it was directed by the magnificent Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu who did the Oscar wining \"Birdman\" (a movie that I personally loved). The Revenant quickly became my most anticipated movie of 2015, as I was looking forward to this movie more than Star Wars, and yes I said it. And after finally seeing the movie myself, I can safely say that I was not disappointed. The Revenant is one of the most stunning, brutal, intense, grizzly movie experience I've ever had. The movie isn't for everyone, but I loved it.\r\n\r\nAlejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu is starting to become my 3rd favorite director working today, because he's such an old school director when it comes to storytelling by the use of art. There's been a lot of drama happening behind the scenes of this movie, with the weather stopping the production or if someone made a mistake while filming, the crew must stop for the day and wait until tomorrow, because one mistake could lose a lot of day light for a scene (It was shot in natural lighting). One of the studios suggested that the movie should be shot using computer generated to make things much easier, but luckily I\u00f1\u00e1rritu said no to the idea by stating, \"If we ended up in greenscreen with coffee and everybody having a good time, everybody will be happy, but most likely the film would be a piece of shit.\" And after seeing the movie I gotta say that it was the perfect decision, because it's very rare for a director today to take that risk and avoid what the studio says. Yes there are some CGI scenes, but the way that the animated effect's blended together with the practical effect's is handled incredibly well. This is one of the best directed movies I've seen in 2015 and I know I\u00f1\u00e1rritu already won an Oscar already, but I hope he wins another one for this, because never before have I seen a revenge tale presented so unique and utterly magnificent.\r\n\r\nI respect Leonardo DiCaprio as an actor, but in this movie, he sleeps inside of a dead horse naked and eats raw food from animals, now if this doesn't get him an Oscar, nothing will. He's performance in this movie is what a call 'a silent performance', because Leo barley has that much lines in the movie and the only time he dose get to talk is in a different language (which Leo has said it was tricky to learn the language). DiCaprio has proven time and time again that he's more than a pretty face, but in this movie I only saw Hugh Glass, not DiCaprio. That's my biggest praise I have to give to Leo, as he had to deliver all the emotions, the pain and the tortured soul that Hugh Glass. All of that was all through his face and eyes and trust me when I say this, but it's not easy as you think. We are so use to seeing Leo as the angry, pretty boy billionaire in every movie he's in, but in this movie I thought he was fantastic. He played the man who lost everything. With very little lines he had, he still manages to make a powerful performance that's so far his best. I really hope Leo gets an Oscar for this.\r\n\r\nTom Hardy also gave an Oscar worthy performance in this movie. I've heard that some people had trouble understanding him in this movie (or just in everything that he's in really). Sometimes I didn't understand what he said but for the most part I did. But all that a side, I still think he was fantastic in the movie. He really added a lot to his character, because sometimes you understand the things that he dose in movie and yes the things he dose in the movie are wrong, but in a rough environment that these people are in, you would likely do the same. I'm not sure if he would get in for best supporting actor, but I hope he dose.\r\n\r\nI'm running out of things to say about Emmanuel Lubezki breathtaking cinematography. The camera work and how he makes the camera feel like a character of it's own is seriously impressive. Lubezki captures nature on film, that shows it's beauty and it's unpredictable surprises. The people running the Oscars should just give Lubezki his third Oscar right now, because he's going to take that third trophy home.\r\n\r\nFor flaws I had with the film it that some of the character logic towards the end of the movie didn't make that much senses to me. And that's it.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: \"The Revenant\" is one of most intense and stunning movies I've seen in 2015. The score is haunting, the editing was top notch and that bear attack scene was just terrifying. I mean how the hell did they do that? I don't know about you, but I honestly can't stop thinking about this movie. It's one of those movies that sticks with you after it's over and it isn't going away anytime soon.","id":"5e2f2b0d1685da0011e9cd5e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2f2b0d1685da0011e9cd5e","movie_id":281957}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> According to her guidance, this is where it should go!\r\n\r\nHer legend continues. I was talking about Maggie Smith, she's 82 years old and still her performances can compete with younger generation actors. The story was narrated from someone's perspective about the role she played, that's why it's little weakened, otherwise if she was in solo, it would have been an Oscar worthy. Incidentally, that someone was an actual writer, so the film ended up portraying her very well, beside himself.\r\n\r\nInspired by the real story of an old lady who lived in a van for the 15 years during the 70s in the London's residential driveways. This film tells the mystery behind the state of her condition and actions. Actually, I expected it to be like 'Little Miss Sunshine', a road film, but after learning it was a biopic I am impressed with the overall movie.\r\n\r\nAn heartfully enjoyable comedy-drama with a small suspense in the plot. In fact, the whole film developed pretty well because of the opening event that hidden from us to reveal at the conclusion. It was a bit of fantasy as well, especially the end was too much of it.\r\n\r\nOn the Mary Shepard character, it reminded me Mrs. Julia Wicket from the Mr. Bean's animated series. Similar kind of attitude like don't care about others, especially when everyone around her showing some kind of respect and care, she was more a sceptical for us. The film was shot in the real locations. That was an advantage for filmmaking, and for us to witness from very close to the original.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"572a017bc3a3682aa6001511","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/572a017bc3a3682aa6001511","movie_id":328589}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> SpongeBob's return to the big screen in a grand scale.\r\n\r\nIt's been a decade since the first film, definitely a long wait for the fans. That film was a hit, but I don't know why it took so long for the second. Honestly, I loved this one too, albeit I'm not a diehard fan, just a supporter. One of the beautiful cartoon universe with unique characters that can entertain all ages. The new addition, especially for this film only, the Antonio Banderas did his part wonderfully. Never seen before stunts in SpongeBob world that comes in the final battle.\r\n\r\nWhenever I review an animation movie, I usually bring 2D and 3D animation topics to denote how the technology has transformed. 'Asterix' from France, 'Doraemon' from Japan, and recently America's own 'Mister Peabody' remodelled in 3D and saw tremendous success. So why not SpongeBob, but only for a small portion they have tried and it was awesome. Most importantly the story blended well with the twist in the character reformation.\r\n\r\nThis movie is in a second batch queue for the Oscar race, that mean a slim chance to get a nominee, but I don't think it will make. That does not mean the movie is bad, it was very good, so entertaining and super funny. Simply not an Oscar material, that's all. If anyone hasn't seen it yet, I absolutely suggest to try it out. I hope it won't take another 10 years for the next movie in the series.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"562bc53c9251414006003c19","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/562bc53c9251414006003c19","movie_id":228165}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> They expected it, but never prepared for it.\r\n\r\nThis is the latest natural disaster flick from the Norway. About an inland tsunami that caused due to the landslide near the lake that based around the mountains. Kind of fresh in that perspective, because as far I remember I haven't seen a movie evolve in this theme which is only a slightly differs from water reservoir burst and flood accidental concepts.\r\n\r\nIt's definitely a good watch, something I learnt from the Norwegian side of strategy to tackle the natural disasters. But the film was about what happens when you know the dangers and for some reason fail to the take action at the time, like maybe the human error or the negligence.\r\n\r\nIt was sent to represent the nation in the 'the best foreign film' category at the 2016 Oscars, but failed to make the progress. I kind of enjoyed it, but not that impressive other than the quality performances and the visuals. I feel the story was too short, I meant not the runtime. Technically, there was no story other than the opening few minutes.\r\n\r\nIt would have been better if it had the hard hitting emotions with the catchy lines and depth in all the main characters. Because when the film ends, you probably begin to forget it already, which usually won't happen for a Hollywood flick. That's the major difference if you compare it with the American films.\r\n\r\n> \"That rock has stood for thousands of years\r\n> and will stand securely for thousands more.\"\r\n\r\nOkay, I agree Hollywood makes the best disaster movies. But other film industries as well catching up the trend, utilising the modern CGI and trying to match with them. Korea did the same with their first disaster film 'Tidal Wave' back in 2009. Remember this is Norways first step as well and somewhat excelled, especially in the technical area.\r\n\r\nFor unknown actors and the language, these films are restricted or depended on the domestic market only and this film did great by setting up a record for that year in the revenue. But films like these are rarely recognised in the international arena, other than by the critics through film festivals. What I think is they need to improve by commercialising the overall product a bit if they want the international market like once again saying what the Korean film industry did.\r\n\r\nIt opens with a simple drama that centres around a family from a small town who're facing the usual family issue. At the end of the first half, the disaster strikes, which was just around the 5 minutes. So you are going to miss those Hollywood propaganda like ships capsized or the falling skyscrapers. The usage of graphics were limited, but the later scenes were green screen shots. So I warn you to keep your expectations low.\r\n\r\nThe next half was the aftermath of the calamity where the people go look for their beloved ones. But it focused only the one family, and their involvement, which is more or less similar to 'The Impossible'. The supporting characters are the weak point in the entire narrative. One of the few things I like about this film was this one looks more natural and realistic.\r\n\r\nI won't officially declare it a must see, it was not bad either. You might like it more than me. The movie is worth a watch other than often you encounter the influence of other flicks. You can't complain for those, basically, they are like a blueprint for a theme like this. If you're able to comply with pouring cliches, you could have a good time with it, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n6.5\/10","id":"5697ab2892514154db0022b6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5697ab2892514154db0022b6","movie_id":336882}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The legend of Yuda.**\r\n\r\nIt is a prequel to the 2004 film 'Hana and Alice' from the same writer, director. So I had to watch that before coming to this one and I found both the films were pretty good. Usually to watch a sequel, you have to be familiar with the original. But for a prequel, it's not necessary as the story wise it would be the original, despite not the first to release in the series or franchise. Either way watching both the films is good for the better understanding, and chronological order is the best way to go for.\r\n\r\nThe formats are different, as well as the time gap between the two films. After all it was not a bad decision. This anime was like any other neat and cute anime you had seen. Yeah, I liked the smooth animation. The sketches were not very detailed, yet very detail in the motion presentation. If you are an anime fan, it will be a treat. I'm not saying it is the best anime ever, but surely a little gem and not be missed by the fans of the 2004 film.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether the final scene of this film and the opening of the other film are same (because of the different mood), but to me it looked like that way. This film is to reveal how Hana and Alice first met and become close friends. But it all begins with the Alice's new school's legend, the death of Yuda. Destined to meet Hana who was a classmate of Yuda, is now her neighbour. So their adventure begins to find new details about Yuda's life, but ends up with misadventures.\r\n\r\n> \u275dI won't forget that pain as long as I live.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe perfect characters, I mean two young teen girls. Also a perfect storyline, which is about finding the truth behind a mystery. But it's not thrillerised as everything about the film suggest, including the title. Very much dramatised with lots of fun filled often tense moments. The first act was good, but it was the remaining film that keeps getting better till the final scene. I liked the second half of the film, especially the quest taken by Hana and Alice was simple yet entertaining.\r\n\r\nThere are some off the track adventures, like for a brief moment an old man enters the narration, but that added an extra flavour to take us in a new direction. Soon it reinstates to its original path and that's where the ultimate friendship blooms between two title characters. It's always about a boy between them. Their friendship was tested in the other film over a boy, but here joining hands to solve the mystery surrounding a boy's death. Like the first film, the ballet had its part, though not a main draw, except being a part of one of the main characters.\r\n\r\nThe original cast from the 2004 film rendered their voices for the respective two lead roles. So except watching it in the anime version, the appeal is almost the same. As per some sources, a manga series is following after this. But I hope the story continues with the third film, either in live-action or in anime. This is an under- noticed anime, but well appreciated. I really surprised of its quality and theme. For me, it's definitely slightly ahead of the first film and this my review briefs why. So surely worth a watch and I recommend it.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59288defc3a368787003ad6e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59288defc3a368787003ad6e","movie_id":311054}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A night before the play!**\r\n\r\nIt is my personal opinion that I did not find the film any good. There's nothing new in it. Even those who haven't seen many films could name a couple of similar films. The best ones. The worst part was, in horror films, ten guys go in and only one comes out. Sometimes none. The found-footage presentation was okay for such concept. The film was short and one day event based. Most of the story was on the night in an auditorium. The initial part had fair space to kick-start the tale with a simple intro. And then the following event did not stay up to the buildup.\r\n\r\nThe basic storyline itself was very weak. The characters, and their behaviours, all easily gives out the upcoming scenes. So predictable, even the twist was ordinary. The way it ended was worse than ordinary. I felt the final scene with the cops was totally unnecessary. There's nothing wrong with the actors. Even filmmaking was acceptable. But I don't know how the production company okayed the screenplay. One of the low cost film, but earned better. Despite not received well by all the quarters. I would always encourage such small films, but I can't suggest it.\r\n\r\n_2\/10_","id":"59dbe7ed925141251f066414","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59dbe7ed925141251f066414","movie_id":299245}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**When an assassin becomes a target!**\r\n\r\nIt was not bad, but the same old stuff that we'd seen in so many other films. It was actually based on the book and directed by the 'Taken' filmmaker. An international project, takes place in three different countries, but opens and ends in Congo. It centres on an assassin who had successfully executed a high-profile job in Africa. But a few years later, after giving up those kind of work, all the sudden it comes back to haunt him when some unknown men comes looking for him. So he decides to find who's behind it and why.\r\n\r\nEven though it is a familiar theme, very much enjoyable. But the problem is the hero remains unhurt and somebody else dies for him which so clich\u00e9. The acting was good, and obviously that is Sean Penn in the lead. The action sequences were okay, but the pace of the film was the reason for me to sit on-board for over 100 minutes.\r\n\r\nSo if you are not expecting a good story and the stunts, it will do okay, particularly for the time pass. Yes, it had a chance to become a better film, but I think it wanted to replicate the book which is a couple of decades old and in the meantime pieces from it was used in the different films, hence this one looked so old. The critics did not like it, but it is much better than they say, as well as not good as some people claim.\r\n\r\n_6.5\/10_","id":"57ed8552c3a3686d010002db","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ed8552c3a3686d010002db","movie_id":266396}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Realistic account of trying to survive on Mars while awaiting rescue*** \r\n\r\nIn 2035 an astronaut (Matt Damon) gets stuck on Mars after he is presumed dead and his team departs without him. When NASA eventually finds out that he\u2019s alive & well they have to find a way to save him. But can he survive for the next couple of years until they arrive? Jeff Daniels plays the director of NASA while Jessica Chastain plays the leader of the vessel. Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor and several other notables are on hand.\r\n\r\nThe only way for Ridley Scott\u2019s \"The Martian\" (2015) to work is if it can convince you that Damon\u2019s character is actually on Mars, which it does spectacularly and realistically (minus a few forced dramatics or stabs at humor here and there). If, like me, you\u2019re fascinated by Mars or the potential of living on another planet in the real world, \u201cThe Martian\u201d is a must.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s reminiscent of movies like \u201cArmegeddon\u201d (1998), \u201cMission to Mars\u201d (2000), \u201cGravity\u201d (2013) and \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d (1968), albeit without the fantastical elements of some of these. It even brings to mind the first acts of \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d (1968) and \u201cBeneath the Planet of the Apes\u201d (1970). \r\n\r\nThe movie scores pretty well on the female front with Chastain, Mackenzie Davis, Kate Mara and Kristen Wiig.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Growing up is not the problem. Forgetting is.\r\n\r\nI usually love the French animations, because unlike American, the stories, musics, characters that influences the thousands of year cultural history. Definitely not comparable to the Hollywood standards, but it had its own technical brilliance. All I wondered was why this film was in English language.\r\n\r\nIt deserves to be on the upcoming's big occasion (2016 February), if it is eligible for the American Academy Awards. From the director of 'Kung Fu Panda' original movie, which was partially based on the children's novel. The book adaptation is the stop-motion animation and the remaining story's the regular 3D animation.\r\n\r\nJust remember the movies like 'What Dreams May Come' and 'The Lovely Bones', those magical worlds and breathtaking landscapes. Usually animations are associated with comedy genre, especially when a child character attached to it. This film was not even a comedy, more like those two titles I mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay wise it was a very 'Neverwas' type, except this one was an animation. But appropriate for people of all ages. The kids can realise the importance of their childhood and the older people can become kids again. The film compressed the gap and erected a bridge between the two hoods, the childhood and the adulthood.\r\n\r\n> \"What is essential is invisible to the eye.\"\r\n\r\nI did not know what to expect from it, but I highly satisfied with the final product. The film characters had no names, but called, the Little Girl, Mother, Fox, Rose, Snake, King et cetera as what their role is and species. Barely there are only 3-4 characters where the story was focused. Obviously it had a villain, but very unusual existence time and in a crucial part of the story.\r\n\r\nI don't remember how the 100 minutes went so fast like a ray of the light beam flashed away. The pace of narration was not a rushy, except the opening part. But once the old man character, the Aviator, voiced by Jeff Bridge was introduced, the movie turned into completely different and awesome. Yes, Jeff Bridge's voice was so good for the background narration.\r\n\r\nThis story is about an old man who refused to grow up mentally and believes the existence of the magical stars and planets. The whole neighborhood stayed away from him and his troubles, until a new girl arrives at the next door. The little girl befriends him and falls for all his stories discarding her daily routines, but later it complicates their relationship after her mother finds out what they're up to. What happens to them and how the story concludes is the remaining part.\r\n\r\n> \"She was not a common rose.\r\n> She was the only one of her kind in the whole universe.\"\r\n\r\nThis story was finely fused between the reality and fantasy. Most essential storyline for the present world. In the name of education how the children were enforced by their parents to mechanical life with less time to play out and make their own friends. Especially as they were lacking the creativity to make up their own fictional worlds with their toys like the kids from a century ago were.\r\n\r\nIt might psychologically affect their characters while becoming an adult like the Aviator in this film, but as one of lines from the movie say 'Growing up is not the problem. Forgetting is', the children are losing their innocence over the adult's reality world. Who knows, someday those kids may become the greatest writer inspired by their childhood days.\r\n\r\nIf you ask me, I strongly recommend it for all. It is very encouraging film for the parents how not to raise their children and for the grown ups how not to get lost is the adult world. Most elegant flick of the year, along with a very few others.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to ignore it because you have read the book, like I said it was not completely borrowed from the original material. Instead, two-third of the film was freshly established out of the same name masterpiece. I'm not familiar with the book, so I've no thoughts that differentiate between these two formats. But definitely the film deserved all the appreciation from critics and movie \r\n\r\n9\u00bd\/10","id":"567c344e9251417ddf003b8f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/567c344e9251417ddf003b8f","movie_id":309809}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**In an attempt to end life, discovering the life itself!**\r\n\r\nActually, this was a better film than what I have heard of it. It is like another version of 'The Constant Gardener'. About a man who never understood his wife, feels guilty while finding some answers after her depart. During his attempt to kill himself in the famous Aokigahara forest, also known as suicide forest, he meets a Japanese man who got lost and befriends. While trying to help him find his way out, they face some unexpected obstacles. Beside, the flashback stories were narrated alongside, piece by piece to reveal earlier account.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'Good Will Hunting', the film is about the survival and fighting the loss and depression. Too slow, so patience is the key to watch it. A bit long narrative, but in the end it is worth. The developments were not that interesting, though the final twist which is kind of simple and predictable makes us a little happier. Great cast, particularly McConaughey, though Naomi and Watanabe in the fine supportive roles.\r\n\r\nFor me this is a good film. I think some people, as well as the film critics got all wrong.

An important historical biopic, at least for a certain section of the audience. I respect that, but it did not impress me as I anticipated.\r\n\r\nFrom the Academy Award winning director for the movie 'The King's Speech', and the last year's winner for a lead role, Eddie Reddmayne together did not deliver the expected masterpiece. But Alicia Vikander was so good, another brilliant co-female-star display just like Felicity Jones from Eddie's previous movie 'The Theory of Everything'. If I were a jury I would definitely give the supporting actress award to her, that's the result I'm hoping for in the next Sunday.\r\n\r\nThe actor did a hard work for the title role, in the many scenes he mastered it, but that's where I slightly disappointed. I felt his character was a little intense, maybe I'm not getting him because I'm straight. The locations, costumes, even the direction and music were good. Both the lead actors kind looks alike, no doubt on the casting, but it only should have been a bit better in exhibiting story.\r\n\r\nMaybe the pace should have been a little quicker as well as some sentimentally appealing scenes would have done good. I desperate to give more marks, but I can't go beyond this. I won't consider it a bad flick, what I meant was a missed opportunity to be a masterpiece. So overall,  it is a good watch.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"56cde74892514152ad00005c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56cde74892514152ad00005c","movie_id":306819}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"There was a time when the movie gods were treating audiences to the omnipresence of zombies. One could not swing a dead cat without running into zombie-related cinema. It was all the rage at the box office that was experiencing a certain celluloid renaissance with overloading narratives within the \u201czombie zone\u201d. Sure, zombies are still the norm in pop cultural media on both the big and small screen (anybody not heard of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d?). However, another iconic horror-induced symbol\u2013the witch\u2013is making its way back into prominence in the cinema circles. Unfortunately, the \u201ctwitch of the witch\u201d is explored in an over-the-top, messy and misplaced CGI-coated production of the outlandish The Last Witch Hunter.\r\n\r\nSo there are a number of reasons why the whimsical wasteland The Last Witch Hunter might be considered high-tech jumbled junk. Nevertheless, the consensus is that sometimes high-tech jumbled junk is one enthusiast\u2019s treasured and enjoyable guilty pleasure worth its mindlessness in gold. Well, The Last Witch Hunter certainly will attract its share of followers as a gaudy and grainy fantasy adventure both big in scope and surreal absurdity. Still, this mythical monstrosity feels annoyingly strained and tries too hard to sell its outrageous, synthetic spryness.\r\n\r\nThe Last Witch Hunter is about larger-than-life throwaway silly thrills and cherishes its berserk-style entertainment with unapologetic relish. There is nothing inherently wrong with upping the ante in boisterous bounciness but Hunter is unfocused and all over the map while never committing fully to being a distinctive, impish-minded vehicle. Instead, Hunter is incoherent and erratically ridiculous as it shamefully incorporates bits and pieces from other better-made schlocky showcases.\r\n\r\nThe casting of the monotone and muscle-toned Vin Diesel seems inspired and logical for something as clumsily radical as The Last Witch Hunter. Diesel, the movie action star that made his notable mark in money-making film franchises that include The Fast and the Furious and Riddick entries, sinks his teeth into another so-called explosive characterization in Hunter\u2019s 800-year old immortal witch hunter Kaulder. Of course Kaulder is a tortured soul and has made it his mission in hunting down naughty witches throughout his eternal existence. Kaulder needs to eradicate these magical misfits in his bid to deal with the tragic curse that has dominated his tattered psyche.\r\n\r\nKaulder may have an affinity for seeking and wreaking havoc on the notorious witches that threaten to corrupt the surroundings but he is partial to one witch in particular\u2013the youngish Chloe (Rose Leslie from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d) whose assistance is invaluable to the brooding Kaulder. Also, Kaulder is joined by diminutive cleric sidekick Dolan 37 (Elijah Wood) as well in the quest to hunt down these wily witches.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious vibes pertaining to Kaulder is somewhat realized. For instance, we know that Kaulder works steadily for the organization known as Axe and Cross. Plus, we are introduced to Kaulder\u2019s only close buddy Dolan 36 (Oscar-winning Michael Caine) and are given a vague backstory about Kaulder\u2019s troubled past and histrionics. The no-nonsense Kaulder\u2019s passion for witch hunting is the only straight-forward sign that we definitely have no doubt about one way or the other.\r\n\r\n\"Witch\" way to go? Who knows but only one witch hunter can answer that in Vin Diesel's Kaulder from the flaccid fantasy THE LAST WITCH HUNTER\r\n\u201cWitch\u201d way to go? Who knows but only one witch hunter can answer that in Vin Diesel\u2019s Kaulder from the flaccid fantasy THE LAST WITCH HUNTER\r\nIn addition to highlighting Kaulder and company\u2019s expectations to wipe away the \u201cbroomstick broads\u201d, the plot starts to thicken as concerns are brewing involving the resurrection of the menacing creature in the Witch Queen (Julie Englebrecht). Naturally, the Witch Queen presents an immediate danger to the cautious Kaulder because of their nostalgic convoluted conflicts previously. Can the crazy-minded coven that looks to promote the Witch Queen succeed and overcome the slaying methods of Kaulder and his crew of crusaders?\r\n\r\nNotoriously clich\u00e9d and cockeyed, The Last Witch Hunter is a corrosive concept meshed together with all the creative comparison of a tangled ball of yarn. Similarly, director Breck Eisner\u2019s toothless witch fantasy adventure Hunter echoes the same kind of forgettable computer-generated gibberish that was evident in this year\u2019s bombastic medieval miscue The Seventh Son featuring the Academy Award-winning Jeff Bridges front and center in another numbing sword-swinging, supernatural sideshow of sorts. The overall film project, plagued with Eisner\u2019s scattershot direction and a tepid script by a trio of screenwriters in Cory Goodman, Burk Sharpless and Matt Sazama (responsible for the disastrous Priest and Dracula Untold), screams of a flavorless stew\u2013many ingredients are mixed in but a natural taste for the concoction never comes into fruition. Relentlessly murky and misguided, The Last Witch Hunter fails to trigger anything remotely intriguing beyond the furious flourishes of shocking, cartoonish imagery.  \r\n\r\nThe premise can be regarded as feeling woefully forced and choppy. The dank cinematography is indistinguishable and the visual special effects are an ambivalent hit-and-miss result depending on what frame of the movie\u2019s indescribable spectacle that grabs your undivided attention at the moment. The storyline is hardly gripping or contemplative even from a campy standpoint. The Last Witch Hunter is frivolously flaccid and never manages to capture any of its dizzy-oriented imagination no matter how wildly off-kilter it tries to achieve in its aimless execution.\r\n\r\nDiesel fans may buy his high-wire act in Hunter and go with the flow but the actor does not deviate away from the familiar characters he has revisited countless times over in his better known on-screen outings. For years Diesel has reveled in preposterous volt-making vehicles for the most part has captured the curiosity of his targeted demographics in both excitable fanboys and hormonal female followers alike. The question remains: can they show some solid consideration in having the balding bad boy of action-packed capers toil among the foolish inclusion of wayward witches and sorcerers in an exposition that looks as if it was conceived with a Middle Ages crayon? The supporting players in Hunter are as arbitrarily acknowledged as the saturated and over-indulgent whims of this far-fetched fable that seems uniquely colorless despite its chaotic grand package of black magic banality.\r\n\r\nSomehow labeling Diesel\u2019s Kaulder as the \u201clast witch hunter\u201d feels deceptive because if the Hollywood sequel machine has its way their version of \u201clast\u201d will undoubtedly be continuous into the next eye-rolling chapter. The real sinful hex at large that some unsuspecting moviegoers will ultimately suffer is succumbing to the laughable supernatural spell that The Last Witch Hunter will cast in insufferable, confusing fashion.\r\n\r\nThe Last Witch Hunter (2015)\r\n\r\nSummit Entertainment\r\n\r\n1 hr. 46 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Vin Diesel, Elijah Wood, Rose Leslie, Michael Caine, Julie Engelbrecht, Olarfur Darri Olafsson, Rena Owen\r\n\r\nDirected by: Breck Eisner\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror and Fantasy\/Supernatural\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: * 1\/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng (2015)","id":"562c283fc3a3681b610063af","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/562c283fc3a3681b610063af","movie_id":274854}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A family with the dark secret.**\r\n\r\nIt's right to say based on the real than a biopic, because it is not the film about the family who we inspire from their act. This is a crime-thriller-drama sets in the early 80s, Argentina, when democracy was restored in the nation. Focused on to tell a story of a middle class family called Puccios. It's a big family, but what they did were inhumane thing. Kidnapping people for ransom money, but in the end, there's no smooth trade off. How long they go for it and how it all ends comes in the latter parts.\r\n\r\nIt was the Argentina's entry to the last year's Oscars. That's really a worst decision ever. Also it the highest grossed film in the domestic circuit. No doubt the film was well made, especially the director who also managed well with the screenplay. This film can be watched to know the truth and nothing else, because of the negative message it carries. Nearly 100 minutes long, full of dark atmosphere, but among it there was a little romance. The actors did good, despite they were in the negative roles.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of films with the dark tone, which are very enjoyable despite the film characters involved in the wrongful acts. Sometimes we root for them, it might be a robbery or a revenge theme. But there comes a time when I hesitate to encourage such films, mainly because of its serious portrayal. Makes me to think only sick people would enjoy such films. It happened recently for a Chilean film 'The Club' that I felt disgust.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the filmmaking, but I feel this better should have been a documentary film. Anyway, that's my view. It was one side narration, covered everything from the family angle. But if it was told how the cops or the victim families coped would have made totally a different film. Then I might have liked it. So overall this film was okay, I'm not in its favor though.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"5851b806c3a3682fb801f078","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5851b806c3a3682fb801f078","movie_id":352161}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**There's a limit for everything, and after that, the same people look differently.**\r\n\r\nThis is an unexpected biographical drama. I don't know who are those two guys, I mean not the actors, but the real life characters. I never read their books or heard their names, though the film sounded great, so I decided to watch it. The entire film was an interview between a newly famed writer and a journalist who dreaming to become like him one day. So basically the young journalist desperately makes himself an opportunity to meet the writer and they take a road trip, discussing various topics.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to say who was best, both Jesse Eisenberg and Jason Segel were excellent. I think it was the best casting, they will be the reason if you want to watch it, not the story. Yep, the story was simple, just talking life, present and future of humankind, other celebrities and finally differences between them. That's the part I loved. I mean famed people or genius, whoever they're, they are just like us when it comes to interacting with others. They argue too, it's not like the worst thing to happen, but a normal thing as a human being. Just like animals locking their horns over land or females and sometimes for a no reason.\r\n\r\nIt was directed by 'The Spectacular Now' filmmaker, based on the bestselling memoir by David Lipsky, the character that played by Jesse Eisenberg. It takes place in the late 90s, but present in the film as a recall after a certain event. If you like 'Before Sunrise' kind of films, you will enjoy it, but if you hate slow pace narration, then you should better skip than giving a bad review and rating badly to wreck it up.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58013aba925141301b000b2e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58013aba925141301b000b2e","movie_id":249688}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"A grand time of things at the grandparents place?\r\n\r\nThe Visit is written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan.

Veering away from big budgets and adopting a low-fi approach, this very much has him back in the spooky zone. \r\n\r\nIt's all very nutty of course, the premise and the (very good) reveal are hardly genre defining, but the unease is palpable, the mystery element strong and there's a bunch of genuinely freaky scenes. The last third is almost delirious as the story goes through its bad dream fairy tale throes, and the small cast are excellent, with Syamalan once again showing how good he works with young actors. \r\n\r\nA good honest chiller that isn't purporting to be anything other than that. 7\/10","id":"588391b2925141045700afea","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/588391b2925141045700afea","movie_id":298312}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Hunt for a witch hunter.\r\n\r\nA Swedish young-adult urban-fantasy-drama based on the first book of the 'Engelsfors' trilogy. If you are a Hollywood films follower, then you would find it a very familiar theme. Except it was not a loud and grand narration produced with the money grabbing agenda. But yes, earning back for what they have spent on it is a very important for any film and sadly it failed on that. Because of too much of dramatisation for a teen film. I liked it because the drama was not a big deal to me. A very refreshing film and nothing like too childish, so even the grown ups can give it a try and have a good time.\r\n\r\nEngelfors is a small fictional town in the Sweden and the story revolves around six teenage girls who are the chosen ones by the secret witch society to save the world. All the girls are entirely different and does not like each others. So joining the hands to counter the evil force that's posing a threat for their kind becomes hopeless. Until they understand their full capability and discover who's behind all the strange events. That brings the ultimate battle which is what everyone of us is waiting for, that decides the fate of those girls and to end the first installment.\r\n\r\nIt was a slow presentation, that's where the problem lies to find the audience for it. Because youngsters won't like the films that lacks its pace, though it was based on them. It was not a visual extravaganza as we have seen in the American counterpart films. Yet the story was very ordinary with the characters close to the actual world except their supernatural abilities. So saving the world means not anything close to 'The Avengers' films, everything here is on a small scale, but properly arranged.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the sequel was based on the result of this film. It got a mixed response, in that, mine is positive. The film came out from all the obstacles while it was in production, so by seeing it all I don't think they're going to make another film in the series. Surely I want it because I enjoyed it which I consider a very rare type, especially in this theme, unlike where the world cinema is obsessed with graphics and fancy stunt sequences for a similar concept.\r\n\r\n> \"You were born selected.\r\n> The Magic has always been within you.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a very long film which is definitely a drawback for a todays film. Had all the opportunities to go deep into every character to expose their qualities and they did that, yet feels like they should have done more for this kind of runtime. Because in many parts it was a limping development.\r\n\r\nFrom all the above it does not look like a film to watch on the big screen. Maybe a television series would have been a fine idea, but still I'm happy for this because I always choose films over the television series. Mainly for the sound mixing, which are usually have the multiple track digital surrounds where in television, they're just stereo. But for this film, they were just okay as I said earlier, it wasn't a grand film.\r\n\r\nI have seen many Swedish films, but not enough to recognise the actors from the local market. I think all the main cast in this was mostly the fresh faces and they have done greatly. An awesome production and wonderful music tracks.\r\n\r\nI don't know how it is compared to the source material, but the mysteries behind the deaths were well illustrated. The twist did not surprise me, but surely unpredictable. There are many unexplained theories lies open that is going to be clarified in its follow-ups. But now I have to wait for it which I'm confident that's not going to happen, not anytime soon.\r\n\r\nI can't go for the book, because I'm not a reader. So it seems my journey ends here for the 'Engelsfors' trilogy. Better I'll pray for the Japanese or the American version to come. In my opinion, this film was underrated, because people are addicted to the commercial elements which seriously lacks in it. Other than that it deserves respectable status among other films associated with the magic. I'll definitely suggest it, but I don't know how many of you will feel the way as I did. Anyway, I still say go for it.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"5752fbac925141061f0000e4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5752fbac925141061f0000e4","movie_id":272634}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> The life of an arrogant and mean farmer Olympic medal winner.\r\n\r\nSurprised to see how the film was received. I mean it was not based on the real or something, the film was not bad either. A decent story and performances, but partially an inspiring theme. You know, of course, in the sports its about winning the medals, only till certain stage, then the time comes to end our journey for various reasons. But still there are other ways to use our gifts like on coaching and encouraging the young talents. That's what this film is about, and I enjoyed watching it.\r\n\r\nThe highlight was it looks some kind of a biographical film, but as I said it's not. I think the screenplay was well written, but pretty predictable story, especially the romance parts were outdated. The sport section was quite refreshing. The jokes were the okay type. The sex scene was awesome. It might be a little overdone, but well composed gymnastic poses. I liked the father-daughter sentiment. It was not emotional with great dialogues, but still a father fighting for his daughter to stand on her own feet was really good to see.\r\n\r\nIt is a chick flick, so both the lead girls were excellent. Pretty much impressive gymnastic stunts. Obviously the stunt double used for some of those parts. Had a good runtime and shot in wonderful places. A small budget film that shot within a month of time, but a great production quality. Entertaining film, but disappointment is it did not do well as expected at the box office. It is not a greatest sports film of all time, but I think there's no harm watching it once, you will realise that after giving it a try.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"57a374429251410a5f002f0b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57a374429251410a5f002f0b","movie_id":308453}
{"author":"Brett Hardin","content":"The Hateful Eight is an epic film. Epic the way Ben-Hur was epic. It\u2019s filmed on rare Ultra Panavision 70. The film crew altered Modern cameras to work with UP70. Quentin Tarantino knew there were two types of film viewers. Those who would see his film as he intended and those who would not. Tarantino isn\u2019t an idiot and knows people will pirate his and watch it on devices he can\u2019t control [Note 1]. To combat this Tarantino made a version of the film which requires viewing in a theatre. He did this with the 70mm roadshow production of The Hateful Eight.\r\n\r\nThe roadshow production of The Hateful Eight is a great experience. I was born in 1981, after roadshow theatrical releases fell out of popularity so I\u2019ve never experience a roadshow theatrical release. Roadshow theatrical releases were (or are) a limited engagement showing of a movie before general release. The Hateful Eight\u2019s roadshow includes a beautifully produced souvenir program\u200a\u2014\u200aalready available on Ebay. The lights go out fifteen minutes prior to the film starting and no previews are shown. Roadshows aren\u2019t their to advertise. Their purpose is to wow you with The Hateful Eight in 70mm.\r\n\r\nI was only eleven when Reservoir Dogs was released and thirteen when Pulp Fiction was released. Arguably, a little too young to watch these films. Although I knew what sex was and how it worked, My young mind didn\u2019t know about paraphilia or unusual sexual interests. I don\u2019t think I even had a working idea of how homosexual sex worked. This would have made watching scenes from Pulp Fiction rather difficult for me at that age. [Note 2]\r\nUnlike many, I saw Reservoir Dogs before Pulp Fiction. Although I like the editing style of Pulp Fiction, I think Reservoir Dogs is a better film. What makes Reservoir Dogs great is the lack of financing. Financial constraints didn\u2019t limit Tarantino and Reservoir Dogs is dialogue heavy with very impactful scenes revolving around a single location: The Warehouse.\r\n\r\nThe high-level idea of The Hateful Eight, Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Eighth film, which implies the title is deliberate, is about a bounty hunter escorting a prisoner (the only female in the film) to \u201chang by the neck until they are dead\u201d in Red Rock. However, a blizzard prevents the prisoner from reaching the final location and the prisoner along with eight others are stuck in a single room: Minnie\u2019s Haberdashery.\r\n\r\nThe Hateful Eight is filmmaking at it\u2019s finest. Like Reservoir Dogs it could have been a theatrical production. It didn\u2019t have to be a movie. If there are special effects they aren\u2019t noticeable. There is violence and blood, which you expect, but comparing to other Quentin Tarantino\u2019s films it\u2019s tame. There is no dancing to a radio tune while Michael Madsen conducts a horrific act. But, the strongest story-telling scene will stick with you. A flashback overlaid with a monologue performed by Samuel L. Jackson that demonstrates the artistic ability of Tarantino. The editing between Major Warren\u2019s narrative and what General Smithers envisions can only be told with film. The scene contrasts the alluring story with the distasteful act. A compliment to the editor who doesn\u2019t pull you out of the monologue, but enhances it.\r\nI\u2019ve only seen, read, or heard a few interviews with Tarantino, but I don\u2019t get the impression he does anything on accident. Tarantino puts too much thought into his ideas and works. When Bret Easton Ellis interviewed Tarantino he stated:\r\n\r\n> My scripts are meant to be read.\r\n> [The Bride] has stashed all this shit in the ground. So, she is going to dig a hole and pull up a footlocker and it will have passports, money, and weapons. All the things she will need for her revenge. But, the way I have it written in the script is she needs to find a rock and turn it over to find an \u2018X\u2019 on the rock. She turns over the rock and finds the \u2018X\u2019.\r\n> \r\n> If the \u2018X\u2019 hadn\u2019t have been there or if she couldn\u2019t have found rock, she would have taken it as a sign that her revenge never should happen and she would have dropped the whole idea.\r\n\r\nThese are things you can\u2019t show on film.\r\n\r\nYou get this same type of feeling when watching The Hateful Eight. It is hard to imagine that Tarantino didn\u2019t have a few one-on-one days with each actor explaining to their character\u2019s fully-developed backstory which isn\u2019t depicted in the film. Only additional viewings will explain each characters motives.\r\n\r\nMany of my college friends who enjoyed Kill Bill Volume One didn\u2019t like Kill Bill Volume Two even though Kill Bill Volume Two is the stronger of the two films. The reason? The dialogue. The dialogue is the best part of The Hateful Eight. Although The Hateful Eight is three hours long you don\u2019t feel it. The film engrosses you with the characters, their conversations, and the conflict between them. The acting is superb.\r\n\r\nMy wife said that this is her favorite Quentin Tarantino film. I don\u2019t know if I disagree and although Reservoir Dogs holds a special place with me, The Hateful Eight is a much more mature film. Tarantino has had 23 years to perfect his craft and it shows. Although I liked Django Unchained, it isn\u2019t as good as The Hateful Eight.\r\n\r\nThe Hateful Eight may be one of the better films I\u2019ve seen in the past few years.\r\n\r\n_Note 1: Mark Z. Danielewski\u2019s House of Leaves is a piece of art as much as a novel. But, there isn\u2019t a digital version. This is deliberate. Danielewski can\u2019t determine a way for readers to digitally consume the book. Contrary to what you expect, this control is more easily achieved with print than film._\r\n\r\n_Note 2: Like all Quentin Tarantino\u2019s movies, The Hateful Eight isn\u2019t for children. Quentin Tarantino is great because of his dedication to his art. Tarantino made a purposeful choice to not have a relationship or children because it would affect his art. I wonder if his decision is partially due to discussions around the dinner table about what Daddy does without showing them. I don\u2019t know if Tarantino has actually thought about the ramifications of raising a child in the dark to his art until a certain age. Maybe he hasn\u2019t. But, If I was in his shoes, I would have internal conflict about not wanting to twist my kid\u2019s minds until they were of age to deal with my creations. But, I am probably projecting._","id":"568847f09251414ecb015a7e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/568847f09251414ecb015a7e","movie_id":273248}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Right in its opening scene, Thilagar stakes its claim to be in the firmament of blood-soaked movies set in south Tamil Nadu. Four teenager, who have been arrested for murder, decide to kill the eight-year-old boy who will come to identify them in an identification parade the next morning. Even though there is no violence in this scene, it manages to be chilling, just by showing us the manner in which these boys behave at the juvenile home and how casually they talk about murdering someone. \r\n\r\nThen, we get the flashback where we learn how the just Bosepandi is admired by his villagers and how this fuels the flames of hatred in the heart of Ukkirapandi, an aging big shot in the region. Bosepandi understands that the violent ways of his clan have to stop and so wants his brothers to get education. Chelladurai becomes a cop while Thilagar joins an engineering college. However, situations force Bosepandi to take on Ukkirapandi, which angers the old man so much that he uses his sons to murder his rival. And this forces the docile Thilagar (he is termed as a person who will move aside even if a butterfly comes in his path) into killing the sons and Ukkirapandi bides his time to get his revenge. \r\n\r\nThilagar is intended as a call for non-violence but unfortunately, the message is likely to get lost in the bloodshed on screen. The director Perumal Pillai tells this tale confidently and the film is fairly engaging but also hardly surprising. If you have seen films in this genre, you will be familiar with the beats of the film. The statesman leader, his dutiful family member, the seething villain, the rituals of the land (here, we get a baby shower, a temple festival and a death ceremony), bittersweet romance, Ilaiyaraaja song (this time, it is Nethu Oruthara Oruthara Parthom), and lots of sickles. \r\n\r\nIf Thilagar taking over Bosepandi's mantle after his death recalls Thevar Magan, the tit-for-tat murders and the egoistic Ukkirapandi and game of one-upmanship reminds you of Virumaandi and the character of Kothala Thevar in that film. And the brawl in the cinema theatre (interestingly, it is not a Rajini or Kamal film, but Karthik's Amaran, indicating the fan following the star has in this region) brings to mind Subramaniapuram. \r\n\r\nThe film is at its best when Kishore is around. The actor turns in a commanding performance and we can understand his plight of being caught in a Catch-22 situation. All he wants us progress but Ukkirapandi will always stand in his way. But the real tragedy is that no one around him seems to understand him and fall into the cesspool of violence.","id":"551061bf92514166db0034c9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/551061bf92514166db0034c9","movie_id":302291}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Didn't lose in translation, almost surpassed the original.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the title is practically the same as the original French movie 'Nuit Blanche'. And frame to frame it was almost similar, except a few minor changes in the characters. It is a great remake, especially keeping in mind the Indian audience and the Indian style of story narration. I have seen within India, the movies got remade into other languages which is quite a fashion for quick money making, but recently the International remakes were soaring with the excellent results. That's mean Indian film industries growing rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe performances were good, but Trisha Krishnan was a surprise that I never saw her before in an action-lady role. The story was simple, a narcotic cop struggles to rescue his son from a drug-lord's captive. Everything happens in just one night in a nightclub building. It is not just a rescue mission, but the fate of many that decided when the daylight breakout. The stunts were much better than the usual Indian standards. It is a 2 hour movie which is a short for an Indian film, especially for not having songs and dances that saved around 15-20 minutes.\r\n\r\nI did not get bored of watching the same story for the second time in another language. There's a Hollywood remake is coming, and have to do it again. You can wait for the Jamie Foxx's performance or can try the original if you think you can't wait, but I also suggest this version which is not a bad either. This movie was well received by Indians than the French movie by French audience.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"570fc3bac3a3685373003272","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/570fc3bac3a3685373003272","movie_id":363178}
{"author":"talisencrw","content":"Being a) the shortest boy in my class in my early years; b) the smartest; and c) adopted by parents of mixed ethnicity (which was a rarity in my small city at that time, the mid 70's), I was a natural target for bullies. At every conceivable instance (and a lot of inconceivable ones as well!), I fought all comers, often coming home black-and-blue, and exhausted--I may have lost some matches to bigger and older boys, but if they were going to win, they were at least going to pay for it, and feel the after-effects for a while. (Thankfully this ended when I was talking with my friend, who was carrying home his personal baseball equipment, when I was approached. I asked if I could borrow his bat for a second, and that ended that. I wouldn't recommend that as a solution to others, for legal reasons. Thankfully the bully's mom and mine were friends, and when he ran home crying and told her what happened, she replied, 'If Billy did that to you, then you deserved it.')\r\n\r\nI don't often do so, but I watched the DVD extras before I watched the film (I usually wait until afterwards). Edgerton's impressive directorial debut here, as well as script, fulfilled (at least to my eyes) his purpose, that of making a psychological thriller along the level of his directing idols, Sir Alfred Hitchcock and David Fincher. The three main stars, Edgerton, Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall (I kept thinking she was Anne Hathaway!), did very good work here. I never really went for Bateman's work when he was younger, but a good friend often watched 'Arrested Development' when I was over, a few years back, and I have grown to like his acting, but he really hits it out of the park here. Had this not been an independent production but a more big-budget affair (i.e., David Fincher), I think he could have gotten an Oscar nomination--he's THAT good here.\r\n\r\nThere was the occasional logical issue I had with the film afterwards, when I stopped and REALLY thought hard about it, but I have no problem with that kind of thing, if I enjoy everything else (which I did). Highly recommended. Definitely worth buying and rewatching--and I can't say that about most films made today. I hope that Edgerton doesn't give up acting, because he's definitely good at it, but I hope he also keeps on writing scripts and directing. Simply based on 'The Gift', he has an admirer in me for life.","id":"5730e6709251413fb5000551","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5730e6709251413fb5000551","movie_id":328425}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Well, that was rather disappointing unfortunately. Not that I can say that I am very surprised though. The first installment in the series started off being \"okayish\" and the rest of them slid downwards towards mediocrity.  This, the final installment, is a notch below mediocre as far as I am concerned. I really cannot understand all the hype about these movies. None of them really shines even if you try to look at them as young adult movies which they really are.\r\n\r\nThis one was downright boring. There were numerous scenes where Katniss or some other character was just dreaming away or sitting around brooding. It took quite a while for anything to start happening in the movie.\r\n\r\nWhen something started happening it was the same mess of political, unbelievably stupid, propaganda, messy and unintelligent fight scenes, Katniss walking around looking, I do not really known, disconcerted, sad, disturbed, whatever.\r\n\r\nHow the chief villains (yes plural) was one could figure out without too much effort. The moment the flyer came into the picture and started to fly over the refuges and the children not only I but all of my kids as well guessed who had sent it.\r\n\r\nThere is really only two things that I liked about this movie. One is that Donald Sutherland was really good. The other is the ending which, although being 100% predictable, was quite satisfying. Well, that scene (everyone having seen the movie knows which scene I am referring to) is where I consider the movie to have ended.

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"The high-powered and hyper-kinetic \u2018The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 is a pulsating production that one would expect from the off-kilter imagination of writer-director Guy Ritchie whose flashy and furious actioners such as \u2018Snatch\u2019 and \u2018Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels\u2019 are indicative of the filmmaker\u2019s excess frivolity. So it is not much of a shock that Ritchie\u2019s big screen adaptation of the iconic 60s television series that featured the retro-suave Robert Vaughn and golden-haired heart-breaker David McCallum takes on a sleek, stylish and impishly erratic mix of intrigue and frolic.\r\n\r\nThe consensus is that \u2018The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 continues the wave of nifty and naughty-minded colourful espionage spectacles that seem to have invaded the summer of 2015. Perhaps when one cries \u2018U.N.C.L.E.\u2019  it will not be as challenging or convincingly crafty as the more cerebral and stimulating \u2018Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation\u2019. Still, Ritchie\u2019s off-beat serving of \u2018The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 is mindless fun and roguishly cheeky.\r\n\r\nSure, at times the boisterous bounce in \u2018U.N.C.L.E\/\u2019 feels rather strained as Ritchie\u2019s foray into the James Bond-esque territory featuring the off-balance smoothness of twitchy twosome  Brit Henry Cavill (the \u2018Man of Steel\u2019 star portraying American CIA Agent Napoleon Solo) and Armie Hammer (incidentally sporting a catchy and clever moniker) as Russian KGB Agent Illya Kuryakin spirals into a cliched cavalcade of mischievousness drowned out by surging surf music, crazy-minded and bright-coloured landscapes, perfect-looking protagonists and wildly penetrating predicaments in its manufactured action sequences. Nevertheless, \u2018The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 still generates a sense of rousing charm and insane impishness to carry out its agenda for off-the-cuff espionage escapist frolicking.\r\n\r\nSome may not mind the make-up of \u2018U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 as a saucy buddy action flick in disguise as Cavill and Hammer drolly inhabit the kooky coolness of TV\u2019s dynamic duo spies from yesteryear. Nobody will ever claim that Cavill and Hammer are trying to ape the small screen spying antics of original U.N.C.L.E. bad boys in the aforementioned Vaughn and McCallum any time soon. The exaggerated juiced-up chase scenes, the inclusion of high-volume spunk and wit, devious femme fatales that parade around as hormonal trophies\u2026all add to the high-wire hedonism of Ritchie\u2019s off-centered international gun-toting caper.\r\n\r\nRitchie\u2019s co-written screenplay, along with Lionel Wigham of \u2018Sherlock Holmes\u2019 fame with \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 producer credits, does not provide much of a deep-seeded story other than its need to indulge the audience in its shifty shenanigans as an over-the-top ode to a classic couple of televised operatives that baby-boomers will fondly recall from their childhood reminiscences. The premise is somewhat painfully familiar as two clashing spy guys with different approaches to the espionage game join at the hip to stop a madman planning to engineer nuclear destruction for a vulnerable world. Of course, in attempting to stop such unthinkable madness we are overcome with the philosophical tactics and mannerisms of the targeted tandem looking to spread some spice along the way in saving the world from certain cartoonish devastation.\r\n\r\nSolo is the capable cad whose free-spirit and ease on handling a sticky situation is met with instinctive, cavalier American ingenuity. Kuryakin, on the other hand, seems to be disciplined in his uptight \u2018play-it-by-the-book\u2019 demeanor as the cold Russian enforcer without a sense of straying from his boundaries. Together, this debonair \u2018ying-and-yang\u2019 pair of free-wheeling agents form as one in their mission to foil the demented deed of others. Isn\u2019t that special?\r\n\r\nIn essence, \u2018The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 believes in its wheeling-and-dealing hype and that is not necessarily a bad thing. It does not pretend to be anything other than what it is at large, a spry, jet-setting caper where playful doom and gloom is played out against a backdrop of elegant locales not to mention a spruced-up soundtrack to accompany the animated proceedings. As usual Ritchie punctuates his theatrical releases with loose-minded lunacy happening at a fast pace. The outlandishness of \u2018U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 is truly true to form in the tradition of the funky and frenetic fables that Ritchie loves to spin at will.\r\n\r\nBoth Cavill and Hammer seem to get inspiration out of their dressy roles as the inventive spies with a knack for carousing and chaos. The wily women that are at the center of attention for Solo\u2019s\/Kuryakin\u2019s romancing interests in Elizabeth Debicki\u2019s vivacious Victoria and Alicia Vikander\u2019s toxic Gaby is refreshingly stimulating and reinforces the suspenseful jolt. As the commanding Waverly that oversees Solo and Kuryakin, Hugh Grant does not hold a candle to the late great character actor Leo G. Carroll, that was so memorable as the head honcho that pushed the buttons in the background for both Solo\u2019s \u2018The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 and later April Dancer\u2019s (Stephanie Powers) \u2018The Girl From U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 \r\n\r\nSo here is to the jousting \u2018U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 enjoying its considerable A.U.N.T (\u2018A Unique Nifty Time\u2019) at the busy summertime box office.\r\n\r\nThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Arlo and Spot's adventure to the Clawtooth Mountain.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I have been looking forward this since the day I came to know about it. But it took so long to come out, even the Windows OS has upgraded thrice since then. After all these years, now I feel this is not what I wanted. It should have been different, especially the story. It was a fine animation, including all the technical aspect had no issues, but the story was not convincing.\r\n\r\nSeemed just like another version of 'The Croods'. In fact, crossover between these two would be awesome like the boy from this and the family from other title as an original family who lost each other for some reason. But the trouble is, both are from the different production house and coming together is a tough task.\r\n\r\nThe civilised dinosaurs? That's kind of weird, but in a children's story and animation, all are fair. So I turned into one and enjoyed it. Apatosaurus are farmers, T-Rex are cowboys, yeah whole new perspective, apart from the humans who are still in lower on the chart of dominance and intelligent.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I'm being honest with what I felt. The theme about self discovery and to throw away fear is inspiring for the little children. At a same time, it is not a freshly developed story, kind of reminds 'The Lion King'. I know they're not same, but the initial parts are, between father and son.

{"author":"clyde e collins","content":"**The initial tableaux:** \r\n\r\n**Initial, part I**: We're in the black plague era in Europe, say 13th century.  The spread of the plague is attributed to the spellcasting of evil witches.  Vin Diesel's character, Kaulder, is one of the witch hunters who finds the Witch Queen.  Kaulder and company put an end to the plague, but at the cost of Kaulder's wife, his only child, and most of his hunter friends.  While dying, the Witch Queen curses Kaulder.\r\n\r\n**Initial, part II**:  In current New York City, Kaulder is still hunting witches.  Yes, the same Kaulder. He's allied with an old group within the church, the Axe and Cross, which tries and imprisons witches.  They also keep secrets.  Kaulder's main contact with Axe and Cross is Dolan the 36th, played by Michael Caine, in one of those short roles that he does so well.  Dolan is quite old, and Dolan the 37th seems ready to take over being contact with the immortal Kaulder.\r\n\r\n**Delineation of conflicts:**\r\nIn the present, witch activity seems to be picking up.  Something large is brewing.  Kaulder suffers a number of reverses, and his list of allies shrinks.\r\n\r\nThe film began in apocalyptic mode, and near the end it is almost there again.  Kaulder must face what he did not face the first time, 800 years ago.\r\n\r\n**Resolution:** Will Kaulder find new allies, or must he carry the day himself?\r\n\r\n**One line summary:** Attempt at another Vin Diesel movie franchise.\r\n\r\n**_Statistics:_** \r\n\r\n**Cinematography:** 8\/10 Well done on the whole; the visuals kept my attention.\r\n\r\n**Sound:** 8\/10 Dialog is clear.  Music seemed appropriate.\r\n\r\n**Acting:** 5\/10 Michael Caine was fine in his short role as noted above.  Vin Diesel is convincing as an action hero, even here with swords, magic, fists, and intention instead of cars, guns, and explosives. Julie Engelbrecht had her fine moments as Kaulder's arch nemesis, the Witch Queen, at the very beginning, and at the very end. Olafur Darri Olafsson was a blast as Belial, an in-your-face opponent for Kaulder.\r\n\r\nElijah Wood's performance sucked rocks.  Rose Leslie (Game of Thrones, 17 episodes) was almost interesting as Kaulder's on-again, off-again witch ally.  That was a bit weak, since she was supposed to be the female lead.\r\n\r\n**Screenplay:** 5\/10 Violence and threat moves the plot along, so the 106 minutes runtime does not drag too badly. I'm glad I saw the film, but would not watch it again.  Why not?  The narrative is not well-constructed.  It seemed like every five minutes there was some change or rules, or some impressive (?) artifact to consider.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the film, I felt that I should have been happier for the protagonist, but just could not be. Would there be major challenges for him in the centuries to come?  Would Chloe be a reliable ally? By this time I did not care, and I felt this to be a major failing of the film.\r\n\r\n**_Final Rating:_** 6\/10 I liked it better than most people did, but I would be hard pressed to say, 'you must see this one.'","id":"57c9ac0e925141538c001d86","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c9ac0e925141538c001d86","movie_id":274854}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Thakka Thakka begins with Thulasi (Leema Babu), a teenaged girl, being sold to a pimp by her own father. This initial segment, detailing the harrowing experiences of the girl, is the strongest portion in the film. Even if the arc (a young woman who raises her child in a brothel and gives up her life trying to save him) is something that has been seen a few times, the filmmaking, enhanced by the moody lighting by cinematographer Sujith Sarang, is pretty solid.\r\n\r\nThe film cuts to the present where we see Thulasi's son Sathya (Vikranth), who has grown up to become a worker in a small hotel. His friend Karthi (Aravinnd), who is also an orphan, is in love with Indu (Abhinaya), a medic. However, Indu's mother (Uma Padmanabhan) plans to marry her off to her brother Kumar, an underling to Paraman (Rahul Venkat), a gangster. When Kumar learns that Indu had secretly married Karthi, he abducts her and plans to sell her in the flesh trade. Meanwhile, Sathya rescues a girl and in the process kills Bala (Arul Dass), the pimp who murdered his mother. Incidentally, Bala is also Paraman's brother and Paraman decides to get Sathya through Karthi.\r\n\r\nThakka Thakka is the kind of film that shows spirit even though it doesn't come together as a whole. There are moments that stand out, but the film lacks the tautness in writing that could have made it into a gripping action film. The outline of this tale is familiar, but director Sanjeev introduces a few layers into the narrative that make it somewhat interesting. However, what it lacks is a strong lead performance to make us care. Vikranth is earnest, but he is too passive, that we hardly connect with the character. In fact, most often, it is Karthi who comes across as the protagonist. The film is also unable to escape the cliche of one man beating up an entire gang of hardened criminals to pulp. Nevertheless, the understated romantic track(s) and the doggedness with which the director narrates this tales ensure that the predominant feeling as we exit the theatre is not that of disappointment.","id":"55e7bcf0c3a3682c64000c20","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55e7bcf0c3a3682c64000c20","movie_id":356516}

{"author":"annaaaaaa","content":"'The Intern' is a comedy\/drama movie, which was directed by Nancy Meyers in 2015. The movie takes place in Brooklyn, New-York. The first thing, which attracted me, was the cast \u2013 Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro as the main characters. This duo seemed to me quite curious, so I wanted to find out what the plot is. Another reason why I decided to watch it was the place. A lot of movies and series are made in New-York, and I like when a movie contains breathtaking views of this city. As for me, it makes movies truly esthetic. \r\n\r\n'The Intern' is a story about Ben Wittaker (Robert De Niro), who is 70 years-old. He has a family (son and grandchildren), which live quite far from him, and he\u2019s a widower. He has plenty of time and desire to do something new. Ben finds a vacancy in online-store of women\u2019s clothes. There he becomes an intern, and his duty is to help Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), a young woman who runs this business. I think, the most fascinating thing about the plot is relationship between Jules and Ben. She\u2019s young and not experienced, he\u2019s wise and he has rich background in business. No matter, they have a huge age gap, they become good friends. Ben supports Jules, not only when it's about work, but in her private life. Jules's family is about to fall apart, and she thinks, if she hires a new director, her family will be fine again. It's a choice between her work, which is extremely important for her, and her family. What should she do? Can this decision save her relationship with her husband? It's a tough decision, but with Ben's help she makes a right one. \r\n\r\n\u2018Experience never gets old\u2019. This is the general idea of the movie. I guess, it means that experience's always needed, it's always modern and it's always useful, no matter, what sort of experience it is. I love this idea and this movie in a whole. It's so kind and also dramatic. Acting makes you laugh, cry and then laugh again. Especially the very last scene makes you feel so calm and peaceful, and that'll be your emotions after watching the whole movie. I've seen 'The Intern' about 6 times, and every time characters make me relive these feelings.\r\n\r\n I think, if you want to watch something easy, warm and heartfelt, you should certainly watch this movie. 'One of my favorite movies this last year was Nancy Meyers\u2019\u00a0The Intern. They\u2019re not considering that for the Oscars even though I think Robert De Niro gave one of the best performances this year in that movie. I thought the script was actually one of her best', said Quentin Tarantino and added that it's Oscar-worthy.","id":"5da7f7c8944a5700152494d4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5da7f7c8944a5700152494d4","movie_id":257211}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A comet in the snow.**\r\n\r\nIt can't get any more beautiful than this. I have seen many lesbian films, but this one was like a result of when a poet and an artist comes together. It was so poetic, as well as an enchanting video portrait. Not everything in the film was pleasant, I mean not the romance parts, but you know self hurting parts as one got depressed in their life. That's where it all begins, an awesomely written screenplay where most of the film remains dialogueless. All you have to do is sit back and enjoy the stunning cinematography and a cute little romance the blends with that.\r\n\r\nThis is a Lithuanian film, but internationally co-produced. It won some awards at the various film festivals. It was officially selected as the Lithuanian entry for the 88th American Academy Awards, but did not make it. Written and directed by a woman filmmaker and this is her second feature film. I hope she makes more films like this with characters with emotions, then she will be in my watch out list. There's no comparable with any other lesbian film as many people doing. This is a very unique, especially in the storytelling segment. Most importantly, anybody with no objection on some sex-romance will do understand and appreciated the artistic presenstation of this film.\r\n\r\nThe title itself a plot line. So you know the storyline, but for how it all happens need to be watched. Sangaile is in her summer holiday, spending time with her parents in a rural villa. Near the house, there's an airfield where some spectacular display taking place, she instantly falls in love with that. That's where she meets a girl named Auste, who seems very interested in her. So later they decide to hang out and do the stuffs. After a few meets, with ups and downs, there relationship intensely grows, but how far it goes and how the story ends was told in the remaining parts.\r\n\r\n> \"You know nobody will understand you better than me.\"\r\n\r\nNot the entire film is about the romance that jumps into the bed. There are some messages, like how one influence the other one to change her character. Like depressed and lost, and got no idea about the future, a new hope rises like a sun for the new day after a long winter. The romance between two different social classes and their field of interest, all those fills the film on all the sides with its own colours like a Rubik's cube. The other advantage was the greatly ignoring the common clich\u00e9s, especially from a lesbian film aspect.\r\n\r\nFilms are collections of many things. From the actors to filmmakers to technicians and locations, when these all get together accurately, a beautiful product like this emerges. That's where it succeeded. First the actors, everyone, but the majority of the tale focused between the two characters and those two were brilliant. They executed so perfectly as it was real. You won't get that kind of great chemistry in all the romance film you watch. There are many moments that feels like it was paused, in a good sense as a romantic, as well as visually.\r\n\r\nThen comes the locations. As it is set in the rural, they explored the landscapes excellently. They were not intended to give preferences on those, but while capturing the film scenes, they used some interesting angles to get those beautiful backgrounds. As I said earlier, the images talk more than the film characters. The music score was also very good. The overall film looks like a touch of the 60s or 70s, but there's no any clarifications about the timeline. Seeing the lifestyle, all the gadgets et cetera, it is obviously a modern day tale.\r\n\r\nObserve everything carefully in the film. The film characters, the story, as well as production design was very simple. Like they did not spend much for making it. Yet it delivered big. Sadly, this is not a well recognised film, not much from LGBT film fanatic friends as well. I haven't seen many Lithuanian films, but surely this is one of the best from that region I have seen. You know who's the target audience for this, but the film is too good, so I hope you make a right choice. Though it is for adults, there's nothing much serious to consider in the romance\/sex\/nudity parts, so the matured and open minded teens can try this.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Kamal Haasan has had three releases this year, and in a way, all three films have been about a man looking out for his family. In Uttama Villain, he played a dying movie star who wants to make amends with the children he has ignored all his life. The cable TV operator of Papanasam was someone who used his intelligence to cover up a murder that could have torn apart his family. Now, in Thoongaavanam, Kamal is CK Diwakar, a cop who fights tooth and nail with both gangsters and cops to save his kidnapped son.\r\n\r\nThere are also a few more similarities with the other two films. As in Uttama Villain, we get a scene where a son, who has come to resent his father for ignoring him, realizes that his old man actually cares a lot for him. And just as we saw in Papanasam, here, too, the hero, CB Diwakar is involved in a game of cat and mouse with the cops while trying to cover up a crime. He is a cop with the Narcotics Crime Bureau, and has staged an unofficial drug bust with his colleague Mani (Yugi Sethu). Vittal Rao (Prakash Raj), a club owner to whom the drug belongs, kidnaps Diwakar's son (Aman Abdullah) and orders him to return the stolen drugs in exchange for his son. Vittal himself is in trouble with Pedha Babu (Sampath), the gangster to whom he owes the drugs. Diwakar goes to Vittal Rao's club but is spotted by Mallika (Trisha), a fellow cop, who alerts her boss Dhiraviyam (Kishore) to this fishy business. Meanwhile, the bag containing the drugs goes missing and Diwakar has to use both brain and brawn to rescue his son and get out of the place alive.\r\n\r\nThoongaavanam is a remake of Frederic Jardin's French film Sleepless Night, and Kamal Haasan's script largely stays close to the original. But unlike Papanasam, where the thrills of the original remained in tact in the remake as well, here, those who have seen Sleepless Night will experience ennui while the rest might notice how the film fails to generate tension consistently. You can't put a finger to it, but something has definitely gotten lost in this translation. One reason for this could be that Rajesh M Selva doesn't capture the frenetic pace of the original, which hurtled from one scene to the next without pausing for breath. Here, after a point, we get the feeling that the film is repeating itself with similar set-ups \u2014 Diwakar trying to evade Vittal Rao and Pedha Babu, and Diwakar trying to shake off Mallika and Dhiraviyam amidst the partying crowd, terrified cooks and clientele. The night club (named Insomnia, a subtle nod to Sleepless Night) is the dominant setting and even though the film cleverly spreads the action across various areas in the club \u2014 bathrooms, party floor, kitchen, VIP lounge and the parking area \u2014 it isn't enough to shake off the feeling of claustrophobia. By the time the film gets over, we feel exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe additions to the plot (the original clocked a lean 90 minutes while this one goes on for over two hours) are clearly unwarranted. Like the bit about a star film that has failed to release on the promised date because of the producer's financial woes \u2014 a dig at the actor's own Uttama Villain, or the epilogue, which is mainly a sop to fans.\r\n\r\nBut even though the film doesn't come together as effectively as it should have, there are moments that keep us glued. A couple of bone-crunching fistfights (testing the limits of the UA rating) in the club's kitchen are clearly the stand-out scenes, and the stunts, supervised by the original's stunt choreographer, Gilles Conseil, raise the bar in action choreography. The tetchiness in the relationship between Kamal and his son in the initial scenes are nicely realized. Technically, the film is solid, as are the performances. Kamal's performance, here \u2014 stylish and a lot more heroic \u2014 is markedly different from what we had seen in his other two films this year. And he superbly balances the steeliness of the cop with the tenderness of the father. The understated Kishore and Sampath are quite a contrast to the flamboyant Prakash Raj, who steals the show. The latter plays a role that has become his stereotype \u2014 the over-the-top villain, but beneath the flashiness and the comic tones, he brings out the vulnerability of the character. Trisha is the lightweight among these performers, but surprisingly, the actress feels just right for the role. To an extent, these factors keep the film engaging, but when it's Kamal Haasan, is merely engaging enough?","id":"5643f6479251410a4c003d23","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5643f6479251410a4c003d23","movie_id":363178}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"**The following is a long form review that I originally wrote in 2015.**\r\n\r\nFrom a technical point of view, _The Revenant_ is one of the most masterful pieces of cinema I've ever seen. This made its one technical failure all the more jarring. The ADR. I don't know how or why this was allowed to happen, but the dubbing of the Native Americans is some 70's style shit, it's awful, and it's awful every single time. In your average film this would be only a minor annoyance, but in _The Revenant_ which A) pretty much nails everything else in the AV department, and B) Takes itself so goddamn seriously, this issue is painfully distracting.\r\n\r\nI also found myself continuously rooting for the antagonists (first the bear, and later Hardy) subconsciously, and scolding myself for it. The good aspect of this is that it was rooted in the fact that all the characters are humanised (even the bear) and fallible, which I like, but the flip-side to that is I was less sympathetic to Leo's character, which takes up the majority of the screen time, and thusly I did not feel fully engaged for a large portion of the movie.\r\n\r\nIn fact the whole second and third acts underwhelmed me in that exact way. That's not to say that they were bad, but they were invariably weaker than the first act. After its end the rest of the film did feel like it was stretched a mite thin.\r\n\r\nThat all said, I knew within about 90 seconds that I was going to give _The Revenant_ a favourable review. Visually, it has this ethereal effect. It feels **too** real. So real that it must be a trick, the world of _The Revenant_ is alien in its realness. A bizarre contradictory nature that struck a chord with me immediately. For the average cinema-goer, I would say _The Revenant_ is worth your time, but for a movie aficionado or film student, I would say _The Revenant_ isn't anything short of a must.\r\n\r\n75%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_","id":"5cb08d739251412fb023d90d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cb08d739251412fb023d90d","movie_id":281957}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Would you let your dream go for the sake of love of your life!\r\n\r\nI watched it specially for Scott Eastwood. I did not like his performances in the previous films I had seen, so expected this one to change my perspective and I'm truly happy with it. If you are a romance novel and film fan, then you probably would have heard the name Nicholas Sparks. I haven't read his books, but I surely love almost all the films based on his material. So expected this film to be another romance masterpiece, but it was not, not entirely.\r\n\r\nYep, it is not a great film, but still a beautiful and enjoyable film. The cast was good, especially I love anything with Britt Roberson. The film had dual layer narration, one being set during the 40s onwards and the other was the present time tale. Both of them were about the young romance and their fight to overcome various issues surrounded their relationship. Kind of original and that's the best quality of this film.\r\n\r\nI think the director did his best who's known for some fine works. The film should have been a lot better, only if it was a bit emotionalised, which is very essential for a theme like this. I thought the final scene was cliche, but after waiting for a few more seconds, I relieved for changing its course in the final minute to conclude decently. The drawback was the length of the narration and the overall slow pace, other than that mostly you won't end up disappointed with this.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The stimulated brain terrorising!**\r\n\r\nActually, this film was made before 'Lucy', but released after that. So I first saw that and now this. Basically, these two films are similar thematic, except the genres are different. I liked Scarlett's film, a very much enjoyable. This film too looked nice, and watching it after that makes to understand it better. I meant scientifically, rather than a supernatural way. So what's extra in this was the usual horror film style jumpy scenes, with loud and sudden sounds.\r\n\r\nLimited cast, and one day event based film. Not a bad writing or the direction and performances. The settings were perfect, and the film did not require strong graphics. The story followed a small medical researcher team who is working on a serum that brings the dead back to life. When their entire work was ceased by the company they were working for, they decide to recreate everything to prove its theirs. Then something goes wrong, following a series of destruction before it all ends.\r\n\r\nLike I said, it was more a science-fictional thriller than your regular horror film. But it borrowed the same style to present on the screen. The events are simple to understand, except that scientific thing. Because there won't be any difference for those who are weak in basic science. It'll be another normal boring horror flick. For me, it's an average film, watchable for once being short and well paced narration.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"59fe12c8c3a36867f6024ca6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59fe12c8c3a36867f6024ca6","movie_id":243940}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> When the mountain swallowed the 33 men alive...\r\n\r\nThis is one of the greatest movie of 2015, not because of twists and turns, but pleasingly illustrating a true disastrous event. So don't listen to the negative remarks about it, ignore the low scores and just see it already. Like any flick, it definitely had a few flaws, if you focus it properly, you won't be distracted for those faults in the movie. All the above, bringing that 2010's unfortunate mining tragedy on screen was a success, that's the very important.\r\n\r\nIt was not a Marvel's superhero movie or a Disney-Pixar's cute animation that has its own large fan base to support. It is not even a Hollywood, but English language movie from Chile. So that's where the critics steered common people in a wrong direction. But as I'm a movie fanatic, I totally recommend it for all. This was not a simple disaster drama, but had a good amount of emotions, suspense, nationalism, light laughs, brotherhood and ultimately a good entertainment.\r\n\r\nIt is no ones biopic as it was categorised. It is a single real incident based movie, especially the book 'Deep Down Dark'. All the characters had a fair scope and portrayed according to story growth. But it opened by introducing only a few main characters and other supporting ones out of 33 whose story this was based on.\r\n\r\nOn an ordinary day, those miners started their day as usual. For some, it was their first day and for others it was the final days of their job, but everyone had their own reasons to go into the mountain's deep down. But what they did not know was the mountain was tired of being opened its mouth for the centuries. Finally, she decided to close the mouth by swallowing the 33. But those men stood against the chances they had and fought for their survival, which was finely told in this movie. What happened to them, how it concludes was narrated still the last minute with suspense.\r\n\r\n> \"That's not a rock, that's the heart of the mountain.\r\n> She finally broke.\"\r\n\r\nTo me there was no mystery left in the main theme, because when this thing happened 5 years ago, I closely followed the event. So I know how it ended and I knew how the movie would end, but surprising parts were the families, media, politics and all the other surrounding events composed together which was a quite fresh perspective that helped the movie to help shape well. So I am telling you, if you think you know this story, you probably wrong on that assumption.\r\n\r\nIf I want to discuss about negative, that would the language of the movie. I am very-very disappointed with that choice, it must have been in the Spanish. Those Chilean characters speaking English was kind of jokes with their funny accent. It did not work for me, because Chile never was a commonwealth member. If Indian, Malaysian or Sri Lankan character speaks English would make sense. I know they wanted it to be an International product, so did they chose Internationally recognisable actors like Antonio Banderas and Julliette Binoche. Yes, on that aspect it paid off well.\r\n\r\nThe movie almost got me on its emotional side, I did not show it physically, but surely I felt deep inside me. It also triumphs to tell how important the families are. They are the first ones to react if you are in a real danger to rescue, to shed tears, to standby on the scene looking for your return and to hug tightly. The movie might be categorised in a couple of genres, but it had other mixed ingredients as well. For example, the scenes called the last supper and the circus outside the rescue site. Movies are not all about perfection, sometimes demonstrating its purpose decently would do good enough. So on that facet I got no point to say to skip it.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"56e6fc7fc3a3685a9a00a536","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56e6fc7fc3a3685a9a00a536","movie_id":293646}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A tale of the modern day job hunt.**\r\n\r\nFrench films are the second most I watched apart from the English language films. It's mainly because of the quality of their products. They won't put big sum on some superhero film like the Hollywood, they give preference to storytelling and the characters which I love even in a slow pace narration. Anyway, you would be tired of listening to what I'm going to say that I always love French and Japanese films, mostly the drama films. This is the latest one I saw that I did not think of giving it a try after the average reception, but once I watched I realised how much underrated the film was.\r\n\r\nThis is like another 'Two Days, One Night', but a bit touch of 'The Pursuit of Happiness' with the limited sentiments. There's no comparison with any other titles, except the similarity in themes. You can call it a docudrama, because it was very realistic that you won't feel like you are watching a film. Especially not for an entertainment purpose. If you are so, then stop there and try other flick. This could resemble your life, at least some way if you ever struggled to get an employment after getting released from the previous job. I am not talking about the freshers or the youngsters, but in between the jobs, mostly the middle-aged and less qualified men's perspective.\r\n\r\nThe modern world belongs to the young blood. Being somewhat old and not skilled with today's technologies is a big excuse to exclude from the employment world. That leaves to get one from the smaller wages. Such film is this one which focused on the man called Thierry who was looking for any job for the last two years. His family is small with a wife and a handicapped son. Financially struggling Thierry decides to get a loan from the bank and try to sell his mobile home to meet the expenses. Finally, he ends up in a supermarket as a security guard and follows his new way of struggle against the reality of the world where crime and compassion overlap.\r\n\r\n> \"A shoplifter has no age or colour. Everybody is a potential shoplifter.\"\r\n\r\nI was desperately looking for some entertainment to relax after the tired day. I jumped on this, and initially it took time to launch into the main storyline. It begins with Thierry having conversation with his old colleagues about the options and if there is any legal solution for his old job. This is the film where pictures, as well as lines carefully watched and listened respectively to understand the intention of such film to be exist. The every word spoken in the film were not like any other films, but it was like real life dialogues between two or more people that we the audience listening them from somewhere around the corner. That's why I compared it with documentary.\r\n\r\nThis is the third film for Vincent Lindon with the director and the best one. The last time I saw him was in the 'Bastards' that I did not like. Surely the best of him after 'Welcome'. He won a few best actor awards for his role in this film, including one at the 2015 Cannes. The film was all about him. He as Theirry was the soul of the film. People start to recognise the actors since they saw them in one of their best performances and now I for Vincent Lindon through this film.\r\n\r\nObviously very slow at the beginning, but once you start to feel you know enough about Thierry, it gets more interesting. Particularly the final act was impressive. It points out how narrowly our society was built where you can't escape the disappointment if you are a sensitive person about the actions that entirely depends on the situation whether its good (empathy) or bad (crime). This film is everything. You can call it a self-discovery or truth finder, but well detailed about the modern day job hunt by an average person. Even if he gets one, does it stand up to his moral dimensions? Because some people mind what they are doing, even though getting it after a desperate attempt.\r\n\r\nLike I said I saw it in a wrong circumstance, but I did not fail to recognise fineness of it. This is one of the best drama films I have seen, especially in the recent times. If you are looking for a realistic portrayal film, this is the one. It might be an under- noticed film today, but the time will come when people look back on this decade for how the lives and society evolved, then this little precious film will impact greater which depicted exactly what's happening right now. What I meant was some films are not meant for the present, despite all the films are made for the present!!!\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"58a3794fc3a3683f84001499","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58a3794fc3a3683f84001499","movie_id":329712}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"When the trailer of Thangamagan was released, it immediately brought to mind his \" Velaiilla Pattadhari\" (VIP) with its shot collage of domestic life and masala heroism. \" Thangamagan\" has all that but these moments feel like a watered down version of what we had seen in the previous film. The film plays on the middle-class male fantasy of young men wanting to be a caring son, a charming boyfriend, a loving husband, and a hero for the family. There is a scene where the protagonist Tamizh (Dhanush, playing the guy-next-door for the umpteenth time) and his friends are watching \"7\/G, Rainbow Colony\" \u2014 a film that so successfully tapped into this fantasy \u2014 and the screen fills up with the words 'A film by Selvaraghavan'. It is Dhanush rightly acknowledging the influence of his brother. But the film lacks the edginess that characterizes Selvaraghavan's films and the naturalism of \"VIP's\" domestic scenes. The characters come across more as archetypes \u2014 hardworking father, loving mother, stunning girlfriend, demure wife, wisecracking friend and so on \u2014 and so, we care less for them. And, the sense of niceness that we see on screen feels less organic and more calculated. \r\n\r\nBut the film isn't a damp squib, either. The principal cast feels right in their roles. Ravikumar and Radikaa are pitch perfect, while even Amy, who is made to sing Tamizhukkum Amudhendru Paer (of all things), manages to pass muster. The scenes in the first half have a smooth rhythm. There is lightness in these scenes and despite the familiarity of the situations, the film keeps us engaged. Tamizh's break-up with Hema ( Amy Jackson), the Anglo-Indian girl whom he loves, and his honeymoon period with Yamuna ( Samantha), the girl he eventually marries, happen in the space of few minutes but the film is convincing in portraying the fact that the protagonist has moved on. Situations that could have become full-blown melodrama of the TV serial variety are treated with a restraint that is admirable. When Tamizh's father (Ravikumar) dies, the camera gradually slips out of the room as if to not intrude on the family's grief and the film even asks the same of the audience and breaks into the intermission. \r\n\r\nHowever, the film lacks a potent conflict (we are instantly able to solve the mystery over missing cash that is the root cause of Tamizh's troubles) and that is why it begins to feel over-long, despite clocking in at just over two hours. And given that it exhausts the feel-good moments in the first half, the second half feels weak, with antagonists who are just not effective enough (it was the case in \" VIP\" and \"Maari\" as well) and unimaginative stunts.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A necessary finishing touch with an unnecessary lag.\r\n\r\nIf the single book 'The Hobbit' was extended to three movies, then that's alright, because that was a large concept with hundreds of unique characters which can take the stretch in narration. But for this series, lucky to be the first film to get away with a big hit, mainly because of teen audience.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I liked the 2nd film very much, but the third movie was a letdown, especially this one was utterly useless. Because the 80% of the story ended in the previous part and in this, it was a necessary finishing touch with an unnecessary lag.\r\n\r\nMight have been a better film if the 'Mockingjay' was a single movie. Nowadays there are many strange ways to make money, the art of storytelling in the movies is slowing vanishing while adapting a book for the silver screen by splitting them into two and\/or three. This culture has to stop, the book fans are enjoying the original masterpiece, while film fanatic like me is suffering a setback. In this 2 hour long movie there are lots of scenes that simply wastes time to bring sufficient runtime.\r\n\r\nDue to the circumstances that I mentioned, the flow was disturbed, mainly because of the release gap between the last two films. Emotions are not felt, actions were weakened, you could only recognise it rushing towards the conclusion. And that section should have been the ultimatum, what comes later is what we call 'happily ever after or the other way' should have been very brief, but in here it was not. Like a new beginning of a new story, it went on too far.\r\n\r\nFrom the screenwriter's perspective that has to be done. I had seen the split movies like 'Twilight', 'Harry Potter' and others, but this one was the worst among them. Even if you try all the four movies in a single sitting, the first two will be the best you can get and the followed two would surely disappoint you because of the slowness.\r\n\r\n5\/10","id":"5702872392514125e70008d5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5702872392514125e70008d5","movie_id":131634}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> ...And then there were none.\r\n\r\nI'm neither Tarantino nor Nolan's fan, but love watching their movies. As usual these director's films are highly expected by all, that's including me. This one started off quite like a normal western, so I thought it wouldn't be like the director's previous film 'Django Unchained'. In fact, it was considered for a sequel to that, but the director felt this story and the previous character Django failed to blend, hence 'The Hateful Eight' was born with Samuel L. Jackson playing an important role.\r\n\r\nSolid eight from me for this QT's eighth film. But I felt the movie was kind of inspired by 'And Then There Were None'. It was not about to find who's the killer or next to be killed. The character introductions were at its best and an excellent twist in the middle. This sets in a cabin with eight strangers struck there after the snowstorm. But after an unexpected event the suspicious started to mount and brings chaos. Then takes us to the flashback to reveal something the story that did not mention in the earlier part which's very essential for coming back to the finale.\r\n\r\nThe 80% of the movie was just talking, but the remaining stunt sequences were so powerful. All the eight, plus, supporting character were exceptional, but the director's favourite Samuel L. Jackson nailed it as his character is a bit above from the rest. The entire film was shot is a couple of locations, but the major portion takes place in a cabin and it was a limited cast movie. These days, western movies are shrinking, only a very-very few good movies are made every year. In the time of superheroes, a movie like this is really very precious, so definitely recommend it.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"56f3ee2dc3a3682fdb00289c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56f3ee2dc3a3682fdb00289c","movie_id":273248}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> \"...who does that?\" \"-Only Charlie Brown.\"\r\n\r\nIn the last few years I have not got tired to praise in my review for those my childhood tv favourite cartoons successfully transformed into 3D animations. After 'Tintin', 'Doraemon', 'Asterix', 'Mr Peabody' 'Winnie' and a few others, now this movie joined the club. I'm waiting for many more like 'Garfield', 'Kim Possible', 'Calvin & Hobbes' et cetera to make its way.\r\n\r\n'Peanuts' characters considered one of the beautiful cartoon characters, just like 'Calvin & Hobbes'. They're simple drawings, yet very cute and delightful. These are mostly best suited to render in 2D animation, so till I watch them in 3D I always had a curiosity and doubts. This film is still a mix of both styles  - like eyes, mouth, dusts and in the side view, it was 2D drawing, but overall characters and backgrounds are 3D.\r\n\r\nIt was so good movie, for the 90 minutes I became a child again. As usual, there were two tales, one was Snoopy's fictional account and the others' Charlie Brown's crush on a little red-haired girl. Both of them were great, but I liked Charlie's a lot.\r\n\r\nOnce the animation was considered only for the kids, but now the world sees it differently. This film had an excellent box office. So definitely there will be a sequel. My only upset is it failed to do good at Annie awards, but anyway, like Disney studio says, that award ceremony is a joke and a disgrace to animation and animation (movie) fans.\r\n\r\n8\u00bd\/10","id":"56f3ef52c3a3682fdd002c8d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56f3ef52c3a3682fdd002c8d","movie_id":227973}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I have to say that I quite enjoyed Tomorrowland despite its way too common mistake of being quite a bit nonsensically preachy to satisfy the current politically correct view of what is \u201cwrong\u201d with the world today. Filtering out those parts this is a quite enjoyable, visually very entertaining, family movie. If you have strong opinions about certain things then you might want to be with your kids when watching this one. Personally I consider my oldest son to be quite capable of making his own opinions and as for the two younger kinds I try to point out the pro\u2019s and con\u2019s and let them grow up to make their own mistakes.\r\n\r\nHaving that out of the way this is a visually quite wonderful movie. it is of course quite CGI enhanced but in a good way. It is a Disney movie after all so you would expect, at least I did, some \u201cartistic freedom\u201d as far as the scenery is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe story is actually a quite lovely \u201cfairy tale\u201d kind of story about a \u201cwonderland\u201d far far away. Initially it is a wee bit difficult to get a grip of what is happening since it all moves about all over the place a bit. If you can overcome that first disorientation it does indeed get somewhat sensible after a while. Having said that I mean \u201csensible\u201d in the context of not only a wild and whacky science fiction movie but in the context of a wild and wacky science fiction movie aimed at the younger part of the audience. Despite the scientific blurb thrown around in the last half of the movie do not for a minute believe that any of the script writers have more scientific knowledge than the average Hollywood script writer which is\u2026zero.\r\n\r\nTo me the enjoyment of this movie came from the childish fantasy style (it does have quite a bit of a fairly tale story over it), from the rather enjoyable cinematic effects, quite a bit of cool action and last but not least \u2026 George Clooney. Actually that is not entirely fair. George was part of it but what I really liked was the recruiting android all the way from the start. When Clooney entered the scene both him and the android pretty much stole the scene. I am afraid that the Newton girl, for a lot of the time, felt more like a \u201cplot element\u201d than a main character to me.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I quite liked the scenes in Paris as well. Sorry guys but I do live in France after all. The Eiffel Tower scenes where quite enjoyable and I do like the touch where they used Mr. Eiffel\u2019s apartment at the top of the tower as a scenery. Actually I am not sure how many people actually know that there is an apartment (now a museum) up there. The stuff about a hidden room and a hidden [naah, that would be a spoiler] beneath the tower is of course truly nonsensical.\r\n\r\nSo, bottom line, if Disney would not have gone down the line of trying to make a political statement, and I do not care what that statement was except that it was blunt, obvious and unconcealed, then this movie would have gotten another star or two. I cannot justify giving it much lower than what I did since it was, technically speaking, a quite good and entertaining movie. However, movies for children is not the medium to make a statement unless you believe that you are living in a socialist state a \u2018la the Soviet Union.","id":"56c331999251414b0a001bda","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56c331999251414b0a001bda","movie_id":158852}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Supposedly his swansong, veteran SA Chandrasekaran gives us two separate movies put together as one in Touring Talkies. In the first film, Love @ 75, he plays the lead for the first time as a 75-year-old man who is searching for the love of his life, who, 50 years ago, walked away from him under parental compulsion. He learns that she is in Shimla and goes there with barely a month to live. A couple of small-time thieves help him in the search. Does he find her? \r\n\r\nSAC tries to go all emo with this old couple romance but the film is overlong and the premise hardly novel. He does better as an actor, playing a character who is young at heart but is counting his days. We get his love story as flashbacks, and even that one isn't fresh. He also seems to have been least bothered about staying true to the period (a character talks about AIDS, which was identified only in the early 80s, though the scene is happening 50 years ago!), and there are large stretches where we just have to put up with him roaming the hill town in search of his lover. It is only in the climax that we begin to feel for the character and even this is largely due to Ilaiyaraaja's Aasai Mugam Marandhu Poche. \r\n\r\nThe next film, Selvi 5am Vaguppu, deals with sensitive topics \u2014 child rape and caste \u2014 but is presented rather crudely. Selvi, lower caste schoolgirl, who stands up against Chinnayya and Gurusamy, two powerful upper caste men, is raped and murdered and the two men manage to convince the village that the girl hanged herself. But her sister, Poongodi, with support from an empathetic cop and two journalists (who should surely rank among the most inept), decides to take revenge. \r\n\r\nThis film once again proves that when commercial filmmakers tackle sensitive issues, it largely ends up as a high-minded and amateurish attempt. When a revenge plan consists of urinating in the coffee and liquor of the perpetrators and making them eat shit as chutney, we just can't help rolling our eyes. And, how can we be expected to take a film where scenes of child rape co-exist with titillating scenes of a woman in her knickers seriously? But the bigger question is how did a film on subjects like child rape and caste issues, and with a scene where an old man in his loincloth gets oil massage manage to get away with a U\/A certificate?","id":"5502fe56c3a36826b9002e5e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5502fe56c3a36826b9002e5e","movie_id":328376}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> No matter what comes between, the friendship remains forever!\r\n\r\nI had seen lots of gay themed films, but this one was different and way better I felt. This was not about the romance, sex or the social struggle, it was about the friendship and nothing else. When one of four friends reveal that he's a gay, how the remaining three reacts to it and what are all damages done to their longstanding friendship is the film.\r\n\r\nI don't know any of these actors, but I liked their performance. And for the first timer, the direction was not bad which was done in just 17 days. Obviously not a greatest film of the year or the best gay film ever, but it had some great moments. A simple story about the four ordinary friends, and their unexpected situation to deal with. Something they're not used to it, but trying their best to adapt forth in the life.\r\n\r\nOnly occasional use of a few obscene lines, so the film is safe to watch for all. It avoids the some usual gay related clich\u00e9, and provides with a fresh storyline. The laughs were not big, especially it avoids the offendable joke topics the most. So overall a decent comedy. For its low budget, the film actually looked like a big production film with a quality narration. Maybe you're not interested in the gay films, but if you do, then don't miss this little gem.\r\n\r\n6.5\/10","id":"5787c2df92514131c0000ea1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5787c2df92514131c0000ea1","movie_id":342672}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Most deserved remake, but relying on CGI for everything ruined it.\r\n\r\nThis movie is only about stunts, the story wise, it's a great disappointment. I have seen the old version, for a 90s movie, the actions were fantastic with an awesome story. In this remake I don't know where's the story, the characters were underdeveloped and it rushed towards the end with plenty of high octane action sequences everywhere. This formula won't work all the time like '300' and 'Fury Road', but it's really good for watching in digital 3D.\r\n\r\nThe story was kind of sameness, but slightly altered, especially about that 8 ordeal and stunts were obviously freshly designed. The graphic works were weak in some parts, it failed to give a natured effect. Yeah, I think CGI is the issue, the movie relied on it for everything.\r\n\r\nThe cast performances were fine, but a big star in the lead might have given a different result. It's entertaining, but that was not enough these days, especially for a cop movie we expect details, not just physical tricks.

It wasn't as bad as I had anticipated, and that the bad reviews at the time gave me the impression I should fear or avoid watching it. The special effects were pretty good, and Sam Rockwell, Jared Harris and Jane Adams (how wonderful it was to see her again, after her exceptional work in 'Happiness'!) sold the film for me. I knew what to expect after liking, but not loving, director Gil Kenan's earlier animated 'Monster House', but I was intrigued how his energetic directing would transfer to live-action work.\r\n\r\nI think they could have made it more suspenseful and scary, but I'm not really sure that was their intention. I think they were going for a family experience with some thrills, chills and laughs...such as the recent 'Ghostbusters' remake was going for. If that was the case, then in that regard it was quite successful. I'm looking forward to re-watching this eventually with my 13-year-old son, horror-film aficionado, Julian, who like me adored the original.\r\n\r\nIf I was to make the perfect 'Poltergeist' film, I would have taken the same exact Steven Spielberg script and simply updated the special effects.

If you had not seen the 80s film, then there's a little chance you might like it. Though it was not a serious horror movie, or a scary movie to consider, still quite enjoyable like a dark comedy in parts. But I recommend the old one.\r\n\r\nReally? Sam Rockwell? He did not fit in the role, just okay though. And the kids, did not impress me as like the original movie. The only upgrade in this new version was the technology, CRT monitors to LED kind of stuffs.

Disappoints for those who loved the first version. However, that movie deserved to be remade, and I did not think it would end like this.

I certainly hope the audience are not dumb enough to fall for this obvious lie. Judging from the, well deserved mediocre score on various review sites I guess they did not.\r\n\r\nAnyway, as for the movie. It is a bleak (cheap) shadow of the original.

How can this guy afford and get a one for a house when he apparently do not seem to have a job? He even manages to go for another house in the end after his original one apparently got shredded. How bloody dumb is the script writer? In the original it was a new neighbourhood which explained the \u201ctroubles\u201d.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The supernatural 'eye in the sky'.**\r\n\r\nFrom the directors of 'A Cat in Paris', but this film set in New York City that narrates the story of a boy with an extraordinary power. If you had liked that film, you probably would like it as well, but a little lesser. Except this is not about the art of theft, but a cop trying to catch a most dangerous criminal. It is so weird to see the New York turned into kind of a province of France as everybody in this speak French, but expected it as it's a French film.\r\n\r\nA very interesting storyline. The characters were well designed and developed. But most of the film was focused on the boy, the cop and the main villain with a dog's perspective. There's a little part of a reporter as well. So I think it should have been called 'A Dog in New York', but the dog is on the wrong side where the most of the story was narrated from. The theme was not fresh, but the way they used to tell the tale makes all the difference. I mean you can compare it to 'If I Stay' kind of plenty of other films. Except it turned into a crime-thriller.\r\n\r\nA young boy named Leo, who is hospitalised for the serious illness, has a special power to leave his body and take an invisible form, and come back again safely within some time frame. On the other side an honest cop trying to hunt down a criminal who is threatening the peace of the city gets a backlash after met with an accident. Now the cop and the boy join the hands to thwart the villain's latest attempt to bring disruption. The mission was not planned well, so how they fight the crime and its result brings to an end to the film.\r\n\r\n> \"I'm not hungry. It's a shame because my dad's pasta is the best in the world.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a PG film, that means it's aimed for all the ages. But particularly for the grown ups, there's nothing much to enjoy other than cool presentation. That does not mean for all the grown ups. The sketches and the animation technics were same as the previous film. They tried to reach bigger audience worldwide from the success of their previous film, but seems not achieved that goal. As the film had many great features like the characters and the story, they have fallen short to surpass as an overall film. Even anytime I would pick 'A Cat in Paris' over this, but that does not make this one's a bad film.\r\n\r\nIt kind of looks like the supernatural version of 'Eye in the Sky'. I'm not talking about the actual film, but the concept of drones to watch over the criminal activity. In here the boy acts as the main communication device. He who one day wants to be a cop, helps to solve the crime. I think the end should have been a little better. Especially from the boy's perspective about how his tale ends were very intentional. Perhaps a bit of emotions at the end would have given a better result.\r\n\r\nI advertise the 2D animations too much on my blog whenever I review them, because they are rapidly fading away art. So my big thanks to those production houses and the filmmakers who still believe in it. If you are an animation film fan, you will enjoy it, no matter you loved it or not at the end. In a simple way to say, it is a fine film for the families with kids aged ten or under. It might look like a typical detective film, but entertaining with a few good moments.

So the Nicolas Cage into this after the legal struggle in real life, but people have different opinion without knowing the truth. He definitely would come back to his old form, but it's not known when. All these his recent B films just somewhat shines because of having him onboard. So this flick as well too ordinary and stupid, though watchable because of the Cage.\r\n\r\nThe story was maybe a hundredth adaptation. Anybody with the knowledge of the decent horror films can predict the entire narration. But the different cast, setting, et cetera makes it worth a watch. Definitely not scary or the suspenseful, yet everybody tried their best to make the product better. Only the first half, mostly the first quarter was the better part of the film. So if you pick it on the basis of the story, you will be disappointed badly. This film is not worth unless you're a Cage's fan who backs him every time or love to take chances on the B films.

They try to rein in their kids' exuberance, seek medical advice, and even send them off to a boarding school, not realising that the key to their change actually lies with them. It is left to Dr Tamil Nadan and his wife Venba, a school teacher who believes in unconventional teaching methods, to make them understand this and unlock the kids' bridled creativity.\r\n\r\nWhen Pandiraj gave us Pasanga, it was like a breath of fresh air. It was film that allowed its child leads to be kids but the filmmaking was definitely grown-up, successfully marrying a native story with a contemporary cinematic form. And with Marina, he showed once again that stories centred around children can be turned into good cinema. Pasanga-2 is also about kids but shockingly, the writing is so commonplace and blatantly manipulative. It is also formulaic in the way it goes about narrating its story ticking off every convention in the children's film genre. The cliched scenes turn preachy at the drop of a hat and to make the film feel hip, Pandiraj keeps throwing trendy elements \u2014 animated stories, guest appearances, even ghosts! \u2014 at us, but they do not add weight to the storyline. The characters are two dimensional and their only role is to keep the plot moving. The actors look the part but their characters are hardly rounded to make us sympathise with their plight. For contrast, we only have to look at the way the bickering couple in Pasanga was written. Here, neither Munishkanth and Vidya Pradeep nor Karthik Kumar and Bindhu Madhavi, convince as people who we could come across in real life. And the characters in Tamil Nadan household come across as something we see in TV commercials with hardly any blemish. Suriya (who reels off his lines as if he is acting in a public service ad) and Amala Paul come across as couple who are always in agreement and have never had a tiff, the kids are improbably sensitive and disciplined, while their grandparents hover in the background to make sympathetic noises. Heck, the family even has moonlight get-togethers on their terrace!\r\n\r\nPandiraj's dialogues are, thankfully, still sharp, and if the film feels alive, it is mainly because of these lines and the truth in them, and the optimistic outlook of the film. And he also extracts good performances from his child leads, who have an impish charm that makes them hard to resist. The film will certainly appeal to an undemanding viewer, but given that we are talking about a filmmaker who has set the bar quite high, the failings in the film override its plusses and it is the duty of a discerning viewer to call out on this fact so that he doesn't settle for mediocrity next time.","id":"568366e8925141133400dd90","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/568366e8925141133400dd90","movie_id":364023}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"The best thing about Papanasam is how convincingly it makes us forget the original Drishyam, and manages to stand on its own. The film is almost a frame-by-frame remake of the Malayalam film and still, it doesn't give that vibe of being a remake. The small town setting, where everyone knows one another, is crucial to the plot and Jeethu Joseph's convinvingly sets his slow-burning crime thriller in picturesque Papanasam. Right from the slang, the local milieu is so well realized that the film transports us to the place.\r\n\r\nScript-wise, there are no major changes save for the fact that the protoganist Suyambulingam (Kamal Haasan) is a markedly different character from that of the original's George Kutty. Mohanlal nicely underplayed the role and gave us the impression of a man who was confident of winning the cat-and-mouse game he was playing with the cops, Kamal Haasan makes the character more emotional and we see a man who cannot afford to lose. This approach makes Suyambulingam one among us, so in addition to caring for the character, we begin to see every problem that he encounters as our own.\r\n\r\nSuyambulingam is someone who has made it big in life all by himself and he takes pride in the fact. His cable TV business serves as a perfect outlet for his obsessive cinema watching (he even stays up at his office during the night to watch movies on TV and goes home only in the mornings). But what he cares the most is his family \u2014 his wife Rani (Gauthami, decent in her comeback role) and daughters Selvi (Nivetha Thomas) and Meena (Esther Anil). When Selvi is blackmailed by Varun (Roshan), who has shot a scandalous video of her, the situation goes out of control and the boy ends up dead. Suyambulingam will not let his family suffer and so, hatches upon an elaborate plot \u2014 inspired by the movies he has watched and his innate street smartness \u2014 to create water-tight alibis. But his opponent, Geetha Prabhakar (Asha Sarath), is equally clever; she is a woman, a mother and a cop \u2014 and all these three kinds of people are known for their instinct. At one point, she sees through his game plan but can she prove that they are lies?\r\n\r\nOne of the strengths of Papanasam is how it makes us side with both these two characters in the end. Geetha's son might be a rogue but she and her husband (Ananth Mahadevan) are parents who love their son as much as Suyambulingam loves his daughters. But until the climax, we see her doing everything \u2014 including physical torture \u2014 to get the truth out. The supporting characters \u2014 Kalabhavan Mani as the constable who is constantly at loggerheads with the hero and is an eye-witnesses to his crime, MS Bhaskar as the friendly tea-shop owner, Delhi Ganesh as Suyambu's father-in-law, Aruldas as the decent sub-inspector \u2014 are just the right fit for the parts. Jeethu Joseph also irons out one major niggle in the Malayalam film \u2014 we are told why a lie detector is out of question in this particular case and that adds to the plausibility of the plot.\r\n\r\nGiven that the script is so strong, the filmmaking takes a backseat. The camera is unobtrusive though the framing and editing in some scenes comes close to TV drama and involves reaction shots of the characters in the frame. Thankfully, the low-key background score, which swells only during genuinely thrilling moments, gives a cinematic touch to the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThough it is a plot-driven film, Papanasam is equally a Kamal Haasan show. This is turning out to be a splendid year for Kamal, the actor. If he made us care for Manoranjan in Uttama Villain with a restrained performance, here, he superbly balances the showiness and resoluteness of Suyambulingam. After a long while, Kamal isn't encumbered by the other roles he has to play in the film (we have to go back to Vettaiyadu Vilayadu to see him in only one role \u2014 actor) and that seems to have been refreshing for him. There is a little more vigour in his performance and it is a joy to see him having fun in the initial portions of the film. This calm also translates into a measured performance in scenes which require heavy-duty acting. Take away the minor issue of the fake moustache and this is a flawless performance.","id":"559768b6c3a36855e6000a7c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/559768b6c3a36855e6000a7c","movie_id":330421}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"There are certain film franchises that just cannot take a hint and go away. The idea of milking the stale novelty of the on-going queasy saga of repetitive horrifying hedonism is something that both the movie-makers and movie-goers are guilty of perpetrating that ultimately feeds into the chronic sequelitis of misbegotten movies refusing to surrender the spotlight. This is definitely indicative of the Paranormal Activity movie series that stretched its one-time legitimate creepy credibility into a tired and tacky frightfest that overstayed its welcome. Hence, the arrival of the latest extension in the veteran found footage phenom machine entitled Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension. Basically, audiences needed another Paranormal Activity installment much like a creaky skeleton needs its share of body fat. Thus, this so-called \"final entry\" makes its macabre mark in the mediocrity of mayhem.\r\n\r\nAfter four previous Paranormal Activity fear-inducing flicks (with Paranormal Activity 4 being released three years ago this month in October), the fifth entry for Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension looks to grind out what is left to pick apart in this grainy and grating creeper. Unfortunately, The Ghost Dimension drags and drowns in its desperate and dull attempt to parlay the familiar foundation of sketchy scares and manufactured jitters as it tries to jump start the stark memories from the other predecessors. The problem is that the Paranormal Activity editions have not sustained itself adequately after the original blueprint. So there is nothing to really build in terms of varying degrees of suspense and shock when the last couple of sequels were thanklessly watered down.\r\n\r\nOne would not mind so much if Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension was a viable swan song that wrapped up its continued bump-in-the-night theme with something unique and invigorating as it looks to wave goodbye to its former reputation as a distinctive chiller thriller. Sadly, The Ghost Dimension feels clunky and goes through the motions while not missing a beat in presenting the same old hair-raising high jinks. This is business as usual and even the most ardent defender of the Paranormal Activity film experience deserves more than this stillborn haunted house boofest.\r\n\r\nIt is a shame that the original brilliance of Paranormal Activity has been lost in the shuffle following a series of continued creepy-minded chronicles that single-handily ruined such an innovative premise. The blueprint for PA started out promising as it delved into the haunting shenanigans of its found footage gimmick that appeared so refreshingly raw and arresting. Plus, the unseen terror and imagined goosebump goings-on solidified this scare tactic piece of cinema as the \"reel deal\" of shock cinema at the time. It looked as if the PA influence would revolutionize (or at least lend some innovative spark) the horror genre to a different degree of expectation.\r\n\r\nThe premise in The Ghost Dimension finds a family man Ryan Fleege (Chris J. Murray) and his loved ones in wife Emily and young daughter Leila (Brit Shaw and Ivy George) moving into a new house as they get situated in their exciting place. Soon, Ryan and his brother Mike (Dan Gill) come across something most unusual--a leftover box containing a camera and VHS tapes (NOTE: it is worth mentioning that the tapes detail the harried happenings that occurred in Paranormal Activity 3). Strangely, Ryan and Mike come to the realization that this most peculiar piece of equipment has a bizarre power in that it can record what they are doing and broadcast it to other sources for whom they are viewing thus creating a link to past and present goings-on. Furthermore, this weird camera has captured the roaming and ominous spirit in the household. The threatening revelation, of course, is that the spooky presence of this ghostly figurehead is drawn to little Leila. Naturally, the concern is an open and shut case: the family must obviously protect the child from the pesky apparition as they are determined to get to the bottom of the mysterious camera that has caused this sudden sense of domesticated dire. \r\n\r\nOther than serving as a mere bridge to connect the previous PA outings to pad the proceedings in this current edition, The Ghost Dimension has really nothing to offer in terms of developing its own path of peril. This \"retread of dread\" feels needlessly wasted and we never are invested totally in what appears to be another routine rousing romp fortified with basic stares and scares, predictable knee jerk reactions, silly-minded atmospheric special effects and the typical \"child gloom-doom possession\" tactic that has been overused countless times before. Sure, Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension promises to answer some of the lingering questions that were presented in this movie's so-called folklore and does indeed touch upon some key factors that PA fans were curious about previously. Still, the film's pay-off in the later part of the story feels concocted and unsatisfying. Indeed, The Ghost Dimension feels like some elaborate patch job as opposed to a solid scream-dream thriller hoping to tie all the pieces together in a film fright series that has inexplicably lasted over the last several years.  Simply, the ensuing PA chronicles has been overwrought with meager menacing indifference. \r\n\r\nDirector Gregory Plotkin (whose credits include editing some of the PA flicks) helms this narrative with a run-of-the-mill flair that does not help an already pedestrian exposition short on its share of daring chills. Surprisingly, The Ghost Dimension has an impressive handful of screenwriters with decent track records of scripting serviceable psychological gems yet their collaboration seems ineffective and incomplete. Perhaps an appropriate case of too many cooks crowded in the kitchen of creativity? The one saving grace, thank goodness, is John Rutland's delicious cinematography that is vividly shot with imaginative urgency. As for the 3-D special effects that are scattered throughout The Ghost Dimension, they somewhat resonate but it is nothing that one would label compellingly expressive from a visual standpoint.   \r\n\r\nIf the Paranormal Activity legacy has a Ghost of a chance to preserve its movie-making memories, it should take its final curtain call with Dimension and allow any found footage of these churned out sequels to speak for itself in the haunted house genre it contributed to so convincingly in its heralded heyday.\r\n\r\nParanormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension (2015)\r\n\r\n\r\nParamount Pictures\r\n\r\n\r\n1 hr. 28 mins.\r\n\r\n\r\nStarring: Chris J.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"As he showed with Naan Mahaan Alla and Pandiya Naadu, Suseenthiran has a flair for giving us engaging action films that are well within the commercial format and still feel fresh in terms of presentation. Paayum Puli lacks the tautness of Pandiya Naadu, but packs in enough thrills to keep us glued to our seats. Cop films in Tamil cinema generally have no qualms about justifying encounters, turning a blind eye to human rights, and this one, too, is no exception (here, we have the hero saying one can get away with murdering anyone but not a cop!). The film \u2014 despite Suseenthiran denials \u2014 seems to be loosely inspired from the real-life murder of sub-inspector T Alwin Sudhan in 2012. Or, at least, he uses the incident as a jumping-off point for the film's plot.\r\n\r\nAlbert (Harish Uthaman), an idealistic, young cop is murdered for shooting dead the brother of Bhavani, whose gang is behind a series of extortion crimes. His heartbroken parents commit suicide and the other cops decide that they will avenge Albert's death by exterminating Bhavani's entire gang through unofficial encounters. ACP Jayaseelan (Vishal) goes undercover to root out these gangsters. He succeeds in his mission but the crimes continue. And the brain behind the whole thing is lurking close to home!\r\n\r\nAs in last week's release, Thani Oruvan, Paayum Puli, too, involves a cat-and-mouse game between the protagonist and the antagonist but the trouble with this film is that the actual plot is never allowed to move ahead in full steam as the action keeps making way for romance (a perfunctory, cliched one where the heroine, Kajal Aggarwal, is reduced to a cutesy creature \u2014 a muyalkutty, as a song puts it) and comedy (a running gag on Soori getting beaten up by his wife), and the momentum breaks often, especially in the first half. There seems to be a bit of overconfidence (or, is it lack of confidence?) on the part of the director in the way these portions unfold \u2014 a scene involving the murders, followed by comedy followed by romance and a bit of family sentiment. We even get an item number! Imman's songs, despite being catchy and energetic, are bathroom breaks as they don't fit in with the plot.\r\n\r\nIt is only in the second half that we finally get to see the film that the premise promised. As Jayaseelan and his mysterious adversary (whose identity is revealed a little too early to the audience) make their moves, we get some gripping scenes that are as effective as those in Pandiya Naadu \u2014 tense moments where the identity of the villain could be revealed any second, a shootout in the dead of the night, a shocking murder right inside the police station in the hero's presence, father-son emotional drama, the smartness the hero displays in discovering the villain's identity. But the climax is a bit of a let down as Suseenthiran trades a punch-in-the-gut emotional moment for a routine fisticuff.\r\n\r\nThere is a touch of Walter Vetrivel in Paayum Puli, another film that was built around a no-nonsense cop, a cold-hearted brother, a Gandhian figure and a crime wave. What's interesting about this film is that the antagonist comes across as a tragic figure (despite his monstrous deeds) for whom we even feel a tinge of sympathise. He is burdened by his family's legacy, but has been corrupted \u2014 and betrayed \u2014 by politics to such an extent that it is \"arasiyal veri\" that has taken over him. And we sense right away that he is doomed as someone close to him enters the picture every now and then to mess up his carefully laid-out plans. The numerous God's eye view shots in the film are perhaps symbolic of this \u2014 the man from above is watching his actions and checkmating him constantly, and taunting him, 'So you think you can get away with this?' And the casting of Samuthirakani is just perfect (even the other roles are impeccably cast and Vela Ramamoorthy as a father let down and repulsed by his son's deeds is excellent). The actor projects a sense of righteousness in most of his characters and Suseenthiran gives a nice twist to this aspect of him \u2014 an ambitious man who lives in the hope that he can justify his crimes by doing good when comes to power.","id":"55f5605392514103b6000f6a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55f5605392514103b6000f6a","movie_id":340829}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Its when Peter stepped into the Neverland for the first time.\r\n\r\nUsually everyone loved growing up watching the various film adaptations of original work by JM Barrie's a century old creation, 'Peter Pan'. There are plenty of unofficial prequels and sequels were also made and met success. Yet this prequel with high budget and modern technology, but not a Disney film, generated some expectations with stars like Hugh Jackman and Rooney Mara in it.\r\n\r\nThe box office was not as expected, and the movie was also just above average, but I liked the performances and visuals. The story is about an orphan Peter who becomes a Pan, a leader to 'the lost boys'. The opening line goes like this: 'Sometimes friends begin as enemies and enemies as friends' and that's what the rest of the movie evolves.\r\n\r\nI don't think I liked this story. In all the prequels, I loved the Nick Willing's 'Neverland' who is a master of prequels to all the greatest fairytales. I disappointed with this only because of lack of the depth in narration, short storyline and quick scenes, other than that it was not a bad flick to me. The main relief was, it was not like the recent 'Alice in Wonderland' style movie with the weird costumes, makeups and the character physiques.\r\n\r\nDespite all the negative feedback for this flick, I feel it won't hurt for a one time watch. My eye is now on its sequel, because before the Wendy's introduction there's another story is to be told and that is between Peter and Hook. But now it's on doubt over the result of this movie. Anyway, I'm on for it and hope it only gets better than the original.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"5697a80f92514154c90023ee","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5697a80f92514154c90023ee","movie_id":266647}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The things to avoid in an open relationship!**\r\n\r\nA film about an open relationship and one losing it in the way to find himself trapped inside filled with jealousy. Really a great idea, I have seen similar films from the European and Hollywood, but this one had potential to be different and it could not. It is very confusing. Not just for the viewers, seems even the writers did not know how to end the tale after great initiation. Actually, I was not expecting any clever twist towards the end, but this story failed to deliver even a normal ending. So I'm very disappointed with how it finishes it off without proper reasoning.\r\n\r\nThe title was a mislead. You have to wait till the finale to understand it, it was also not that effective. The story was, actually there's nothing, or maybe you can say it's a one liner. When two young people make a deal to keep their relationship open, one could not cope with it after some time together and that brings the mistrust, eventually doubts arise on what kind of affair they are having. At some point it could get ugly, but what stops them, especially the future of them decided in the final segment of the tale.\r\n\r\nSo I kind of liked the first half, the real problem was the following half. I know the film character had confused over something, but why should the filmmaker confuse us as well. Should have detailed that part to come out clear. Though it was different, and still not the best solution for a tale like this. The actors were good, and decently made film, I mean the production, which I think is okay for a watch, yet it is not for everybody. Particularly for having the adult contents, it suits better for the grown ups.\r\n\r\n_4\/10_","id":"581cf2eb925141359f001146","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/581cf2eb925141359f001146","movie_id":336200}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Destination Las Vegas!**\r\n\r\nOne of the worst week for me as most of the of films I've seen were not up to any good. Okay, fine, the first part was decent. I thought a little refresher, somewhat funny too, so on such scenario, anticipating a sequel is common, but this is not what I wanted. After seeing this, I come to realise that the sequel was a bad idea. Seems funny, but no impact. In fact a little boring to see the same old comedy tricks again. Especially mocking a fat man is too offensive at the present era. So the hashtag on body shaming would go viral on social media.\r\n\r\nThey did not get a decent story. Even the film characters, including the villains were too old fashioned. Even this film had made in the 90s, might have not received well too. The concept of going vacation-come-convention, we had seen this before, are not we! Yeah, Paul after his short marriage and losing mother, he and his daughter heads to Las Vegas. Being watchful father and meeting his old friends, the adventure begins, when some criminal activity is going on behind the conference. His plan to save his daughter, as well as thwart the crime are the remaining focus of the film.\r\n\r\nI felt for a character like Paul Blart, casting Raini Rodriguez as his daughter was a little too much intentional. Yeah, the film was full of television guys every corner. Its not just direction, or performance failed, it was the writing. This kind of comedies is now considered ancient, that's why Rowan Atkinson stopped doing his routine comedies. But now it's certain that there won't be a third. If you had seen the first and not sure about this, believe me, you won't miss anything. Instead, I would suggest you to re-watch the original.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I found this to be a quite enjoyable family movie derived from the Peter Pan story we all love. I am not really sure why it holds a fairly mediocre rating on most rating sites. It is undeserved as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nThe movie is a prequel which tells the story of how Peter became Peter Pan. I think the story is fairly well done and allows for both adventure and humor.\r\n\r\nThe characters are pretty good although I found Peter Pan to actually be the weakest of them. Hook and Tiger Lily not to mention Blackbeard stole quite a lot of my attention. Peter Pan is not bad just a little\u2026bland.\r\n\r\nThe movie is darker and more real than other Peter Pan movies. Blackbeard is a rather nasty villain and there are certainly more danger for the good guys in this movie. People do not just get nocked down and come back, they really die.\r\n\r\nThe special effects are not bad. I quite liked the pixie swarms at the end of the movie. Also, unlike what some reviewers state Peter Pan does fly in the movie. I can only assume that those who state that he does not never bothered to see the movie to the end. Do not review a movie if you cannot be bothered to finish it for Christ sake!\r\n\r\nThe movie leaves a bit of a whole between the end of this story and the beginning of the traditional Peter Pan story. What happened to make Peter and Hook become enemies and what is the story between Hook and the crocodile for instance? I certainly would not mind a second movie about that.","id":"58bfc3f3c3a368695900478a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58bfc3f3c3a368695900478a","movie_id":266647}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Every act is fair from their own perspective!\r\n\r\nThe title represents a small town where the story takes place. An opportunity to see the old Kamal Haasan. It was like been ages, seen him in this kind of attire, especially Tirunelveli accent was phenomenal. As usual, his performance and expressions stole the show and none others were matched his par in the movie. Nothing wrong to call it was his show. Kind of addicted to 'Yeya En Kottikkaara' song. A typical Tamil song, if you are, you might feel the deep.\r\n\r\nIt was a remake of the Malayalam movie 'Drishyam', which was inspired by the Japanese novel 'The Devotion of Suspect X'. I have not seen the original movie, but seen the Japanese version based on the same book. There are no major comparisons, except the crime, the rest was completely rewritten to suit the Indian audience. But the writer denies, by saying neither book adaptation nor inspired.\r\n\r\nI have heard that the narration was very emotional and the characters were more guilt feel than the Malayalam. Initially Rajnikath was considered for the main role, but happy it went to Kamal Haasan. None other than him would have suited better to portray Suyambulingam. He would definitely bring the emotions out of you easily. After Sivaji, he's the king of those roles. At the plenty of the scenes I was amazed by his execution, especially in the end scene when he finally breakdown with guilt.\r\n\r\nI don't believe when people say the original version is a must watch. Every film industry in India has fine actors, especially this film recruited their best as of I have heard. So I recommend your native version or the closest one to opt. The advantage in the remakes are, a chance to fix if there were any flaws in the original. Since it was directed by the same filmmaker, I strongly suggest the neural audience to pick between the original and this one, because of the naturalistic portrayal of the rural family. But if you prefer stylish, especially for the non-Indian, there's always Bollywood.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"55f716aec3a3686d0b00b7ab","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55f716aec3a3686d0b00b7ab","movie_id":330421}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"As likened to an innocuous fairy tale rash, the movie mythology surrounding J.M. Barrie\u2019s classical kiddie character \u201cPeter Pan\u201d comes and goes when it pleases. Naturally there have been several big screen interpretations to outlast one\u2019s reserved stash of pixie dust to fling around. From perhaps the best known animated film adaptation of Walt Disney\u2019s nostalgically revered version to the surprisingly big-budgeted Steven Spielberg-directed spectacle dud Hook with a high-caliber cast the legend of \u201cThe Boy That Never Grew Up\u201d seems to spark the challenge of presenting yet another spin on Barrie\u2019s iconic treasured tyke.\r\n\r\nIn director Joe Wright\u2019s sci-fi fantasy action-adventure Pan the familiar factors of Barrie\u2019s magical Boy Wonder are evident and should serve as a mild and manufactured revisit to the \u201cPeter Pan\u201d folklore for children of all ages. However, the whimsical aspect of Pan was dubiously overshadowed, overproduced yet curiously understated in its ability to convey a storytelling moment that did not seem laborious. Consequently, Pan feels mechanical and never quite settles in with any sense of breezy charm or youthful balance of wonderment. Instead, the audience is left wondering about the uniqueness and distinctive approach to an already ubiquitous serving of Barrie\u2019s celebrated literary lad. Despite the vibrant visuals and the given big screen blueprint for \u201cPeter Pan\u2019s\u201d endearing legacy Wright\u2019s toothless tale of flashy action and adventure may just prove to be another proverbial flash in the Pan. \r\n\r\nClearly, there is no rhyme or rhythm to tamper with the built-in concept of what the majestic make-up for \u201cPeter Pan\u201d should be conceived in the minds of generations that were subjected to Barrie\u2019s boundless boy. Still, Wright and Jason Fuchs fail to capture any fresh imagination or intrigue about the puppy dog-eyed youngster\u2019s on-screen by-the-dots adventures. This pumped-up project is pedestrian at best and nothing more than another sparkled rung in the \u201cPeter Pan\u201d ladder of box office hits-and-misses. The casting for Pan is decent enough but the shoddy material they are left to elevate with their included presence is wasted in a stillborn fantasy odyssey that cannot overcome its own creative indifference.\r\n\r\nPan seeks to start out with its own embedded twist by delivering this narrative as a prequel set in 1940\u2019s London. Here, we are introduced to 12-year old Peter (Levi Miller) whose disillusionment continues to spiral while staying at the chaotic Catholic orphanage he was unceremoniously dumped off courtesy of his desperate mother (Amanda Seyfried). Nevertheless, Peter maintains some semblance of hope that his mother will soon return to fetch him and all should solve whatever abandonment issues he has at hand.\r\n\r\nSoon, Peter and his fellow orphanage buddies will succumb to the clutches of Blackbeard the Pirate (Hugh Jackman). Evidently bad boy Blackbeard had been a notorious busy beaver by sadistically kidnapping working class children and shipping them off to his Neverland mines to toil there. However, Blackbeard and his bunch cannot be too bad to tolerate since they welcome out-of-the-blue snappy sing-a-longs to such noteworthy tunes as Nirvana\u2019s \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit\u201d and the Romones\u2019 \u201cBiltzkrieg Bop\u201d. Huh? Of course this impromptu musical sequence is not the only thing that seems curiously out of place in the disjointed Pan. \r\n\r\nOkay...so Hugh Jackman has both a black beard and a black heart in PAN. How about a blackboard to erase this ill-conceived ode to the J.M. Barrie treasured tyke?\r\nOkay\u2026so Hugh Jackman has both a black beard and a black heart in PAN. How about a blackboard to erase this ill-conceived ode to the J.M. Barrie treasured tyke?\r\nIt is not long before the plagued Peter meets and becomes attached to a hustling drifter named James Hook (Garrett Hedlund). Yes folks\u2026it appears that Star Wars comparisons are in order here as Peter\u2019s Luke Skywalker teams with shifty Hook\u2019s Han Solo to defeat the devilish Blackbeard\u2019s Darth Vader. And you might want to ask who is the Princess Leia in this disguised Star Wars premise amid the mines and high seas? Well, in this case Princess Leia is in the form of Pan\u2019s Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara). Thus, the gang assembles together in an attempt to thwart the iron fist of Darth Vader\u2026er, the diabolical Blackbeard. The excitable exploits of the crew coming together to defeat the pesky pirate is meshed together with the flashy flourishes of random 3-D special effects, the vitality of color and scope and playful variations of well-known \u201cPeter Pan\u201d personalities. Hence, all the festive and feisty flexing that Pan demonstrates still cannot compensate for a lackluster execution of Wright\u2019s anemic installment that botches a ready-made backstory for \u201cPeter Pan\u201d enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nAs Peter, Miller shows some solid and impish promise as the boy searching for self-discovery in a bizarre surrounding of despair and disappointment. Jackman\u2019s over-the-top villainous Blackbeard is simply passable but nothing really worth hanging your hat on. Jackman\u2019s plotting pirate will not make anyone dismiss Johnny Depp\u2019s Captain Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies anytime soon. The added elements in supporting players such as Hedlund\u2019s Hook and Mara\u2019s Tiger Lily (not to mention the Lost Boys) feel synthetic and arbitrary\u2013something not very encouraging as these characterizations are essential to the whole \u201cPeter Pan\u201d universe.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Pan one might end up saying never mind to the boisterous yet aimless shenanigans situated in Neverland.\r\n\r\nPan (2015)\r\n\r\nWarner Bros.\r\n\r\n1 hr. 51 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Levi Miller, Hugh Jackman, Garrett Hedlund, Rooney Mara, Amanda Seyfried\r\n\r\nDirected by: Joe Wright\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG\r\n\r\nGenre: Sci-Fi Fantasy and Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n\r\n","id":"561b0975c3a3685101002082","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/561b0975c3a3685101002082","movie_id":266647}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> You can't hold back forever your crush on someone.\r\n\r\nI don't know why it is underrated, probably that's a mistake. Because this is not your usual teen movie, but a different perspective tale and told in a quite exciting way. It was from the director of 'Robot & Frank', it is only his second film and he's now in my watch-out filmmakers list. Both the films were different genre and topic, and I totally loved them. This film was adapted from the book of the same name who wrote 'The Fault in Our Stars'. The film talks about a childhood crush and how long does it takes one to get courage to open his heart.\r\n\r\nQ short for Quentin, when he first time saw the girl named Margo, he has instantly fallen in love with her. But having differences over how to enjoy the life, they had drifted away. Until when the actual story begins in the final year of their high school. So Q finds some clues when Margo disappeared like usual, but this time he considers it seriously and goes after her to reveal his love. What follows is a road adventure and a mini twist in the tale.\r\n\r\nGreat cast, but I think it is the Nat Wolff's best performance as the lead. The supporting roles were not here to just support, but participated beyond the usual. Cara Delevingne was not bad either, but her part was like in and out frequently. So overall it had best set of characters with uniqueness from one another. Which means don't expect a silly teen comedy, it was awesomely designed to impact all generations. So the entertainment is guaranteed.\r\n\r\nIt is not just a romance between two, that is what I was surprised. The narration points out a one love story, but in the end you would end up watching a multiple romances. Something very refreshing and all the lines were very matured, which kind of feels like the real world stuff. I really liked the conclusion, proves why one should watch it. Whatever the others say, I definitely recommend it. A sweeter and a heartwarming teen film.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"57c8b58c92514148de000b8d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c8b58c92514148de000b8d","movie_id":286565}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"After getting too preachy in his previous film, Gouravam, Radhamohan is back with what can be described as his forte \u2014 a light-hearted comedy that feels like a spiritual sequel to his debut film Azhagiya Theeye, even if this one feels slightly watered-down compared to the earlier film. What if the aspiring filmmaker of that film, who was also named Chandran, had become a failure, with his first film a box office flop and the next stalled mid-way? That is what has happened to this film's Chandran (Karunakaran), who considers his next project \u2014 whenever it happens \u2014 will be his \"last bus\". So, when his manager Pandian (Mayilsamy) takes him to Ayya (MS Bhaskar), a big shot in the fishing community who wants to produce a film, he instantly agrees (his sister's impending marriage also forces his hand), even though there is a catch \u2014 Ayya wants him to cast his daughter, Maha (Nandita) as the heroine. Has Chandran bargained for more than what he had asked for?\r\n\r\nThematically, Uppu Karuvadu feels like a Jigarthanda-meets-Kathai Thiraikathai Vasanam Iyakkam (KTVI). As in the former, it is about a filmmaker who makes a compromise with a gangster-figure to make his film, and his exasperation trying to make a non-actor act provides the humour; and like the latter, the scenes are mainly discussions \u2014 that serve as genteel commentary on the film industry \u2014 that the filmmaker and his team have as they try to get a script ready for the film. But in place of the visual stylishness of Jigarthanda and the structural bravado of KTVI, the scenes here play out like a series of comedy sketches, giving it the feel of a stage drama that has been taped on camera. The music (by guitarist Steeve Vatz) is a complete let-down while the images look flat. Interestingly, the cinematographer is Mahesh Muthuswami, who was behind the arresting visuals of Mysskin's earlier films. You could watch this film on the big screen or on your TV or mobile and your experience will be the same.\r\n\r\nBut this has been Radhamohan's approach in his other films as well, and if you have to be less critical, you could qualify it as an understated visual style. And the director, with help from his dialogue writer Pon Parthiban, does make up for it with a constant stream of laughs delivered via gags and one-liners. Some are laugh-out-loud funny (Mayilsamy's mannerism of calling every sound as a good omen), some just about make us break into a smile (Tata Sumo-ku puncture podalam; Titanic kappal-ku unnala puncture poda mudiyuma?) while a few are been-there-done-that (the scenes involving the fake godman who counsels Ayya). And the casting is also spot on. Karunakaran brings the right amount of seriousness to the role while Nandita captures the spoilt child aspect of Maha. Chawms and Narayan as Chandran's associates convey the right amount of cluelessness, while Mayilsamy shows that he could be a fine replacement for Thambi Ramaiah. And the Radhamohan constants, Kumaravel, as a former gangster who ingratiates himself into the story discussions and turns out to be the best contributor, and MS Bhaskar as the big shot with a penchant for poetry, are impressive as ever. The standout is Doubt Senthil, as a naive assistant director who keeps using the wrong similar-sounding English word \u2014 bald for bold, impotent for important, Akila Kurosawa for Akira Kurosawa and so on. In the end, despite the considerable failings, it is these touches that ensure that we leave the theatre with a smile on our face.","id":"566563b0c3a368510c001a70","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/566563b0c3a368510c001a70","movie_id":349197}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"In filmmaker Scott Derrickson\u2019s original \u2018Sinister\u2019, this writer\u2019s critical impressions toward the sub-par psychological yarn was rather blunt if not consistent with the steady diet of formulaic fightfests. The following passage pretty much sums up the cinematic sentiments from the movie\u2019s critique:\r\n\r\n'At best Sinister is a lukewarm twitchy tale that routinely teases the audience with the obligatory guessing game of whether or not the conjured up evil-minded spookiness is imagined\u2026cheapened scare tactics, an ambiguous monstrous myth, transparent characterizations and a mixed bag of a supernatural storyline barely put any Sinister thoughts in our heads worth contemplating.\u2018\r\n\r\nWell, say what you will about the first \u2018Sinister\u2019 outing but it at least had some slight star power in lead Ethan Hawke whose presence was one of the minor pluses in Derrickson\u2019s shoddy shocker. In director Ciaran Foy\u2019s (\u2018The Citadel\u2019) tingling yet generic \u2018Sinister II\u2019, we hardly experience the essence of top-notch horror-induced hedonism. Feverishly flat, the creepily clich\u00e9d \u2018Sinister II\u2019 continues the tedious tradition of assembling sure-fire goose bump moments yet never really fortifying these mentioned moments with any heft of genuine suspense or titillating intelligence. At best, \u2018Sinister II\u2019 skillfully demonstrates its somber shell but horror movies in general, at least ones that strive for sophistication and coherence, should not continuously hide behind the sketchy synthetics of macabre mediocrity.\r\n\r\n'Sinister II\u2019 dutifully shares its symbolic connection with its predecessor. For starters, \u2018Sinister\u2019 alum James Ransone (the deputy from the first film) returns to the perverse playground while being blessed with a lead role in this frightful follow-up. After his dubious dealings with the Oswalt family in the first film\u2019 where he was part of the police force\u2019 the former law enforcer now works as a private investigator in his continued quest to combat that pesky spirit known as the demon Baghuul. Ransone\u2019s ex-deputy is consumed with the shocking murders that took place previously, so it is his mission to eradicate the further Baghuul-instigated mayhem.\r\n\r\nThe newest family involved in the menacing mix consists of an Indiana farmhouse containing a mother named Courtney Collins (Shannyn Sossamon) and her two young sons (real-life brothers Dartanain Sloan and Robert Sloan). Unfortunately, Courtney is battling back and forth with her insufferable and indignant husband (Lea Coco) as her poor boys are caught up in the heated drama. The last thing that Courtney needs is a domestic distraction in the farmhouse that incorporates the spookiness of the Baghuul\u2019s mischievousness. Thus, the hapless deputy-turned-PI must do what it takes to prevent the Baghuul from corrupting the psyches of this vulnerable family unit.\r\n\r\nThe film\u2019s screenplay, written by Scott Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill, plays up to its predictable strengths as the audience is already steeped in the \u2018Sinister\u2019 mindset. Unfortunately, the element of mystery and intrigue is already compromised because \u2018Sinister II\u2019 does not really leave much second guessing for its titillating tension since it already displayed the same kind of copycat gloom-and-doom blueprint as evidenced in the first installment. In echoing the familiar patterns of eerie scare tactics, this sequel merely mirrors the shady shenanigans found in the first showing that was not that innovative the original time around. Sure, the unsettling imagery does have some warranted punch that leaves somewhat of a horrific impact. The grainy and gruesome home film angle showing a family\u2019s hanging is undoubtedly quite affecting but the shock factor is brief and oddly forgettable. One is left wondering if there are enough tingly tricks up Foy\u2019s desperate sleeve to arm \u2018Sinister II\u2019 with more than just drab shadows and twitchy innuendo.\r\n\r\nIndeed, \u2018Sinister II\u2019 is atmospheric and bleak and does a sure fire job of creating a dank and disturbing universe where the percolating peril steadily brims. However, that is the problem with \u2018Sinister II\u2019 as it settles for the surface-base hedonistic haunting without committing to anything morbidly motivating sans the convoluted creepy conventions. Ransone\u2019s bid to expose the imposing beast Baghuul while protecting the fragile welfare of the vulnerable Collins is genuinely a number-by-number plotline that feels stillborn. Even the dastardly Baghuul is stripped of anything particularly mysterious or diabolical for the audience to get on board and become mortified. Resembling a late gray-bluish sandpaper-faced rocker in The Doors\u2019 frontman Jim Morrison with long stringy hair and mod attire, the Baghuul does nothing to really stimulate the gory imagination of \u2018Sinister\u2019s movie-making mythology\r\n\r\nLittle beauty and the rock n' roll attire Beast is something being presented as quite SINISTER. \r\nLittle beauty and the rock n\u2019 roll attire Beast is something being presented as quite SINISTER.\r\nIn the long run, \u2018Sinister II\u2019 sings a spooky song in many ways but arms its tepid tune with the continued cheap thrills and false jump edits that are so annoyingly common in contemporary creepfests. \u2018Sinister\u2019s crime is not so much the calculating presence of a haunt hipster looking to stunt the growth of bewildered housing inhabitants as it is following the pedestrian path of boofests with banal bangs of exhilaration.\r\n\r\nSinister II (2015)\r\n\r\nFocus Features\r\n\r\n1 hr  30 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: James Ransone, Shannyn Sossamon, Dartanain Sloan, Robert Sloan and Lea Coco\r\n\r\nDirected by: Ciaran Foy\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror\/Psychological Thriller\/Supernatural & Suspense\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: * * stars (out of 4 stars)","id":"5622edbb9251413a7400799d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5622edbb9251413a7400799d","movie_id":283445}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> What's the most dangerous? The dark force or the evil father.\r\n\r\nThe first film was good, I enjoyed it, but not scary. So a sequel was expected and it failed to live up to the standards of the original. I would say, it was a decent horror film, with more story and drama than the creepy atmosphere. One character retained from the previous and the core theme remained, but tried a different method of narration. Something like 'Goodnight Mommy' with two brothers and mystery events surrounding them.\r\n\r\nIt definitely lacks what a horror film required the most, and predictable too. But the story wise, it was decent, because the actors did a good job. So it is an average film. I expected a better ending and it did not conclude at its best leaving me disappointing. The way it ended might have been the suitable for the story, but I wasn't impressed. Again, another sequel is most certain, so I think this tale is not over yet and chances are very high that the story would follow with the same cast.\r\n\r\nIt was not a bad flick, but not a follow-up you would have wanted. If you're looking for a genuine horror film, then you should skip it. There's nothing brilliance to appreciate at any level. Overall, I too felt it should have been better in some places. So my advise is if you forget its genre and try to enjoy that you're watching some movie that you don't know its category then surely would have a decent time with it.\r\n\r\n4\/10","id":"5787babbc3a3683929000c19","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5787babbc3a3683929000c19","movie_id":283445}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> What it is like to throw a grand teenager-style party at your 30s?\r\n\r\nDon't assume it's a high school party movie, but the big girls'. That's where everyone's are wrong and expresses their disappointment. For me it was a nice comedy, but not comparable with other great ones. It might won't work on teenagers, but there's no issue for adults with the open mind to enjoy it. A part themed movie for the grown-ups.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'Pitch Perfect' another woman oriented comedy. Both, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were not that funny, hence not a rocking combo, but did not fail either and worked okay on this. They are the sisters with the opposite character. When they visit their childhood home, they decide to throw one final party before handing it over to the new owners.\r\n\r\nJohn Cena's cameo was excellent. In this chick movie he's the only one who gave manly appeal compared with the other men. The story was decent, but most of the movie was a regular party that goes wild. So expecting development of the characters or the story is silly. What I meant was, it is an entertainer, not a biopic or a documentary, so it delivers its purpose.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"56f3ebb49251411a97002a7b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56f3ebb49251411a97002a7b","movie_id":266294}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Inji Iduppazhagi has mostly been in the news for its leading lady Anushka putting on the pounds to play the central character. Unlike their north Indian counterparts, fans in the south, especially in Tamil Nadu, have been more receptive to curvy heroines. But that seems to be changing these days \u2014 blame it on S(l)imran! \u2014 if one were to go by the number of slender leading ladies in Kollywood today (even Hansika, who started out as a chubby actress sports a slim look of late). So, in that sense, it is quite a risky move for a heroine, and Anushka does deserve credit for trying. She plays Soundarya aka Sweety, a cheerful, but overweight, young woman, and looks the part (though there is, at times, a discernible inconsistency in her figure from one scene to the next). Initially, she doesn't seem right for the role, especially when she has to act bubbly (she has always seemed to be a somewhat mature presence), but gradually, wins us over with the earnestness in her sweet-natured performance.\r\n\r\nThat is true of the film as well, to a certain extent. It takes us a while to settle down to its uneven rhythm. The plot revolves around Sweety's inability (or rather her mother's) to find a suitable match, and her falling for the hunky Abhishek (Arya), a documentary filmmaker and one of the prospective grooms who land at her doorstep. Initially, she rejects him, mainly to savour the idea of her rejecting someone for a change, but the two develop a friendly relationship. And just as she starts developing feelings for Abhi, he falls for Simran, a slim-figured social worker, leaving Sweety dejected. Meanwhile, her mother compels her to enroll in Size Zero, the new slimness centre that is the talk of the town. When her friend Jyothi, who's also a Size Zero member, ends up in the hospital, Sweety learns that it is due to the dubious practices that the centre uses to help its clients slim down. With help from Abhi, Sweety starts an awareness campaign, much to the chagrin of Size Zero's owner Satyanand. Does she win in this battle? Does Abhi realize her love for him?\r\n\r\nThe problem with Inji Iduppazhagi is that the script exhibits a split personality and the tone fluctuates between the feel-good and the over-the-top. And for long sections in the second half, the focus shifts from Sweety's journey and the film turns into a fitness commercial (complete with appearances from numerous) film stars. It is a blatant attempt to sell us a 'message' (which should, ideally, have been subtly conveyed in the course of telling the story), and the film spends too much time on this segment. Also, because it has been shot as a bilingual, the film is unable to get the milieu right. The dialogues, while witty in places, feel like they were translated into Tamil from another language, while the line readings by the actors don't feel natural. Given the large number of non-Tamil faces and the fact that even Anushka's voice is dubbed (by Deepa Venkat), there are times when we are unable to shake off the feeling that we are watching a dubbed film. In this sense, it reminds you of Aaha Kalyanam, another Tamil-Telugu bilingual that didn't feel local enough. And in the climax, it falls into a cliche trap of its own making and gives us the umpteenth instance of a well-meaning guy being cruelly dumped at the altar, so that the leads can have their 'happy ending'.\r\n\r\nBut despite these issues, the film manages to be engaging enough. It also gets the feel-good moments right. The fairytale-ish segments (in a nice visual touch, the frames freeze whenever Sweety has a life-changing experience) and the moments that showcase Sweety's cheery and helpful nature are done right, like her emotional dependence on fortune cookie messages to cheer herself and spread love. The senior actors like Urvashi, Prakash Raj and Gollapudi Maruti Rao register in their supporting roles and help us instantly get their characters. And for once, it is refreshing to find the hero gamely playing second fiddle to the heroine. And refreshingly, the film doesn't shy away from portraying him as the object of desire, much like how heroines are typically presented in the other films.","id":"5665645b925141280a001bc5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5665645b925141280a001bc5","movie_id":357708}

Still, the film falls flat on its face more than once.\r\n\r\nThe movie is mostly cringe humor. It's filled with one character or another doing something embarrassing. While this can be done really well if used correctly, Sisters seems to hit everything with the cringe hammer until it cries.\r\n\r\nThis isn't really expected, and neither is the abundant use of bodily and sexual humor. There are some great moments in the movie relating to these, as well.\r\n\r\nThe real issue with the movie is it feels like the writers went at it with a list of \"funny\" situations and tried to fit them all into a loose theme.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> One of the finest movie about the raids on cartel gangs.\r\n\r\nThis was really a great film. Fighting against the drug trafficking was the theme. The story of an FBI agent who was recruited to work in an elite force that no one knows its existence. Their's aim is to tackle the main source, instead to deal with its lower order. Something that impossible to do without international cooperation. Every raid is done in secretively, sometime if required at any cost in whatever effort to stop it. Like I said, this was an awesome movie, and good to see it after the documentary like 'Cartel Land'.\r\n\r\nThe story is kind of hard to detail it out, because it was more an action movie than the talking. How a special force unit goes after the bad guys and stops them is the main plot. But the characters were so distinctive, every main roles had their own agenda for what they are doing and that's how the narration dominated with the high standards.\r\n\r\nThe cast who played them were simply outstanding, including that starts with Emily Blunt, who is someone looks changed the attitude to play physically challenging roles after 'Edge of Tomorrow'. And then Josh Brolin and another one, an upcoming young British actor who I really don't know, but Benicio Del Toro was actually the show stealer.\r\n\r\nHis part was unexpectedly great, totally raw and aggressive. Especially the his end scene, no one could have guessed it, but that's how the way it is.

If it is not something worthy, the movie would have not taken up the shape. It was a very good movie, and a very important historical subject. It has been 100 years since and now the world we live-in is much different and better. I think after thousands of years, now the women got their freedom.\r\n\r\nI thought I knew this story very well, but it was 'Made in Dagenham' which is quite similar to this which is also based on the real. Both the stories take place 50 years apart, but this one was the beginning of a new era for women, not without sacrifices and sufferings.\r\n\r\nGreat actors, great actings, awesome storytelling, cinematography at its best, direction was amazing and the music was so pleasant, but the method of dealing was a bit gruesome, and sometimes brutal. I thought the terrorism is a new word, but this movie gives a different perspective and meaning to that.\r\n\r\nYou would definitely love this film if you respect women. All women cast movie, including the director, but for everyone. It might have begun in the UK, but the entire planet saw a drastic change and still taking place in some places. I don't see any reason why I should not recommend it to you.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"5702917bc3a368569c003c43","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5702917bc3a368569c003c43","movie_id":245168}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A journey from the girlhood to womanhood.\r\n\r\nAn amazing drama about the life, especially it reveals what it would be like being a woman farmer living in the early decade of the twentieth century. The film was adapted from the book of the same name that's dealt with the rural Scottland subject. Even though I'm not familiar with the original material I would say it was one of the best novel-to-screen translation I have seen. The long runtime has never been the issue, but slowly, solidly told tale. My only disappointment is that it was not in the Scottish language since it was about a Scottish family.\r\n\r\nThere were many Scottish dialects that I did not get at first, so I had to google them to know the meaning. But I liked it which reveals the true nature of the local culture. I meant it essential to narrate a tale in the native flavour to enhance the richness in its contents. The story sets in the 1910s that centres on a farm girl named Chris. An epic life journey from the girlhood to womanhood. Under her atrocious father, the film tells how the whole family was living in the fear. After a death in the house, the event slowly begins to tear the family apart, leaving Chris behind to take the ultimate decisions about her future and the family land.\r\n\r\nAnybody would definitely feel bored in the initiation part, because you won't understand the story right away. If you manage to survive in the first half, then you can easily get through in the remaining by liking it a lot. It was nothing like we know the story or we don't, it was simply about the twist and turns of somebody's life just like ours, except it was from a different timeline. Precisely to say the phases of life is what this film is all about. Like shifting the gear in the car, according to the condition of the road and the destination. The joy and sorrow are the part of the life which is sometimes depends on the decision we and around us make.\r\n\r\n> \"You will need to face men for yourself. When the time comes, there's no one can stand and help.\"\r\n\r\nIt was totally an unexpected film, kind of reminded me 'Gone with the Wind' and 'Love Comes Softly'. Focused mainly on a woman, in the men dominated world. It was not just a rural theme, but also sometimes takes us beyond to other topics. Like during the first world war and under the English dominated UK, how the Scots lost the rights and their culture disappeared. No doubt why Scots are asking for their own nation.\r\n\r\nThe romance was another turning point in the story, like raising strong from the fall. After seeing lots of similar changes, I was unable to predict what conclusion may come. But it was strong and intentional with some wonderful dialogues. I loved the beautiful landscapes from the different seasons. It was actually shot in the New Zealand, Scottland and Luxembarough. There's no expansion in the locations, mainly it sets in and around a farmhouse and very occasionally other than these parts.\r\n\r\nThe one in the Chris' shoe was amazing. Like usual, Peter Mullan was fantastic and similarly others as well in their short stay. As the story progress, consequently the film characters reshuffled. Even for us, the main character Chris is like crossing through a juncture from the coming-of-age to self-discovery. Displaying the transformation of Chris from a certain period of time was the film's great achievement. Like how a landscape change from the dawn to dust, this woman's life sees the same fate. That's what the title implies.\r\n\r\nI don't know this British director, but this film opened a new door to me further to check it out his other works. I don't know either that everybody would like it, but it is really one of the wonderful drama of the 2015 and I recommend it to all, especially if there's no problem for you for a long story told in the slow pace. I hope they make films out of the remaining two books as well.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"576d8bdb9251410c20000901","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/576d8bdb9251410c20000901","movie_id":277713}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Deeds, not words.\r\n\r\nIt's a telling point in history, that of the Suffragettes, the militant women's organisations in the early 20th century who, under the banner \"Votes for Women\", fought for the right to vote in public elections. So case in point that any filmic treatments are greatly anticipated - and wanted of course, so here we have Sarah Gavron's film that is written by Abi Morgan and starring Carey Mulligan, Helena Bonham Carter, Brendan Gleeson, Anne-Marie Duff, Ben Whishaw and in cameo Meryl Streep.\r\n\r\nRight off the bat it should be noted on two crucial points, one is that this is merely a story strand involving a group of Suffragette women, this is not all encompassing, something which is emphasised by the fact that Suffragette leader Emeline Pankhurst is only cameoed here by Streep. Secondly it has to be said that this is a condensed narrative for story telling emotional gain in favour of the Suffragettes, their more serious activities for attention are very much played down. So with that in mind anyone interested in the subject are urged to seek out literary sources for story as facts.\r\n\r\nFilthy Panks!\r\n\r\nThe gripping story here dramatizes events that builds to the death of Emily Davison at the 1913 Derby. We are privy to the harsh realities of the life of women in this era (period detail superb), the employment pay structures, the treatment at the hands of the authorities, and the home lives that could result in losing ones child on account of poverty. It's potent stuff and ensures that we at least understand the need for change and fully support the women in their ultimate goal, the arguments put forward viable and just.\r\n\r\nThankfully the makers are not on a one way mission to portray all men as monsters, there's a nice balance between good and bad. The implications of the women's long road to reckoning is given thought, the social distortion possibility hanging in the air alongside economic murkiness. So although the narrative often gets heavy handed in striving for dramatic impact, the point is well and truly made and begs all to delve further into a cause that ultimately needed winning.\r\n\r\nSmall in scale as regards the Suffrage Movement as a whole, but important as an historical pointer and acted with professional assuredness by the cast, this achieves its goals regardless of condensement gripes. 7\/10","id":"5c2c8d6e0e0a2642d63872b3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c2c8d6e0e0a2642d63872b3","movie_id":245168}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Losing that you love makes you realise its value.\r\n\r\nThe only reason to I go to Nick is to watch 'Shaun the Sheep'. This show was watched by many adults as well, a popular one among all the ages. As the fan of this series, we have been waiting very long to get a movie version. I was excited to see it and of course enjoyed it completely. Its impossible one to get disappointed with the movie\/show when the narration is led by one of the awesome characters, Shaun. The promotional posters were also created some extra curiosity that imitated the famous Hollywood films like 'Boyhood', 'Wild', 'Birdman' and many others.\r\n\r\nStop-motion is a very-very hard and outdated concept of the animation format, but still loved by many. Every year only one or two get released, sometimes none. The technical sides were upgraded, including bluescreens for backgrounds and other special effects. Still the hard work remains, but qualities are improved. It made significant contributions to the live-shot movies in the old days when there was no CGI. So when we see a movie like this, the product reveals in each and every frames the real vision from the artist and writer's perspective. Every detail, every corner of the screen tells the story.\r\n\r\nIt was so good as a television show, because of short and sweetness. The filmmaker intended to create the same magic, except the credits its just a below 80 minute movie. Had a good storyline and a couple of new characters were introduced. Because the new adventure extended its area volume and so the antagonist was needed. Shaun and his buddies set foot outside their barn to find their lost farmer. The journey begins towards the big city and the movie discloses their risky and dangerous undertaking. They go pass lots of stages to accomplish their quest and only the last quarter reveals result with a thrilling chase scene.\r\n\r\nUnlike the series, it was not completely a fun movie. There are some emotions involved, and I was amazed by those exhibitions. Because of some kind of childhood connection between Shaun and Co and their owner. That was unexpected, but was really very nice to see the other side of them. We know Shaun is a curious character, he always wants to learn and try new things. So when he has to make an unexpected decision, it does not go as planned and the fun begins with their mischievous adventure in an unfamiliar territory.\r\n\r\nAs usual without the dialogues, that can be understandable by everyone without a language barrier. A true family movie, from grandparents to grandchildren together watchable flick. Almost a masterpiece, offers a lot of great moments to give ourselves to it. And for the fans its a celebration time for sure. Definitely this movie would get into the final shortlist for the upcoming (2016) Oscars, if not, that would be a shame for the entire ceremony. But for winning, we have to wait till how good 'The Good Dinosaur' going to be. In the meantime, don't miss this little cute flick.\r\n\r\n8\u00bd\/10","id":"56043c8092514122ca004f68","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56043c8092514122ca004f68","movie_id":263109}

I probably had the same problem with this film as I had with Minions. It isn't bad idea but it's too much minutes for too little words.\r\n\r\nShaun the Sheep is great idea but much more enjoyable when it's in seven minutes instead of 85. I think that story had too slow tempo for how long it was and I also felt like I already saw it because the story wasn't really original when it comes to it and also gags in this movie weren't really that funny. I think that even 5-years-old are already full of this same kind of jokes.\r\nI personally enjoyed \"emotional part\" of this movie more, than I enjoyed the \"funny part\".\r\n\r\nOn the other hand I really loved animation and soundtrack of this film which was truly briliant and one of the factors why I had energy to finish this movie because without it I wouldn't do that and for me, the last 15 minutes of this movie was the best part. \r\nThe idea was great but they should have worked on it more.","id":"56fe87ee925141286000145d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56fe87ee925141286000145d","movie_id":263109}
{"author":"mattwilde123","content":"'Shaun the Sheep Movie' is the spin-off feature film of a spin-off television series of 'Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousers'. Boasting the same crew that brought us 'Chicken Run' and 'Wallace and Gromit', it promised a lot.\r\n\r\nThe film is made by the Aardman production company and so boasts a pleasant stop-start animation style. This \"old-school\" way of creating a cartoon is refreshing in the modern world of overused computer imagery and 3D effects.\r\n\r\nThere is no dialogue whatsoever in this film and so it feels like watching an old cartoon such as 'Tom and Jerry'. There are subtle nods to other television shows and films such as 'Breaking Bad', 'Hannibal' and 'Taxi Driver' so the parents are kept amused at times.\r\n\r\nThe story is very easy to follow due to the characters very expressive faces and directions which, being a children's film, make it a lot more simple and universal.\r\n\r\nOverall, 'Shaun the Sheep Movie' is a good film for children. It has very cute characters and the animation is very fun. However, it doesn't have much for any other demographic unlike the company's previous work. But, saying that, it is an inoffensive and enjoyable film.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605","id":"58c14f9292514173270099a3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c14f9292514173270099a3","movie_id":263109}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Experiencing what Saul's seeing, hearing and undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe World War II is the largest source supplier for the war movies. I have seen numerous breathtaking braverism, as well as heartbreakingly suffering film characters which are based on the real and sometimes fiction. The genre too differs, from action, adventure, war to the comedy, romance, drama et cetera. Since the Academy Awards nominee announcement in the January I had an eye on this, but now it had won the Oscars that draw my interest even more on this. Anyway, finally saw this, so let me tell you what I feel about it.\r\n\r\nIt is no ones biopic, but inspired by a collection of testimonies of those who had made out alive from the Auschwitz. Like some of the WWII films, it is very unique, that focused on a particular event and a person. Saul is one of the prisoners in the Nazi held concentration camp who is a slave-labour. His job is to clean the place after prisoners were executed. One day he finds a young boy who was executed and soon he takes the responsibility to give him a proper burial. Risking his own life and others, he begins to find a rabbi to perform the last rites. So what happens later and how it ends is the remaining film.\r\n\r\nIt is not only enthralling story, but was very clever and unique filmmaking. In this whole film you will see one face at all the time in different angles and mostly they're close shots. Yes, Saul is everywhere, the camera never takes off its lens out of him. We would experience what he sees, listening and undertaking, more like in the real time. Just like a computer game where everything is from our (player's) angle, but here it is us again barely through the Saul's perspective. (Something like the upcoming Hollywood film 'Hardcore Henry' trailer I saw.)\r\n\r\nAlthough, the movies are not the games, like I felt weird during watching 'Need for Speed', when Aaron Paul was at my place. And a movie always needs a character that can take us to the journey through the time and space where it sets, otherwise it will be called a documentary film. The aspect ratio was like the older day films which is narrow that takes time for us to get used to it, yet it is a colour film. More like the entire story is taking place within the 48 hours. Interesting pace and developments, and a decent conclusion. I think it deserved all the praise and prizes given to it.\r\n\r\n> \"You have forsaken the living for the dead.\"\r\n\r\nI know the seriousness of the film and its contents, but I could not avoid the laugh at the end scene. I did not want to, but I did it without my self-awareness after seeing the Saul's face. I hope, there are others too, like me in that situation. Yet the storyline was very strong, like how far would a man can go knowing the life is meaningless after what he's going through. That makes him to take a solo mission when others are struggling and working together for their freedom.\r\n\r\nSince I don't know any language that spoken in the movie, I had no problem too to follow the movie. The 1944 settings were so realistic, I think everyone's hard-work was this film's result. All the performances were excellent, especially who played the Saul's role. That is the face no one is going to forget who had watched this film. However the real hero of the film was not the actors or the writers and the director, but the cameraman. Like I said earlier, he had done a brilliant job. If anyone wants to praise this film, he\/she must begin with him. The cinematography award at the Oscars might have went to 'The Revenant', but the cameraman award is none other than this guy who shot this film.\r\n\r\nI really liked this film, but not overly sympathised or enjoyed. Usually if any movie that's based on the real gets my favour, even the movie has been low quality with more than ignorable flaws. Because telling the truth to the world is what I consider is foremost important than trying to get benefit out of it. But when it's not factual, I expect whatever the cinematical options can make it a better product.\r\n\r\nThis film comes between them both, but leans mostly on the truth about the World War II prison camp. An insight of what the prisoners have went through. Painful to watch a movie like this, at a time I appreciate the filmmakers for giving this film and let the younger generation know a tiny dot of the incident of the WWII. To watch this film, no one needs a reason. It is automatically a must see, but after watching it, whether you liked it or not is an individual opinion.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"572a046c9251414b850013e3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/572a046c9251414b850013e3","movie_id":336050}
{"author":"Bob","content":"If you are looking for a good thriller, with minimal special effects that calls upon the skills of the filmmaker and cast to make you feel the moment, this is a must see. Southbound, created by the independent group radio silence take the genres of thriller and horror to a new level, intertwining five stories that will have you turning on the lights and questioning the sanity of the cast. All five sequences take place in a nondescript desert town and call upon one's own fear to set the scene. As the story progresses, you see how each story leads into the next with connections that are tangential yet produce the notion that the setting for the stories is the source of danger rather than individual and unique experiences of each player. To this effect, the filmmakers do a superb job of capturing the essence of fear as you follow the lives of the players from story to story as the flow one into the next in an semi-seamless flow that keep the movie going. Of particular joy to this reviewer is, as one would assume (at least this viewer), are minimal special effects. The ones that do exist feel so real that you do not realize that they are there without reflection (or rewinding). \r\n\r\nThe acting, while not Oscar worthy, is well done. You can feel the fear and terror in their dialogue, their actions as they venture through the tale. Shockingly, gratuitous nudity that is usually prevalent in the horror genre is missing or at least so minimal I do not recall a single scene. There are plenty of moments that will stay with you and are sure to be topics around the water cooler. The 'frights' are memorable enough to make this production worth watching.\r\n\r\nThe filmmakers remind this reviewer of early thriller producer\/director M. Night Shyamalan works with their own twist on storytelling. I recommend renting this feature as it s a must see with potential to be a cult classic in years to come.","id":"56feaa2ac3a36821b1003118","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56feaa2ac3a36821b1003118","movie_id":354251}
{"author":"belushi123","content":"The Second World War was one of the most horrifying and unimaginable events that happened in history; so much so, you could almost say it was what real-life horror films are made of. So, why are there not enough horror films that use soldiers and army atrocities to create a unique yet realistic dread in us? Director Mark Nuttall and writer Nigel Horne clearly picked up on this unexploited horror and along with higher beings, the paranormal and a little bit of time warping created the unique Soldiers of the Damned.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s 1944 and a group of German soldiers are sent on an obscure, dangerous and completely undisclosed assignment. Commander of the troops, Major Kurt Fleischer, and his men are to escort Professor Anna Kappel into the ominous forests of Russia to retrieve a precious and ancient relic. When the troops begin to vanish into thin air it becomes apparent that their mission is something far more sinister and the woods are home to worse than the brutal enemy.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s something very compelling about war stories and that becomes even more so when you add a slow burning atmosphere that explodes with a creative idea and lots of blood. Soldiers of the Damned progresses slowly at first but takes the time to build the characters and their relationships up, which is important when there\u2019s the mystery of what the mission really is, who is on what side, who knows what and most vitally what is causing men to disappear and return mutilated.\r\n\r\nGil Darnell (Major Kurt Fleischer) plays the commander exceptionally well, bringing to life his worn down personality from the war and his distrust towards most. Not only this but Darnell looks like George Clooney and sounds exactly like Ross Kemp \u2013 awesome! Alongside is Miriam Cooke (Professor Anna Kapell) who brought to life the perfect balance between being sweet to deceive the troops and then turning into an absolute insane bitch.\r\n\r\nSoldiers of the Damned was bound to have a high number of deaths due to it being the war and all, but there was just the right combination of harsh but typical shooting kills with an unrestrained amount of gruesome and inventive ones by whatever lurks. The effects were done incredibly well, although my only qualm would be that I thought the tank scene could have been a little subtler. Regardless of that, I loved watching the Germans painfully combust and have bullets unconventionally put in their brains.\r\n\r\nNothing will be revealed about the twist of this film because I genuinely want you to see it for yourself. The plot turned unexpectedly catching me off guard with what really dwelled in the forest \u2013 it\u2019s fresh and something I\u2019ve never seen used before. This British indie film is perfect if you\u2019re looking for something a little different and love both the horror and war genres. Soldiers of the Damned is truly a clever, distinctive, bloody and enthralling film, which I highly recommend.\r\n\r\nReviewed by Zo\u00eb Rose Smith","id":"55987013c3a3684baa00097b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55987013c3a3684baa00097b","movie_id":345287}

{"author":"jann","content":"This is some sort of Christian Bigfoot movie. Not something you see every day, I know. It's about a rural family in the late 1960s who have a Bigfoot on their property. The father is determined to defend the homestead, the mother wants to move, and the younger of the two sons wants to make friends with the furry guy. Eventually it becomes clear that either the Bigfoot or the family has to go.  \r\n\r\nThe plot is not bad. The creature itself looks surprisingly good, and the movie does a good job of showing you enough of it throughout but saving its face for the last few minutes.The dialogue, for the most part, is not bad.\r\n\r\nBut there is one, terrible problem with this movie: The acting. Every single actor - and I use that term loosely - in the cast is positively dreadful. I don't know who these people are or where they came from, but you would probably find more acting talent in your local high school drama club than among this cast. \r\n\r\nThe production values aren't bad. Nothing is really bad about this movie, except the acting, which is so bad I can only give the film 1-1\/2 stars. It gets an astonishing amount of very high reviews and ratings, which are usually followed by accusations of those reviews having been paid for. If you like Bigfoot movies, or Christian movies, or are just curious to see any movie that has a peculiar mix of 1 star and 10 star reviews, then see this. Otherwise - don't.","id":"589aa3a9c3a3683aa3002d80","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/589aa3a9c3a3683aa3002d80","movie_id":407300}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"I can handle the rules, man, I'll handle the rules.\r\n\r\nUltimately this is just another one of those sports movies about someone who went off the rails due to tragedy, but came back to make the audience cheer. There is absolutely nothing new here, every clich\u00e9 is adhered to, every chance to tug the heart strings is prominent, while the finale is as obvious as any one who watches sports movies will expect. But these things don't make it a bad film.\r\n\r\nIt's very well mounted by the makers, expertly performed by the principal actors, and, well, there's often a time when you need a rousing pick-me-up movie. The camera work and choreography is high grade, while director Antoine Fuqua is able to keep a realistic feel to the drama throughout. It is what it is, a very well made boxing movie, it's just not champion in story, just merely a contender. 7\/10","id":"5737a0f8c3a3682ae900066b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5737a0f8c3a3682ae900066b","movie_id":307081}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"There are some movies that try to be different but fail to be so because the people behind it do not have the know-how of filmmaking. And, Soan Papdi belongs in this category \u2014 films that start out as passion projects but finally end up as something resembling vanity projects on account how badly they are made.\r\n\r\nThe long-drawn out plot (the film is a test of patience even while clocking less than two hours) involves Shiva, a computer engineer, who gets engaged to Aarthy. Their romance and 'dating' happen, rather refreshingly, in the traditional way \u2014 it is a match fixed by their parents and refreshingly, each finds the other attractive. We are introduced to Shiva's friends, each with his own quirks \u2014 one is a married man, another is an unemployed graduate who will only accept a job in the US and the third is a javelin thrower who has a real shot at being selected for the Olympics. One day, Shiva and Aarthy, who have gone shopping with these friends, return to their car only to find a little boy inside. He says his name is Sahil but doesn't seem to know the way home. Meanwhile, a mysterious caller tells Shiva that he has kidnapped his friends and if he wished to see them alive, he should bring Sahil to him. What does the boy have to do with gangsters?\r\n\r\nThis might seem like a decent plot on paper, but an air of amateurishness pervades Soan Papdi that it is hard for us to not mind the poor writing or the ineffectual filmmaking. The storytelling is naive (the romantic portions are so cringe-worthy) and there are some ridiculous twists (let's just say no one in India would go to the extent of kidnapping and fraud for what we are told is the reason behind the crimes) that provide unintended laughs. When Shiva and Aarthy find Sahil, they do not contemplate the prospect of taking him to a police station like sensible people and instead take him out shopping, order pizzas and chase him around a swimming pool. This, even after they realize that the boy is not sure of the address to his house! Then, once the gangster calls, Shiva just walks into his den along with his lover, whom he doesn't even think could become collateral damage. And we get one of the most incompetent gang of kidnappers, who just leave their place unguarded and do not even confiscate the keys of the people they have kidnapped allowing them to easily get away from the place.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of instances that indicate that some thought has gone into the project \u2014 like, when we are told the reason for Shiva being late during an earlier scene or when his computer education comes in handy to solve the crime and save his friend. We can see that there is sincerity in the attempt but then, is that alone enough?","id":"559769fcc3a36855d4000b1d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/559769fcc3a36855d4000b1d","movie_id":340311}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The A list actors in a B movie, is the latest trend.\r\n\r\nA bunch of great actors with their very good performances, but the story was merely okay, even though somewhat it was an enjoyable flick. 'Two Rabbits' was a good Brasilian thriller, this is from the same director and his Hollywood debut which is not a spellbinding. I expected a lot after knowing it was his film, it did not disappoint me either, but for the Hollywood standards this was a let down. If it would have been a Portuguese film, then no one would have complained much.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed to be a sequel to David Fincher's 'Seven', but failed to fuse both the stories. So then it became an independent narration. The title should have been 'Premonition', but there's already a movie with that name. Like I said the story was kind of a mix of other films. The theme was a too much intelligence, so it needed the clever writers for its screenplay. I only say it was a missed opportunity to turn the product like 'Law Abiding Citizen'.\r\n\r\nFor a concept like this, the scenes were too ordinary and the end has been just alright. The best thing about this was the entertainment it offered, no matter if you feel deja-vu of watching this film, you won't get bored. Top actors, but I still consider it a good quality B movie than an average quality A list movie.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"57028c61c3a36856a500332e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57028c61c3a36856a500332e","movie_id":339527}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The neverending tale(s)!**\r\n\r\nFive tales, written and directed by four directors. It was a horror anthology that takes place in just one day and night. Firstly, this film was not bad as it looks. Each tale and its interlocking with one another was very nicely done. The layers are not arranged in a column or a row or a circle. It was just like what you see on the poster, a star. Especially one character from each tale, how they become a victim in another was the highlight. The genre mixing was so good, I mean it was not out and out a horror. Mystery, thriller, crime, all was put together and presented smartly on the screen, particularly the loop was very fascinating.\r\n\r\nI have seen some similar kind, but this one was slightly different from those and a better one in some way. Not all the tales were awesome, though there's nothing wrong with them. For every 15 minutes, it keeps developing without giving rest to us and events in the film. So it was a non-stop entertainment, particularly if you like horror, thriller. If you pay close attention, you could find more hidden meanings or messages. So this film can be watched once, but not everyone going to enjoy it. Especially if you are okay with B movie, then there's nothing stops you.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"5844693d925141676400c770","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5844693d925141676400c770","movie_id":354251}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> I enjoyed it because it reminded me my childhood.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of movies related to the video games. The 80s movie 'Tron' was one of those first I have seen, followed by many. But the recent one 'Wreck-it Ralph' was the game changer in the modern animation\/CGI which led to another similar flick, 'The Lego Movie'. Lego and 'Toy Story' are the toys, not the video games, but very close to this theme and I'm very happy that Hollywood made this film for the guys like me who grew up playing them.\r\n\r\nThe film had a very simple story with the great visuals. Sometimes simple is very good rather going for hi-tech. Especially those who played these games in their middle-age back in the 80s could be now very old and they might suffer to understand the film due to the technology\/terms\/phrase gap, if it matched to the todays hi-tech hi-resolution video games. But the youngsters of the present era didn't understand that who are the backbone of any movie's success and that's why this movie sunk in the ocean of criticism.\r\n\r\nMy childhood and teenage was the late 90s and early 00s respectively, So 8bit games are on the edge of revolution. My favourites were the races and brick games, especially 'Duck Hunt', because I get a gun, not joystick. So this movie really brought me those sweet memories. A decade ago I used those unique sounds and music for message alerts in my 2G mobile phone(s).\r\n\r\nI know recently Sandler had hit the rock bottom in his acting career, but, he's kind of lifted after the decent film 'The Cobbler' and excellent multistarrer 'Men, Women & Children'. This is not a massive comeback to what he's known for, comedies. But, sailing on average or above in better than falling downward in the career graph. To me this film was a better one, an above average, obviously not a masterpiece.\r\n\r\nGuest appearances were unexpected, but was not that effective, except Ashley Benson, who was so hot in her 2-3 odd minutes. This film is not for everyone. Youngsters and oldsters never understand it. If you were born in the 70s and 80s, then probably you will know what to expect. Even it does not deliver to your expectation, definitely gives satisfaction for bringing those lost memories of our childhood.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"563a4a91925141439c002d62","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/563a4a91925141439c002d62","movie_id":257344}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Nostalgia can be something to revisit as a decent form of escapism from one\u2019s current worries. It feels so refreshing to turn back the hands of time and recall all the wonderful memories and perks of our younger days and, what is not to consider about the days gone by when reminiscing about certain trends in music, fashion, entertainment or past relationships? For this particular theme regarding director Chris Columbus\u2019s tepid comedy \u2018Pixels\u2019, the focus pays homage to the old school pastime of video games. Sure, \u2018Pixels\u2019 tries to recapture the glory days of 80s video game mania and wrap it into an off-kilter disaster comedy that awkwardly borrows heavily from another 80s iconic big screen laugher we affectionately recognize as \u2018Ghostbusters\u2019. Instead, the clunky \u2018Pixels\u2019 is nothing more than an updated poor man\u2019s version of the aforementioned \u2018Ghostbusters\u2019 with little distinctive spark or  imagination to accompany the empty zaniness. This latest lame and recycled Adam Sandler-led vehicle should come with the familiar message that is flashed at every conclusion of a video game: Game Over!\r\n\r\nEvery formulaic bone in the body of \u2018Pixels\u2019 is fragile because the movie really does not strive for anything sensational outside of its ambitious special effects wizardly. One can somewhat appreciate the few outlandish moments that garner a chuckle here and there but for the most part \u2018Pixels\u2019 suffers from transparent character developments that take a backseat to the incidental mayhem that persists.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that \u2018Pixels\u2019 is one of the few Sandler-branded films that one could actually stomach without resorting to the usual eye-rolling exasperation. Still, that is not saying very much nor is this what one might call a glowing endorsement neither. Screenwriters Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling manage to adequately stuff enough throwback reminders to the heyday of 80s-era frivolity regarding video game fever and the baby-boomers (and strangely enough youngsters and young adults) will probably relish the reminiscent goofiness of the period. The need to mesh the sentimental fixation of video games with the reliable foundation of disaster flicks that still reign supreme in today\u2019s popcorn cinema scene is challenging yet \u2018Pixels\u2019 just does not have the convincing giddy-minded gumption to pull off such a free-wheeling stunt.\r\n\r\nAs many may proudly admit their hours-long odyssey into video arcades where brain cells were bombarded by exceptional gaming skills, we come across a selection of a former (and some may even say current) \u2018nerd herd\u2019 of gifted gamers that were resourceful back in the day when their fierce video game acumen was something not to mess with at all. Leading the pack of players that were previously involved in the 1982 World Videogame Championship competition is Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), a slacker that has done nothing productive with his adult life since the notable achievement of being a runner-up at the WVC competition as a child. The champ, whose title was earned at Sam\u2019s expense, is Eddie \u2018The Fire Blaster\u2019 Plant (Peter Dinklage). Rounding out the trio is game-playing expert and conspiracy-seeking ace Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad). Oh yeah\u2026let\u2019s not forget their mutual friend Will Cooper (Sandler\u2019s comedy best buddy Kevin James) who just happens to be the President of the United States. How convenient, huh?\r\n\r\nWell, the expertise of the video-playing \u2018fearsome threesome\u2019 will come into being handy when a misinterpreted recording of a video game competition recovered in space by perturbed aliens sets off the threatening agenda for these space invaders to conquer the arrogant earthlings. After all, the taped recording ruffled the feathers of the aliens so the planet Earth needs to be challenged for the rights to claim planetary property. So the question remains: can the uninspired electronics-installing Sam, the cocky-minded Eddie and paranoid puss Ludlow defend our world and use their gaming prowess to outwit, outplay and outlast the aliens as a high stakes game is proposed for ownership of the planet?\r\n\r\nSome may dismiss \u2018Pixels\u2019 as a serviceable, quirky comedy that has a unique spirit onto its own. It does have its inserted nuttiness at various spurts. However, the overall presentation feels utterly choppy and the whole premise about these past gaming misfits returning to their childhood glory to rescue mankind through their glorified hobby comes off as manufactured, clumsy-minded campiness. There is nothing about \u2018Pixels\u2019 that screams originality besides being a faceless \u2018Ghostbusters\u2019 knock-off but with familiar video game branding (the gigantic Pac Man-eating creature comes to mind as he tries to swallow the entire metropolitan region). This frenzy-minded fable seems strained for canned laughs.\r\n\r\nSandler, although not as nearly obnoxious and grating on the nerves as he is in some of his other monotonous vehicles, seems to be sleep-walking in his role as the redemptive Sam looking for that second chance to come out as victorious to undermine his otherwise mundane existence. The breath-taking Michelle Monaghan, playing Sam\u2019s shapely military protocol pop tart of a girlfriend Violet van Patten, is on hand to remind us that even labelled \u2018losers\u2019 that like to push gaming buttons on a console can get the last laugh in coming out feeling lucky. Monaghan\u2019s Violet being Sam\u2019s glamorous galpal and James\u2019s Cooper as Sam\u2019s Commander-in-Chief pal is probably the most outlandish and funny element about \u2018Pixels\u2019 to legitimately digest at this point. Gad is a mixed bag as the oafish Ludlow often opining for his indifferent pixel princess Lady Lisa (Ashley Benson). Dinklage steals the show as Eddie, a diminutive dynamo that is big on showy confidence within his small frame.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that the insanely amusing Bill Murray and his crew of ghost-busting goof-offs need not to lose any sleep over over the perfunctory put-on that is Sandler and company in the slight and forgettable silliness of \u2018Pixels\u2019. One might want to save their roll of quarters and wash a load of dirty laundry as opposed to playing a do-or-die game of \u2018Donkey Kong\u2019 with these video game vagabonds.\r\n\r\nPixels (2015)\r\n\r\nSony Pictures\r\n\r\n1 hr. 45 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Adam Sandler, Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad, Kevin James, Brian Cox, Matt Linz and Sean Bean\r\n\r\nDirected by: Chris Columbus\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy\/Fantasy\/Video Game Action & Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s Rating: * 1\/2 stars (out of 4 stars)","id":"561a102c9251415d3100163b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/561a102c9251415d3100163b","movie_id":257344}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"There are times when you exit a movie happy with the thought that it could have been worse. And that is how Savaale Samaali is. It is a comedy with a few jokes that make us laugh out loud, some that make us smile, some that make us cringe and quite a few that do nothing. It isn't a bad film but director Sathyashiva (who earlier made the gloomy Kazhugoo) never realizes the full potential that the premise promises.\r\n\r\nThe plot revolves around Karthik, who gets a job at a TV channel that no one watches. He is attracted towards his sister's friend Divya and tries to impress her with the help of his colleague Billa, but she doesn't reciprocate his love. Meanwhile, the debt-ridden channel's boss tries to commits suicide and requests Karthik and Billa to find a way to get the channel to the top position. The duo hit upon the idea of uniting lovers facing parental opposition through a reality show, but they fake the whole thing with koothu actors. Meanwhile, Divya asks Karthik to help unite a real couple whose fathers are powerful politicians.\r\n\r\nLike India Pakistan earlier this year, Savaale Samaali is a film that doesn't aim much. It wants the viewer to have a few laughs and leave the hall. There is farce but it is rather tame and never cutting-edge. The filmmaking can at best be described TV serial-like with shots cutting back and forth between whichever character is mouthing the dialogues. The writing is formulaic. We get a few oddball characters (a beer-guzzling grandmother, a boss scared of his employees), a mandatory romantic track (about the hero in love with his sister's friend), a TASMAC song (that initially tries to be different by blaming men and finally succumbing to misogyny), an ill-fitting moralizing scene (about the value of Koothu) and a climax where the confusion reaches its peak.\r\n\r\nWhat makes it work to an extent is that it keeps trying to make us laugh and throws all sorts of jokes, which either hit their mark or miss it by a mile. But the actors are earnest. Ashok Selvan's geniality nicely complements the the motormouth Jagan, and there is real chemistry in this pairing. And towards the end, we get a bunch of veterans like Nasser, Oorvasi, MS Bhaskar and Mano Bala who gamely try to be as silly as their characters demand.","id":"55f5602f9251413cab00022d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55f5602f9251413cab00022d","movie_id":330405}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Sakalakala Vallavan, like its namesake \u2014 the 1982 Kamal Haasan-starrer \u2014 is about a villager who tames a city girl. But while that film, despite its outdated and sexist outlook, managed to be entertaining, this one is exasperating from start to finish. Sakthi (Jayam Ravi), the son of a local politician, falls in love with Anjali (an overweight, scantily-dressed Anjali), the moraponnu of Chinnabuthi (Soori, trying to imitate Vadivelu from Winner but simply not possessing the body language to make the role funny), who is constantly at loggerheads with him. But circumstances force Sakthi to marry Divya (a tired-looking Trisha), a city girl, because his father (Prabhu) asks him to. However, all that Divya wants from him is a divorce.\r\n\r\nThis is a formulaic plot, yes, but what makes it intolerable is how lazily everything is done here. The film wants to be a comedy and it thinks that you can make anything funny if you can gives the audiences a scene that is a reference of an already popular scene. So, we get an endless stream of movie references (from Mouna Ragam to SIngam) in the way of dialogues, character names and background music. It also tries to show that it is self-aware by telling us every time the characters are about to break out into a song, but instead of being cute, this only reiterates the staleness of the formula. Even the stunt choreography is cliched \u2014 a shot of a bus blown up, the fighters falling onto the various props, hero clenching his fist and so on.\r\n\r\nAnd if there is no reference to trot out, it turns horribly sexist \u2014 making fun of domestic abuse (slapping the wife as a means of keeping her under the husband's control), domestic rape (the hero is so enraged that the heroine doesn't want to sleep with him, that he tells he will rape her), molestation (the hero falling on top of heroines portrayed as romance)... Well, you get the drift.\r\n\r\nThen, there is the inconsistent characterization \u2014 a modern girl, who calls herself \"independent\", agrees to marry a guy whom she isn't interested in without raising even the merest hint of disapproval, a father who has forced his son to marry a girl he isn't in love with tells the couple they should make their own decisions, a guy who does everything to make his father stand tall helping an opponent win (and make his dad lose)... There is also the final act, which is sponsored by so many advertisers but has really nothing to engage us and still continues to go on and on even after the climax is over.\r\n\r\nSakalakala Vallavan is so abominable \u2014 a blot in the career of everyone involved in making it \u2014 that it makes us question its very existence and how it even came to be made. If you could classify it under a genre, this would be the 'What were they even thinking' movie. After sitting through the two-and-a-half interminable hours, it is the only question that we want an answer for from the people behind it. What was the director thinking when he came up with this 'script'? What were the producers thinking when they decided to fund this? What were the actors thinking when they signed on for this? In fact, we even begin to question ourselves \u2014 what was I even thinking to have decided to see this?","id":"55e025b792514177d9001e2d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55e025b792514177d9001e2d","movie_id":327915}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Ah, star kids! They definitely have it easy or so you might think until you have seen this film, the debut of Shanmugapandian, the son of Vijayakant. The lad, who seems to be an amiable chap, definitely has put in efforts when it comes to the stunt scenes, which have been the hallmark of his dad. It's true not all star kids start emoting like pros right in their first film, but at least, we could see that they were ready to take the plunge. But in Shanmugapandian's case, what those who are launching him have forgotten is that it requires a capable director to make an actor out of someone. Take the case of some of the successful star kids \u2014 if Vijay had a director in his own father SA Chandrasekaran, Suriya and Karthi had Vasanth and Ameer respectively, while Prabu Solomon and M Rajesh guided Vikram Prabhu and Udhayanidhi Stalin. And, even though his Kadal didn't create waves at the box office, Gautham Karthik's talent has never been questioned because of Mani Ratnam. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, for Shanmugapandian, Sagaptham's director Surendran is the film's weakest link. The story that Surendran tells is dated by at least 20 years while things like plot, logic and craft are invisible. Things just happen. Like the hero becoming a hotshot detective within days of arrival in Malaysia. Like the heroines breaking into a song and fighting over the hero after a single phone call. Like the inevitable cameo by Vijayakant coming up without any proper lead-in (and, sadly, confirming the veteran's acting days are clearly over). \r\n\r\nThat is not to say the others are good. Both the heroines are plain terrible when it comes to emotions and their lip-sync non-existent. When the film begins, we get a rider stating that since major portions of the film takes place in Malaysia, the characters are shown as talking in Tamil. Maybe, they should have included the heroines somewhere in it as well. The supporting cast, which includes dependable names like Ranjith, Devayani, Suresh and Thalaivasal Vijay, are given roles that are mainly there to prop up the hero. And, the poor youngster is made to utter punch dialogues that want to keep reminding us that he is a chip of the old block (Mannipu enga parambaraikke pidikkadha vaarthai). But then, we see his baby face, and realize this is just too soon and all that we feel is pity. Ah, poor star kids!","id":"55976bcc9251413da6000bb3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55976bcc9251413da6000bb3","movie_id":329589}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Sathuran has an interesting storyline that, like Yennai Arindhaal and Kaaki Sattai earlier this year, revolves around a medical cover-up. The protoganist is Dheena, a happy-go-lucky auto driver. He is honest and expects others to be so; he falls in love at first sight, and doggedly pursues the girl despite her clearly telling him that she doesn't want anything to do with him; he also protects girls who are harassed by cops; and, he fights back when he is pushed to a corner. In short, someone with all the qualities that we see in a commercial film hero.\r\n\r\nHe unwittingly takes on two hitmen as his passengers and becomes the prime suspect following a couple of murders (one of the victims is his friend), one night. Even as he is shocked by this, he learns that his father and his lover might be the killers' next targets and races to save them. But first, he has to escape from the arrogant cop stands in his way.\r\n\r\nSathuran is able to generate thrills and suspense thanks to its pulpy plot, but the film doesn't soar as you expect it to. It is weighted down by a protracted set-up that serves mainly as a build-up for its hero. Given that the character is an auto driver, we get a mandatory song about auto drivers (the director is an erstwhile assistant of Suresh Krissna and these portions feel like a tribute to his guru's Baasha). We get a romantic track that involves a running gag about the hero ending up below the heroine's legs and looking up at her. It isn't as crude as it sounds, but it isn't amusing either. And all the actors seem to act an an exaggerated pitch. Even Kaali Venkat, who underplays in his other films, overacts. But the worst is Raju Eswaran, who plays the cop character; he is so over-the-top that he never feels realistic.\r\n\r\nThankfully, once the plot kicks into the gear (around the time the killers come to Chennai), it holds our attention to an extent. But if only had the execution been better, we would have been treated to a thrilling genre film. For now, we will have to be content with the night-time cinematography by Monik Kumar (who has worked as an assistant in Slumdog Millionaire), who shows Chennai in a different light and is a major plus for the film.","id":"561d0bf2c3a3682253003b3b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/561d0bf2c3a3682253003b3b","movie_id":363183}

Such is the case with San Andreas. In essence this is a remake of Roland Emmerich's 2012, only this is the shorter version with the time span that 2012 should have had. This does exactly what the marketing department promised it would, namely lots of crash bang and wallop, but just like Emmerich's behemoth it gets boring entering the final third, the writing just not good enough to hold interest once the noise and destruction dies down before the big finale arrives. Suspense is absent, emotional investment in characters is null and void, while there are no worthwhile surprises in store. But on the plus side Johnson is a likable guy and he carries us through till the end of what is a fun movie if expectation levels are appropriately set at dumb popcorn fodder. 6\/10","id":"564840899251413ae1006405","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/564840899251413ae1006405","movie_id":254128}

Meanwhile, Thirumalai ( Samuthirakani), the new inspector to the place, tries to catch him but Sarveswaran proves too good for him. However, Thirumalai's friend Surya (Sarath Kumar), an undercover police officer, decides to take him on and put an end to his menace.\r\n\r\nSandamarutham shares some similarities with last week's release Anegan, and this week's Tamizhukku En 1-Ai Azhuthavum. As with the latter film, here too, a terrorist conspiracy is what drives the plot forward. And, like Anegan, it has a plot that is pretty preposterous. Interestingly, both films have been co-written by writers who are who are known for their crime thrillers \u2014 if it was SuBa in the former, here, it is Rajeshkumar. And, here too, various concepts are thrown around \u2014 silastic gel, shadow wing cops, silicone fishes, a mystery chemical that is a MacGuffin, plastic surgery, terror plot to bomb 101 cities, The Mahbharata's Chakravyuham and so on. But, while Anegan used these elements to cook up a pulpy thriller, this one takes a more conventional approach where the plot is largely in service of its star.\r\n\r\nSo, we have buildups for both Sarveswaran and Surya. The former is termed as stronger than the Ramayana's Vaali, and he is motivated only by money. He wants to be showered with \"Dollar mazhai\". His game of wits against the straight arrow Thirumalai is one of the highlights in the film. Surya, on the other hand, is more of a conventional hero \u2014 a daring cop, a caring son, a loving fiancee and a concerned friend. But, Sarath Kumar, with his sincerity, makes us buy this character. He's also effective as the antagonist though there are times when he goes over-the-top, maybe trying to do a Rajinikanth (from Endhiran). The climactic fight when the two characters go mano a mano is a showcase for the star, who, for an actor in his 60, seems super fit.\r\n\r\nSandamarutham would have worked better as a lean and mean action thriller but the director, A Venkatesh, also doesn't want to lose out on the \"family audience\", and so we get prolonged scenes involving Surya's family. He also uses Surya's family to emotionally manipulate us \u2014 at one stage, Sarveswaran, who holds the cop's family members hostage, lays out all their mobile phones on a table and starts shooting the persons whose phones Surya calls. We are supposed to care and shed a tear but given that these characters aren't made endearing, we hardly bother.","id":"5502fd259251413d9f00498c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5502fd259251413d9f00498c","movie_id":280090}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is a classical Hollywood movie, thin plot and a lot of effects. However, this time, I quite liked it. Actually I liked it a lot. The plot, although thin, is not altogether bad, it holds together even though are quite a few unbelievable moments. However, put in the context of a traditional disaster movie, it is not bad.. Maybe this is what I like about the movie. It is really a good old fashioned disaster movie.\r\n\r\nWhen I first read the blurb about this movie I was afraid that it was going to be a big apocalypse at the beginning and then it was going to be a \u201cslow\u201d search for Ray\u2019s daughter. It is nothing of the kind. It has a decent build up of suspense up to quite a few more or less spectacular earth quake scenes \u2026 and then it continues. I was pretty happy that there was a decent build up from the start but I was even more happy that the initial earth wrecking event was actually not the big event.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote at the beginning, the plot is pretty thin. The special effects are not however. At least, I liked them. Not surprisingly houses a are falling over like there was no tomorrow (which for a lot of people there are not) but it is done quite well. I also liked the scenes where the earth wobbles when Ray and his wife flies over it in his chopper. I found that quite cool. There are a few moments that are, well let us say not too well thought through. For instance the classical collapsing building that collapses in the just the right pace for the heroes to do there job. The we have when Ray and his wife speeds through the waters of Los Angeles after the quake, which are riddled with trash. The amount of trash in the water would have rendered their propeller useless after a few hundred meters. But then, I think I am too much of an engineer now.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Ray\u2019s wife. That was one of the things I really did not like with the movie. Maybe the movie directors and actors in Hollywood are so used to divorcing all the time that they think it is a \u201cstandard\u201d plot element and do not think twice about it but for us other \u201cordinary\u201d people it is a tragedy (especially people outside of the US apparently if one should go by the trash that is spewed out from Hollywood all the time) and I really do not want to watch that crap all the time in movies and TV-shows! I was actually tempted to downgrade the movie at last a star, even two, for that crap but what the heck, it is a good movie and I do like \u201cThe Rock\u201d.\r\n\r\nSo after, after that little outburst, I have to say that I this one was a really enjoyable movie. One of the few lately that I have watched. It is a quite good, classical, disaster movie with a good build up, really good effects and a good and happy ending (for the main characters at last) and I am a sucker for happy endings.","id":"5af431b60e0a263961009b06","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5af431b60e0a263961009b06","movie_id":254128}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"There are films whose twists in the script make them unpredictable and interesting and there are films that have one twist too many and end up exasperating us. Yaagavarayinum Naa Kaakka (YNK) belongs in the latter category. The film begins in the past \u2014 January 1, 2015, to be specific \u2014 with a grieviously injured young woman and man being dragged across the floor by a mystery person. We do not see the faces of all three characters. Then, the film cuts to the present where Saga (Aadhi) lands up in Mumbai. His face shows wounds and in the voice-over, he tells us that he is on a dangerous mission. We see him buying a gun and going after Mudaliar (Mithun Chakraborty, acquiting himself well in his first appearance in Tamil films), a feared gangster. We think that this is going to be a Gajini-style revenge saga but then, Saga stars telling us how he ended up in this situation.\r\n\r\nWe see his three friends \u2014 Shiva, Rajesh and Kishore \u2014 all of whom are from rich and powerful families. Saga's is a middleclass household and he is often scolded by his father and pampered by his mother. There is also Kayal (Nikki Galrani), the intrepid young girl who loves Saga. Everything is going smoothly until New Year's night, when one of his friends starts harassing Priya (Richa Pallod), a girl out on a date in a hotel. The cops do not take action because the boys' families are highly-placed but what no one realizes who Priya is. She is the daughter of the powerful Mudaliar and vows to have them murdered in the next 24 hours. And then, she goes missing and his friends have all gone into hiding. Thus, Saga becomes a target of Priya's brother Guna. Now, Saga must use every amount of courage to save himself and his friends. \r\n\r\nUp until its final twist, YNK is a competently made action drama and debutant director Sathya Prabhas manages to keep us guessing on what will happen next. He gives us an involving plot, relatable characters, a romantic track that even when it feels implausible and over-long remains cute and brings a smile, and a mystery to keep us hooked. Yes, too much of screen time is wasted on this set-up and the plot essentially kicks in only in the second half, but we do not feel bored in these segments. And the manner in which the conflict arises is also interesting \u2014 it is the hero's friends and the hero himself who are at fault and invite trouble upon themselves, so we don't exactly root for them.\r\n\r\nThe unnecessary twist in the end, however, completely undoes everything that was good until then. From a gangster drama, the film turns into a psycho killer movie and just when we think the end is in sight, it becomes a mindless splatterfest that is funny for all the wrong reasons. The attempt to glorify friendship at all cost feels pathetic and when we see Saga willing to lay down his life for his friends, the foremost question on our minds is why he doesn't even half as much for his own family, whom he had put in terrible danger. Talk about being so near and yet so far.","id":"559768d89251413da6000b5b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/559768d89251413da6000b5b","movie_id":264049}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"For director Vishnu Vardhan, Yatchan is, in a way, a return to his small-scale roots. There is a whiff of the cheerfulness we saw in his breakthrough hit Arindhum Ariyamalum, though this film finds it hard to seamlessly balance the tone, swinging from serious to seriously spoofy in a matter of minutes. The plot, based on a serialized story of writers Suba, is pure pulp \u2014 there's the menace of murder, the glamour of movies, comedy and even ESP.\r\n\r\nThe film begins with a back story for one of the heroines. Shwetha is struck by lighting in her childhood, which gives her the ability to see \"paranormal experiences of visuals beyond time\". It then intercuts with the stories of the two heroes. Chinna is a small-time gangster in Thoothukudi, while Karthikeyan is a wannabe actor in Pazhani. Circumstances force them to land in Chennai. Karthi manages to be selected as the star for a movie while Chinna is hired for a \"low-budget killing\" of Shwetha, who has realized through her 'power' that Vetri, a bigshot and an aspiring politician, has murdered his brother. However, a mix-up results in the two heroes finding themselves in the wrong place. With the hit screwed up, Vetri is now after Karthi and Chinna as well.\r\n\r\nYatchan's failing is that despite moments that click, it fails to come together as a whole. The wildness of the tone makes it hard for us to take things seriously or care for the characters. The film spends too much time setting up the moment when the heroes switch places and lacks a sense of urgency that such films need. The ESP angle doesn't really add anything to the film. We would have believed even if we had been told that it was just instinct that made Shwetha smell something fishy about Vetri. And Vishnu Vardhan has made a poor casting decision by going for Adil Hussain who looks completely unconvincing and uncomfortable as Vetri. Where we need menace, we see only fake moustache and poor lip sync. This is why even the climactic twist, involving another switch, doesn't have the impact that it should have.\r\n\r\nThat said, Yatchan is never boring even though it is not film that could be recommended as essential viewing. And it is technically terrific. The interesting frames and the colour schemes that cinematographer Om Prakash uses ensure that the visuals are arresting. He is complemented by composer Yuvan Shankar Raja who pitches in with a buoyant score and boisterous songs. The film oozes cool and we find it difficult to take our eyes off the screen even when the scene isn't emotionally involving. Also, the lighter scenes mostly work. Krishna gets the perfect role for his exaggerated acting style and the actor is a lively presence here. His scenes with Swathi are cheeky and fresh. And RJ Balaji pitches in with a scene-stealing performance with a character which starts out as a mere add-on but later becomes one of the highlights of the film.","id":"55f560709251415ca00012b6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55f560709251415ca00012b6","movie_id":280140}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"There is a wonderful screwball vibe to Vellaiya Irukiravan Poi Solla Maatan (VIPSM), a black comedy that is a confident debut by Abanindran. The director manages to keep things relatable and even when things get out of hand for the hapless protagonist, they do not feel improbable. It all starts going wrong for Karthik (Praveen Kumar, who looks like Bollywood actor Rajkummar Rao in certain angles) when he borrows money from a moneylender at a high interest. He has returned with his wife a kid to India from the US, where he had only recently landed a job, to look after his ailing father (Jayaprakash), a widower. But when the doctors tell him that his father needs surgery, he decides to borrow cash instead of selling off their land as his father wishes to give it to his grandkid. He hopes to repay the amount in three months but his father's condition worsens and he spends the cash to foot his medical expenses.\r\n\r\nBut, when the moneylender starts to intimidate Karthik, he, with the help of his friend Mani (a superb Balasaravanan), hatches a plan to anonymously blackmail his ex, Pooja (Shalini), who is the daughter of a rich businessman. However, Pooja doesn't have any money with her, and so, she approaches Karthik (not knowing that he is the one blackmailing her) to blackmail her husband Raghu (Karthik Kumar), a rich doctor. Raghu, in turn, blackmails a politician, who begins to blackmail a top cop, and soon, things spiral out of control and this game of blackmail reaches Periyavar (an ill-fitting Naren), a kingmaker in Delhi. Smelling something fishy, Periyavar goes after the links in the chain one by one and ultimately, that leads him to Karthik. Can the youngster save his skin and escape the wrath of Periyavar?\r\n\r\nThe best stretch in VIPSM is when Karthik's blackmail scheme starts turning into something much bigger. It is weird, it is funny, and it is also very much believable. And we get to see some interesting characters \u2014 like Mani's friend Thiruvengadam, a courier guy and a reformed petty criminal and the eccentric Varma and Sharma (TM Karthik and Five Star Krishna), two middle-men who make a living out by acting as conduits for the black money of the rich and powerful. We are so engaged with what's happening on screen that we even don't realise it when Karthik goes off screen for most parts of this segment.\r\n\r\nThe emotional beats also hit us hard and they are earned and do not feel manipulative. Karthik's relationship with his father is refreshingly portrayed in a low-key manner and we understand why he would go to such lengths for his dad (\"I panicked,\" he explains to a character and we totally believe that). And the film, like Paayum Puli a few months ago, shows that even people whom we consider to be rich might be having financial problems. The romance between Pooja and Karthik and their break-up is communicated to us in short but effective flashbacks. The resolutions are a bit simplistic but given how it was simple acts in the earlier sections of the film that snowballed into a problem of mammoth proportions, they seem acceptable.\r\n\r\nIt is only in the final few minutes that the film derails as the film mutates into something straight out of a discarded masala movie script. Unnecessarily, it starts projecting Karthik as a hero, and when he challenges Periyavar, it rings false. Even the emotional beats get louder, and the father-son sentiment stars to feel like an overdose. These certainly bring the film down by a notch or two but the assuredness of the filmmaking until then (there are rough edges considering that this is a first-time effort) helps us tide over these niggles.","id":"568366bfc3a36860e9016372","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/568366bfc3a36860e9016372","movie_id":369684}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The cops versus a corporate house.\r\n\r\nThe Korean cop-thieves films are quite extraordinary and I had seen plenty of them. This is based on kind of similar theme. Instead the gang here it is a cop who face-off a millionaire. This is not completely a serious action-crime, but a bit of fun too, that was well written and directed by 'The Berlin File' filmmaker. The film was a huge hit in the domestic market, but I felt the runtime was slightly a lengthy with some few boring parts. Overall, the film was entertaining, that reached close to my expectation.\r\n\r\nBefore coming to the main story, the film tells a couple of quick crime solving events in its first act. It was the story of an honest, but a tough police officer when it comes to the crimes and criminals. That's how he ends up on one of the greatest case he has ever taken in the hand. Though, it all begins when one of the truck drivers was badly injured after protesting over his termination from the job without the pay. That brings a young wealthy businessman into the frame for the head-to-head clash between him and the cops. In the end who wins, the corporate house with their financial power and political influence or the limbless police force is the remaining.\r\n\r\nThe opening was so hilarious, I thought I had to prepare for the laugh riot, but then the middle parts failed to keep the same intensity. Precisely to say there's nothing much happened, not the interesting stuffs. That is where the audience has to watch out, because this is not one hundred per cent comedy. But somehow the story kept moving in a right direction, especially the clash between the cops and corporate, at least in a draggy pace. When the final act commenced, I felt the previous developments came in handy to set the stage for a great finish.\r\n\r\n> \"I told you to stay out of trouble.\"\r\n\r\nQuite refreshing from the regular cop films. I did not anticipate the amusing characters like this, not from the cops. Only the cops, but the character sets from the opposite were inverted like 'the masks of comedy and tragedy'. The whole cop team, including the chief was so funny. There are loads of small scale jokes that brighten up our mood. But like I said, once the narration approaches the midway, especially after a business tycoon was introduced, all the fun parts were beginning to fade away. That's the reminder for the commencement of the other facet of the story.\r\n\r\nSo the film takes the us to the vital segment of the narration where the intensified confrontation takes place. But only the twist spells even more interest in us about the tale's ending. Nothing any breathtaking secrets revealed, yet absolutely best and smart turnaround. The struggling police force against their rival was brilliantly told. In reality, I don't think things can happen like that, but for a movie, it was fun as well as thrilling with some awesome stunt sequences.\r\n\r\nThe actors too showed their potential. I think it is a good film to remake, but there are few areas to improve like overall pace of the film. When the film started, it took me around half an hour to get used to everything about the film. From the characters to the situations they are in, it needs a serious attention from us, but the other side the length of the film is a worrisome. I enjoyed watching it, so no doubt it was a good film, but should have been even better than that.\r\n\r\nI would say it missed an opportunity to be one of a fine cop film. Not because of the attachment of the comedies, but separating and randomising them from the other heavy events makes it an inconsistent to keep up the same momentum throughout, especially like during facing the bad guys. If you watch the film's ending you will understand what I meant.\r\n\r\nSo these kind of flaws are minors, that comes under the screenplay's error when the scenes in the story failed to flow in a same flat surface. That's what I felt, yet I know I'm not an expert in that field, but I have experience watching films like that. So I won't complain the overall film, surely I can recommend it for those who like cop story. Though the one thing you have to keep in your mind is that it is not a serious recital, but something like seeing a film Jackie Chan in a cop avatar.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"573763bbc3a36805ab000d09","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/573763bbc3a36805ab000d09","movie_id":346646}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Vedalam begins with a police operation in Italy. The assignment is to nab Rahul (Rahul Dev), an international don, but the officer in charge of the operation realizes at the last moment that his target has tables the tables on him. As he is about to die, he says there will come a guy even better than him to take him down. To this, Rahul replies that a it will take a really bad man to even come close to him.\r\n\r\nCut to Kolkata. Enter Ganesh (Ajith), who has arrived in the city with his sister Tamizh (Lakshmi Menon). They are moving to the city for her studies. Ganesh becomes a cabbie and his soft demeanour endears him to everyone. Meanwhile, he informs about a suspect to the cops, and the gangster, Aniket (Aniket Chouhan), who is Rahul's brother, wants his head. He is nabbed and taken to the Aniket's yacht. And that is when Ganesh shows his Viswaroopam! Everyone is decimated, and that lays a trap to Aniket's brothers \u2014 Rahul and Abhinay (Kabir Singh). Who is Ganesh for real and what is his enmity with these criminals?\r\n\r\nIf you have seen Siva's previous films \u2014 Siruthai and Veeram \u2014 you will have a fair idea of what to expect in Vedalam. He is beginning to make a career out of films that are extremely loud and incredibly gratuitous, and his filmmaking style mainly involves ramped up camera moves, frenzied cuts, and over-the-top acting with an ear-splittingly loud background score for company. He is like the student who manages to pass despite his handwriting being an illegible scribble. And he stays true to this style in Vedalam, which, surprisingly, works... somewhat!\r\n\r\nThe main reason for this is a flashback episode that is familiar but still manages to strike a chord. There is something affecting about the concept of compassion changing the heart of a mercenary gangster. It is a done-to-death trope but Siva makes it convincing by not overdoing the emotional drama in this segment. He also capitalizes on the brother-sister sentiment, but refreshingly, the scenes between Ajith and Lakshmi Menon feel like understated melodrama when compared to the tone of the rest of the film. The romantic track is, thankfully, (almost) non-existent, while the comedy track, anchored by Soori who tries desperately to make us laugh \u2014 and fails, is juvenile. The absence of Santhanam, who made these portions in Siva's previous films enjoyable, is clearly felt.\r\n\r\nBut then, the other characters, including the heroine and the villains, in such a film exist mainly for one purpose \u2014 the veneration of the hero and for this, the director uses the formula of both MGR and Rajinikanth. Ganesh is a do-gooder like the former and we get the supporting characters exalting his qualities (Ivan azhinju poganum-nu nenaikaravan kooda ivana admire pannama irukka mudiyathu). And taking a cue from the latter, the hero is proud and keen to project a bad guy image (Nee kettavan, naan kaedu kettavan). As he did in Vaali and Villain, Ajith puts his shtick of instantly changing expressions to good use to send fans into frenzy, though he is made to laugh like a crazy person doing the stunt scenes. There is a passing resemblance to Baasha (a seemingly innocent man with a violent past) but fans of the Rajinikanth film can rest easy as this is not a complete rehash of the film as rumours had suggested. At least for that, we have to be thankful to Siva.","id":"5643f4c09251410a53003d5c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5643f4c09251410a53003d5c","movie_id":362150}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Horror comedies are the trend today but Pa Vijhay, making his directorial debut, has tried to gives us a horror film overloaded with sentiments. The plot is a very familiar one, of a 'good' ghost that wants to take revenge. As is the formula in these kinds of films, where we \u2014 like the hero \u2014 are expected to be scared of the spirit initially, the first half chugs along with ominous shots, forbidding music cues and jump scares. There is Vikram Chand, a rich man, who flees the country after he learns that he is the target of the ghost. The action then cuts to Saravanan (Pa Vijhay), an ordinary taxi driver, who is approached by Milovina (Avani Modi) and her father D'Souza (Joe Malloori), who are researching the paranormal. We get to spout some mystic mumbo jumbo (Sample: Ghosts will try to get in touch with the last person they laid their eyes on before their death).\r\n\r\nAnd then, in the second half, we get the answer to the 'why?'. We find out how Vikram is responsible for the death of Anu, a student in his school, and the emotional trauma of her parents (Samuthirakani and Devayani). We are preached about how private schools are cash-grabbing, heartless institutions which do not care for the safety of their students (complete with examples of the Kumbakonam fire tragedy and the death of a schoolboy in the swimming pool among others). And after every amount of sentiment has been milked for, the film finally decides to show us how the villain gets his retribution (a bit about a butterfly is the only novelty here).\r\n\r\nStrawberry could have been mildly engaging if only it had released some five years ago. Given the amount of horror films that Tamil movie audiences have been exposed to during this period, the film feels utterly redundant. The filmmaking, too, isn't interesting, and depends on done-to-death cliches \u2014 moody skies, pouring rain, tacky visual effects and high-pitched music, supported by bland performances. Then, there are also unnecessary songs and comedy sequences (one involving Mayilsamy is plain irritating). The film tries to make up for all these deficiencies by taking the moral high ground and coming down hard on an easy target \u2014 the private educational institutions. The best thing one say about it is that there is a basic level of competence with which the whole thing has been put up and that gives us a reason to sit through the whole thing.","id":"55f5609ac3a3686d07006102","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55f5609ac3a3686d07006102","movie_id":359122}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is a pretty classical horror movie. If you are a fan of these kind of movies I would say that it is worth watching. If your are not into these kind of movies you are probably going to find it \u2026 not so good.\n\nThe story is obviously somewhat ludicrous. It is the usual nonsense about someone using chemical waste. In this case mixed up with fertilizer in the garden which causes wasps to mutate into some kind of Alien-like species that invades peoples bodies after being stung and spawns mutant, giant killer wasps.\n\nEven if the story is somewhat ludicrous the movie is somewhat entertaining though. I especially like the fact that it is not the usual, nonsensical, teenage group goes partying with a lot of drugs kind of crap. The main characters here are actually somewhat intelligent.\n\nThere are also a few characters that are quite likable, unlike in the standard Hollywood fare in this genre. I did quite like the old geezer that, almost, managed to make it to the end.\n\nThe special effects are somewhat mediocre, at least when the wasps are shown in their entirety. There are a few gory effects but really nothing to write home about.\n\nSome things were rather silly though and the silliness accelerated towards the end. The giant burning wasp was rather over the top. The end? Well, I expected the usual it-is-not-over kind of ending (it is a horror movie after all) but the flying things at the end was really moving the movie into comedy land.\n\nStill a somewhat entertaining horror \/ comedy movie and I have to say that I liked this movie more than a few of the \u201chorror\u201d movies, with a lot higher budget, that has come out of Hollywood lately, mostly due to the characters not being totally stupid.","id":"5a9f812d925141580c00c50d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a9f812d925141580c00c50d","movie_id":254472}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"So where were you when the Science Fiction cinema sensation \u2018Star Wars\u2019 took shape and captured the imagination of the massive global moviegoers\u2019 escapist expectations back in 1977? Regardless of whether you existed thirty-eight years ago or not, the legend of George Lucas\u2019 highly-heralded SF blockbuster that shattered box office records worldwide was automatically engrained in your cinematic psyche. Now nearly four decades later, the motion picture phenomenon that took place in \u2018a galaxy a long time ago\u2026far, far away\u2019 has come to expand its entertaining promise and prominence even after numerous servings of movie sequels, television specials and other fanfare attributes that promoted the \u2018Star Wars\u2019 agenda throughout the countless years.\r\n\r\nThe modern-day arrival of yet another \u2018Star Wars\u2019 edition in the millennium movie-making age of technical and tactical brilliance is quite fitting and filmmaker J.J. Abrams is the right choice to helm this sacred film franchise and present a whole new litany of continuing adventurous narratives for a new generation of \u2018Star Wars\u2019 personalities dipping their tenacious toes into \u2018the force of goodness\u2019 battling \u2018the dark side\u2019 of authoritative evil.\r\n\r\nIn Abrams\u2019s reboot \u2018Star Wars: The Force Awakens\u2019, the anticipation of enhancing and enlightening the reputation and respect of the Lucas landscape of stormtroopers, light sabres and of course the iconic \u2018Star Wars\u2019 returnees from the treasured trio of Harrison Ford (Han Solo)\/Carrie Fisher (Leia) and Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) registers with a nostalgic blast of appreciation and exhilaration. \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 is a sheer big screen celebration of majestic impishness and intrigue that will fortify the hunger of both casual and rabid \u2018Star Wars\u2019 fanatics. Indeed, the hype is warranted and Abrams, the mastermind of the big-budget movie sequelitis, is in top form as he triumphantly presents \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 on a prized silver platter designed for its surging golden moments of charged ebullience.\r\n\r\nIn looking at the numbers game that is connected to the overall \u2018Star Wars\u2019 universe, it is hard to believe that the last prequel was released just a decade ago. Furthermore, it is mind-boggling that the aforementioned \u2018Star Wars\u2019 \u2018royalty\u2019 in Ford, Fisher and Hamill have shared the same space on film for the first time in over three decades since they last were featured in a \u2018Star Wars\u2019 movie together. Nevertheless, no one can deny that \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 does not take the challenge in combining the remembrance of the \u2018Star Wars\u2019 installments of yesteryear with the fresh brand of current upstarts willing to engage in another boisterous saga that begins a whole chapter of compelling wonderment. The mix of veterans and novices in \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 is quite interesting but the familiarity of the storytelling heft of good vs. evil is always a solid sell in the realm of the \u2018Star Wars\u2019 utopia.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 not only serves as a bridge that crosses both boundaries past and present in \u2018Star Wars\u2019 folklore but it taps into the masterful mystique that Lucas and company worked so diligently to showcase so historically some thirty-eight years ago. Still, some may have lobbied for a stronger storyline in \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 as they may gently dismiss it as being merely thin in its premise while viewing it primarily as a launching pad to develop yet another series of movies to create the \u2018Star Wars\u2019 juggernaut for this current-day climax of warped speed wizardry. For those that want a basic outline of \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 pulse it is as such where the beloved yet aging tandem of standouts Han Solo and Chewbacca (yes, good old hulking and walking hairball Chewie is back) is helping out heroic new bloods\u2019 Rey and Finn (played by Daisy Ridley and John Boyega)\u2019 in an effort to groom them for combating the emergence of Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a villainous representative from the Dark Side of the Force.  \r\n\r\nBasically, \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 is a grand and stirring homage to the prolific Science Fiction\/space fantasy that dared to soar its ambitious wings while taking the old-fashioned concept of the good guys sparring with the bad guys and spinning a whimsical web of dark imperialism while searching for the intrinsic value of brotherhood. One cannot imagine the vitality of \u2018Star Wars\u2019 without the inclusion of notable and favorite characterizations that were instrumental in inviting a ravenous response to this filming phenom that has existed in your pop cultural lives for too many years to recount. In addition to joining top dogs in Ford\u2019s Han Solo, Hamill\u2019s Luke Skywalker, Fisher\u2019s General Leia Organa (the former Princess Leia to all you old school \u2018Star Wars\u2019 enthusiasts out there) and Peter Mayhew\u2019s Chewbacca, there is the welcomed presence of C3-PO (Anthony Daniels) as well. As for C3-PO\u2019s newest sidekick BB-8, a mechanical rolling ball robot, he is the R2-D2 replacement that should easily win the heart of the kiddies looking for a cute contraption of a companion to treasure on the spot. It should be pointed out that \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 is set 30 years from the last installment and thankfully this update has not lost a magical step since that time.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, the First Order\u2019s solar system mechanism needs to be destroyed and must be eradicated by the young talents in spunky and pretty Rey (think the athletic female version of Luke Skywalker) as she teams up with former stormtrooper Finn, a warrior with an uncharacteristic compassion for not killing any designated weak soul as instructed. Naturally, this duo (while under the tutelage of the mature and ragged-looking Han Solo) has their hands full as they clash with the nefarious General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson from \u2018Brooklyn\u2019) and his Special Forces prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Kylo Ren that strikes an immediate comparison to \u2018Star Wars\u2019 most notorious bad boy in the deliciously ruthless Darth Vader.\r\n\r\nDaisy Ridley's Rey and John Boyega's Finn are having a blast as the touted twosome out to save the day in J.J. Abram's celebrated STAR WARS reboot THE FORCE AWAKENS\r\nDaisy Ridley\u2019s Rey and John Boyega\u2019s Finn are having a blast as the touted twosome out to save the day in J.J. Abram\u2019s celebrated STAR WARS reboot THE FORCE AWAKENS\r\nThankfully, the majority of the audience may recall similar elements in \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 that was touched upon in \u2018Star Wars\u2019 editions such as \u2018A New Hope\u2019 and \u2018Return Of The Jedi\u2019 where the same structure and theme of the plot points are somewhat revisited. As charming and stimulating as \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 appears in its glorious presentation of being a beautifully shot and visually vibrant popcorn piece, the real find in Abrams\u2019 spectacular space-aged spectacle is Ridley\u2019s heroine Rey, whose emotional and physical commitment to this futuristic fable feels grounded in genuine suspense and praise. Ridley has legitimate game and carries this hot and heavy galactic actioner on her sturdy shoulders with the overwhelming pressure of headlining a cinema giant looking the re-enter the consciousness of rabid \u2018Star Wars\u2019 aficionados everywhere. Clearly, we are invested in Ridley\u2019s Rey whose feistiness never undercuts her feminine convictions or courageousness. She runs circles around her male co-stars in fellow \u2018Star Wars\u2019 newbies Boyega\/Finn and Driver\/Kylo Ren and her sense of empowerment is what drives the authentic Force behind Abrams\u2019 inherited \u2018Star Wars\u2019 workload.\r\n\r\n\u2018Star Wars: The Force Awakens\u2019 gleefully ignites the flashy flames of giddiness that we all associate with George Lucas\u2019 indomitable big screen creation. The signature flourishes from composure John Williams\u2019 commanding musical score to the stunning and innovative technical tweaking to the mixture of the old and new guard in front of the camera all make for an eventful and exciting return to the universal staging for a movie-making moment that will stand the test of time, the immense pop cultural movement at the movies known as \u2018Star Wars\u2019.\r\n\r\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens (2015)\r\n\r\nLucasfilms\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 15 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Harrison Ford, Daisy Ridley, Carrie Fisher, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, Peter Mayhew, Domhnall Gleeson, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Andy Serkis, Gwendoline Christie, Kenny Baker, Anthony Daniels  and Max von Sydow\r\n\r\nDirected and Co-Written by: J.J.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Pretty impressive narration, a better version out there for now.\r\n\r\nUS film or UK film is not an issue, but the real question was the second movie required? Plenty of films are made in a short period of gap about the same person like 'Infamous' and 'Capote', themes like 'Olympus Has Fallen' and 'White House Down', and sometimes remakes like 'Deaths at a Funeral' from other film industries. So the history says audience accepts only they are different from each other and so this film was, but very very sad it bombed at the box office.\r\n\r\nLike everybody I was not interested in this, even though it was from a renowned filmmaker. But after watching it now, I felt I was terribly wrong. Actually, this is the best version so far about the Apple Inc co-founder Steve Jobs. It was entirely a different narration than the previous one, everything was like the backstage drama that takes place before every product launch. That means most of the film was shot in the auditoriums and its corridor, parking lot, rooftop, and other surround places.\r\n\r\nAll the affairs like family, friends, co-founders, business, troubles et cetera are brought into one place and dealt there itself. Surely a very cleverly written screenplay and display by the actors, especially the two Oscars nominee Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslate. Once again Danny Boyle proved his directional skill with this beautiful biopic. I did not LIKE the end scene, but LOVED it. In fact, this film's end and Ashton Kutcher film's opening scenes has a clean follow. I also felt the movie was very honest, but I don't how much since I'm not into the books to learn about the famous personalities. It's not a must see, but definitely worth a try.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"56cdeb1f92514152ab0000d8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56cdeb1f92514152ab0000d8","movie_id":321697}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Slumber Earthquake.\r\n\r\nThere really is no point trying to do an in depth review of this, it falls in line with a number of series blockbusters that are guaranteed to garner rabid responses, pro and con. \r\n\r\nThe Force Awakens is a film of many flaws, it has a pungent whiff of safeness about it, the charges of it being a glitzy remake are fair enough, while certain plot strands are frustrating and set to be big talking points for years - and years - to come.\r\n\r\nYet what about its worth to someone who is not obsessed with every finer detail? Someone who just loves the Star Wars universe as a spectacle prism of entertainment, and has just wanted a Star Wars film worthy of being fit to sit alongside that original trilogy?\r\n\r\nThis made me feel 11 again, took me back to a time in 1977 when I queued for three hours to see such wonders on the big screen. The Force Awakens is, in spite of the recognised flaws, a loving homage to a past love. It's sly with humour and nods to foundations, a blitzkrieg of effects and sound work (my Blu-ray viewing had my sub-woofer doing a jitterbug in the lounge), and it doesn't shy from surprise or the dangling of the carrot.\r\n\r\nThe makers have big heart and technical invention, the cast vibrant, spunky and strongly committed to the cause - the old hands a very reassuring presence - Yeah, so it's not sci-fi perfection, or any Star Wars geeks' idea of the perfect Star Wars movie (oh J.J. Abrams you devil you!), but it made this middle aged guy shed a tear of happiness. A moment to reaffirm why - as a young lad - I fell in love with film in the first place. 9\/10","id":"571db465c3a3683de2000122","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/571db465c3a3683de2000122","movie_id":140607}

Well ever really. I liked the blend of new and old material, but I hope that moving forward, the series relies more on the new. I don't mean ditch all the original characters, I just mean we don't need endless callbacks to the past in Episode VIII. It worked fine for this one, and I totally get needing to re-acclimatise audiences, so I'm absolutely understanding of it in this case.

{"author":"Bulletproof5FDP","content":"**The Force Awakens: A New Hope 2.0**\r\n\r\nThe highly-anticipated follow-up to the Original Trilogy treads through familiar waters, taking the \"safe route\" approach. Though The Force Awakens has its fair share of phenomenal moments and is definitely an improvement over the Prequel Trilogy, its reliance on using the Original Trilogy (mainly A New Hope) as a template feels nothing more than an imitation of events that occurred prior.\r\n\r\nAt the end of Return of the Jedi, the Empire suffered a great loss, with the destruction of the Second Death Star and deaths of The Emperor and Darth Vader. It was implied that Luke, the last surviving Jedi, would restart a New Jedi Order (based on Expanded Universe media, which has been declared non-canon by Disney). That is indeed what happens; however, a rogue student of Luke's slaughtered his peers, seduced by the mysterious Supreme Leader Snoke of the First Order and adopts a new identity as Kylo Ren. In summary, the Jedi Order did indeed happen (off-screen), but gets wiped out (off-screen, again), leaving Luke the last surviving Jedi and retreats into exile (off-screen... seeing a pattern?). The Empire is basically resurrected as the First Order, with the Rebel Alliance becoming the Resistance, and once again, they're tasked with destroying a gigantic ball of death. Sounds an awful lot like A New Hope, as a modern-day \"soft reboot.\" \r\n\r\nDroid carrying top-secret info? Check.\r\nVillain dressed in black with mask? Check.\r\nProtagonist lives on desert planet? Check.\r\nDiscover that they're indeed Force-sensitive? Check.\r\nHan Solo and Chewbacca escorting our heroes to destination? Check.\r\nA cantina featuring a cantina band? Check.\r\nMentor figure (Obi-Wan in ANH, Han Solo in TFA) killed by villain? Check.\r\nBattle of Death Star (Yes, I'm calling Starkiller Base a Death Star)? Check.\r\nDoes big ball of death get destroyed? Check.\r\n\r\nRey is indeed a Force-sensitive individual, but throughout the movie, she is just as good a pilot as Han Solo, is able to use a Jedi mind trick with ease, and easily overcomes the villain (Though it could be argued that due to Kylo Ren's injury from Chewbacca, he was weakened). There better be a damn good explanation as to why Rey is so strong with the Force when The Last Jedi is released. Anakin and Luke required training to become a Jedi, Rey is basically a pro with little to absolutely no training.\r\n\r\nFinn... Though I did enjoy the idea of a Stormtrooper defecting from the First Order and eventually helping out the heroes, Finn got annoying quick. From cringe-worthy lines to his constant \"Gotta get away from the First Order\" state of mind, he should have been a more battle-hardened individual who eventually became disillusioned with the First Order. His more cowardly approach to defecting wasn't very well-executed. But I gotta admit that the relationship between him and Poe Dameron was well-done. Didn't feel forced, just felt natural. Him standing up to Kylo Ren in a duel made me respect his character a lot more. His battle with the other Stormtrooper was just amazing. I'm honestly hoping his character develops more in The Last Jedi.\r\n\r\nI liked Poe Dameron from the get-go. From being a smart-ass to Kylo Ren to taking out multiple TIE Fighters, Poe is definitely a welcome new character to the Star Wars universe. Especially BB-8, just an absolute ball of cuteness. BB-8 was one of the two new characters that really stood out to me. Funny how Star Wars manages to make you like the droids so much.\r\n\r\nHan Solo and Chewbacca play a substantial role in this film. Han Solo's death was beyond tragic, just seeing an iconic character we saw develop from a selfish, Force-denying individual to taking charge in dire times (putting his life on the line). Once Han Solo yelled out his son's name, I knew his time was up. Leia, now a General, doesn't really get much time to shine. She and Han have been broken up for some time now (I'm guessing since Ben Solo became Kylo Ren), but their bantering still remains. C-3PO (now with a red arm) and R2D2 (in low power mode due to Luke's departure) are basically given minimal roles in favor of BB-8. Luke Skywalker made an appearance in the very final moments of the movie, but does not utter a word. Just seeing his expression when Rey hands him his father's lightsaber was more than enough. \r\n\r\nA quick summary of other characters: Captain Phasma, a more useless female version of Boba Fett. Maz Kanata, a color and gender-swapped Yoda who somehow manages to obtain Anakin's\/Luke's lightsaber. Supreme Leader Snoke, a mysterious figure leading the new Empire (sorry, First Order) and first appears as a hologram (like the Emperor). General Hux, deliverer of a Hitler-like speech to his space Nazis. \r\n\r\nKylo Ren. In my opinion, Kylo Ren is the best part of the entire movie. Sure he worships his deceased grandfather Anakin Skywalker\/Darth Vader and flips out into extreme tantrums, he is more than just an ordinary one-dimensional villain. He worships Darth Vader because he wants to carry on his legacy of killing the Jedi and achieve his intimidating status of being a ruthless individual. He is torn by both sides of the Force. He is indeed strong with the Force, stopping blaster shots in mid-air, freezing people in-place, and can probe the minds of others as a method of torture. His unstable crossguard lightsaber is appropriate for his uncontrollable anger and conflicted state of mind. Once he killed Han Solo, there is no hope for him returning back to the Light. He became a full-on evil person. I'm ready to see the damage he will do in The Last Jedi.\r\n\r\nThe action\/set pieces were very well-done and that opening sequence with the raid on the Jakku village is one of the best and most chilling moments in all of Star Wars. The Battle of Takodana and the resulting battle was phenomenal and seeing Poe take out multiple TIE Fighters make him an exceptionally skilled pilot, even moreso than Luke. The final battle between Rey\/Finn and Kylo Ren didn't feel choreographed at all, just felt like a battle between novices, unlike the highly-choreographed kicks and flips and lightsaber-twirling present in the Prequel Trilogy. Rey and Finn leaving Jakku in the \"garbage\" ship and the whole sequence through the Star Destroyer graveyard was beyond phenomenal.\r\n\r\nThough The Force Awakens does indeed take steps forward to move the franchise forward into a new direction, it takes several steps back into familiar territory. And yes, it feels as if I have been ripping on this movie, but in my honest opinion, The Force Awakens is a solid entry to the Star Wars franchise. The action set-pieces were so well-done, the nostalgic factor of the Original Trilogy is prevalent, Kylo Ren proved to be a well-developed villain with room for improvement, and the relationships between the characters feels so organic and fluid-like, as if they're all cohesive with one-another.\r\n\r\nMy Rating: 7.5\/10.0","id":"58d44f2fc3a368128901aa17","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58d44f2fc3a368128901aa17","movie_id":140607}
{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps:\/\/www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nStar Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017) was just released, but my time didn't yet allow me to watch it. However, I do have time to review the film that started this new trilogy: The Force Awakens. At the time, it was my most anticipated movie of the year and I placed it second on the list of my favorite films of 2015 (just a bit below Mad Max: Fury Road).\r\n\r\nSo, yes, I do love this movie and it is definitely on the top3 of the saga! The cast choices are the undoubtful proof of the huge success that this film achieved. Daisy Ridley (Rey) is a massive discovery, her talent is limitless and she embraces her role like no other. She delivers a very emotional and powerful display, showing all of her acting skills. I can feel that she is 100% committed to her character and what a character to portray at your first big movie appearance.\r\n\r\nRey is excellently-developed throughout the film, she might mislead people into thinking she is just a mere scavenger, but once the movie gets going, she becomes an awesome character sharing some of the most epic moments in the whole runtime. She has an oddly mysterious backstory, which is going to produce theories and plot twists that I can't wait for, in the next films.\r\n\r\nJohn Boyega (Finn) is a fantastic supporting actor and another great casting. He brings just the right amount of humor with some exceptionally delivered lines and his facial expressions and timing are perfect. Finn is going to be one of the audience's favorites for sure, his journey to encounter Rey is interesting and unique in the saga. In my opinion, it is his story that carries the beginning of the movie and that sets up a lot of characters and plot points.\r\n\r\nAdam Driver as Kylo Ren ... Oh. My. God. What a performance! Driver is so subtle in the most meaningful moments but so compelling in the most menacing ones. He elevates Ren into a phenomenal antagonist with a splendidly written script. J.J. Abrams and co. do a wonderful job writing both the plot and the characters. Kylo Ren stands out, he is a multi-layered character with so much untold and hidden behind his personality and intriguing past. Once again, there are many theories and plot twists ahead that I'm drooling to know which one they are going to follow with.\r\n\r\nOscar Isaac is very exciting as Poe Dameron, another fabulous addition to the franchise. His character creates an honest bond with Finn and their interactions are pretty cool. They share some amazing scenes and Poe has all of the awesome X-Wing fights, which are outstanding. Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) does not show up that much, but he definitely is a very threatening presence and a very well achieved motion capture work.\r\n\r\nAs for the original cast\/characters, Harrison Ford has one of his best performances in the more recent years. Han Solo is one of his most popular characters and he portrays him flawlessly. Carrie Fisher returns as Leia and she offers a touch of reality to all of this. Every time she is on screen, everything becomes more realistic and tangible due to her graceful and humble display. Chewbacca has the usual funny \"dialogues\" with Solo and some glorious action set pieces.\r\n\r\nBB-8 is what people feared the most since he could easily be annoying or irrelevant. Thankfully, he is another checkbox on the list of marvelous additions to the Star Wars universe. It is mind-blowing how a droid can provide so much laughter and terrific action scenes, he is unquestionably a toy worth spending your money on for Christmas. C-3PO also appears and elevates the level of nostalgia that everyone is already full of.\r\n\r\nMoving to the technical aspects of the film, J.J. Abrams proves himself to every single person that doubted him since he is the main reason why this movie is one of the greats. From the seamless editing to the great camera work during the impressive action sequences, he enhances the story so much with his distinct use of visual storytelling. It feels like a real film and not just a Star Wars typical movie.\r\n\r\nThe visual effects are top notch and the cinematography could not be better due to the unbelievable practical backgrounds. Abrams uses a lot of long, wide shots with beautiful landscapes and mostly everything is real (besides the obvious, there is very few CGI, less than you probably think), which transforms every scene, every shot, into something more special. The tone is very well balanced between comedy and action, the storytelling process is astonishingly well handled and the pacing always maintains the tremendous excitement.\r\n\r\nOne of the common issues of all Star Wars films are the excessive exposition scenes. Well, J.J. massively improves on that aspect having just a couple of them and I am counting the traditional text that starts the movie. Like I said above, there is an extensive use of visual storytelling, in other words, everything that you see is giving you information while advancing the plot without actually literally telling you what is going on or what is going to happen.\r\n\r\nJohn Williams' score continues to superbly accompany every scene, not only the action ones, but it also strengthens dialogues. I love the ending, but here is where both fans and critics are going to become very divisive. It ends with a huge cliffhanger and some people are going to be disappointed because they are left with this feeling of unfulfillment and if you don't know how to deal with it, you might think you didn't enjoy the film.\r\n\r\nThe truth is you can't have everything right now. This is a trilogy, so it is absurd to even expect that you are going to have everything that you wish for in the first movie of a new era. I wanted more from the second the film finished, I also felt a bit let down because the movie concludes with something I had been expecting forever. However, this is a great feeling to have because it means the film meant something, it means the movie was so amazing that I just can't wait anymore for the next one!\r\n\r\nNevertheless, The Force Awakens can't escape some minor flaws. While pretty much every single character is great, Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong'o) is not. With so much practical effects surrounding every environment, a 100% CGI character is going to (negatively) standout.  Besides, the whole subplot involving meeting with Maz feels a bit unnecessary and the story could have easily progressed without her.\r\n\r\nHowever, my main issue with this film is its lack of originality when it comes to creating a new actual danger for the galaxy. I mean, the Starkiller Base is essentially another Death Star, just bigger ... Really? They couldn't figure out anything else besides another giant planet destroyer? It does not reflect J.J. Abrams' incredible direction and the production team's excellent work, at all.\r\n\r\nFinally, there are some \"problems\" that I don't yet know if they are, in fact, problems. This is the first movie of the trilogy and some things happened that I don't know how or why they did, so I can't really fault the screenplay ... yet. We all know the huge plot device that Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) supposedly had for decades, but then Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) was released and brilliantly solved what was already considered an internet meme.\r\n\r\nThis film does not have such a massive plot device, but there is one little moment that occurs in the first act that I still don't know if it is, in fact, a flaw or if there is an explanation waiting for us in the next movies.\r\n\r\nAll in all, The Force Awakens proves that the Star Wars franchise is still, very much, alive! This is easily one of the best films of 2015 and one of the best in the franchise. It features an outstanding cast with some excellent performances from the new actors joining the saga and powerfully nostalgic displays from the original members. Incredibly-developed characters carry this movie with the help of a mysterious and captivating screenplay, as well as a lot of visually exciting action sequences. J.J. Abrams has his stamp all over the film, with beautiful wide shots, massive practical effects, and exceptional use of visual storytelling. A cheap third Death Star and some very minor issues here and there don't allow the movie to shine flawlessly, but it is still freaking awesome! It undoubtedly belongs to my Top3, behind Empire Strikes Back and A New Hope.\r\n\r\nRating: A","id":"5df9269f65686e00158a07b7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5df9269f65686e00158a07b7","movie_id":140607}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The rise of the Rap music!**\r\n\r\nThere were lots of debate over this film's snub from the Oscars, but I'm not here to talk about that. As a film, it was awesome and as a biographical film, even more awesome, but not an inspiring film that I was expecting. There were many bad things in it, like the language and character portrayals. Though hats off to the filmmakers for rendering the it with the bold contents. I don't know if it being true to the actual events, but anybody can feel how those circumstances would have been for those involved in the real.\r\n\r\nOne thing is for sure, the film is not for the families. The first half was the reason which was very negatively appealed, particularly the racism and police abuse preoccupied rather than telling the actual story. But the next half was much better. I liked it because of that part which crafted so brilliantly. That's where the real journey begins. Well played characters, everybody who repressed those real ones were done incredible job.\r\n\r\nThis film revealed something I did know. Like how the Rap music got so popular. I quite belong to the same generation where this thing got its revolution. It was like another 'Lords of Dogtown' where the young guys made skateboards popular, but here it was the Rap songs. It was a two and half hour long film, longer than an average film length, but the pace was good. Except the strong contents, the narration never looked dull. I totally enjoyed watching it, a good film for adults, particularly those who love Rap music must not think of missing it.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"57f40cf4925141398a000228","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57f40cf4925141398a000228","movie_id":277216}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Giving up it completely does not erase the ugly side.**\r\n\r\nIt's a funny title for a serious film. I have heard the film was loosely based on a real scandal. This is the story of a federal prosecutor whose life has been decent until he becomes addicted to the escort service. As his wife is pushing him for entering the politics, on the other side, he's unable to come out of his new habit. The time comes when both these things can't go together, he has to pick the side and that brings the end to the tale.\r\n\r\nReally an interesting story aspect, but slightly I was not happy with how it was presented on the screen. Though the characters were excellent and the perfect executions by its actors. Patrick Wilson was good, even in a small screenspace Lena Headey excelled. The other characters influenced quite strongly in the film. Like their intentions over the film events which played a major twist in the storytelling. The people can go any length to achieve the bigger thing is the one of the main messages of the film.\r\n\r\nThe theme was strong, but there were some weaker spots in the narrations. Although, an acceptable and enjoyable film. The end was totally unexpected, but unbelievably not that smart from the character's perspective. Surely an average film, but definitely not a bad or an awesome film. Its about the scandal of a high profile figure or at least trying to be, though everything were told from a single angle. So I hope you watch it and give an honest opinion than going against it from even before the start just because everybody already doing that.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"58a375d1c3a3683eff000f14","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58a375d1c3a3683eff000f14","movie_id":309503}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"A solar flare hits the Earth and mobile communication across the city takes a hit. Vasanth, a tech whiz, is trying to restore mobile networks in his locality by using TV signals. Raja, a taxi driver, is busy romancing his lover inside his car not realizing that a terrorist has placed a bomb inside it and plans to activate it over phone. If Vasanth succeeds, it will actually help the terrorist execute his plan. Meanwhile, Mukil, a property dealer, is searching for his love interest Simi, who is actually buried under debris in a construction site \u2014 with a superheavy stone block dangling over her at a great height. And, the only chance of him saving her is if the mobile network is restored on time.\r\n\r\nThus, Ramprakash Rayappa sets up his story effectively and keeps us on the edge of our seats for the most parts. The manner in which he handles this multi-strand narrative without making it chaotic deserves appreciation. The success lies in how he makes each of these sub-plots interesting.\r\n\r\nVasanth is shown as a tech savant (probably, that's why the character is named as an anagram of the word) who likes to invent things \u2014solar bike, robotic dog, bomb detector, invisible ink, miniature bike with a video camera \u2014 and finds being in a job boring. He ghostwrites project reports for college students and one student, Harini, falls in love with him. His mother (a stellar Urvashi) is not quite educated but has learnt a lot about science from her son and can talk about them with conviction. She can even make a clock run by using potatoes as batteries! There is a very amusing scene where Vasanth lets her reply to Harini's messages, that highlights the easygoing relationship between the two.\r\n\r\nRaja is the loudmouth driver who doesn't get a girl because of his indiscreet talking. However, one girl falls for him but he can woo her only with the help of Ramesh, the small-time thief who has stolen his mobile phone. Ramesh also has a part to play in the terrorist's plan and gets the loudest cheer with his actions in the climax.\r\n\r\nBut the track involving Mukil and Simi doesn't feel intrinsic to the plot. Take it away and the film will hardly suffer. Also, their romance seems forced and ridiculous. She is a suicide counselor who mistakes him for a suicide victim while he mistakes her empathy for love. But when they realize the mistake, he tells her that he will continue to love her until she verbally abuses him! And, Dinesh, who still seems to be in Cuckoo mode, and Bindu Madhavi, who is mostly wooden, make one of the most unconvincing romantic pairs in recent times.\r\n\r\nRamprakash Rayappa gives his own spin to the race-against-time thriller with Tamizhukku En 1-Ai Azhuthavum, a solid debut film. Generally, in films of this nature, the hero will have to push himself and beat time and accomplish a task. Here, Ramprakash does what Albert Hitchcock mentioned in his famous conversation with Francois Truffaut while explaining the difference between surprise and suspense. He lets us \u2014 the audiences \u2014 know the stake while his three leads are hardly aware of what they have in store. We see the bomb being placed, Simi getting buried and the cables holding the stone block snap. Thus, we become active participants in the developments on screen and that makes the film more thrilling than it should have been.","id":"5502fcecc3a3685b96004a56","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5502fcecc3a3685b96004a56","movie_id":280084}
{"author":"narrator56","content":"I have always been drawn to stories of time travel. The best book I have read was Time and Again, by Jack Finney. I am sorry they never made a movie out of it, probably because it was more subtle with less action than other sci-fi stories for most of the book. But there are plenty of time travel movies out there, like this one.\r\n\r\nThe fact that teenagers are using the device to travel in time, plus the fact that - at first - they can't travel back more than a few weeks, obviously was put in place to limit their ability to travel whenever they want. So instead of trying to prevent a horrific world event, for instance, they are jumping back in time to tweak their own lives and mistakes. If you have watched many time travel movies, it isn't a spoiler for me to say things don't go exactly as planned.\r\n\r\nThere are a few clever plot twists here, and I mostly liked the chemistry between the lead characters. The dialogue became a bit wooden here and there, but overall the writing wasn't bad. I have to say my biggest gripe was with the hand-held camera routine. I almost wonder if they used it just to honor another movie with the word \"Project\" in the title, if you are wondering 'witch' movie I am referring to. But whatever the reason, it didn't really work for me.Their reasons for always lugging the camera around, even when there was just one character, fell flat for me. For the loss in camera work quality, there wasn't enough of a gain in plot or character interaction. But it didn't cause me to give up on it, just to wish it lived up to its potential. I am not going to comment on the ending and risk giving anything away, except to say that it felt a bit anti-climactic to me.","id":"5e89b838b84f940014cbaccc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e89b838b84f940014cbaccc","movie_id":227719}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Trapped underwater in a pod and battling to the survive.\r\n\r\nI might be a little harsh with my rating on this, but I had my reasons. The film theme was not bad, pretty fresh, but the screenplay was not developed to its full potential. I know it is a low cost film with a limited cast, so I respect the production quality which really was better than what I expected, but the story was way simple and predictable. If it was a more edgy type, would have had best chance to impress the viewers, because there are lots people who take chances on small film like this.\r\n\r\nIt's a 'trapped' concept. You can call it an opposite to 'Gravity'. I mean that story takes place above us and this one below the sea water. I did not anticipate to that level, because I knew it's limit, yet not very convincing. The other reason is there are lots of awesome B movies with innovative ideas I have seen where this film narrowly failed.\r\n\r\nThis is a story of the diver's team who went to fix the damaged underwater pipeline gets trapped in a small pot after losing all the contact with their ship. So the team of four battles to survive in a hostile condition, especially the oxygen is their main concern till someone comes to rescue them. That's the story which reveals what happens to them in its 90 minute narration.\r\n\r\nThe cast and crew's effort must be appreciated, because shooting some 30-40 per cent of the film underwater is really a tough job. At the beginning it looked promising, but later on it did not stay that way, especially the end was a kind of let down. It is a fictional tale, nothing like 'The 33', otherwise even for an ordinary story that inspired by a real event gets our sympathy. I don't think it is worth a watch, unless you got lots of spare time and want to pass it, then it would make a decent timepass film.\r\n\r\n4\/10","id":"57b4fee8925141408e003b7c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57b4fee8925141408e003b7c","movie_id":252164}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Look\u2026one can never have enough time travel movies for our escapist needs, correct? After all, the possibilities are endless in terms of how filmmakers could explore the surreal dynamics of different dimensions thus allowing audiences to suspend their disbelief and engage in the wonderment of SF exuberance. So the question remains: can first-time director Dan Israelite instill some fresh distinction into the ubiquitous genre with the teen-oriented time travel vehicle \u2018Project Almanac\u2019? Well, let\u2019s just say that superior spectacles such as \u2018Looper\u2019 and this year\u2019s engaging \u2018Predestination\u2019 have nothing to worry about in terms of giving way to Israelite\u2019s featherweight found footage fantasy. In fact, \u2018Bill And Ted\u2019s Excellent Adventure\u2019 looks appetizing and inspired in comparison.  Relentlessly sketchy and as exhilarating as a PBS-televised high school science project during summer vacation, \u2018Project Almanac\u2019 fails to bounce sufficiently with its erratic presentation of cockeyed camerawork and crew of stock character whiz kids along for the surreal joyride.\r\n\r\nIsraelite and screenwriters Jason Harry Pagan and Andrew Deutschman concoct a breezy kiddie escapist flick where the scientific impishness feels somewhat upbeat and the young cast seem to be engaged in the time-traveling adventure that giddily plays out. However, whatever spry momentum that \u2018Project Almanac\u2019 manages to achieve is undermined by the distracting shaky hand-held camera movements and choppy jump cuts that turn this sci-fi caper into a disjointed B-movie bubble. Furthermore, the inclusive found footage material is overblown and exhausting. The gimmick, when used sparingly, was a treasured touch to heighten the anticipated tension. But \u2018Project Almanac\u2019 is not the only guilty party to spoil the essence of such a \u2018trick of the trade\u2019. The reality is that contemporary cinema\u2013especially in horror and sci-fi\u2013resort to these technical tactics to the point of no return.\r\n\r\nIt is no surprise that the arbitrary jittery cosmetics behind \u2018Project Almanac\u2019 is under the producing credit of Michael Bay whose reputation for exorbitant twitchy filmmaking has been documented in previous pulsating actioners.  Brilliant high school science mastermind David Raskin (Jonny Weston) has ambitions for attending prestigious MIT and needs the appropriate experimental project to be conducted in his attic for acceptance to his choice of prestigious schooling. The finances are tight and David is chasing after a scholarship that should ease the economic burden on his widowed mother (David\u2019s scientific father had recently died).\r\n\r\nSo David is a chip off the old block like his late father. Daddy Dearest, however, did provide some incentive for his son to to realise his MIT dreams. David had discovered an unfinished experiment of his dad\u2019s \u2013 a mysterious machine that has the capability of relocating individuals through time. This discovery is in the company of his \u2018herd of nerd\u2019 friends plus his younger sister Christina (Ginny Gardner) along to record the curious contraption that will eventually take them all on a back-and-forth odyssey where they can pop into time traveling moments that range from dealing with school bullies to being placed in front of chemistry class testing sheets.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, \u2018Project Almanac\u2019 never seizes the opportunity to think big in its time-traveling exploration. Instead, the movie mopes around with trivial tidbits such as petty scholarly set-ups and never really delves into grand confrontational entanglements that one would expect young impressionable brainiacs to face while awkwardly placing them in sensitive settings that all the book learning in the classroom cannot solve. The concept of this so-called time machine that David found in the basement by the skilled hands of his deceased old man should have predictably brought both father and son briefly together immediately in the name of their beloved interest in science, an irony nearly overlooked that could have been both poignant and profound. The nonsense of the kids cheating through invading the lottery result and retaking tests is a mere slap-on-the-hand cautionary tale that comes off somewhat corny and predictable.\r\n\r\nSadly,  \u2018Project Almanac\u2019 morphs into teen soap opera territory and sinks the minimal sci-fi flavoring it had for a nonsensical diversion punctuated by the aforementioned shoddy camera fluctuation and lack of time-traveling zest beyond small-time incidental dilemmas. Weston\u2019s David Raskin had the potential to be the second coming of \u2018Back To The Future\u2019s Marty McFly but the lame plot and punchless exploits handcuffs him from answering the call.\r\n\r\nProject Almanac (2015)\r\n\r\nParamount Pictures\r\n\r\n1 hr.  46 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Jonny Weston, Allen Evangelista, Sam Lerner, Ginny Gardner and Sofia Black-D\u2019Elia\r\n\r\nDirected by: Dean Israelite\r\n\r\nRated: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction\/Teen Time Travel Adventurer\/Sci-Fi and Fantasy\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** stars (out of four stars)","id":"561a191292514111c3001c4a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/561a191292514111c3001c4a","movie_id":227719}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Given that horror is the flavour of the season in Tamil cinema, it is no wonder that we are beginning to get every sort of horror film. But what everyone seems to be conveniently ignoring is the fact that not everyone can make a truly scary ghost movie. Yoogan is a low-budget horror movie like Pizza, but while the latter had attitude and ingenuity, this one is just a compendium of horror movie cliches \u2014 unusual camera angles, noises in the night, jump scares, a ghost who the makers want us to take as seriously as the one in Grudge but whose very appearance only recalls the funny ghost in Scary Movie 3, a dull backstory for the ghost targeting these youngsters \u2014 that we are hardly scared. Even the dramatic portion, which is set against the backdrop of an IT company, seem like cliches involving people working in the IT industry (they hardly work at office, they drink, they date endlessly, they lack morals). And the modest budget is evident in the visuals, which have a TV serial quality to them, while the acting resembles what we might find in student films. That the director wants to scare us with the camera angles and sound design instead of resorting to cheap VFX is understandable \u2014 and even commendable \u2014 but things turn monotonous after the first couple of scenes as he has just one scare trick up his sleeve. Even the revelation in the final portions fails to generate any excitement.","id":"55976b449251413da6000ba1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55976b449251413da6000ba1","movie_id":337603}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The youthfulness ever presence, despite the living matter nears to cease.\r\n\r\nHalf a year ago the first look poster of this movie's stirred everyone including myself. Not seen such kind of posters for even movies like 'Blue is the Warmest colour' and 'Nymphomaniac I & II'. It is obvious the director of the Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA winner for the movie 'The Great Beauty' delivered another similar ordinary concept about extraordinary fictional personalities. And the way of their life, especially when they meet the difficulties at some point of their lives.\r\n\r\nFrom all, the casting of Michael Caine caught my interest on this. This is another wonderful movie with the hard work of the fine cast and the crew. There is a good chance for the movie in the upcoming Oscar and other prestigious awards node in a couple of categories, including for the Caine's performance. Because it looks like made for awards, rather breaking records at the box office.\r\n\r\nWhatever the topic of the movie is, 'love' stands at the centre of the web. Human affections for each others, losing someone you love and at a same time falling for another. All about passing through 'love' in the life and in which, how strong is our grip on it to carry along with us to the end of the life was illustrated pretty compelling way.\r\n\r\nThe theme was bold, and everything shown was realistic. But it also makes some illusions to brief the other side of reality. For instance, a Buddhist monk who demonstrates his peaceful achievement, a fat man kicking a tennis ball high in the air et cetera, all these are the youthfulness of who are no more youths, citing as a desire for beyond their limits which is obviously what the title implies.\r\n\r\nI won't expect everyone like the movie as I did, because it is not made for everyone. But you could try it and then decide your thought on this film. That is one of the way the movies like this can work for the people who are choosy sometimes.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"5661a5aa925141790600776e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5661a5aa925141790600776e","movie_id":310593}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"In many ways, 36 Vayadhinile is closer in spirit to Gauri Shinde's English Vinglish. Both are feel-good films that mark the comeback of a beloved actress (Sridevi there, Jyotika here). Both the films talk about empowerment, especially of middle-aged women. If Shashi of English Vinglish is a housewife who supports her family by being an entrepreneur (who makes laddoos), Vasanthi (Jyotika) goes to a job to share the financial burden of running a family. Both these characters become an embarrassment of sorts for their teenaged daughters. Both are forced to look inward only when they become truly alone \u2014 if Shashi has to go to the US on her own, here, Vasanthi is left behind by her husband and daughter. Both gain confidence when someone from the past comes into their life; if it was a niece for Shashi, it is a friend for Vasanthi. And both earn the trust of their family by succeeding on their own terms. \r\n\r\nBut Vasanthi is also different from Shashi. For one, she isn't demure like the latter and can be wily \u2014 even if it is only to get a seat in the bus. Sure, the life of this 36-year-old, mega serial-loving, working woman revolves around her husband Tamizhselvan ( Rahman) and teenaged daughter Mithula ( Amritha), but at work, she is every bit the typical paper-pusher one might find in government offices. She is a clerk in the revenue department who goes late to office; doesn't mind delaying files; rags her junior colleague; and, indulges in boasting contests with another colleague; in short, she is an everywoman. \r\n\r\nHer husband has been trying to move to Ireland for a better quality of life and her daughter, too, is excited about studying abroad. But Vasanthi is rejected in the job interview because she is old for the job (that she yawns during the interview doesn't help). \r\n\r\nAnd, one day, she learns that the president of the country, who is on a visit to the city, wants to meet her, after learning that she is the inspiration behind the impressive question posed by her daughter. But on D-Day, Vasanthi faints before the president, resulting in public humiliation \u2014 the people she encounters in her daily life crack jokes at her expense, she becomes a meme on social media, but worse, she falls in the eyes of her daughter and her husband, who are embarrassed by her. Such insults \u2014 and the encouragement of her college friend Susan ( Abirami), now a person prominent enough to be featured on the cover of a magazine, \u2014 force her to look inward, rediscover herself and become the achiever that she promised to be during her college days. \r\n\r\n36 Vayadhinile is a remake of the Malayalam hit How Old Are You and the director, Rosshan Andrrews, who helmed the original as well, is pretty faithful in transposing the plot to Tamil audiences. He has managed to iron out some of the wrinkles of the original \u2014 the Tamil version is crisper (115 minutes compared to 140 minutes), a major character (played by Jayaprakash) is brought in early into Vasanthi's life, some scenes are made more believable (sample: in the Malayalam version, the heroine goes all alone to spend a night in the hotel before meeting the president but here, we see her mother-in-law accompanying her), the dialogues are sharper (though this is hardly Viji's best work) and the score (Santhosh Narayanan) is more evocative. \r\n\r\nBut some of the problems remain. In some key scenes, the lines are read \u2014 and not spoken \u2014 making the scene feel staged. Like the one with the president and the one in which Susan inspires Vasanthi. Even a brief flashback in the latter scene to underscore Vasanthi's resolve feels unnecessary. \r\n\r\nBut what is most disappointing is the portrayal of the husband as a jerk to make us sympathize even more with the female protagonist. Tamizhselvan doesn't come across as a husband who is just not sensitive of his wife's desires. Instead, the film portrays him as a spiteful person who takes out his frustrations on his wife and is completely OK with exploiting her. We first see him talk his way around and cunningly make her confess to the police that it was she \u2014 and not him \u2014 behind the wheel in an accident enquiry. We then see him accusing her of willfully sabotaging his plans to go to Ireland. In another scene, he takes her out under the pretext of dinner only to tell her that he is embarrassed by her and is taking their daughter away from her despite knowing that she is at a low point. Finally, he blatantly hints that he sees her mostly as a housemaid who doesn't need to be paid. At least if there had been a scene showing how this mean-spirited person finally begins to understand and appreciate his wife, we would have felt satisfied. But all we get is a shot of him holding his wife's hand during the climax, which appears false and even insulting to the character of Vasanthi. \r\n\r\n36 Vayadhinile might be a familiar tale of women empowerment, but the issues that it deals with \u2014 women setting aside their dreams after getting married, age being a hurdle to one's success and the necessity for organic farming \u2014 are very valid. The film, despite the problems, is compelling drama. Andrrews also manages to inject humour into many of the scenes so that the plot doesn't feel burdened by melodrama. And in Jyotika, who makes an impressive comeback (there is a welcome mellowing down of her usual exaggerated acting style), the film has an actress who can command the screen and make us care and root for the protagonist and feel elated when she manages to conquer.","id":"55976a999251413d93000ab1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55976a999251413d93000ab1","movie_id":334383}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Puli (Tiger) is your Indian cinema version of Gulliver and the Lilliput's fairy tale. A lavishly mounted fantasy adventure, at the core it is basically a love-story.\r\n\r\nIn a faraway land, live a cruel tribe who go by the name of Betals. Blue eyes and Dracula fangs are their distinguishing features. They also have strange powers that can get them to fly like Batman and fight like Gladiators. Their only aim is to commit atrocities on some poor mortals living in the plains close to their kingdom.\r\n\r\nDon't grieve just yet. When you think that the meek are doomed for life, baby Magadheera is found floating in the water surrounding this village. He is adopted and becomes a favourite. This place is also home to a pretty lass called Pawanmali (Shruti). The two marry secretly. But their happiness is short-lived because the Jaltarang (Sudeep), the cruel Betal marshal kidnaps Magadheera's loved one. In his quest to find his wife, Magadheera sets off to the Palace where the cruel queen (Sridevi) lives with her daughter Mandakini (Hansika). Of course, his journey is hardly without adventure. Before he can ride off into the sunset with his wife, he has to fight a one-eyed monster, maim a hundred Betals and sing songs with Mandakini.\r\n\r\nPuli is a fantasy but its failing is that it is told in an amateur fashion. Coming as it does, after the humongous success of Bahubali that raised the bar as far as fantasy, animation and give-it-all-you-got cinema goes, Puli disappoints. The film works as a visual extravaganza, but it fails to entertain. Even Vijay fans may find it hard to lap up his snazzy song-routine. Sridevi's arched eyebrows are more expressive than the rest of her. Hansika and Shruti only wiggle their backsides and shake their bellies. Aah, even that's disappointing.","id":"56122ffcc3a36868240130cf","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56122ffcc3a36868240130cf","movie_id":330420}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Many a director would have chosen to make Purampokku Engira Podhuvudamai as a prison break movie that along its way touches upon debatable issues like communism, capitalism and death penalty. But SP Jhananathan has other ideas as he turns Purampokku into a call for discussion on these topics without making the film overtly preachy. That the director has managed to achieve this without making comprises for the sake of censors is quite a feat.\r\n\r\nHis protagonist is Balusamy (Arya), a young man with communist ideology, who, at the start of the film receives the death penalty for what the government considers anti-social activities. But for Balu, his crimes were a service to the society and a protest against rampant privatization and the country becoming a dumping ground for wastes from developed nations. Meanwhile, the prison officer, Macaulay (subtlety is not the film's strength), is someone who believes in the State and deems it his duty to uphold what the law and the constitution say.\r\n\r\nAnd to carry of Balu's death sentence, Macaulay reaches out to Yamalingam (didn't we tell you not to expect subtlety), the State's only hangman. But Yamalingam is a haunted man. He comes from a family of hangmen and his hanging of an innocent man when he was a teenager, continues to torment him. Naturally, he doesn't want to do the task. Meanwhile, Balu's comrades, led by Kuyili (Karthika), plan to kill Yamalingam so that the hanging will be postponed. However, when they realize his intentions, they make him act as an accomplice in helping Balu escape from prison. What happens in this conflict between the State, the revolutionary and the commoner?\r\n\r\nJhananthan takes his own sweet time to get to the crux of the story, spending too much time on songs and establishing the grandness of the prison set, but once the plot gets moving, Purampokku is completely engaging. That the director manages to make it a solid political commentary and also an effective thriller at once is an accomplishment. From using technology like phishing and QR codes to the oldest trick in the book (a letter whose word will become visible only when shown by the fire), he uses everything to add to the thrills. The sequence in which Balu tries to escape is the film's highlight, with the tight editing keeping us on the edge of our seats.\r\n\r\nBut the film deserved a better cast. Arya is totally miscast as Balusamy (he doesn't even look like someone who might have such a name). Balu is a person who will do anything for his ideology and can inspire absolute devotion from his associates, and silently commands everything (he is constantly compared to Bhagat Singh). We needed an actor who could convey the fire that is burning inside this person, his intellect and determination, but Arya plays this like how he plays every other role \u2014 casually. We never for a moment believe that this is some person who can write on 'The Silence Of Revolution'. Similarly, Karthika seems too young and lightweight as Kuyili. And it doesn't help that every time the director goes for close-up, it is her arched eyebrows that call for our attention. Shaam is functional but given that Macaulay is shown not just as a straight arrow cop but also as someone who thinks about his actions, the film would have benefited if this had been a layered performance. Thankfully, Vijay Sethupathi redeems everything with a sensitive performance. Initially, even he seems to be redoing what he did in Idharkudhaane Aasaipattai Balakumara, but then does a great job in conveying the emotional turmoil of his character. Balusamy might be the film's central character, but it is Yamalingam who is its beating heart.","id":"55976a7b9251413d96000b87","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55976a7b9251413d96000b87","movie_id":264045}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A complete action pack, with not so popular actors.\r\n\r\nThis is the second version, or we could say the reboot after the 2007 film did not receive well. This should have been a franchisee with at least 3-4 films by now. It's very clear that something is not working out for it. As for this film, there are several issues. But fairly did at the box office, which is poor for an action film like this. From the director who had never worked on any project before and the writers with good experiences.\r\n\r\nThe money was well spent, the production quality was so good, then what is the trouble? Well, my first point out is the casting. Preferably someone top star who can pull the crowd into the cinema halls. Perhaps Jason Statham would have been a better choice, after Paul Walter's death who was suppose to play the lead. I'm not denying, but Rupert Friend was very good in the replace. But my point is there's no star value in this project, especially for the foreign markets, these lead stars are the strangers.\r\n\r\nThe other drawbacks are, this film rated R, which is utterly pointless. Because there are no kisses, no sexy outfits, or drugs consumption, but only violence and gore which are mostly CGI works. Could you believe what the films are turned out to be nowadays. LOL. Though, I enjoyed the action sequences, so I can't thumb down and it does not enough to me to thumb up as well. Decent story with a speedy narration. Definitely an average film. Never seen Singapore better than in this film before. You could watch it for the time-pass and for the stunts, or in a situation when there are no other options available.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"56619b2d9251417904007212","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56619b2d9251417904007212","movie_id":249070}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I know, I know, this movie is rather superficial and simple. More effort has been spent on cool action than on depth of the story. Well, you know what? I do not care! I quite liked this movie. Agent 47 is cool and kicks ass. The bad guys gets plenty of ass whooping. The action is good. There is quite a lot of high tech and gadgets. What is there not to like?\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of with a quite cool sequence introducing Agent 47. I have to say that I got into quite a bit of \u201cwow\u201d mode right a way there. The movie continues with plenty of action sequences with just a wee bit of slowdown in between. Actually the first-half, at least, of the movie is pretty much one long chase.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I should point out that I have not played Hitman and do not really know what the original story is about. From a lot of the comments I have read it appears That this might be to my advantage when it comes to enjoying the movie.\r\n\r\nSome people are probably complaining about bad acting since Agent 47 do not really show much in terms of facial expressions or emotions. Well, news for you, he is not supposed to! He is supposed to be a cold emotionless killing machine so stop whining. Personally I found Agent 47 to be an excellent character. the re is on scene in particular that I liked where Agent 47 intentionally allows himself to be caught in a embassy. Once inside he, to no one in the audience surprise starts to tear the place apart. You have to see it to know what I mean.\r\n\r\nThe second part, or perhaps just the last third, of the movie turns into more of a search and destroy for Agent 47 and his new \u201cpartner\u201d. this part is of course as action filled as the first part of the movie. Naturally it all leads to a big show down between the Agent 47 & Co. The end itself did not really deliver any surprises but was satisfying.\r\n\r\nThe one thing in the movie that annoyed me was this subdermal armor stuff. The idea was not a too bad one but they really overplayed it. Come on! Just shoot him in the head or an eye or some other \u201csensitive\u201d part for Christ sake. Bulletproof my arse!\r\n\r\nI honestly do not understand the low rating this movie has received. 5.7 at IMDb is really a bit harsh. Rotten Tomatoes rating is, not very surprisingly, abysmal. Rotten Tomatoes and their \u201ccritics\u201d ratings must be the worst of any ratings site. When these dickwads rate down a movie, that\u2019s when I start to get interested. First step is to drill down into the real audience ratings which more often that not gives a different picture.\r\n\r\nAny way I digress. Bottom line is that, for me, this is a simple, straightforward, high octane action movie and I quite enjoyed it.","id":"592852c89251413b4a03bdd9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/592852c89251413b4a03bdd9","movie_id":249070}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The mysteries surrounding a family hidden from the actual world.\r\n\r\nProbably it is not a HIDDEN gem, but will take you with a surprise. Yes, the film would do better than anybody's expectation, well, mostly it does for sure. For such a small length film, the presentation was wonderful. The story was very simple that never required any kind of developments for its characters or the previous accounts like the film 'The Mist'.\r\n\r\nIt just opened with a family of three were hiding is a fallout shelter, but they never give us the reason behind it. That's the best part, because of that mystery which was improvised to the greater level under its theme limits the film looked so good. While hidden from the outside world, it also reveals how well they're prepared to face the threat posed by whatever out in there. A bit by bit the flashback story was told to balance the viewer's anticipation as well as to bring the curtain to the narration.\r\n\r\nIt is not a big cast film, but they all (three) were good. I know many people expressed disappointment over Emily Alyn Lind's performance, I thought same as well that she did a bit over expressions in some of the scenes. Other than that, she's a better actor that I know from her previous films. If you're bored of watching lots of high budget superhero films, you could try this for a change. It looks like a new brother combo is on their way in the line of Coen bros and others. It was theirs first directional venture and they did a good job, but the real test begins henceforth, so I hope they only climb upwards.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"5743785e9251414c0d0000a4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5743785e9251414c0d0000a4","movie_id":360784}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A dystopian-thriller-drama in a retro effect.**\r\n\r\nA new British dystopian-drama sets in a single 40 storey building revolving around the people who resides there. It was based on the novel of the same name which has a great cast and a decently made film. But it is kind of a 50-50 to me, mostly I enjoyed with a little disappointment in some parts. First of all I did not know anything about the film, so surprised with its development, especially when it reached its midway I realised the theme. The setting was great, and well performed by all, particularly the Tom Hiddleton which is very rare to see him in a lead role.\r\n\r\nIt was the story of a doctor who moved to his new residency in a high-rise tower and tries to blend in with the others. But as the world is falling apart by the collapse of the society and civilisation, his tower block as well affected very seriously of all kinds of supplies where he confronts various threats from its people. The remaining story concentrates where it is going to end and how with some high and low moments.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, the narration takes us outside the building, but it does not stay there long enough. At present there are many dystopian films are made, especially for teens, so this is really good and gives the 70s and 80s kind of effect, despite technologically it resembles the current world. Not many people who watched it liked it, so did I. It was not that bad, but the story was not appealing to the 2016 audience, where so many hi-tech films hitting the screen in dystopian theme. From that perspective, it is good we have here a different kind, but not enough. It would have become one of the classic cult if it was made in the 80s or should have been updated thoroughly for making it today.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"57ed83ec9251414c9f0002c7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ed83ec9251414c9f0002c7","movie_id":254302}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> People can change, but for some it is too late!\r\n\r\nIt's a wonderful cast and not a bad production either, so I enjoyed the watch, but did not like the film much. The reason is I had seen a few similar flicks which are much better than this in every way. A school kid and his single parents' struggling relationship and their strange neighbour, so it is the concept I'm familiar with, but the story was a bit different. There are a few good scenes in it, but the most of the parts were dominated by the only the nice events like happily ever after kind of stuffs right from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe title role was played by Mickey Rourke, but it was Nat Wolff's film. The narration should have been much better, I mean it should have had more complicated segments. I even don't know how it got the R rating. The writing and the direction, both should have been a bit bolder. There are some people who liked it a lot and defending it, but I'm neutral. To me it was 50-50, I neither liked nor disliked. But all I wanted was a bit better than this, so I can't judge it for other. I hope you make a right decision on this if you plan to watch it.\r\n\r\n5\/10","id":"57951aee92514142a40043a5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57951aee92514142a40043a5","movie_id":330112}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A strange tale of class E.**\r\n\r\nI had zero idea about the film. Anybody who reads the title correctly would think it might be a horror or a crime-thriller. It was the same case for me as well. This is a strong name for a children's film, particularly in the west. Remember 'Jack the Giant Killer' was renamed as '...Giant Slayer' for the same reason. But adults do not care, especially the youngsters. Such films are measured by how much blood shed. Anyway, it was well designed. From the story to the characters.\r\n\r\nSo this was adapted from a famous manga series of the same name. Recently an anime series as well made out of it and was received so well. The creativity has no limits, that's how Japanese manga and animes flourished when the western world shifted their focus on 3D animation. Even the Marvel and DC made a bigger stride in motion pictures. This is an alien invasion theme, but very unique, probably only kind. It is more like a computer game than a film. Just take a gun and have a great time killing the strange creature(s). Just like most of the films in the 'Resident Evil' franchise.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'Oppai Valleyball'. The film is about the students and their class E from a junior high school that was invaded by an alien intelligence. He who claims the responsibility for most part of the moon's disappearance and pledged to do the same to earth by the end of the year. Now with the full support of government and armed agencies, the class E students are given full license to kill the alien and win the great prize. Provided them human friendly weapons and assassination training, the game begins.\r\n\r\n> \u275dEven though he's a powerful who can destroy the world, everyone is saying he's quite good at teaching.\u275e\r\n\r\nBy learning the storyline, you might think it is easy, but that's the trick part. Because Korosensei (the name was given to it by class E students) is lightening fast and no bullet can hit him. You can call it something like Japanese version of 'The Flash'. Even he looks like a smile emoji with weird smiling sound, but the facial expression changes according to the situations like the different emoticons.\r\n\r\nThe concept of the film definitely looks great for manga and anime, but live-action is different and they did make it work. The film was close to two hours, and they filled it with quite interesting stuffs. That means I did not face any trouble with the film's pace. Most of the story takes place in the classroom and its surroundings. Great character, as well, well developed story at different levels to make it a good entertaining product.\r\n\r\nDespite Korosensei is the villain, he was quite likable character. His dialogues, his dedication in teaching, he can be easily forgiven, but his threats are very serious. It's a matter of defending the earth and human pride. So that's the major difference between humans, including class E and him. But all this is in a comedy film, that's the great about the film. Honestly, I did not get a few jokes, as they are meant very close to the Japanese sense of humour. But still a very enjoyable film by outsiders.\r\n\r\nThere's already a sequel was made by the same director called 'The Graduation', but it was not as successful as this one. I can't rule out anything till I saw it myself. Hope I would see it as soon as possible. Meanwhile, if you haven't seen it yet, surely worth an attempt. But don't expect too much fancy like the western sci-fis. If you are familiar with the Japanese style of storytelling, you would know your limit. Like many manga adaptations to the big screens, I'm very thankful. Because I'm unlucky to get a chance to read those mangas as I can't get them anywhere near me. Anyway, I'm not a book guy, but films. So this format works for me and I'm loving it.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58caff389251415e6f0030e1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58caff389251415e6f0030e1","movie_id":349176}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The fight within them is to free the nation from a foreign power.\r\n\r\nI remember that a few years ago I loved 'Jeon Woo-Chi' from this same director. It was so awesome, the mix between the modern world and ancient myth with the usual Korean style presentation, a little different from other similar western films due to the cultural difference. After that, this the second movie of his I am watching and I had two opposite thoughts in the two halves of the movie.\r\n\r\nInitially, I felt I chose a wrong movie. One of the reason was, I could not get the film characters right due to complicated introductions. Too many main characters and that's a too much to recognise if you're not a Korean or not familiar with the Korean faces\/actors. Somewhat I was confused, at least in the first quarter. In the second half, especially after the story moved to Korean, I get used to it and afterwards it was very smooth.\r\n\r\nThe other reason was obviously the length of the movie. Only because of the puzzled opening order. Later the story development was so good, I began to feel comfortable with the narration and after that I did not notice the runtime at all. I have no source to confirm whether it was based on the real or simply a cinematic fiction, but it was very interesting as it progress. So don't force yourself to watch the movie, but it you do, then give it a time in the beginning and be focused, later definitely you will be in a position to get through as easily as I did.\r\n\r\n> \"Damn, we could all die tomorrow. Let's dance.\"\r\n\r\nActually, it all began in the year 1911, and moved to 20 years later during the Japan's occupation of Korea. The resistance freedom fighters plan a series of assassination of the Japanese leaders in the nation's different regions. One such man was a powerful native business tycoon. When everything goes wrong, the story begins to take a turn, complicates further by revealing the old secret. How much it affects and to whom, followed by the final battle sequence.\r\n\r\nObviously everyone interesting in this film for Jeon Ji-Hyun's presence. Of course, as usual she was very impressive, but her so-star, Ha Jung-Woo with his weird screen name 'Hawaii Pistol' was also equally good. When I first heard Hawaii Pistol is coming, I thought it was the arms supply from Hawaii. Anyway, it was a grand intro, after his entry the movie was set to explore the rest of the story in a style. The other actors like his hilarious partner and the main villain set the tone for the movie.\r\n\r\nCertainly it is a movie to pick if you want an historic subject other than your regular Korean themes. Beautifully written for the screen, except like I said the editing was confusing for the lack of proper inception. Don't think it's simply about the brave freedom fighters; betrayal, revenge, family, third person caught in, like that it had many stuffs. It is also very rare to see a woman fighter among them. All the action scenes were really well made, because that's the title isn't. The terrific settings of the 30s as well. I can't say about it is a must see or not, but surely a fine historic movie that I am pleased with.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"56b3854e9251415320000cde","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56b3854e9251415320000cde","movie_id":291549}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"For a horror film, Demonte Colony starts harmlessly enough \u2014 the four leads are introduced with a scene each and in this one scene, we are able to get an idea of their characters. Raghavan ( Sanath), an aspiring filmmaker, goes to narrate a horror film to a producer, who, instead asks for a comedy. In what appears to be a subtle dig at a real-life actor, the producer asks for a story-less film in which the hero and the comedian should keep talking throughout the film, and audiences shouldn't be able to figure out who the actual hero is. Sajith (Abhishek) is an electrician and a loser in life, while Vimal (Ramesh) is a graphic designer. Then there is Srini ( Arulnidhi) who provides companionship (in a non-sexual way) to Jillu, a married woman, in return for money. \r\n\r\nOut of false bravado, the four decide to check out a dilapidated mansion in the titular Demonte Colony, a place where a Portuguese lord murdered all his servants after his mentally unstable wife becomes pregnant during his absence. The friends manage to come out unscathed or so it seems until the next night, when eerie things begin to happen in their room \u2014 the TV doesn't switch off, and instead of the DVD that they had inserted plays their own conversations; the windows and doors do not open; their cries for help are never heard outside; they learn a startling fact that one of them has been dead since the previous night! Why the evil spirit is after them is the mystery. \r\n\r\nHorror comedy might be the flavour of the season, but debutant Ajay Gnanamuthu's Demonte Colony is a refreshing change \u2014 it is a pure horror film with no frills attached (forget comedy, the film does not even have a heroine!), and this alone makes us want to appreciate the director. The film does indulge in the cliches that beset the horror genre but it is the way in which the film is made that gives it a different tone. The film takes place over the course of two days and the entire second half takes place inside a single room but with the help of his cinematographer, Aravinnd Singh, Ajay manages to keep the film visually appealing \u2014 the orange glow of a streetlight in the background provides a stark contrast to the saturated tone that is used for the room and the interesting angles in which the cinematographer frames the action (a must in a horror film) adds to the thrill. The background score is just a bit loud but the sound effects team gets things right. If the constant patter of the rain outside enhances the hopelessness of the situation in which the protagonists find themselves in, the vibration that we feel when a gun is repeatedly banged on the floor elevates the tension in the scene. \r\n\r\nBut despite the visual flair, Demonte Colony at times gets bogged down by predictability and the lack of a genuine sense of dread. The film also throws up questions that aren't convincingly answered, like why the evil spirit waits for a day to hunt them down and what\/who is the good spirit that communicates with them through an ouija board. And the climax is a bit of a letdown. It doesn't feel like a twist but more like a cheat where things are shown to have happened one way and then revealed to have happened in a completely different manner.","id":"55976a599251413d91000b5e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55976a599251413d91000b5e","movie_id":341420}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"Amusing, thoroughly tacky horror\/parody of metal music\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2015 and written & directed by Jason Lei Howden, \"Deathgasm\u201d is a horror\/comedy about a group of teens in Auckland, New Zealand, who start an extreme metal band named Deathgasm and inadvertently unleash dark forces that possess the nearby populace.\r\n\r\n\u201cDeathgasm\u201d combines elements of \u201cEvil Dead II\u201d (1987), \u201cTrick or Treat\u201d (1986) and \u201cBraindead\u201d aka \u201cDead Alive\u201d (1992). Amidst the sometimes profane and tasteless happenings, there are moments of masterful hilarity (e.g. the Peter Criss joke and the black metal photo op in the woods), including black comedy, naturally.\r\n\r\nNumerous seminal bands are acknowledged throughout, some of which are worthy of the recognition and some not so worthy: Death, Judas Priest, Bathory, Slayer, GWAR, Cannibal Crap, ad nauseam. (Even Def Leppard is noted, which some might find odd, but it reveals the open mindedness of Howden; besides, they were definitely a metal band during their first few albums, albeit not extreme metal). Florida\u2019s Trivium is curiously referenced throughout the flick, which tells me they\u2019re a big hit in New Zealand (\u2018cause they ain\u2019t all that big in the USA, although they\u2019re certainly a formidable metal act).\r\n\r\nThe band\u2019s name, Deathgasm, is presumably an homage to Wargasm and Death or Death Angel. The main protagonist, Brodie (Milo Cawthorne), looks like a cross between a young Alice Cooper and Keith Deen, the vocalist of Holy Terror (R.I.P.) while his buddy, Zakk (James Blake), resembles a pasty version of Conan the Barbarian. Kimberley Crossman is cute, curvy and formidable as the blonde babe, but the camera rarely zeroes-in on her beauty, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s the stereotypical myth that Christianity and Christians are opposed to metal, but Black Sabbath started the genre and they had overtly pro-Christian songs, like \u201cAfter Forever\u201d and \u201cWar Pigs.\u201d If you doubt that, just read the lyrics. Or how about the ending of \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d? Not to mention that there are scores of kick-axx metal bands that have espoused biblical themes in a positive sense, like Cage, Trouble, Megadeth, W.A.S.P., Saint, Tourniquet, Bride, Saviour Machine, Living Sacrifice, Antestor, Zao, Seventh Angel, Theocracy, Barnabas, Believer, Overkill, Deadly Blessing, Avenged Sevenfold and (of course) Stryper. Notice, by the way, that I didn\u2019t say they were all \u201cChristian bands,\u201d just that they have all blatantly espoused biblical themes on occasion. Needless to say, the idea that metal is intrinsically anti-God is laughable. Get real. Christianity has been part of the genre since day one.\r\n\r\nThe accents are kinda thick so you might want to use the subtitles if you live outside of New Zealand and Australia.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 26 minutes and was shot entirely in west Auckland.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> When we won't feel a thing for a great loss...\r\n\r\nI am observing closely Jake Gyllenhaal's acting career and he's giving the best performances in all his films. He's one of top 5 best actor of our generation. So technically I love all his films, especially in the recent years and tell me who won't if they love good stories and performance. I expected this to be another excellent film and yes it was, but not that great.\r\n\r\nWhat he has given to his fans and film viewers is the promise and fulfilled it all the way. So even an average film can automatically become a better one. This film was based on the one of the blacklisted script, but Gyllenhaal's presence made all the difference along with the wonderful director.\r\n\r\nIt was the story of a man who lost his wife in a car accident. His way of grieving is what the film narrates. He realises that he's not able feel a thing when everyone around does, so he decides to make search for the answers and so the bizarre journey begins. The casting was good, but it was all about the Gyllenhaal's role. I like Naomi Watts, but for the first time she looked old to me. And the others did not have much screenspace, except that new face boy who was decent.\r\n\r\nI think not everyone would enjoy it, it is a weird story of almost a weird person, so you would easily get it. You must need to be a patience, besides it is a dark comedy. You might wonder why the title was named 'Demolition', the films gives a strange demonstration for that in a good way. It is not like a must see, but totally worth for Gyllenhaal alone. I can't say it should have been better, because there's nothing to get better, everything was at its best.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"57951cafc3a36828e1001526","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57951cafc3a36828e1001526","movie_id":303991}
{"author":"Daddie0","content":"This is one of those films that takes some time and consideration to fully assess.\r\n\r\nOne one level, it's a straight-forward action\/thriller with a unique and interesting setting. Heroes and antiheroes pervade as we are plunged into what is for most of us a new experience and reality. Of course, one that is fully fictionalized. If you can get the emotional distance to view it as such, the film works fairly well, even though it follows a fairly predictable narrative arc that we have seen in many other contexts. (Boy meets cat, boy saves cat, boy better save cat again and again and again, etc.)\r\n\r\nOn another level this film serves as a none-too-subtle political and terse philosophical commentary about current disagreements within the United States of America and her southern bordering nation. In this aspect the film uses all the finesse of a sledgehammer meeting a mosquito, with thinly developed two-dimensional characters that later on still seem to betray themselves far too quickly. In this aspect the film seems to fail in changing minds (if expected to engage the \"other\") or succeed in reinforcing biases (if expected to create our oh-so-delightful echo chambers).\r\n\r\nI can imagine this film really working well in a different time and place, but in our current historical context--for which it was undoubtedly developed and funded--it just doesn't work all that well.\r\n\r\nMy advice: watch if you can lay down your ideologies, sink into the experience and enjoy it as an action\/thriller. If you can't do that you will likely find yourselves aggravated by the experience no matter where you fall on the ideological spectrum.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Kaaval begins with a voice-over reeling out the numbers of murders that have happened in the state and the cases that have not been unsolved so. Then, we are told that most of these killings were done by contract killers, who do them solely for money. And we are given the man who is responsible for these dirty jobs \u2014 Karuna, a gangster in a fishing hamlet, who has everyone from ministers to cops in his pocket and runs a business that spans drug peddling, intimidation, contract killing, et al out in the open.\r\n\r\nBut one man is plotting his downfall \u2014 a cop, an encounter specialist, to be specific. This is Chandrasekar (Samuthirakani), who is determined to end Karuna once and for all and goes undercover and observes the gangster's day-to-day activities. He gets the go-ahead to carry out an encounter but the plan goes kaput because Anbarasu aka Anbu (Vemal), the carefree son of a police constable (MS Bhaskar), who is on friendly terms with Karuna, informs the gangster of the operation. Chandrasekar's fellow cop is murdered and this only makes him all the more eager to kill Karuna. A turn of events result in Karuna beginning to suspect Anbu and now, the young man is hunted by both cop and criminal.\r\n\r\nThe problem with Kaaval is that it offers nothing new in terms of story and presentation. Almost every development feels been there done that. The story of an encounter specialist is something that Gautham Menon did with much finesse in Kaakha Kaakha, and this film hardly adds anything to it. Interestingly, the director ropes in Gautham to provide the voice-over in the opening scenes. The villain is the generic gangster that we often see in our films and so, he hardly comes across as a formidable foe. Then, there is the heroine character, who simply exists because there needs to be a love interest for the hero.\r\n\r\nThen there are the twists which we can see a mile away. The tries to keep Chandrasekar's identity a mystery until the halfway mark but we know he is a cop in his very first scene. Similarly, we are shown a cop getting marriage and we realize instantly that he will be murdered a few scenes later. Such predictability pulls down the film every time something remotely interesting happens.\r\n\r\nThankfully, the editor seems to have realized this and makes the scenes zip through, never allowing us to pause for breath and ponder over the flaws. It also helps that in Samuthirakani, the film has someone who can carry it to the end, with a sincere performance that is very typical of the actor.\r\n\r\nThe decision to make the hero an unwitting pawn of sorts is interesting and Anbu isn't exactly a character whom we root for. He is a good-for-nothing, who is clearly influenced by the corrupt practices of his constable father, and uses the cop's son as a get-away-with-anything card. And he doesn't have a shred of remorse in taking the gangster's side even though he is well aware of his nefarious activities. And once Chandrasekar enters the picture, he sorts of recedes into the background, but Vemal plays this character, which has a few shades, too casually to get us interested in Anbu.","id":"559769309251413d99000aac","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/559769309251413d99000aac","movie_id":342698}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"There is a strong whiff of filmmaking from an earlier era (the 80s and 90s) in Katham Katham. This is quite evident in the way the film begins, with a murder by the villain to establish his ruthlessness followed by the titles, which appear in the form of negatives of the scenes from the film (a style that was commonplace during the 80s). \r\n\r\nThe film then introduces its two heroes \u2014 Pandian (Natraj) and Nandha (Nandha). Pandian, an inspector who is in the pay of Periyannan, the local minister who runs in own government in the place. But he is no Saamy. He is so corrupt that traders shut shop on hearing that he is on the way to collect his 'dues' and has no qualms demanding sexual favours at the local brothel. Nandha is a straight arrow. He is idealistic and honest to a fault that he has been transferred 15 times in three years. In the scene when we first meet him, his father, who is also a cop (and has no misgiving in getting things for free), tells him to be pragmatic and bend a little. \r\n\r\nWhat happens when these two characters are forced to endure each other? Naturally, there's friction but given that he is a subordinate, Nandha can only fume inside, because even the higher-ups to whom he complains about Pandian are Periyannan's stooges. The fact that Pandian walks away with all the glory when Nandha does good deeds only rubs salt into his wounded ego. However, Periyannan begins to mistrust Pandian following a scam gone wrong and makes an attempt on his life. Pandian survives and turns over a new leaf, vowing to bring him down but Nandha, not realizing his transformation, makes his own moves, including getting close to Periyannan, to get rid of his superior. Can he step back before his hatred for Pandian fully consumes him? \r\n\r\nThis is pucca masala material and Babu Thooyavan does a fairly good job with it until the interval point. And, Natraj, playing the role of an opportunist who reforms (something he did in his previous film Sathuranka Vettai as well), puts on a no-holds-barred performance (replete with Rajini mannerisms and double entendre dialogues) that complements Nandha's tightly wound-up act. But the film fails to pick up steam after Pandian's reformation. We expect sparks to fly in the confrontation between Pandian and Nandha, and Pandian and Periyannan but the script just fizzles out. There are no thrilling cat-and-mouse games and in their place all we get are predictable situations, a mood-killing love track between Nandha and Madhu, a local girl and a tame climax that is utterly disappointing.","id":"55106338c3a3683e7f005732","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55106338c3a3683e7f005732","movie_id":329475}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Kaaki Sattai seems to have only one purpose \u2014 to turn a wisecracking star into a punch dialogue spouting superhero. Like Maan Karate, it wants to be a platform for its leading man Sivakarthikeyan, one that catapults him into the enviable league of 'mass' heroes. And, Durai Senthilkumar has chosen the best way to make this happen by taking up a cop story (we even get a carefully edited intro scene where we don't see the hero's face until we have seen his feet). The film even acknowledges this by referencing Alex Pandian and Duraisingam, two of the most intrepid movie cop characters, while the movie's title is that of an earlier Kamal Haasan film. But Sivakarthikeyan is not yet a bonafide action hero and so, the director makes his hero a cop (it is certainly not by accident that this character is named Mathimaran) who is a mix of wits and of course, wittiness. That is why the build-up heavy hero-introduction scene is finally revealed to be a dream sequence. \r\n\r\nMathimaran is frustrated that his superiors (Prabhu in a cameo) aren't giving the job the respect it deserves, and are merely content to fulfill their superiors' orders. But, then he lands a crucial case involving organ trafficking. A group is exploiting immigrant labourers and murdering them for their organs but with the commissioner a chum of Durai ( Vijay Raaz), the brain behind the whole operation, Mathimaran has to rely on his wits to put a stop to Durai's illegal activity. \r\n\r\nOnly earlier this month, we had another cop film, Yennai Arindhaal, that dealt with the subject of organ trafficking. It is a serious subject but given that Sivakarthikeyan is the hero here, the treatment is lighter in Kaaki Sattai. And that is the problem with the film. The film keeps alternating between the serious and the light tones. And, it is hard to take a cop seriously when he has to depend on Mano Bala and his brand of humour to crack his case. \r\n\r\nThe cliched situations don't help either. The heroine ( Sridivya, who is getting stereotyped) is in serious danger and the hero arrives out of the blue to save her. The hero gets a call and steps out of a vehicle and the next instant it gets blown. The doctor involved in the crime confesses everything only to reveal that he has taken poison. The romantic track is generic. Mathimaran helps the heroine's family and starts wooing her until she agrees, which acts as a cue for yet another increasingly repetitive Anirudh song. Even the issue of a cop falling in love with a girl, whose mother doesn't want to marry her daughter off to someone in khakhi, is brushed off lightly despite the initial build-up. \r\n\r\nAt one point in the film, we are shown that the villain uses a mathematical formula in his operation. It is only in the end, we realize that it is not just the villain but the film's director as well who has succumbed to formula.","id":"5502fc829251413da8004ac6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5502fc829251413da8004ac6","movie_id":280168}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"A road trip that turns into a nightmare, Kadavul Paathi Mirugam Paathi brings to mind Spielberg's Duel to which it owes a lot. The final portions where the stranger chases the couple's car in a truck is eerily similar to the incidents in that film. However, the too many slow motion shots and vehicle-on-the-road shots only seem to indicate that this is a 45-minute to one-hour plot that has been stretched to feature film length. Duel managed to pack in the thrills throughout its 90-minute running time despite having no flashbacks or songs. You need solid technique to fashion a gripping film out of this material but that is rarely seen here. \r\n\r\nThe film begins with a security guard being murdered at a police station and then, in the next scene, we see Jai and Neha en route to Hyderabad to get married. They offer a ride to a stranger, who tells that his car has suffered a breakdown and he needs to go to the next town to get a mechanic. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the police are investigating a murder and the cop handling the case senses that something is amiss and goes after the three people in the car. Can he get to them before the stranger attacks the couple? \r\n\r\nThe film manages to be engaging in parts and the suspense over when the stranger will reveal his true colours keeps the first half coast along. In the second half, we are told why he was in a mental asylum and while this flashback feels redundant (the fact that he is a psycho is enough for us to be invested in the proceedings), it offers us a pleasant duet and another fine performance from Pooja. But the film needed drama in between the chase sequences but we don't get that. The conversation between the characters is bland and only seems to suggest that the filmmakers are in some urgency to move on to the next chase. The composer, Rahul Raj, uses excessive guitar riffs for the background score to make these happenings on screen look dramatic but his effort ends up being quite loud.","id":"5510644e925141065c005957","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5510644e925141065c005957","movie_id":307412}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"In a way, the Muni films are like the Fast & Furious franchise, initially dismissed as something appealing only to a particular group of people but starting to gain increased acceptance among the paying audiences and even critics. Yes, they are silly, over-the-top, over-long and loud (both literally and filmmaking-wise) but there is also some fun in the whole enterprise, which manages to pack in the masala movie must-haves \u2014 comedy, action, thrills and sentiment \u2014 quite satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nKanchana-2 contains everything that we have seen in Kanchana and more. There is Raghava (Lawrence in comic mode), who is scared of ghosts and goes to extreme lengths (his bedroom resembles a tantric's abode and he even has a watchman in his loo) to protect himself, much to the chagrin of his mother (Kovai Sarala). Raghava is possessed by not one but many ghosts. There are exorcists who control these ghosts. There is a sympathetic backstory for these ghosts who are only seeking revenge against the men who wronged them. Here, Ganga (an effective Nithya Menen), a disabled woman, is killed along with her lover Shiva (Lawrence in mass hero mode), and friends by the moneylender Marudhu ( Jayaprakash), who wants to marry her to his mentally ill son. There is a rousing pre-climactic song that sets the stage for the final showdown between the forces of good and evil. Heck, there are actors who we have seen in the earlier film \u2014Kovai Sarala, Sriman, Mano Bala and Mayilsamy \u2014 who appear either in the same role or in a new role in this film. So, the only difference is the set-up to this tale. Here, a TV channel executive (Suhasini in a rather perfunctory role) accepts a pitch by her director ( Taapsee) and sends in a crew to shoot a ghost show to counter the spiritual shows that have catapulted their rival to the top.\r\n\r\nThe showpiece sequence in the film is a scene where Lawrence appears as all the ghosts. It's also the most fun because this is played chiefly for laughs with Kovai Sarala and Renuka being the hapless 'victims'. The comedy is broad and low-brow, banking on gay humour and the reactions of the characters when they are spooked by the presence of the ghost. It becomes too childish at times but you laugh nevertheless. As for the scares, much of it involves cutting to a close-up of a character getting scared and zooming out in the next shot to show the ghost being face-to-face with them. This technique does become tiring but there is fun to be had in predicting how and when the ghost will reveal itself to the characters.\r\n\r\nThe flashback portion in Kanchana dealt with the struggles of a transgender and here, it deals with a disabled person. However, despite Nithya Menen doing a good job, this portion was more impactful and even moving in the previous film. The climax is also sort of a letdown as it takes place in CG land and the gravity-defying action sequence has a cartoonish feel to it and doesn't affect us. And, despite the popularity of the series with children, kids might find some of the scenes too upsetting, so parents consider yourselves forewarned. Still, the film does what it promises \u2014 we chuckle, cower, cry and at times, cringe.","id":"55976b889251413d9f000a71","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55976b889251413d9f000a71","movie_id":330425}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> It is not perfect, but delicious.\r\n\r\nMovies about foods and chefs are quite popular since the beginning of the cinema. Not only among the food lovers, but the movie fans, critics as well common people decides to book a table at a nearby best restaurant after watching a delicious film like this. At least one movie in every year makes us to talk about the foods for that entire week. Like the Jon Favreau's last year's 'Chef', this is 2015's.\r\n\r\nOn this theme, movies are always quite similar, except subplots like family, friends and sometimes foods from the different part of the earth as well. This film was not that brilliant when it comes to innovation in the story. The same old chef who comes back strongly after losing everything to get a another star. So what makes this special is that the actors, everyone was awesome. Even in smaller parts, especially the lead one Bradley Cooper makes all the difference.\r\n\r\nThere was a twist, but it does not make us say wow. Definitely it was a bit fun, filled with some dark humours. The slow, dull storytelling was almost like a soulless product, but anyway, kind of it worked well due to the style of film setting that created to narrate it. Feels like in the many scenes, characters were intensely dragged in like the cameos, otherwise it would have been very plain. Overall, it's not a best food\/chef movie I've ever seen, but very much watchable and enjoyable.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"56b38230c3a36806ea002253","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56b38230c3a36806ea002253","movie_id":295964}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"For both Karthi and director Muthaiah, Komban is a retread. If Karthi's character of Kombaiya Pandian reminds you of a somewhat righteous Paruthiveeran, the plot \u2014 a ruffian trying to mend his ways for his family \u2014 is the same as we saw in Muthaiah's debut film Kutti Puli. There, Sasikumar played a rouge-with-a-good-heart whose mother tries to reform him by getting him married. Here, Karthi plays a do-gooder with a temper that often lands him in trouble and he attempts to reform after marriage, because of his concerned father-in-law. The villain in both these films is a big shot who feels slighted by the hero's arrogance and wants revenge while the heroine is an intrepid girl, interestingly, played in both the films by Lakshmi Menon. \r\n\r\nThe problem, though, is not the similarity of the characters or predictability of the plot, but the lack of real excitement in most of the scenes. The film hums along, moving from one scene to the next, without really making much of an impact in the viewer. Even the action scenes are less thrilling. In fact, every action scene is given an extra punch and urgency with the help of the background score and editing to make us feel that something momentous is unfolding on screen. But, after a point, the stunt sequences only become monotonous because for how long can we bear the sight of sickle-wielding characters lashing out at one another? Mind you, the villain has innumerable underlings but in true masala movie tradition, they never attack the hero all at the same time. They come one after the other to get beaten up by the hero making us wonder if each one indicates the difficulty level of the stunt for the hero as in a video game. And, even though the villain and his sons bay for the blood of the hero, no one thinks of getting a gun for doing the deed and finishing it up in a jiffy! It is either sickles or knives or fists but never a gun. \r\n\r\nThat is not to say that the film is without any moments. The prickly relationship between Komban and his father-in-law Muthaiah is the film's highlight. After amma, appa, akka and thangachi sentiment, it is now time for mamanar sentiment and thankfully, the director doesn't go overboard in narrating Komban's initial misunderstanding of his character and his efforts to patch-up with him. Credit should also go to an understated Rajkiran, who is very effective playing this sentimental character. Komban's attempt to save Muthaiah after he learns of the villains' plot to murder him off inside the prison is thrilling. \r\n\r\nNow, coming to the controversy, the film is not casteist unlike what the protestors alleged. In fact, in an early scene, Rajkiran tells a character that he needs relations but not caste. But the real issue is the casual manner in which violence is portrayed in the film. The violence in the film feels very real and can be affecting but sadly, the film chooses to glorify this as something heroic.","id":"55976c049251413d99000af0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55976c049251413d99000af0","movie_id":327709}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> An ordinary woman's life struggle that lives very close to average of us.\r\n\r\nA very fascinating movie. Depicted as a real life drama that is totally different from the other Oscars nominees for this year. Based on the novel of the same name, that tells the story of a young Irish woman, Eilis, in the 1950s who travels to the United States, Brooklyn, looking for a better future. Thousands of kilometers across the Pacific ocean, she finds a new job, new friends, a whole new life, but what she misses is her home and family. So how she makes out of those difficulties, and finds a way to go forward is the rest.\r\n\r\nAbout an ordinary woman's life struggle that lives very close to average of us. That's why I loved this film more than other drama films nominated for this Oscar. The first two acts were amazing, the third was a bit off and cliche, but that's how the story rediscovered by getting back at the conclusion. I think this is Saoirse Ronan's full matured character as an adult woman. She was my favourite child actress and seen all her films. So felt strange to see her like this, because that's not how I remember her, but it only gets better after she does more character like this.\r\n\r\nShe was very good, in fact, she should get the Oscar for the role. In my prediction, Brie Larson for 'Room' and Ronan are the top contenders, but if Cate Blanchett wins that'll be a great disappointment. I'm also expecting adapted screenplay awards. The cinematography was fantastic, those 50s New York City really brought back on the screen. It is a must watch, especially if you're a middle aged guy, because you're well experienced about personal and social life already, and this movie only a reminder.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"56cdef8dc3a368126e00015b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56cdef8dc3a368126e00015b","movie_id":167073}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Once upon a time in the wild Alps valley.\r\n\r\nIt was almost like a fairy tale, about the relationship between a young boy and a bird. From Austria, but made in English language with the limited cast and a semi-documentary style film. It is a very similar theme to the French film 'The Fox & the Child', but sets in a different scenario. Get prepared to witness the stunning Austrian Alps valley with a story of where man meets the wild. A fine entertaining film, as well as to study the behaviour of this magnificent bird that targeted for the audiences of all ages.\r\n\r\nA simple story that sets in one summer of the 60s, that narrated by Jean Reno, who appeared as a forester. He recalls the story of a boy named Lukas, who developed an unusual bond with an eagle since it was a chick that fell from its nest. The boy named the bird Abel and stood by his side providing all needs like foods and training, till he become an adult. As a wild animal, his instinct urge him to act differently and so the Luka's love and care for Abel will gets difficult by every day. As the seasons change, time to define their actual relationship and that's what the film beautifully narrated.\r\n\r\nIt was mostly the background narration like an episode telecasted in a nature channel than the film characters that delivers the lines, but overall the film was dominated by an awesome background score. The sound mixing was really great, along with the breathtaking photography, especially all the segment with the bird, landscapes and other animals. The camera angles were absolutely superb and the film unfolds some of the things that we haven't seen in the documentaries like the topics of conservation, poaching and other human activities, especially the take of wild Apls in the different seasons.\r\n\r\n> \"To learn takes courage. And to teach, patience of a mother.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy was terrific, and so those shots with the animals, especially Abel in the different stages of his life. A great effort put by the crew to make such an incredible film in the unfriendly locations, mainly the animal trainers and the proper guidance from the wild\/nature experts. One of the jaw-dropping scene was the face-off between the bird and the ibex. I don't know how it was done or taken an unused clip from nature film, but its addition brought the phenomenal effect to the film. Not all the sequences were lively captured, there are some CGI works too, but very well done that blends accurately.\r\n\r\nBesides the boy's friendship with the bird was like any kid who love to have one. So envious. In other side, his conflict with his father is what pushed him to get nearer to the Abel. Somewhat it relates, both, Abel and Lukas are in a same situation in their respective lives and tells how they together fight to break free from it. In the end it very clearly differentiates where everyone belong and their role in the mother nature.\r\n\r\nThe story is not what you're going love, but the way it was narrated, mainly the technical brilliance makes us fall in love with it. A coming-of-age film, definitely a very rare kind with a quality narration. Medium pace, but very intense and surely can beat Disney nature films. For children, it is a must see, but for adults, it is not necessarily a must see and if you think that way, you are missing out some masterpiece of the nature's video portrait. You don't have to adore it or go after the flaws, just relax and enjoy it, that's it works.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"577aadbac3a368770e001ff3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/577aadbac3a368770e001ff3","movie_id":378373}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Never leave town!\r\n\r\nTricky. For anyone familiar with the very real instance about the spate of suicides that has blighted the Welsh county of Bridgend, then this film is likely to be a mixed viewing experience. For sure during the film one can't help but keep thinking about the real events, the theories and facts of such, so it's a little distracting because Jeppe R\u00f8nde's film demands the utmost attention throughout. \r\n\r\nIt should be noted with all seriousness that this is only a meditation on the real events, it's not offering up answers, so people should seek out all official text and documentary of the events for the real picture. The film operates in the haunting space of the ethereal, both narratively and visually, with the youngsters at the story's core firmly caught between two worlds. The behaviour of the youths here will cause consternation in some quarters, their recklessness and daring on the surface not making sense, but really that's the point. Sense doesn't operate, not here or in the real world.\r\n\r\nThere's a number of striking sequences that show Jeppe R\u00f8nde as someone who has something to offer the indie art cinema circle. Such as the naked youngsters floating silently in the lake that has become their getaway place, and the finale at same lake that is akin to lambs paddling to their slaughter. Of course the director has had to fend off charges of sensationalism, romanticising suicide etc, that was to be expected, but he hasn't. He has produced a film of intrigue and emotional depth, one that stays with you long after that haunting final shot has vanished. 7\/10","id":"59fecdbe92514146e8032ceb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59fecdbe92514146e8032ceb","movie_id":316885}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> It's just a matter of when, one to find his place to fit in.\r\n\r\nNothing wrong to call it an another version of 'Spare Parts', but it dealt with a different subject. It is a biographical-sport film, about a running race team involving seven high school students from one of the poorest towns in America, McFarland. But the tale begins with the coach Jim White, who finally arrives with his family there after got fired frequently in the other cities. Not intended to stay for a long period, but he has no other choice. He finds hard to fit in the society and get along with his students, but he manages to get going when he forms a team for the upcoming cross-country running race. So their journey puts the small town on the map.\r\n\r\nA very inspiring film, not just sports personalities, but anyone who wants to achieve in life should see it. So a must see film for the students and the youngsters. It is not just about the sport, but culture and society. The first act was an introduction, where and how everyone comes together was revealed. Followed by the middle part focused more on the game. Getting prepared for it and facing other troubles that stands obstacle to it. And finally in the third act, it kind of loses what originally intended as a theme, but brings the social matter into it before getting back to where it belongs to curtain.\r\n\r\nThere was lots of modification in the cinema version compared to the original story. Characters, locations, events, all were kind of randomised from the actuality to the different timelines just to tell a good story. After all, this is a Disney film and Disney always seeks a decent family theme, yet it still remains true to the real. From the New Zealand director of 'Whale Rider' fame, another brilliant film. Apart from the super Kevin Costner and his family, the rest of the cast was so perfect. One of the best sport-dramas of the year and Disney done it again. You no need to analyse it to choose, just go for it and it won't disappoint you.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"57951e619251412ba30013de","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57951e619251412ba30013de","movie_id":228203}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Director Sundar C is an old hand at recycling past films and presenting them as new by adding spoonfuls of comedy but the formula deserts him in Aambala, a masala movie that is a trip through time, and not in a good way. The film is filled with tropes that would have been acceptable in the 90s. We have families that are separated because of an incident in the past, lost-and-found moments, henpecked husbands, botched up kidnapping plans, outdated athai ponnu romance, and so on. The multi-star cast, the wily hero, the over-the-top action scenes, the speed breaker songs (which, while foot-tapping, seem to belong to another film) and the noisy background score make us wonder if we have stepped into a Hari film, though this one clearly lacks the manufactured pace of that director's films. It is only the comedy scenes that keep reminding us that we are watching a Sundar C film, but even these become tiresome and even crass at times. \r\n\r\nIf the film works to an extent, it is mostly because of Santhanam, who plays a cop named RDX Rajashekar. He effortlessly makes us laugh in the scenes where he becomes the victim of bad luck. But once the actor exits the frame, the first half becomes tedious with plot developments that can be seen a mile away. Even in the second half, it is only after his return that the film gets some energy, and the scene where he makes his re-entry like a mass hero is ingenious and humorous. The climax involves hundreds of henchmen but mercifully, Sundar C uses them for comedy and lets the hero fight only the villain and his son. Stunt master Kanal Kannan, who plays one of the henchmen, is a riot in this sequence. \r\n\r\nThe film begins with Saravanan living as a fixer who organizes crowds for political meetings (There is even a blatant dig at the present incumbents of Nadigar Sangam when Vishal tells a character who asks him if he is aspiring to get his post, 'Unga velaya neenga ozhungaa senjaa naan yaen sir unga edathukku varen?'). He meets Maya and falls in love with her but he is told by his mom about his separated dad, Aalavandhan. He goes to find him and gets two brothers in the process and also learns how Aalavandhan has been ostracized by his sisters for being responsible for their father's death. So, his mission becomes reuniting the family and fulfilling his father's wish of his sons marrying his sisters' daughters. \r\n\r\nOne reason why Aambala ends up as a mild disappointment (especially for fans of the director's comedies) is because of how convenient most plot developments are. Saravanan just lands up at his native place and finds his dad immediately. Maya conveniently turns out to be his aunt's daughter so that he will not have any dilemma in choosing between love and his father's wish. The police station at the place is empty just in time for them to pose as cops. When Saravanan gets arrested, Rajashekar turns up in the next scene after having gone missing on screen till then. Even the villain makes things simple by boasting about his hand in Aalavandhan's father's death just before the climax so that it is easy for the sisters and their brother to patch-up. \r\n\r\nAll these only make us wonder if Vishal, who has been choosing interesting scripts of late, and Sundar C, who has been in good form since Kalakalappu, embarked on this project just to put behind the disappointment over the delay of their unreleased film Madha Gaja Raja. Or, would that be too convenient an excuse?","id":"550300bec3a3685b9b0044ed","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/550300bec3a3685b9b0044ed","movie_id":318572}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Adventurous,  funny, thrilling and shocking!\r\n\r\nThe second movie for me from this director after a beautiful child custody dramedy, 'Everybody in Our Family'. This was totally different, a historical theme that takes place 200 years early to the present. This is a black and white flick that perfectly blends with the timeline of the narration. The Romania's submission for the 2016's Oscars. I have not seen all the foreign movie nominees, but having seen the out of the contest films like this and Brasil's 'The Second Mother', they are a lot better than the actually in the race film, 'A War'.\r\n\r\nComing to this movie, I was almost certain that I wasn't going to write a review after knowing about it through the trailer and the synopsis despite good ratings and praised by the critics. Because I felt this must be a boring kind, so was thinking to get over with it. Like there's a saying, don't judge a book by its cover, it happened right here for me with this movie. So this is where I realised after the watch that the Academy Awards was totally wrong for snubbing it. In fact, this was one of the best foreign movies I have seen in the last six months or so.\r\n\r\n> \"When a wise man opens his mouth, open your ear.\"\r\n\r\nThey might have had a solid reason for that, that I don't know, but my guess is the film's ending. The opening was slow, the dialogues were loud, but sometime foolishly funny and sometimes wisely funny. Overall you must pay close attention, so that you can enjoy jokes. Definitely a wonderful adventure, like any other man hunt films, this was so serious on that affair, but viewers won't realise that till the final scene. A well supported music throughout to tell an incredible tale about two men on the mission who meet different people, land, culture and language.\r\n\r\nIt is 1835, in the Eastern Europe region, Wallachia, the father-son duo from the police force on a trail to track down a runaway slave. They must go beyond their territorial limits to find him. On their way, they came forwards to the people they just met needed help, and vice versa, After the intense search they grab him in the remote place, but his version of the story to flee differs. So what comes later is the final act and a very shocking conclusion.\r\n\r\n> \"Fear is shameful, but healthy. It's God's gift.\"\r\n\r\nNot so interested to very into it is something that I was not expected. The reason was obvious it was funnier than I thought. Besides that, I was uncomfortable with the slavery theme. It's turning me off from having a good time and beginning to concern. But that's how the old world was, as it was based on the old documents and texts of the real event. After that horrifying finale, the bold statement from the father to son that goes like this 'God, even looks after worms and we can't look after each other' is what made me think we had come a long way since, yet do everything has changed now? And you know the answer to that.\r\n\r\nIt was not an unusual storyline, I have seen hundreds of other similar films, but it was from the different country, hence different language, culture, comedies, landscapes and different outcome result. Well, this film gets you at with the different moods at the different level of the narration. A fine merges of multiple genre, and yet delivers more than you anticipating. If you are wondering what is the meaning of the title, 'Well Done' or 'Bravo' is the English translation.\r\n\r\nLow budget movie? But, that's the reason this movie makes a very interesting. Because the 19th century tale and this film that kind feels like made in the early 30s (except the high framerate) pretty unlike to any modern black and white films. Definitely a must see if you're interested in this year's Oscar nominees for the best foreign movies, even though it did not make.\r\n\r\n8\u00bd\/10","id":"56cdf1c692514152ab0001b9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56cdf1c692514152ab0001b9","movie_id":319993}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Knight of Craps = Shift + delete**\r\n\r\nAs for me, this director is done. His last best film was 'The New World'. I don't know why someone keeps financing him. It is neither an art and message film, nor has any entertainment value. In one word, total-crap. All the above, these actors agreeing to do the roles. Definitely this director's films have received more boos at Cannes than any others. Not fit for film festivals, as well as theatrical releases. The surprise part was, I saw it. Even after I felt a similar way for his previous film.\r\n\r\nThere's no story. Just a random acts. Even documentary films have a better narrative. Remember a film was being made by Willem Dafoe in the film 'Mr. Bean's Holiday', this is exactly the same film. Except there's no Mr. Bean\/Atkinson here to make it a cheerful additional editing. It was like the director woke up in the morning and decided to do what he felt to shoot without a script.\r\n\r\nI dislike whispering background narration. It is like a lullaby, one might fall into sleep. Not just asleep, but a deep sleep. Direct dialogues between the characters are like an oasis in this film. If you have nothing to do and ready for a slow film, you should not consider it then too, because it is not a film, but a two hour long torture. Easily skippable film.\r\n\r\n_1.5\/10_","id":"59fe1e3f92514146f502443d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59fe1e3f92514146f502443d","movie_id":86835}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Just say no!\r\n\r\nEli Roth directs and co-writes the screenplay with Nicol\u00e1s L\u00f3pez and Guillermo Amoedo. It stars Keanu Reeves, Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas. Music is by Manuel Riveiro and cinematography by Antonio Quercia. \r\n\r\nReeves plays Evan, a devoted husband and father of two, who while he is left home alone, is visited by two young women soaked and apparently lost. Letting them in to his home as an act of kindness, things quickly spiral out of control.\r\n\r\nYou do wonder if Eli Roth sits at home looking at the reaction to his movie and giggles like a schoolboy. It's invariably a distinctly average film, but it does get a reaction from the audience, something which Roth is gleefully aware of. Pic is actually a remake of Peter S. Traynor's 1977 movie, Death Game, which starred Sondra Locke and Colleeen Camp, both of whom lend their names to production for this release.\r\n\r\nAt times it feels like we are part of one of Roth's wet dreams, or conversely one of his sick jokes. Yet as the cast struggle to instill acting gravitas (the girls actually become more annoying than frightening), and Roth chooses psychological themes over blood and guts, there's a deft whiff of a moral fable hanging in the air. While also of note is the nods to film noir, both in story and visuals. It isn't enough to save the piece, but it's interesting enough as an aside to the chaos inside the house. 5\/10 ","id":"57041816c3a3686985000757","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57041816c3a3686985000757","movie_id":263472}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Be cautious of the two slices of the free pizza delivered to your doorstep.\r\n\r\nAnother flick that sets in an isolated place with the limited cast. A low budget film, which was a remake of the 'Death Game'. After playing a strong character in his previous film, Keanu Reeves is back exactly opposite to that one. Yep, remember what happened to the two men who break-in into his house in 'John Wick', but here it is like what if he's not able to handle them or to do anything about it kind of Circumstance.\r\n\r\nHe played a normal family guy, a father of two children with a beautiful wife and a big house. The trailer itself revealed half of what the movie's. But the rest of the film is not bad at all, and that does not count as I'm praising it. The movie was average because of the writing was too loose. Not only predictable, but aimlessly moved and the motives were never explained. So the mystery remains mystery.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those films that leaves behind us to suspect the possibilities. A broad open for a sequel, but likely there's very less chance for another film. The girls were so good looking and performed well. The theme aimed for erotic-crime-thriller, but did it achieved? I don't know, the original was released in the 70s, which might have been too sexy for that time, but in the present world, it is not that special or effective, just like 'I Spit on Your Grave'. You could watch it to enjoy your moment, but it would be a cinematically impressive with the great writings, actings, with twists and turns and all.\r\n\r\n5\/10","id":"56477aa8c3a36826140042be","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56477aa8c3a36826140042be","movie_id":263472}

Yes kind of similar theme, but there's a lot of difference. The concept was the same and the story happens in an alternate way like 'what if'. That means one takes place outside the prison and the other one in the prison. If you're a movie fanatic, you would enjoy the show other than going after flaws and resemblance.\r\n\r\nI had seen many weird combos, and I felt same feeling for this Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart, when I first heard about it. Like usual, once I watched the movie seem to be okay. Quite a show and equally good, one of the funniest combinations to entertain. I had a few good laughs and enjoyed the film. I would love to get a sequel for this, because these men coming together are double fun. So it should not be wasted ending with a one-off movie, but at least a duology or maybe a trilogy.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A video game that you won't play, but watch!\r\n\r\nThe entire story was told from the Henry's perspective, I mean what he sees through his eyes are the visuals we get. The first person point of view. Like the video games, but you won't play, just sit back and watch it. So you won't see the Henry's face, because he's you and you won't utter a word. That character was actually performed by many stuntmen and their risky stunt sequences pay off so well. That means, the main character is the cinematographer of the film. So all the credit must go to them for doing multiple task at a same time.\r\n\r\nIt is a one day event based narration. All about running and chasing, right from the beginning. Along the way it lets us know why it's taking place and who's behind it. The rest of the cast was too amazing, especially that South African actor of 'District 9' fame was simply brilliant with different getups. I also enjoyed the Russian locations which were something refreshing.\r\n\r\nThe story was simple, but puzzled. They explained nearly everything, yet a few doubts remain with us. So I'm expecting a follow-up, more than that I want it to be a trilogy and nothing less. For the sequel, put us in the cinema hall, but give us Virtual Reality Headset, I think that's how the future of cinema should be, especially for this film.\r\n\r\nVery unique and craziest film, one of the best of this year. It was kind of similar to Statham's 'Crank', as well as good as that one. If you like action films, then surely you would love it. Especially if you're a gamer, then it will be a double treat. The Americans did not show interest in this like usual which is not Hollywood or British. Especially critics never appreciated the creativity, but this is a must see film and the rest of the world accepted the truth. So don't think of skipping it.\r\n\r\n8.5\/10","id":"57951e91925141797e0057c9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57951e91925141797e0057c9","movie_id":325348}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Stand up and fight back like a king!**\r\n\r\nLike everyone who saw it said a surprise film from a debutant writer, director. It is a powerful title, but the film was different. Like it focused to tell the story of a teenager named Jack who is regularly picked to bully by some older guys from the school. The film opened with a payback act by Jack, but soon they get him back. This time it gets more serious than ever, and how it ends comes in the latter half of the film.\r\n\r\nThis is a short film and a good screenplay too. Initially I did not like much, it looked like another same old themed teen film. But the second half of the film completely changed, especially about bullying and how others see it, apart from the victim and offender. An awareness film, though the end drawn as what a cinematic storytelling required than the social message.\r\n\r\nThe kids did well, particularly Jack, Ben and a few others. There's no obscene materials, but in a sequence it gets bold like how normal teenagers are obsessed with those stuffs. That does not mean it is bad for them to watch. It is a much better film on this theme, and gets better while progressing narration. It is one of the under noticed good film of the year. It's not a must see, yet worth giving it a try.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5851a620c3a368258c00f2ef","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5851a620c3a368258c00f2ef","movie_id":330916}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"In the opening stretches of Kirumi, we see Kathir (Kathir), its protagonist, indulging in worthless conversation with his friends, getting into a tiff over it and storming off the place, hitching a ride with his neighbour Prabhakar (who is on a 'job'), flirt with an eager young girl who is alone at home (and mischievously goes into her room in a inviting manner to freshen up), and proudly tell Prabhakar's wife Gayathri that he visits his home once a week when she questions him on spending the nights at his friends' room; in short, we see him behaving every bit like the carefree, young heroes populating our screens. And then, we get a scene where he is in his house. And we see that he has a wife and a kid! But this revelation isn't underscored by judging Kathir for what he was doing earlier, but simply conveyed to us in a matter-of-fact manner. And, it is at this particular moment that the film makes us realize that it is not going a typical Tamil film.\r\n\r\nThe film is about this ordinary, young man, who is still a man-child, evolving into an adult and realising his priorities and responsibilities. And for this to happen, director Anucharan provides a setting that feels new to the audience, and turns what should essentially be a coming-of-age drama into a tense thriller. This world, which is populated cops, informers, and gangsters, is richly detailed (Kaaka Muttai's M Manikandan is the co-writer) and feels incredibly close to real life, with Arul Vincent's camera often acting as a fly on the wall, letting us peek into the lives of these characters. We see how each one is interdependent on the other and how those with power can toy with lives of the normal folk.\r\n\r\nThe plot kicks into gear when Kathir, with Prabhakar's (Charlie, rock-solid) help, becomes an informer to the ambitious inspector Soundarapandian (David, impressive), and helps him out with his cases. In return, the cop treats him in a friendly manner. Meanwhile, Kathir decides to teach a thing or two to Shankar (Dheena), a bar owner\/gangster's (Thennavan) brother, who had humiliated him some time ago. He encourages Soundarapandian to raid the bar, which is also a gambling den, and the inspector uses it to score points over his rival Mathiarasu (Marimuthu), under whose jurisdiction the place falls under. Just when Kathir thinks that he can use his new-found clout to move ahead in life, tragedy strikes and soon, he realizes that the stakes have risen so high that his own life is at stake.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Kirumi stand apart from other thrillers set in the backdrop of crime is its understated quality. Even when the situation offers scope to turn things into full-blown melodrama, Anucharan keeps things at a low key (aided by K's unobtrusive and evocative background score), and this refreshing change of pace actually keeps things interesting. Take the scene where Gayathri has to visit the hospital days after her husband's death. In an earlier scene, we are told that the couple has been trying hard for a child. Kathir's wife, Anitha worryingly asks him, 'What if is she is pregnant?' The doctor enters, tells Gayathri that she has nothing to worry and it is just weakness that has made her unwell. And then she adds that she should take care of herself for the baby inside her. We don't see Gayathri breaking down and wailing her heart out as it might have happened in a lesser film; instead, she takes this news in a stoic manner that seems to suggest, yes, she is in the midst of tragedy, but life has to go on.\r\n\r\nThis is one movie that realises that there is good and bad in everyone. Even the antagonists are painted in a considerate manner that reinforces that it is situations that force people to act one way or another. In an earlier scene, we see Soundarapandian visiting Kathir's home for his child's birthday and later, this same genial man, when he realises Kathir could turn out to be a loose end, chooses to do something despicable. And even at that moment, we see a humane side to him when another character makes its appearance. It is also remarkable how the characters in the film never do something that feels implausible or way beyond their means. The way Shankar's brother has to run from pillar to post to get his brother out and the scenes where cops become answerable to their higher-ups only show that even the powerful hold power only to an extent. And Kathir never becomes a cinematic hero. When he is about to be attacked by gangsters, he doesn't stand up to fight them, but runs away. Even when his life comes under threat, his instinct is only to seek help from others. And he is haunted by his failure to protect those around him. Which is why the offbeat and modest climax, which might seem underwhelming initially, is actually a rather brave one.","id":"5608b35e9251417a45003c56","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5608b35e9251417a45003c56","movie_id":361493}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Where does A Venkatesh figure among masala movie makers who have been prolific over the past decade? KS Ravikumar is known for his collaborations with big stars, Lingusamy gives us mass elements in a glossy package, and Hari's films have the breakneck speed (even if it's mostly the ramped up cinematography and hyper editing) going for them. Even with someone like Perarasu, we get moments that are unintentionally funny. But Venkatesh tends to play it straight and safe that his films are largely nondescript that we hardly remember them after exiting the theatre. \r\n\r\nIn Killadi, Dharani ( Bharath, who tries hard to be taken seriously as a mass hero), an intrepid college student, drops Anjali (a bland Nila), who is running away from home to escape a marriage with her rowdy uncle Bhavani (Vincent Asokan), at the bus stand but Bhavani and her arrogant mother Angayarkanni (Roja trying to do a Sornakka) mistake him for her lover. Now, Dharani and his family become their targets but they hardly realize that he is more than a match for them. \r\n\r\nThere are far too many influences from Venkatesh's previous work in the film. Like the hero of Dum, Dharani is a fearless young man; as in Aai, Palani forms the backdrop for some portions of the story; like Kuththu, the heroine's side is the antagonist; Vincent Asokan, a regular in his films, is once again the bad guy... \r\n\r\nThe film is essentially a compendium of the masala movie must-haves \u2014 hero introduction song, aggressive hero, his loving family members, damsel-in-distress heroine, kuthu songs disguised as duets, random comedy track (a mildly funny one featuring Vivekh and Cell Murugan) and over-the-top villains. Killadi is the kind of film where if the hero is shopping in the market, you can be assured of a fight. Dharani is the kind of hero who doles out messages of self improvement while performing paal abishekam for his favourite film star. Angayarkkanni is someone who boasts that she has coffee at the collector's house and then breakfast at commissioner's house but will turn into a loving mother seconds after slapping an elderly man. And, Anjali is the kind of girl who will wait till the very end to challenge the villain to a mano a mano with the hero. How we wish she had challenged the villain much earlier!","id":"5502fde592514174f6000f51","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5502fde592514174f6000f51","movie_id":280954}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Landing in a wrong timeline!**\r\n\r\nFeels like 2010 was a long ago, so I don't remember the first film much. Looks like it is an unnecessary sequel, particularly when a very important character goes missing. Even the first film was not great, though that was considered a mainstream film and this one slipped into the B category. An average story, the theme was not used properly. I'm not talking about the plot holes, but the story construction and its characters.\r\n\r\nThe old friends meet again after becoming famous and millionaires, but when one of them met an accident, they decide to go back in time to fix it. Instead, they enter a wrong timeline and from there how they get back is what revealed in the remaining narration. The comedies were okay types, but I expected a better one. The twist was very ordinary, for a time travel theme people anticipates a smart twist, but it fell short to stand up to the mark.\r\n\r\nWhatever, the production was awesome, all the special effects were acceptable. I mean it did not strongly relied on them, but according to the story's requirement, it managed so well. Less entertainment, but very much watchable and suits as a timepass product. I think the scenes at the end credits are for fun, but it also looks like a hint for possible third film. I'm not against that idea, but if it has a good story and upgraded cast like maybe new ones, I surely look forward.\r\n\r\n_4.5\/10_","id":"581cf33392514136140010fa","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/581cf33392514136140010fa","movie_id":243938}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A little girl and her unexpected adventure with an unlikely friend.\r\n\r\nIt was a good movie, but just like 'Turbo', it was turned down by the critics and so those who follow them. Besides Disney and Pixar, DreamWorks Animation ain't that bad at all. Technical side of this film comes under same league with the other two top production house, but the story and the character are not strong enough. Comedies were awesome, and so the dialogues, the innovation in narration falls short with the same old cliche in the alien theme. The soundtracks were good though, especially that one used for the promotion, 'feel the light'.\r\n\r\nFor a change, the lead girl character was different and voice rendered by Rihanna. I said it many times that my first ever 3D animation was 'Ants', despite 'Toy Story' was the first feature length. And this film has been the best work of the director to till date since his first flick 'Antz'. As usual like any animated movie, it was targeted for children, but I enjoyed watching it. There won't be a sequel at least for now, but I would love to have one. For a change you can try this to get a break from the fairytales and princess stories.\r\n\r\n6.5\/10","id":"55de10a19251411c3e000274","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55de10a19251411c3e000274","movie_id":228161}

In the end it's pointless. But maybe that's the nihilistic non-message? There are three fairly worthy women, but the creators never really take advantage of their presence.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 29 minutes and was shot Black Park Country Park, Buckinghamshire, England and London (train interiors and station).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B- (6\/10","id":"5cbe0e7492514108d8ffc30e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cbe0e7492514108d8ffc30e","movie_id":301846}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> You just got coopered!\r\n\r\nI don't mind whatever the others thought of the movie, but I enjoyed it, I got entertained well. It was not the low ratings or the bad reviews, I believed in the director, mainly because of her previous film 'The Guilt Trip' that I heartily loved. In fact, it was a short movie and I surprised how nice it was.\r\n\r\nIt was the same old story, an honest cop is framed into a shootout disaster during the witness protection program. She must bring all the strength and courage to fight back to clear her name. So the story is actually a road trip and all the actions are in the form of humour.\r\n\r\nIt was a good one for me, at least it should be a decent one as a collection of the everyone's thought, but leaning too much on the bad side that it won't deserve. Its very very sad a cute little movie like this and 'Tammy' are thrashed badly. Don't expect it to be the year's best, just watch it for the entertainment, or the time pass which might bring a better result.\r\n\r\nThe dialogues were fun, some scenes were good and I felt some were overused. The last year (2014) was one of the best years for Reese Witherspoon. Both the film of hers 'The Good Lie' and 'Wild' are the career's best ones. With this she's back to the commercial films. It might not be a great as those, but satisfies at least for the first time view.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd\/10","id":"561e7c45c3a36826060004ac","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/561e7c45c3a36826060004ac","movie_id":268920}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> It's vampa time!\r\n\r\nFrankly, I was not thinking of writing a review for this. You know, some animated movies come and go unnoticed, so I believed it would be one of those. In fact, I did not like the first film much, that is the reason to watch it so delayedly and with a minimum expectation. Better late than never, well, I regret for viewing it so late. One of the best animation of 2015, maybe in the top 10 or 15.\r\n\r\nWell, it was a one liner, like, the daughter wants to move to the human social world thinking that might do good for her son's future. But her father plan to stop her getting away from him and the hotel. So those attempts are the rest of the movie. I liked the movie very much because it was very funny, especially the lines were and its accent, Adam Sandler nailed it.\r\n\r\nI have said millions of times that I don't know why Americans and critics hate Adam Sandler that much, I don't know about the rest of the world but I kind of like his films. The last few films like 'The Cobbler', 'Pixel', 'Men, Women & Children' and this one were so much better. It did not bring the old Sandler, but brought us a different and new Sandler on screen. He was definitely the main reason for this film's success.\r\n\r\nDon't just a book by its cover, well, here the cover is the previous installment. The first part was not a must see IMPO, but this is especially for the animated movie fans. PG rated movie, but still it might scare mildly for below 8 kids, only because of the theme. I had a great time with it and expecting it to do the same impact on you as well. And I can't predict the third will be as lucky as this one, lets wait and see.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"56d9a91ac3a3681e36022298","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56d9a91ac3a3681e36022298","movie_id":159824}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"At one point you could actually find some ounce of redeeming quality in the original \u2018Hot Tub Time Machine\u2019 where the movie demonstrated its playful foolishness for unexpected thoughtful insight involving a bunch of weary dudes in stagnation with their sub par lives. The gimmick of an unlikely hot tub magically transporting these silly-minded saps back in time when their youthful existences were fun and carefree that meant something in contrast to the nowadays malaise that plagues them actually had merit, to a certain point of course.  Gleefully, the art of discovering the inner man-child mentality was a cockeyed challenge in \u2018Hot Tub Time Machine 2\u2032 . This is not to say that the original \u2018Hot Tub\u2019 was without its transparent banality. Still, it at least had a wacky purpose of over-the-top observation in mindless men looking to get back into the boundless craziness of their early years of arrested development.\r\n\r\nWell, in the tradition of inevitable practice of sequelitis comes the monotonous \u2018Hot Tub Time Machine 2\u2019\u2026a blatant excuse to heighten and celebrate whatever remaining applauded lunacy the predecessor had in making its misguided mark the first time around. Relentlessly pointless, tasteless and desperately attention-getting, this second serving of \u2018Hot Tub \u2018overflows its witless waters with jerky Jacuzzi-style humor so uninspired in lukewarm laughter that you might consider drowning yourself to save the agony of its time-traveling tepidness.\r\n\r\nThe tone in the first \u2018Hot Tub Time Machine\u2019 wanted to take a jittery joyride in reshaping the doldrums of these present-day morons and whisking them back to the mid-1980s where they can discover their fratboy fantasies as an escape route. Now, director Steve Pink returns to the splashy scene-of-the-crime as his tacky time-traveling hipsters want to engage in more naughty-minded brushes with eccentric personalities and places. The second time revisiting this anemic \u2018Back To The Future\u2019-esque formula finds the hot tub hotshots ten years into the future as they have taken advantage of exploiting their experiences through time travel. Yippee for them!\r\n\r\nScreenwriter Josh Heald\u2019s lame story never taps into the freshened fervor of the magical hot tub or its band of traveling hucksters as the movie buries itself in arbitrary, manic messiness. \u2018Hot Tub Time Machine 2\u2032 has really nothing to say or contribute to its empty-minded nuttiness. If you are game for gawking at bouncy babes (okay, this is not altogether a bad thing to endure), tolerating varied penis-style jokes, being exposed to tired time-traveling gags and fussing over the presence of an assassin on the lurk then jumping into this particular installment of \u2018Hot Tub\u2019 will warm your stillborn funnybone. Otherwise, the rest of us will probably prefer to blow bubbles out of chlorine pool water.\r\n\r\nThe \u2018Hot Tub Time Machine\u2019 rabble-rousers are back in this sorry sequel sans top-billed star John Cusack (Cusack\u2019s Adam Yates character is missing from the proceedings, a lucky timed absence for both Cusack and his alter ego). So the floor belongs completely to the other players in Rob Corddry\u2019s Lou, Craig Robinson\u2019s Nick and Clark Duke\u2019s Jacob. Together, they all capitalise on their hot tub-related hubris and profit fabulously in their money-making ventures.\r\n\r\nLou\u2019s creation of the Internet search engine \u201cLougle\u201d (yeah, a festive take-off on Google) has made him a bundle of cash. For Nick, his star-power as a musician (based on the creative back\u2019s of the other artists he stole from) has landed him comfortable pop cultural status. Jacob, who we learned was Lou\u2019s son previously, is piggybacking off of Lou\u2019s online business success as his personal servant. When an assassin decides to rub out Lou (he is shot in the private parts\u2026there you go\u2026the ready-made juvenile wee-wee fodder in gear), the guys decide to go back to their trusty hot tub to take them back and curtail the assassin\u2019s deed but that is to no avail. Instead, Lou, Nick and Jacob are thrust ten years into the future. The question remains: can the time-traveling trio catch the would-be assassin? How come one gets the sudden urge to automatically root for the killer-at-large?\r\n\r\nSure, the criticisms lodged towards anyone that will rail against the intentional nonsense of \u2018Hot Tub Time Machine 2\u2019s will be inevitable. \u2018Hey idiot\u2026 the \u2018Hot Tub Time Machin\u2019e flicks are not suppose to win Oscars so stop being so fussy and overly critical.\u2019 Okay, duly noted. Still, regurgitating a comical time machine romp back in 2010 that was questionable to begin with as it tries to mine the same kind of hackneyed hilarity leaves something to be desired. The gross-out nature of the smirking showcase lacks heft and feels woefully childish. The whole affair screams volumes of strain and desperation as Pink wants the forced lewd laughs to settle as opposed to trying to present a rollicking narrative that actually presents a sense of zany adventure without leaning on its noxious fumes.\r\n\r\nFor the sheer sake of being sophomoric and obnoxiously outlandish, \u2018Hot Tub Time Machine 2\u2032 struggles mightily in trying to plant a guilt pleasure grin on one\u2019s face. Sadly, there are plenty that will be receptive to this lazy and raucous time-traveling tripe with the transparent titillation.\r\n\r\nHot Tub Time Travel Machine 2 (2015)\r\n\r\nParamount Pictures\r\n\r\n93 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Rob Cordday, Craig Robinson, Clark Duke, Chevy Chase, Adam Scott and Collette Wolfe\r\n\r\nDirected by: Steve Pink\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy & Fantasy\/Time Travel Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: * star (out of 4 stars)","id":"561a16f3925141775f001bd2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/561a16f3925141775f001bd2","movie_id":243938}
{"author":"skyezero","content":"This could easy rate as one of the biggest piles of cowshit I have ever seen in my entire life. Saying this consider Chlo\u00eb Sevigny is in this is quite the statement as she\u2019s one of my favourite actresses of all time. In her defence - she gave as much to her role as possible and it didn\u2019t really set her up with a fighting chance.\r\nThe movie starts with Chlo\u00eb Sevigny\u2019s husband cheating on her so I instantly hate this film as who the fuck would cheat on her?! Answer is nobody, not one person who is deemed as sane, ever. Her part is minor in this unfortunately for my eyes and the purpose of distracting me from how dire the movie is. \r\n\r\nThe film is focusing on a group of bratty 12 year olds who you immediately hate and want to die. Within 5 minutes I was praying for some machete yielding manic to come and hack them all to pieces - don\u2019t judge me for saying that until you\u2019ve watched this the entire way through. They\u2019re all bullying eachother with obvious insults such as the fat girls weight, such imagination. They\u2019re having a sleepover and the one who\u2019s invited the new girl they talk about as though she\u2019s a saint but as the movie progresses she\u2019s actually bat shit insane and don\u2019t recall her saying one nice word so not quite sure what happened with that slight deviation of the character traits. The Mother (blessed Chlo\u00eb) leaves them with free reign of the huge house, alcohol collection and her millions of pounds worth of jewellery to try on. The maid has disappeared to god knows where and apparently nobody thought to keep her in for when the group of 12 year olds are going to be flying solo. At one point and I shit you not they\u2019re all posing with a gun and uploaded it to Facebook like #lookatme diediediediediediedie.\r\n\r\nThey all decided to stick to bullying two of the girls and tell one she has to leave. The rest act as though they\u2019re terrified of this notion for some reason but she eventually runs into the local woods and thank fuck as she was getting on my tits. Her Dad is screening her calls which I completely understand as if that thing belonged to me I would be doing exactly the same if she tried to contact me. \u201cI can\u2019t even see right now wahhhhh\u201d Shut up it\u2019s fucking daylight you ridiculous little gonk.\r\nAs the 12 year olds are getting white girl wasted, lost girls Daddy comes and has a complete melt down which isn\u2019t scary in the slightest it just makes you raise your eyebrows a bit as to how bad is this actually going to get, absent mindedly moving the mouse to see how long is left of this garbage. It\u2019s impressive how many times \u201cyou should go and kill yourself\u201d is said. One time is actually from wandering brats Father to the children inside the house. Again, sort of agree. \r\nThere\u2019s some art on the wall which the camera moves to a few times which looks like Marilyn Monroe with an egg replacing her face and when the camera is on that, the yolk rotates. I have no idea what the relevance of this is. \r\nI DON\u2019\u2019T UNDERSTAND THE RELEVANCE OF THE ENTIRE FUCKING MOVIE.\r\nBAD.\r\n2\/10 - one for Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and one for Natasha Lyonne featuring a small part.","id":"5942ac85c3a3686c6c00d8ab","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5942ac85c3a3686c6c00d8ab","movie_id":301325}

I have seen even worse than this one. So to me it is an average except the end, otherwise below average. Yes, the conclusion was terrible, seems like they don't want a continuation.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> An extra large size love and food story.\r\n\r\nIt is an excitement to explore the world films, but I'm always happy to end up in a Japanese film, because it is one of the language, people and culture I adore a lot. Followed by a success of the television anime series, this live-action film was made in which both were based on a manga series of the same name. Other than that there's no connection between the film and the series.\r\n\r\nA good manga book can make a perfect anime film or a series, because they both share a similar visual illustration. Surprisingly, this film managed to narrate as good as the anime does and this is not the first time to achieve such treat, but surely it is one of those to successfully transform a manga into a live-action.\r\n\r\nThe main character Takeo Goda was just like the Shrek. Like bigger, taller, stronger and scarier as well, but inside, he's a tender hearted, except this story does not take place in a world where magic exists. When I heard about the film and its storyline, I was praying for not to be another 'Big Man Japan' or like the Hulk kind of physical transformation. I'm relieved after watching it, and ended up liking it more than what my initial anticipation was. It looks more a fictional creation, but this thing happens in the real world as well, except those comical characters.\r\n\r\nAn unusual high school love story, but it all begins with two think friends. One is a very fine looking boy adored by all the girls in the school and the other one is not so good looking Takeo who steps in if anybody is in a trouble and takes no credits for it. In a such event while rescuing a girl over eve teasing incident, he finds the victim very beautiful. Later they three becomes very close and over their daily meeting, Takeo begins to fall for her despite his friend and her making progress. So the rest of the film reveals all the development between them and concluding the narration with a cute little cliched twist.\r\n\r\n> \"A person's heart... Why can't we move it the way we want to? Even though it's our own heart... It doesn't listen to what I say! I wonder if it's because I'm stupid?\"\r\n\r\nFeels like a typical Japanese comedy with a unique idea, but the scenes were better if not makes it you go for a loud laugh. I confess that I did not laugh much, but surely I enjoyed every bit of it. That's the difference between having a good time, laughing and depressed over a film. It is a food film as well, but I did not realise until the final act.\r\n\r\nI recently saw the first season of the Amazon's 'Just Add Magic' which is about the recipes for making a food that delivers wish (magic) and this film as well without magic in it tells how to impress the one you love and them to fall for you. It is not just a comedy, it was also a cute and sentimental romance, that specially aimed for the teen audience.\r\n\r\nIt was a good balance in the theme and its contents. Because of having a physically strong character, the film did not go for a full exposure. Either be it the karate championship or the amusement part disaster scenes, it evolved smartly with obviously a comical relief. Feels silly for the film characters not to disclose their feelings to each other. But it helped a simple love story to be a complicated love triangle. The actors were very cool, especially the one in the Takeo's role and then the girl with her heartbroken expression throughout the film.\r\n\r\nThere was a post credit scene, a funny way to finish it off. Now I'm thinking whether there will be a sequel or not. Because with a concept like this, definitely would come close to the original if that does not overtake it. It was not a very clever as you would have wanted, but a good entertainer as it promised in its trailer. I don't know the domestic release film rating, but I think it is somewhat PG, so it can be enjoyed by all despite a high school centric theme. I recommend it to everybody, though, remember some of you won't go to love it as much as I did, that does not mean I'm wrong, but we're different. Overall, it is definitely worth a watch and I won't deny that.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"57603eff92514166070016ad","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57603eff92514166070016ad","movie_id":356156}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Being young, having a beautiful girlfriend and other things that had done!**\r\n\r\nThey say its a prequel to the 1996 film 'My Sex Life' that I haven't seen, but this looked good and its not. I'm not sure how much one has to be familiar with the original film, though it does not matter much I think since it is a prequel. Because everything starts here and follows there. So I saw it, and I wanted to like it, but not fully impressed. The story was told in chapters. The opening was like some kind of a spy thriller, but soon when the episode 'Esther' begins, it turned into a romance drama.\r\n\r\nA man who has been investigated when another person with the same identity was found. So he reveals his school day's events, followed by his first girlfriend and complication surrounding it he had faced. That, how he had won her over the older boys and about his close friend, till leaving them behind to work in the central Asia. Mostly it is a love story with some twists in the affair, but how it all ends still remains mystery even after the narration ended.\r\n\r\nThe issue is it is not detailing anything, just reveals events of a youngster's romance life. Particularly the end was not good. So I think that's why I need to see the first film, resuming the narration could continue from where this one concluded. I leave (_b_l_a_n_k__s_p_a_c_e_) till I saw that and update this review, if I change my stance over this one. Even if I didn't like, still I would update it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile back to the review; it is like a French version of 'Flashbacks of a Fool'. Technically, there's no fault in this, only the screenplay did not convince me. The actors were so good, no doubt its a well made film that some people would enjoy it and I hope you are one of those.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"5851a24c9251416fad0199ce","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5851a24c9251416fad0199ce","movie_id":315575}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"RELEASED IN 2015 and directed by Anne K. Black, \"Mythica: The Darkspore\" is the second film in the five-film fantasy\/adventure series about a limping servant girl with blossoming magical powers named Merek (Melanie Stone), who teams-up with a heroic warrior, Thane (Adam Johnson), a miscreant lothario, Dagen (Jake Stormoen), a priestess, Teela (Nicola Posener), and a hunky elf, Qole (Rocky Myers), for a journey to obtain all the shards of the Darkspore to keep it from the diabolical Szorlok (Matthew Mercer). Kevin Sorbo has a cameo.\r\n\r\nThe story takes place in an adventurous Medieval-like world where sorcery, elves, orcs, dragons and other fantasy creatures are real. If you like The Lord of the Rings, D&D, Warcraft, Conan or Sinbad you\u2019ll probably like the Mythica franchise. These movies were partly funded by a Kickstarter campaign with all the movies costing less than $100,000, except the fifth and final one. The first movie, \u201cA Quest for Heroes,\u201d cost $94,294 while this sequel cost $81,099. The production quality is incredible for such meager budgets, particularly if you\u2019re familiar with micro-budget productions. The Mythica films are basically just as good production-wise as \u201cDungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God\" (2005), a TV movie that cost a whopping $15 million (for a TV flick, that is).\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Darkspore\u201d is disappointing in comparison to the dynamic first film, in particular the first half where the transition from \u201cA Quest for Heroes\u201d is clumsy and unexciting. Thankfully, things perk up in the second half and make up for the weak first act, especially a fight with a dragon in the desert. In any case, be sure to see \u201cA Quest for Heroes\u201d before viewing this one.                           \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 47 minutes. WRITERS: Anne K.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The fast approach romance, fades away slowly.**\r\n\r\nI knew it was a romance film, but totally unexpected what I just saw. It was different, that's all, other than that there are many similar films that were already made. The film's focus was not the characters, but the phases and the pace of a romance. The love at the beginning and the same love at some time in the latter. The differences what the film highlights. But it's impossible without the characters and their perspectives. So, from the beginning to the end, how a romance can evolve, how it influences other around, all the fun, crazy stuffs, is the film.\r\n\r\nThe film was partially inspired by the director's own married life. Nice casting and performances. I felt like there was no depth in narration. Depth means, you can't understand the characters fully. Everything it lets you know are the events from where the film begins. So basically it is all about the romance and nothing else. Not even their professions, or the friends and any side incidents, except those topics were used in places in a small quantity to fill the void and make a clean flow of the story. The whole two hours is like about an insane romance. Again, that part divides into two, the first half of the film and the next half.\r\n\r\nIn the first half, it's all about the initiation. Girl meets boy, instantly fall in love with each other and do crazy things to build the character. It seems like any romantic film, but it all necessarily designed to manage what follows in the later part. Apart from the two who are well positioned from their professional level, it looked kind of like a rich guy meets an economically average girl. Then entering his world, and beginning to taste the royal lifestyle, as well as a sweet romance. The story was mainly told from the woman's perspective. The narration had double layer, going back and returning to present, the two timeline story was revealed to us.\r\n\r\n> \u275dI prefer not to be in love and not get hurt.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe woman seems intentionally met with an accident in the opening, and she begins to remember her recent past. Her unexpected crazy romance with a rich playboy. While recovering from the knee injury, she makes some friends and they all help each other to come out of their struggle. On the other side of the narration, revealed everything she went through. Not just a happy love story, but struggles over the time pass by. Having a child, being parents, the life drastically changes for both of them. Yet their love and care for each other remains somewhere in the deep of their hearts. Then there is a life, every moment is unpredictable. So how it ends was not that I surprised, because of its realistic.\r\n\r\nAt one point, I thought it could be the French 'The Notebook'. It did not have emotional end. I'm not saying about sad or happy ending, but the film was honest to the real world. How the second half turned out was the excellent twist in the narration, but done with slowly. This was about the people in their late 30s or 40s. That makes the film is mainly for middled aged people. Otherwise, if the characters and their generation were brought down to like the 20s, the film would have been totally another level. And would have had a more target audience. That's what most of the Hollywood films focus on these days.\r\n\r\nThe same film in Hollywood would have been one of the frontrunner for the Oscars. The performances were really great. Particularly Emmanuelle Bercot was awesome. As usual, Vincent Cassel showed his class, proved why he's one of the top stars in France. I thought two hours was a bit long, but the writing was good, they had filled the film nicely with the events that helped further to grow stronger in the following scenes.\r\n\r\nDespite I consider it a nice film, I don't think everybody would enjoy. They might like it at the end, enjoy watching is not that comes along. Because it is not an entertainment film, nor an art. As I said before, realistic about the relationship and its maturity in the modern world. The other options for the relationship, despite putting all the efforts to save it like people did in the previous century. So, all I say is choose it wisely.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59bd92829251413561019871","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59bd92829251413561019871","movie_id":329805}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Whose fault is it anyway!!!!**\r\n\r\nHere I'm back to review a Korean film. I have seen hundreds of Korean films, but seems I have never seen a story about youngsters like this one. Or probably not in a long time. An interesting storyline, written and directed by a debutant filmmaker. My first impression was the Korean version of 'Interrogation'. Well, almost looked like one. Only it was less violent. It is one of those films, some people could feel uncomfortable watching, because of the overwhelming annoyance of negativity or tortures. If you have seen 'Brokedown Palace', you will get it. But there are many other similar flicks that you could be familiar with a few.\r\n\r\nIt was not a straight narration. Often revealed recent past events to make the story straight. It all begins when four friends chased by the cops on the foot in a late night street. That looked fun, but it was not. Because the story takes a twist on the earliest. One of them got into an accident. So their getaway ends there. Now being caught, the film set to reveal why they were running away from the cops. It was a slow interrogation. Meanwhile, the four boys' individual lives briefed. Where they were coming from, their family, the social status and why they have ended in another town.\r\n\r\nThe film did not dig deep enough on everybody, except surrounding the mystery on what the film is dealing with. It shows the strength of their friendship. When one of them got seriously injured, how solidly they stood for him and each other. Well, that's what they wanted to do, but they have entangled with the complication in the police station. Their effort to make the cops to understand what really had happened, especially their parents intervene to free them, seems nothing's working. It went on like that, but at some stage, it's set to test their friendship bond. The bond of a very long relationship. From there, where it all heads were a little emotional conclusion.\r\n\r\n> -xX] Stop avoiding the facts! We'll tell them what really happened. [Xx-\r\n\r\nNo matter who's the filmmaker, even if he's a newcomer or a big shot, high or small budget film, or there any familiar faces around, the Korean films all are almost has the same vibe. I mean any story, any situation turned to be so hard hitting that would remain in our minds for a very long time even after finished watching. Take an example of this film, it had a simple story. The developments were nothing other than going back to just a few hours earlier to reveal important parts. There was no twist like that going to flip the entire event before the end. But still it had one twist, in the form of the other way around, which steered it towards the emotional side.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes the emotions, not a typical tearjerker I have been expecting. Because truthfully, I wanted it to be that way, ready to compromise with cliches. So they knew the viewers would expect it, hence the story ended differently. As for me, it is not just under-rated film, but also under-noticed decent film. If I meant decent, that's it was a much, much better film. Definitely slow moving, but that's the way it is and worked out well. All the lead actors were good, even those are in small roles. Surprisingly, for such an intentional drama, the film had been just a 90 minutes long. Why surprised? Because I have seen an usual Korean film's average length is very close to two hours or just above.\r\n\r\nI have read some negative remarks, but one should focus well enough to understand completely. It's not about tough platform, but watching it undisturbed could ensure there's nothing wrong with the film. Only they have failed to acknowledge it. There's nothing much movement in the narration like stunt sequences. Everything was conversation and\/or interrogation. The drama. But major uncertain is every key event that could possibly solve the puzzle were kept locked away. Something they wanted to tell like from the real world perspective. Especially in the aspect of arrogant cops and self rescuing parents. It's totally hard truth that's depicted nicely in this cinematic version. If you are asking my opinion, I absolutely say go for it.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"5a7720910e0a26643304c2f4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a7720910e0a26643304c2f4","movie_id":381375}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Kuttram Kadithal has a lot in common with this year's other release, Kaaka Muttai. As in that film, here, too, we have an isolated incident that, fuelled up by the media attention, gets blown up into a larger societal issue. But, while that film was a feel-good human drama that was content to gently satirise the issues of the society, Kuttram Kadithal makes no bones about the fact that it wants to start a social awakening. There are times when we even sense that the director is just ticking off the checkbox of issues that he wants to highlight \u2014 sex education in schools, corporal punishment, sensationalism in the media, faith and being human, et al \u2014 with characters talking directly to the audience. But the film is made with such conviction and there is sure-footedness in the storytelling that it hits you hard at several moments.\r\n\r\nThe film's director, Bramma takes his time to set up his characters. We are first introduced to the newlyweds Merlin (Radhika Prasidhha) and Manikandan (Sai Rajkumar), who behave like any other young couple. We see them sharing a cosy moment on the bed talking about how many kids they want and so on. And then we learn that their inter-religious marriage does not have her mother's \u2014 a hardcore Christian, who distributes pamphlets on the Lord and organizes religious gatherings at her home \u2014 blessings, and this has been worrying her. Next we see the school's principal (Kulothungan Udayakumar) and his wife (Durga Venugopal), who is a teacher in the same school, Udhayan (Pavel Navageethan), a fiery communist with a good heart (are there anything else, at least in the movies?) who believes in making the rich accountable for their mistakes, Cheziyan (a winsome Master Ajay), a charming brat and his auto driver mom (Sathya). We are introduced to the teachers at Merlin's school and through the lovely montage song, Kaalai Nila, Bramma skillfully establishes the worlds of these characters. We even get to see Manikandan's workplace and these places feel so lived in.\r\n\r\nBut then things turn tense when Merlin, substituting for another teacher, slaps Chezhiyan, in a moment of anger. The boy faints and is rushed to the hospital where the doctors tell them he has slipped in to coma. The principal realises Merlin cannot be squarely blamed for this incident and anticipating hostility, urges Merlin to leave the city with her husband for a while. Udhayan, who happens to be Cheziyan's uncle, wants justice for the kid and demands to speak to the teacher who hit his nephew. In the meantime, the media gets whiff of this incident and soon, becomes a sensation.\r\n\r\nBut what stops Kuttram Kadithal from reaching the lofty heights it aspires is the blatant manipulation towards the end. The scenes where Merlin goes missing and Manikandan is forced to search for her (and finds her by the railway track), the one where a reporter and her husband sit in a coffee shop and discuss the incident as if they are the thought bubbles of the audience, or the scene where the reporter tries to corner Chezhiyan's mother seem to belong in a different film with a different sensibility... The are also elements that stick out from the organic nature of the storytelling and seem affected... like a plastic bag that gets trapped in Merlin's feet, the overtly religious symbolism (a cross reflected on a rear view mirror), the presence of koothu dancers during a scene, a street performer whipping himself on the street as Merlin passes by. And even though we already care for these characters just as they are, Bramma decides to make them even more sympathetic by giving us their back stories to the tune of Bharathi's Chinnanchiru Kiliye. Imagine reading a book where most of the paragraphs are italicized, underscored or in all caps. That is how these portions make us feel.\r\n\r\nSuch missteps and excesses can be easily excused as first-time filmmaker's overeagerness in a film that is so lovingly crafted, and filled with moving performances and hard-hitting moments like when Merlin meets Chezhiyan's mother and seeks her pardon, or the one where she heroically admits to the press that her act of hitting the little boy was wrong, even if it hadn't been the cause for him slipping into a coma. You will be hard-pressed to see a more poignant scene this year as the superb one where the principal's wife reveals why they understand the pain of losing someone to a furious Udhayan.","id":"5608b30a92514154690018c0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5608b30a92514154690018c0","movie_id":330428}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A creepy Christmas tale of a family.\r\n\r\nProbably no one would have anticipated it, this is a surprise movie, especially being an anti-Christmas theme. Possibly the one last time I enjoyed was a Finnish film called 'Rare Export', that's the name came in my mind after watching this. I also could not believe this rated PG13, well it differs in other countries. Of course, there are plenty of intensified frightening scenes, even for the adults, but no gores. The violence parts were well edited\/shot, yet it makes sure they're still part of the story without showing them. I think it was a smart filmmaking keeping in mind the family audience. So in the end, I guess it paid off well.\r\n\r\nI did not know the plot, as well as a few words that referred in the movie. But while watching it, I was worried about the graphics, because this is not a big budget film. Even the cast was not from the top league. Overall, it achieved a good result, that's the point. There are no major flaws as well, and the small ones can be easily ignorable. Because on the other side the movie provides a good suspenseful entertainment that makes you not to move the body or the eyeballs. After I'm saying all these, you should at least consider giving it a shot. But remember there's no story in it, it was constructed on a panic situation during the heavy blizzard when one after another begin to disappear.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"5729fb2ec3a3682aa6001480","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5729fb2ec3a3682aa6001480","movie_id":287903}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Behind this man's success there was a woman and other things.\r\n\r\nThis is not a bad semi-biographical music-drama with a little romance in it, but many of us have no idea of its existence because it is not a Hollywood. For me it was just an above average, because of the first 30 minutes. In those narrations it was very boring, you know a film needs a good opening and this film's first impression failed. But next one hour, till the final scene was much better. Except I hated the whispering dialogues which this film had everywhere.\r\n\r\nI don't know who is Chet Baker, thanks to this film for introducing him to me. This story is no special compared to other biopics related to music and singing. Like fame and drugs taking over the career where one struggles to rise back from the fall. This is the same old crap, except it is a jazz theme, but everything was lightly portrayed without making much complication. I mean it centres only on the romance and music, everything else was never given preference. Except in parts where the couple seeks support from the outside world like the opportunities and meeting their parents.\r\n\r\nThe film focused only a certain stage of the life of Chet. It is very sad not knowing his earlier life as well as his Europe settlement in the later on which looks much more interesting than what they narrated in this. Ethan Hawke was great as usual and so his co-stars. There's no harm for once viewing, but some people feel it more depressing than enjoyable or entertaining. So the film is for the selected audience and make sure you're one of them before going for it. \r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"57a36f479251416b97006026","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57a36f479251416b97006026","movie_id":327528}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Bhooloham is set in north Madras and revolves around the boxing community in the place. There are two warring boxing groups in the locality and Deepak Shah, a media moghul, hits upon the idea of holding a boxing championship by exploiting their rivalry. With his smooth operator ways, he has no difficulty in getting Bhooloham, a boxer seeking to avenge the loss of his late father in the ring, fight against Arumugham, whose father had defeated the former's father in the tournament. The hot-headed Bhooloham puts Arumugham in a critical condition by knocking him out in their match, but has a moment of epiphany and decides to hang up his gloves for good. But Deepak, who is counting on the tournament to bring untold riches to the channel, will not let him withdraw that easily. He stages a match between Bhooloham and the national champion Guru Dayal by deceit and forces Bhooloham to take on Steven George, a notorious international champion, in the final match. Can the hot-headed Bhooloham see through his game plan?\r\n\r\nBhooloham is written by director SP Jhananthan and though the director's fingerprints are evident in most places, it is in the climax that they are very apparent. It is structured as a sports film, but it is actually a rant against sensationalism in the TV media, capitalism, and even an unintended plug for the Indian government's Make in India initiative. As he did in his own film, Purampokku Engira Podhuvudamai, earlier this year, Jhananthan uses this plot to spell out discussion points for the society. Director Kalyanakrishnan's filmmaking style is loud but it suits the tone of the writing and given that the characters, too, are written as over-the-top individuals, the film doesn't grate once we have settled in after the first few minutes. The milieu of the film feels authentic and that is the director's biggest triumph. He nicely captures the sub-culture of boxing that is popular among the people of north Madras and we get to see their beliefs and their values through the actions of some of the characters. The film's digs at the amount of sensationalism and commercialisation in the reality shows of TV channels is also spot on \u2014 Deepak keeps telling his executives to instigate people and the screaming promo videos turn a boxing competition into war, while the kind of sponsors that the programme attracts are witty alludes (Palakalar Cool Drink, Muru Muru Chips) to existing soft drink, snack and health brands.\r\n\r\nThe director also exploits Jayam Ravi's tendency to go overboard and the actor, with his exaggerated acting style and toned physique actually makes us believe he is Bhooloham. But the other actors are typecast. Prakash Raj is once again given a role of a scheming villain and given that we had only recently seen him in such a role in Inji Iduppazhagi, we get a sense of deja vu. Even the arrogant north Indian (Arpit Ranka) and burly foreigner (former professional wrestler Nathan Jones, who seems to have been game enough to dress up in drag) are stereotypes. And Trisha, who plays Sindhu, Bhooloham's love interest and ardent fan, looks out of place and never feels like she belongs in this setting. She seems to have been roped in just to balance the testosterone on screen.\r\n\r\nThe film wants us to believe that a TV channel can wield an inordinate amount of power over the viewers, who will hardly question its decisions.But what mainly lets it down is the predictability of the plot. Every twist and turn is visible a mile ahead, so it brings down the excitement that we should ideally feel in films of this genre. And the climactic bout is, in fact, hilariously staged, and when Steven, who, until then, had been built up as a psycho who uses boxing as an excuse to kill, has a change of heart, for no apparent reason, it is hysterical.","id":"5683671192514131df013d6f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5683671192514131df013d6f","movie_id":280877}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Meet the most savage people of the American native.\r\n\r\nThis was one of the three western films I've watched back to back recently. The other two were 'The Salvation' and 'The Homesman'. They all were totally different from each other and I enjoyed them a lot. I did not know what this title means, but I learnt it before going for it which means some kind of axe used by the American Indians. So I have waited for that moment to know why the film's called that and then, omg, I was very shocked, totally uncomfortable to watch that part. I felt like it was a western version of 'The Hills Have Eyes'.\r\n\r\nThis was a road movie. A group of peoples' journey to rescue those who were abducted by some mountain tribes. The rescue was the third act and the rest of the film was about how they make into that remote place. Obviously a slow pace, makes you sit whatever position you want, but after the 90 minutes you will be more focused than before as the narration gets tense. The best part of the film in any western the audience were looking for finally arrives. It was a simple, but very strong and disturbing.\r\n\r\nThe cast was the plus point, everyone did their part best. Even the music and the locations were very nice and appropriate. One of the rare western films I've seen, with a mix of horror-terror. This is the cheapest film and shot within a month of time, but a fine production and completely unexpected film. Possible for a sequel, but I think that's not a good idea unless it retains the same crew. If you're okay with a slow narration, then you will enjoy it. Compared to the opening, when it ends, you will feel satisfied. It is not a greatest western of all time, but still worth a watch.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"5787c6c292514131c2000f77","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5787c6c292514131c2000f77","movie_id":294963}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"It's sure to be a bone of contention...\r\n\r\nWritten and directed by S. Craig Zahler, Bone Tomahawk stars Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox, Richard Jenkins and Lili Simmons. Music is by Zahler and Jeff Herriott and cinematography by Benji Bakshi.\r\n\r\nAh, yes, the horror western hybrid, a most difficult thing to get right at the best of times, even harder to entice newcomers to the sub-genre splice if they don't particularly like horror or westerns! This is a tough sell, a pic of startling originality, but of homage worthiness as well, that it kind of feels like a film made for a secret society of film fans. A society perhaps like the Troglodyte tribe who dominate the horror aspect of this particular tale.\r\n\r\nPlot is set in the wild west, where after a set of circumstances leads to the kidnapping of three people from the local jail - by members of the Troglodyte tribe, four men set off on a rescue mission...\r\n\r\nHow splendid to find a narrative that isn't afraid to nod towards one of the most revered westerns of all time, yet be its own entity at the same time. Bone Tomahawk will polarise opinions, no question about it, the whole middle section involves a travelogue pumped by characterisations and a need to set the stage for what will occur in the final third. However, to even think that the four horsemen of the apocalypse bulk of this movie is mere slow time cinema is unfair, for dark comedy is at work - a racist horse? Surely not?. \r\n\r\nSo the screenplay not only sparkles with wit, but it also pulses with drama, drama that comes from human stubbornness. Be it men who know that no matter what will happen, they will maybe die in honour due to mistakes or mismanagement, or just a matter of redemption, this mission on the surface seems pure folly, but in reality there is more at work here.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Some farmers are not born farmers, they're made.**\r\n\r\nThe last Israel film I saw, I did not like much, but this time it is opposite. I liked this theme, about the farmers who are the feeders of the world and they're declining. But this film is not here to discuss about that topic, just a different angle tale like three different generations of the same family and theirs take on the family business, that means farming. It is every parent's duty to support their children, particularly if their kids shows more interest in something, they must not discourage it. This is a lovely film, especially coming from the Israel, because the film might be made in Israel, but its about the different ethnic people and the message was very bold.\r\n\r\nThis is a story of an Iranian farmer family of a young boy with his two parents and a grandfather living in the rural Israel. The father and boy has lots of differences, like the father is trying to build a future by extending his turkey farm for the boy. But the kid is different, he does not want to take over it, that's the right time his uncle arrives from the United States. Seems he's going to stay for a while, despite he's the one who escaped from this life for a better one. Meanwhile, he spots his nephew's talent and gives a full support, but the father and his father's insistence, the family loses its strength. So the rest of the narration is to focus whether the family patches their differences and fall back to happily ever after or if not, then what's going to happen.\r\n\r\nA very inspiring film. The narration was not focused from one character, but kind of neutral. Sometimes, it was from the father's eye like how hard he works for his family. He was into farming because of no choice left after his brother abandoned him years back. Now his son is in the same battle as his brother was. Since he's the only child, he has no other option like his father. The rural kids too can dream big, but what this kid is interested in is merely a hobby in the eyes of his father. That's where the uncle comes in. If you ever had an uncle, probably most of you would know what I meant. Because I too was encouraged by mine. So I do understand what this boy is fighting for.\r\n\r\n> \"If you bend a branch too hard, it breaks.\"\r\n\r\nSince it is a foreign film, I don't know anybody from this. Probably they're new faces, but theirs character executions were phenomenal. Everybody, all the main cast was so impressive. The credit must also go to the director who also wrote the screenplay. It was Israel's official entry for the 88th American Academy Awards in the best foreign film category, but did not make into the final five. Recently I have been watching some good rural based films and this is another great addition to my collection. This is not a masterpiece and we know that, but still there's a lot of reason why one should watch it.\r\n\r\nI feel this kind of themes need a serious uplift by the viewers, because what this film revealed was not like any city based film with the plot that revolve around crime, thriller, mystery, but a pure drama. Being a farmer or born in a farmer family, what life they inherit, especially the question of how much they would be happy doing farming for their rest of the life. In urban, people change their professional field often, but that's not an option here for them. You can call this the Israel's 'October Sky', but the story lacked to concentrate more on the kid. Because they wanted a clean balance between all the film characters and also the message to deliver in a striking way. So the filmmakers did their best and also the actors, that's why the film received very well.\r\n\r\nNot just for the children, but a good family film. In fact a film for everybody, I definitely suggest it. But there are some flaws like I know these days kids are very curious about learning new things, particularly in a practical way like tools in the hands. Though how this boy developed his skills remains a question. I mean hailing from a rural where he has less resources like you can say the books about his interested field or anyone who are in that field to inspire him or assist him. Initially we know that he's up to something, but then in a few minutes later he already mastered it. This is not a big deal, particularly in the films, so it does not affect to enjoy it or what it tells the society. There are many good reasons to watch this than to neglect it for its minor flaws. So I hope you watch it.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"580e49b89251416e10001bf5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/580e49b89251416e10001bf5","movie_id":358913}

{"author":"Shreyance Parakh","content":"**Good intentions, average execution**\r\n\r\nThough I'm an admirer of Neeraj Pandey's work, Baby was not among the same league as Special 26 and 'A Wednesday', which was a class apart. Most Indian audiences would like this movie a lot but for me it was a case of an average movie that could've been a great one. There were a lot of loop holes(not particularly plot holes) and it could have been cut short by about 10-15 minutes. Some dialogs seemed as if they've been included just to please the audiences like Akshay's wife saying more than once \"Marna mat\"(Don't die). In fact she was one of the only miscast of the movie. Started 'not liking' her from her very first scene. First half felt like somewhat dragging, but the second half must've infused interest in the majority.\r\n\r\nThe movie had its pros too, first of which was the star-cast and the acting. Akshay Kumar was great, which he always is in these kind of roles, and everyone supported hi beautifully, be it the fight sequence from Tapsee Pannu, or the supporting roles of Anupam Kher and Rana Daggubati. Danny Dengzongpa seems to be in the second innings of his career and I'd love for him to play an elongated part in this one. Other good things about this movie were that it seemed good on the technical front and the research behind it bore fruits like the rest of the director's works. Finally, Rasheed Naz must be the perfect person to play 'Maulana Mohammed Rahman'.\r\n\r\nI personally liked D-Day, which was based on the similar story-line, a lot better than Baby though the majority might differ. Hence I won't say to stay away from this one, instead go for it and decide for yourself.","id":"590b29839251414f8d01514c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/590b29839251414f8d01514c","movie_id":314389}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**For some people, living a normal life is a challenge!**\r\n\r\nTeen girl's film, but no usual romance-comedy. There are some small clich\u00e9s, but being it is an action film, those parts looked kind of small. Yeah, nice casting. Hailee was really cool. The 'Descendant' girl Dove was good as well. The rest of cameos like Samuel L. Jackson and Alba was fine. It was from the director of 'Fanboys'. It tells the story of a girl trained to be an assassin from a very young age who escapes the centre to live a normal life in the real world. And that's where she struggles to blend in, as well as to overcome from the tailing troubles of the past.\r\n\r\nA well entertaining film, if you are not expecting anything big. It got a few great action sequences. Except Sam L. Jack, it is totally a chick film and most probably suitable for everyone for viewing. I enjoyed it, but I don't think I want a sequel for it. Particularly business wise that won't do well as this one was not received well by the film critics. Despite I approve it for a go, the rating wise it is just an average film. Sometimes that's where opinion divides for a film about what we felt watching it and how we're going to rate it later on.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"591b61b7925141061e06aff2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/591b61b7925141061e06aff2","movie_id":248574}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Complexity isn't the time maze, but the romance.**\r\n\r\nI don't remember when I saw my last Thai film. Looks like it has been nearly 3 years. Usually I like Thai films, particularly they are famous for small budget romance or horror films. I was drawn into Thai films, mainly for the teen romance-comedies from last one decade that I have seen and liked plenty of them. Really happy to be back and this time the film I picked was a little different theme which is a time- travel. I felt it was not bad, but felt should have been improved in a few areas.\r\n\r\nThe film is about the teenager Kong. When he upset with his parents who are fighting frequently, he decides to spend a night out. So makes a quick call to his friend in a rainy night. A while ago, he had found some old pictures, and a pager with a message beeping. Now he does a crazy thing by responding to it which transports him to the year 1995. He's not yet born, but he finds his parents' romance stumbling over another girl. He decides to sort it out and after the task how he makes back was revealed with a twist.\r\n\r\nOne thing I find hard in Thai films is the names of the actors, which are too long and almost impossible to pronounce. But I know a few actors, only by recognising them than by names. The last time I saw Pimchanok Leuwisetpaiboon in a small role from 'Bangkok Knockout'. But nobody can forget her from 'A Little Thing Called Love' as Nam. In this, the story was not presented from her perspective, though she was good in the character Som. The character was almost similar, like crazily being in love with her senior.\r\n\r\n> \"You have to feel like feeling good about someone and secretly falling in love.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the time travel, this film was nothing special. They did not prioritise on that part, but concentrated more on the event followed. And again, I'm little disappointed on that, as the characters had flaws to fit-in in the time maze. Like if it was a loop, somebody from the future should have recognised the Kong, particularly his parents. So some parts of the film need to be explained, particularly for Kong completely exposing himself in the alternate time.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, it was a decent entertainer. Especially if you are not a Thai or don't know the Thai language, then the percentage goes down a bit. Because most of the comedies were hard to catch up in the subtitle translation as its meaning altered. Since it took place in the 90s, we don't know what was the trend in the Thailand at that time, especially the local music industry where most of the film plot revolved.\r\n\r\nThat's not it, the final twist lifted the film a bit, but from the romance perspective, it remains unclear as the time gap influenced it to end in one way. It might be foolish to expect, but a sequel to built a story on that to solve the second romance track could work. Apart from one of the actors I mentioned earlier, the rest of the cast was excellent as well.\r\n\r\nOne of the major issues with the screenplay was the romance which is not deep enough to impact. Kong had perspective, but all the romance sentiments were held with Tom. The film focused on the task Kong has taken than Som's romance. Anyway, the film will work for most of the viewers, particularly for the youngsters. So I don't think it can be classified as a below average. For me, it hangs between 'average' and leaning mostly towards 'good'.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"585edb3292514115c0012df6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/585edb3292514115c0012df6","movie_id":358329}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This movie is absolutely ludicrous! The core of the story is simply unbelievable. However, this is movie meant to entertain and I dare say that the target audience is not exactly my age. This is clearly a teenage movie. Well, I guess that there is still a bit of a child in me because I found it rather entertaining even though, with a bit less \u201cHollywoodish\u201d and more intelligent directing it could have been a lot better.\r\n\r\nI would say that this is a quite nice family movie. Well not for the really young of course due to the amount of action. Saying that this is a family movie is probably going to annoy a lot of people in the \u201cbible belt\u201d due to previously mentioned action as well as the fact that there is a bit of partying going on, including consumption of fermented and even distilled beverages on but hey, I am Swedish, when I was a kid, way too long ago, there was not a teenager around that had not tasted HB which is the Swedish term for \u201cHembr\u00e4nt\u201d or in English home brewed alcohol.\r\n\r\nAnyway, unless you are a moral fanatic, there is really not much to be upset about in this movie apart from the laughably ludicrous story. Kids being trained as assassins from young age. Ehh, okay. Could have been half plausible if it was not for the \u201ctraining\u201d scenes in the beginning of the movie. Toddlers operating machine guns and driving cars like Vin Diesel? Okay, maybe they were just above toddler age but I was laughing so hard it was difficult to judge.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is pretty much without surprises (if you have read the blurb at least). Our heroin goes to school and, deprived of a normal childhood, finds it not so easy as she perhaps imagined. Here is where I feel there are a lot of missed opportunities. Our teenage assassin never really gets to truly impress. Sure, she gets to do a bit of clobbering but it is constantly hidden in a veil of ridicule. With a more intelligent script writer this could have been a really cool part but as it plays itself out it is just \u201cokayishly\u201d funny.\r\n\r\nNaturally a few bad guys arrive in order to crash the party and, well, we get a bit more of the same as before just with some more action. The action is not bad, for this kind of movie at least, that has to be said. Unfortunately the way it plays itself out is a wee bit disappointing. It is just unintelligent. The beginning of the movie seemed to hint that these teenagers were trained in all areas, including the grey cells, but certain scenes where just, \u201cI cannot believe that you were that stupid\u201d, and for the record I have a teenage son that made the same remarks!\r\n\r\nNevertheless it was indeed a quite entertaining movie. Far from great but definitely worth watching.","id":"561264349251415e530084af","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/561264349251415e530084af","movie_id":248574}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"While his films since Magadheera have become ambitious in terms of scale and narrative, SS Rajamouli is at heart a masala filmmaker and arguably, the best one we have in our country right now. You just have to look at how he gives every major character in Baahubali its own heroic introduction to realize how keenly he is attuned to the pulse of the audience and knows what button to push to make them cheer. We marvel at the hero's strength when he uproots a massive Shivalingam and carries it over to the waterfall; we are awestruck by the heroine's beauty and later, her bravery; we are thrilled when we see an aging warrior show his skill with the sword and terrified seeing the villain bring down a raging wild bull with his bare hands, and stirred by another lead's speech even as we are shocked by her appearance. These are terrific masala moments and Rajamouli shoots these scenes in rousing fashion and packs them in at regular intervals that we are constantly in thrall.\r\n\r\nShivu (Prabhas) is brought up by tribals but he is forever fascinated by the huge waterfall in the forest and keeps trying to scale it to see what is out there. A wooden mask gives him the drive to do it and he meets its owner \u2014 Avanthika (Tamannaah), a warrior who belongs to a rebel group trying to rescue their queen Devasenai (Anushka), who has been chained by the kingdom's evil ruler Palvaalthevan (Rana Daggubati). Shivu offers to go on a rescue mission little realizing how deeply he is connected to the characters involved in this game of thrones.\r\n\r\nBaahubali's narrative is influenced by everything from the Mahabharata and other Indian folklore to Rajamouli's own Magadheera. The backstory, involving the titular character Baahubali, is in fact, very much in the Mahabharata territory. Cousins, one good at heart and another evil, who are competing for the throne, a statesman warrior who is noble but is tainted because he is loyal to the wrong side, a scheming father who wants the throne for his son at any cost, a royal child who is rescued from a river and so on. And by the time we reach the abrupt end, which sets up the sequel, we are reminded of Kochadaiiyaan, which also chose to stop its story midway following a crucial revelation.\r\n\r\nAs for the visuals, Rajamouli takes his cues from varied sources \u2014there are scenes that recall the grandeur of SS Vasan's Chandralekha (the installation of Palvaalthevan's statue), the sweeping battle scenes of Peter Jackson's The Lord Of The Rings (the battle with the Kalakeya army), the dreamscape scenery in James Cameron's Avatar (Shivu climbing over a waterfall), the gorgeous acrobatic movements of Zhang Yimou's Hero (the scenes involving Sivudu and Avanthika), and even a dash of James Bond (an escape from an avalanche). But Rajamouli superbly weaves these influences together and adds his own inventive touch to these scenes, so that they come across as ingenious. Even the romantic track, which some might feel perfunctory and unwarranted, is imaginatively done.\r\n\r\nAnd with his technical team (or, should we call it an army), the director gives us one of the fantastically mounted films from our country. The sheer scale of the film is breathtaking. Art director Sabu Cyril and cinematographer Senthil Kumar, along with the VFX team (despite being clearly visible in certain shots, the the visual effects efforts work is very good) seem to have worked extra hard to make every frame appear grand, while Maragathamani's rousing score heightens the drama on screen (though, the songs aren't as effective).\r\n\r\nThe same cannot be said some of the actors who fall short in terms of performance. It is easier to buy Tamannaah as an angelic beauty than as a fiece warrior. Rana isn't menacing enough while Prabhas feels a bit lightweight, though we can appreciate the effort they have put into looking their parts. Thankfully, the seniors are very good \u2014 Sathyaraj as Kattappa and Ramya Krishnan as Sivagami, the caretaker queen, are the scenestealers while Nasser, who is seen with a shriveled arm, is his usual villainous self. And Madhan Karky finds the sweet spot for the dialogues where the Tamil doesn't sound out of place and at the same time, isn't too difficult to understand (as it happened with Selvaraghavan's Aayirathil Oruvan).\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of missteps too. An item number that appears during the hunt for a traitor just yanks us out of the period and puts us in contemporary mass hero movie territoty. A pre-war scene where the two sides involve in a dialogue comes across as implausible given that the enemy army is portrayed as bloodthirsty barbarians who are only interested in pillaging the lands and raping the women of the country they are attacking. There are some shots (even close-ups) where we see the actors speaking their lines in Telugu, which is jarring. The film also doesn't feel tightly edited, probably because of the decision to split the story into two parts. Some of the scenes continue longer than needed and this is especially true of the climactic battle sequence, which goes for almost 25 minutes! Yes, it is incredibly staged and there is never a dull moment, but we do feel the length. And when the film reaches its sudden end, the experience is very similar to what we feel when we are watching a movie (or a match) on TV and the power goes off right before the climax.\r\n\r\nStill, the film is a remarkable achievement that proves that the Indian film industry is still capable of creating grand spectacles.","id":"55b888b092514123d500140b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55b888b092514123d500140b","movie_id":256040}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Two brothers and their quest to find the truth.**\r\n\r\nA strange Danish film. It was a lot like the Danish version of 'The Addams Family'. Written and directed by a screenwriter for the notable films in different languages. This is the story of two brothers who embark a journey to a remote island after their father died. Because they learn they were adopted, so they go to look for their biological parents. They end up in a strange house with the strange people, but realise how they are related to each other. So the remaining part focused on the mysteries surrounding the house. When those things come out, the narration reaches its peak and brings the end.\r\n\r\nI think the title should have been 'Men & Animals'. If you watch the film you will know the reason, particularly after the final twist. As I had observed, many people liked it, but to me it was average. The idea seems very good, but the style was missing. Too ordinary presentation. If the approach was atypical like I said 'The Addams Family', it would have gained more popularity internationally.\r\n\r\nThe actors were good, shoot in the good places. Among all, Nikolaj was the familiar face. This is not your usual film, yet not for everyone. Maybe if you know the language, you might enjoy it better. The subtitle translated comedies are not that effective. Feels like I want to like it, since it was tagged as a comedy I did not get many laughs. So I won't stop you if you want to try it, but only tell you to be careful while choosing it, regarding what you are expecting from it.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"58446678c3a3683e1600bf88","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58446678c3a3683e1600bf88","movie_id":296313}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Andhadhi gets the structure of a crime film right. There are corrupt ministers, scheming robbers, eager police officers, backstabbing associates, crores of rupees... And director Ramesh Venkatraman keeps the plot just a little bit convoluted, so that we are unsure of the motivations of the characters and where things are leading to. There are the friends, Guna and Deva, who are aspiring to become police officers when we first see them and they manage to get into the force. There is the power minister Vallarasu, who demands Rs 300 crore as kickback from entrepreneur Rajesh for sanctioning his solar power plant project. The money gets stolen and an inspector is murdered. Guna and Deva are part of the team investigating this crime and their prime suspect is a notorious robber. Meanwhile, a businessman's son is kidnapped and there is suspicion that the same robber might be involved. And Guna stumbles upon a clue that makes him suspect the motives of Deva. What is true? Who can he trust? And, how can he nab the criminal and save the boy? These are the questions for which he has to find answers fast.\r\n\r\nOn paper, this plot promises a thrill ride of a film but sadly, despite having the bare-bones of a solid thriller, the film never feels compelling. A plot that is a web of intrigue and mystery is presented in rather dull fashion. Rather than getting into the plot, we are initially burdened with a lifeless romance (where lovers break into a duet at the prospect of going together to the grocery store!) and an uninvolving drama about Guna's attempts to become a cop. Both the writing and filmmaking at best resemble a student effort. Added to this, none of the leads look the part. They come across more like people at a costume party, and this makes it hard for us to take the characters \u2014 and the film \u2014 seriously. There is sign of spark here, but one cannot expect audiences to put up with such amateurishness just because it's a low-budget film.","id":"5618850dc3a36824560011bd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5618850dc3a36824560011bd","movie_id":270769}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Ant-Man?***  \r\n\r\nReleased in 2015, \"Ant-Man\" stars Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, a cat burglar who is offered redemption and the opportunity to be a hero. Michael Douglas plays his mentor, Hank Pym, and Evangeline Lilly Pym's daughter; meanwhile Corey Stoll co-stars as the heavy.\r\n\r\nIn my vast arsenal of old comics I have only one issue where Ant-Man is the main star: Marvel Feature #10, which featured Hank Pym as the hero, not to mention his wife, the Wasp, AKA Janet van Dyne. The character's run in that comic ceased with that very issue. By the 80s Scott Lang, a good-intentioned thief, became Ant-Man after stealing Pym's Ant-Man suit to save his daughter. With the encouragement of Pym, Lang became Ant-Man full-time.\r\n\r\nThe movie is based on these events and I was surprised at how entertaining it is considering how relatively minor the hero is. The movie even makes a joke about this when Ant-Man comes face-to-face with the Falcon (Anthony Mackie). Speaking of which, it's great to see the Falcon in action. It's also great to see Yellowjacket who, in the comics, was Hank Pym after Lang took over as Ant-Man. In the movie Yellowjacket is the villain (Stoll), which is okay since Pym's Yellowjacket in the comics sort of became a villain when he had a mental breakdown and was eventually divorced by Janet, the Wasp. The filmmakers incidentally did an excellent job with the Yellowjacket suit.\r\n\r\n\"Ant-Man\" was a surprise hit at the box office and understandably so. It's a quality superhero flick done with style and brimming with confidence. It's nothing more than this, but that's all it needs to be. It's nice to see Michael Douglas who was, believe-it-or-not, 70 years-old during shooting. He shines in the movie as Pym and could easily pass for ten years younger. I also really liked the Quantum Realm sequence when Lang is reduced to microscopic size.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 117 minutes and was shot in Georgia and San Francisco, CA.

It's a nice, light, fun heist movie with some pretty cool effects and a great cast of characters.\r\n\r\nMichael Pena, T.I. and David Dastmalchian make this movie so much more enjoyable. Not that Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, and Corey Still aren't great, but those three as a sidekick trio crack me up.\r\n\r\nEdgar Wright's stamp is all over this movie and it's a shame his directorial touch is missing, because he would have known what to remove to make it even better.\r\n\r\nBut all in all, Ant-Man is great entertainment with a feel good story about a man trying to be the hero his kid thinks he is.","id":"5c842634c3a3684e8cdacb22","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c842634c3a3684e8cdacb22","movie_id":102899}
{"author":"Gimly","content":"Less spectacle than most MCU films have been serving up, particularly in phase two, but the story and characterisation is actually a little stronger than the past couple of tales Marvel has served up.\r\n\r\nVillain Darren Cross, AKA \u201cYellowjacket\u201d (originally a hero in the comics) lacks the onscreen presence of top tier Marvel-evil Loki, but is certainly one of the stronger offerings the MCU has given us. His twisted relationship with his former mentor gives another level to this Marvel film not seen since _Winter Soldier_.\r\n\r\nNot so much a super hero film as a super heist film, _Ant-Man_ was a welcome refreshment to the comic book movie party, and though I always like to give myself some time to find exactly where MCU films fit in my overall experience, at the moment I would say _Ant-Man_ sits somewhere comfortably in the middle, maybe even a bit below, but is still well worth a watch, even for those who aren\u2019t deeply involved with the film series as a whole.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it.

{"author":"tmdb47633491","content":"A reminder of what movies can do. That is, revitalize the soul. I usually watch movies in spurts. I won't see anything for 9-13 months, because things in my life are going for the most part smoothly, but then comes this inevitable (it would seem) slide back into not so much a depression as much a soul-level detachment from reality. Lethargy, I guess you'd call it. So I put together 40-50 new things to watch and marathon at the pace of 2 or 3 per day, until I'm finished. Every time I do this, one or two movies come along that splash water on my face and bring me back to life. The rare breed of original, endearing, honest, careful and considered filmic experiences like 2001, or Ikiru, Hannah and Her Sisters, City Lights, or Anomalisa, are, for me, the antidote to a dying spirit.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Size doesn't matter if he's a superhero who committed to save the world.\r\n\r\nMy confession is I never read 'Ant-man' comics and I never knew such kind of superhero even exist in Marvel till this movie was announced. (But I know Danish film 'Antboy'.) So I'm glad they brought cinematic version of 'Ant-man' and I'm sure he'll return to the next 'Avengers' as they promoted strongly in this film itself to know what would be the audience response. I don't know others, but I definitely welcome the idea.\r\n\r\nAnother CGI magic, another Marvel's wonder. As long as they pick the right cast and crew with a good story, the sci-fi like this continues to rule the cinema world. It was a great team work, that must be appreciated. As usual the top notch visuals as well the performances, even the sidekicks. But I was surprised to see when Paul Rudd was attached to this project. I believed it would be a comedy sci-fi packed with full of action, and I was wrong. It was a simple tale, a heist theme and of course it was fun to watch, but never was a comedy movie.\r\n\r\nA wonderful beginning, especially for the first film in the series. You know strong foundation is the key to raise a building above. I know the sequels would only get better by progressing and it should be. Because in all the Marvel's superhero flicks, this one was the most family and young kids friendly. That does not mean there were no violence, but from the title to the characters and presentation, all were so casual and can be understood by all.\r\n\r\nIt was so great to see a legend like Michael Douglas to be a part in the modern movie. Now I am eager to see Evangeline Lily as Wasp-girl in the follow-up. It would be like Peter Pan and Tinker Bell, but in a sci-fi version. The extras were very interesting, I enjoyed them as well. If you're are yet to see the film, don't expect anything like Disney's 'Honey' trilogy, after all, if you enjoy the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) then you would do same for it which is the twelfth to follow.\r\n\r\n7.5\/10","id":"566ee3b4925141664f00f834","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/566ee3b4925141664f00f834","movie_id":102899}
{"author":"mattwilde123","content":"I like Paul Rudd and was hoping this would be as funny as 'The Guardians of the Galaxy' but it wasn't. It looked good and the direction was solid but I think it suffered from the constant screenplay rewrites that the film underwent by changing the screenwriters (Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish).\r\n\r\nI also felt it was a bit too long-winded and it was unbalanced.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"When Anegan opens, we are told that the year is 1962 and the setting Burma. Murugappan, a Tamil labourer, saves Samudra, the daughter of a rich Burmese general, at a local fair. She falls madly in love with him but her father is totally against it. But the Burmese coup d'etat takes place, and Murugappan tries to smuggle Samudra to India. However, they are betrayed by Mallika, the girl who was in love with the lad. The lovers jump off the ship but Murugappan is shot at and Samudra decides to die along with him. \r\n\r\nThe action shifts to the present and we see that these events are being narrated by Madhumitha, a game developer in Kiran's successful company (with the sinister name of Tentacles), who is undergoing regression therapy. The poster in her room is that of Aung San Suu Kyi, Samudra's classmate! Madhu says that she has come across characters from her past life and is convinced that she will also meet Murugappan in this generation. And, she does, in the form of Ashwin, a systems engineer in her own office! She starts wooing him and while he is not ready to believe in past life, develops a soft corner for her. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, after an accident, Madhu regresses and tells another story, of Kaali and Kalyani, set in Madras in the year 1987. Kaali is a tough guy who charms Kalyani, a Brahmin girl, with his righteousness and innocence but she is forced to agree to a wedding with Ravikiran, a business magnate. However, Kaali arrives on the wedding night and the lovers decide to elope but they are duped and murdered. And, the killer might be someone close to them in their present lives, waiting to kill them again! \r\n\r\nAnegan is pulp done perfectly well and KV Anand and his writers SuBa outdo themselves with this tale of reincarnation and revenge. The film certainly has the feel of a pulpy crime novel, which the writers are known for. \r\n\r\nDhanush is in terrific form here and just as he did in Velaiilla Pattadhari, the actor effortlessly makes Murugappan\/Ashwin\/Kaali seem both heroic and credible characters. It is hard to think of any other contemporary actor who could have pulled off the physical and emotional aspects of all these roles this convincingly. If he is effective as the scrawny labourer Murugappan and totally looks the part, he is very much relatable as Ashwin, the \"middle class\" systems guy. But the real scene-stealer is Kaali, the ruffian with a heart of gold. The shading he gives the character makes Kaali (who also gets to dance to the rousing Danga Maari) stand out from the similar rough-and-tough Karuppu of Aadukalam and the titular character of Maryan. The only place where he feels out-of-place is the brief role of Ilamaran, as his lanky frame doesn't go well with the princely costume. \r\n\r\nAmyra, in her Tamil film debut, gets a meaty role, and while, as Samudra and Kalyani, she's just another pretty girl falling for charming men below her social stature, as the perplexed Madhu, she is quite convincing. Karthik, who is rather subdued in the initial portions, lets loose in the climax and makes you understand why the character does what he does. \r\n\r\nAnand has never been a filmmaker who holds himself and here, he keeps throwing various elements at us \u2014 reincarnation, past life regression, illegal drugs, military coups, ghosts, underground video games, murder, mystery, red herrings and a handful of accidents (involving a giant wheel, a lift, a car, a lorry). But, unlike Maattrraan, which went off the rails after a promising first half, here, everything works and in gloriously fashion. He also displays a playful, lighter touch here, so we easily buy into the preposterousness of the plot. And despite the chaotic plot, there is clarity in the storytelling. There are traces of Magadheera, Enakkul Oruvan, Cloud Atlas and The Fountain, but these are mainly due to the reincarnation theme. The individual love stories seem a bit routine and the third act does become a little predictable and the moment when Ashwin, too, realizes his past is feels rushed and lacks impact, but even here, Anand ensures that we get those mass moments \u2014 like the scene where Dhanush brings the house down in the scene where he mimics and mocks Karthik and the way the villain is killed. Anegan is pure camp but also a hugely entertaining one.","id":"5502fd75c3a36826b9002e55","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5502fd75c3a36826b9002e55","movie_id":262973}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"When one thinks of a typical super-hero actioner, they imagine the boisterous boundaries that are associated with such an explosive genre: eye-popping special effects, outlandish and grand-standing villains, world domination escapades, complex yet flashy super-heroes that seem unreal and unapologetic and a big scale of unbelievable escapism that is tellingly becoming of a comic book epic on the big screen for the hungry eyes of the giddy moviegoer. Remember, all these described elements are not a bad thing when it comes to larger than life comic book\/superhero fantasies. In fact, we almost insist that our volt-minded vehicles have some kinetic kick to its pulsating, pithy adventures. After all, there is certainly nothing wrong with that approach to the cinematic sensationalism of summertime popcorn pleasers and the costumed heroes that take us on that daring, rollicking ride of magical mayhem.\r\n\r\nHowever, director Peyton Reed\u2019s \u2018Ant-Man\u2019 symbolizes a different texture and tone to the familiar action-packed world of Marvel Comics\u2019 outrageous universe both on the printed pages and in the dark movie theaters. It does not necessarily use the overwrought or ultra-stimulating tactics to sell its percolating product as a super-charged heroic fable of mighty manipulators out to save the planet in the tradition of frantic favorites such as \u2018The Avengers\u2019 film franchise for instance. Instead, \u2018Ant-Man\u2019 relies on its small and intimate take of quirkiness, introspection, a gentle doomsday message of despair and a measurement of an awkward man that wears his bugged-out wardrobe with a sense of curiosity and conviction. In essence, \u2018Ant-Man\u2019 is a costumed caper that is high-spirited in its low-key excitement\u2026something quite refreshing and revered in the wild and wacky world of Marvel Comics\u2019 representation of the super-studs and sasses that invade our cinematic sensibilities in the hazy days of summer.\r\n\r\n\u2018Ant-Man\u2019 lead Paul Rudd, an affable actor that has shown various levels of competence in both comedies and dramas over the years, is the unlikely source to don an ant-oriented attire and let his charm and cheekiness take over as the tiny bugged-eyed avenger of right and might. Rudd plays Scott Lang, a former troubled lawbreaker and gifted engineer whose demons come back to haunt him when he gets involved in the burglary shenanigans with his bad news buddies (T.I. and Michael Pena). The reason for Lang\u2019s lure back to crime: a cockeyed but convenient way to win over the affections of his estranged young daughter.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, another great analytical mind of mechanics and science in stand-offish Hank Pym (Oscar-winner Michael Douglas) is spotlighted as he too struggles to relate to his daughter as well in the pretty Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly). Anyhow, Pym has a colorful backstory as it is revealed that he used to save the world from harm as the underrated crime-fighter Ant-Man. There was no glory or special recognition for Pym\u2019s heroics as the buggy super-hero but his devotion to his crime-stopping craft was realized nevertheless.\r\n\r\nAs ANT-MAN Paul Rudd's Scott Lang has plans to stop the criminnal foolishness besides raiding a giant-sized picnic basket in Peyton Reed's modest costume caper.\r\nAs ANT-MAN Paul Rudd\u2019s Scott Lang has plans to stop the criminal foolishness besides raiding a giant-sized picnic basket in Peyton Reed\u2019s modest costume caper.\r\nThe conflicted father-daughter tandem of Pym and Hope eventually recruit the beleaguered Lang to climb into the exo-skeletal red-and-black suit and become the current Ant-Man to continue the mission of promoting goodness over evil. In this specific case, Lang\u2019s Ant-Man is asked to foil the nefarious agenda of Pym\u2019s former protege and associate Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) who threatens to expose the revolutionary shrinking technology to anyone sinister that offers him an insane and immediate price for such secretive scientific information that could jeopardize mankind in the long run. Of course, it goes without saying, that Cross has an ominous alter-ego in the vile Yellowjacket whose back-and-forth clashing with Lang\u2019s Ant-Man leads to the calculating and corrosive chess game of one skillful insidious insect trying to outwit and outmaneuver a conscientious one.\r\n\r\nSome may dismiss \u2018Ant-Man\u2019 as being too low-grade, cheesy and incidental in its confrontational canvas of saints versus sinners. Still, Reed\u2019s handling of his Marvel-inspired \u2018battle of the bugs\u2019 is a winning formula in simplicity because it does not have to be rooted in a spectacular and showy landscape as the other successful bombastic blockbusters that come out of the frivolous factory of Hollywood. Essentially, \u2018Ant-Man\u2019 demonstrates the right kind of personality and prestige for its presentation as a scaled-down comic book actioner steeped in the personalized disillusionment of the characterizations and their assorted psyches. Sure, \u2018Ant-Man\u2019 will not let anyone forget its popular competitor in the much glorified and iconic standing of another insect-fighting Marvel mastermind in \u2018Spider-Ma\u2019n anytime soon. Yet Scott Lang\u2019s Ant-Man is just as angst-ridden, impish, awkward and devoted as Peter Parker\u2019s resilient web-headed wonder Spidey.   \r\n\r\nThe drama unfolds so convincingly in \u2018Ant-Man\u2019 not so much because of the dire dilemma of comicbook goodness and badness but because of the examination of deteriorating relations between broken men and their families or more specifically between fathers and daughters. Both Rudd and Douglas are committed to their roles as the Ant-Men that saved the world with ease past and present but could not say the same thing about rescuing the domestic responsibilities that eluded them under their own roofs. As Lang tries to find an opening for forgiveness toward his little girl and remarried ex-wife (Judy Greer), his current adviser Pym struggles to put the pieces together with a disgruntled Hope that blames her father for the neglect of her well-being as well as the death of her beloved late mother known as the Wasp, a super-heroine that shined in her own shadow of accomplishment.\r\n\r\n\u2018Ant-Man\u2019 is a soulfully weird, witty sliced-down spectacle of a comicbook film that is rare in its skin to deliver the message of a connection not just to stamping out the cartoonish crime and chaos that is routinely found in the playful playground of Marvel\u2019s movie machine of high-powered personalities armed with skillful brute and brilliance. It also has something called heart and hope as it tackles the alienation and isolation of fathers and their vulnerable daughters. It will take more than a gigantic can of Raid to destroy the indomitable presence of \u2018Ant-Man\u2019 and what his hedonistic heroics, both physical and psychological, bring to the prized picnic table.\r\n\r\nAnt-Man (2015)\r\n\r\nWalt Disney Studios\r\n\r\n1 hr. 57 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, Crey Stall, Michael Pena, Tip \u201cT.I.\u201d Harris, Judy Greer, Bobby Cannavale, Wood Harris and Abby Ryder Fortson\r\n\r\nDirected by: Peyton Reed\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Comic Book Fantasy, Super-heroes, Action and Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s Rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)","id":"56207bd192514171cb006642","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56207bd192514171cb006642","movie_id":102899}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**To learn what happened on that particular evening!**\r\n\r\nIt is not great, but still a good film. Starred in an important role and directed by Tim Blake Nelson. I think he also wrote it decently that remind us similar classics. A multi-layered narrative, where everyone has connections or meets at one stage of the story. It sets in one fine evening followed by a mysterious tragedy. Then the story moves back in time for days to introduce all the characters and their intentions in the life. Different families dealing the different issues, but they all lead to that particular evening where it somewhere links them in and bring a fitting end with a twist.\r\n\r\nSo when the film nears the final segment, the curious among us rises. The common mistake we make while predicting the end is once again certain when the final push successfully takes us by a surprise. I am not saying it is a masterstroke, but comparing with the rest of the film, it was good. An independent drama film, except some sexual and drug references, it can be watched by the adults and matured teens, but the pace might trouble you in some parts with slowing a bit. \r\n\r\nActors were awesome. Since it is a multi-starrer, everyone had small screenspace, but excelled in that. The disappointment is Kristen Stewart, if you are going to expect more from her role. So the film lacks the star value. Having a good story, but not having the marketable stars made the film to sink deep bottom without a trace. Yep, as for now it needs more viewers, despite whatever result it produces. Other than that this film surely not bad as it was tagged. I will definitely recommend it.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"57d30ace92514154830007a5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57d30ace92514154830007a5","movie_id":277710}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Through the eyes of one who thinks everyone in the world is alike.\r\n\r\nThe film was based on the stage play. Originally it was meant for a short movie, but during in the production it was extended to a feature film length and ended up knocking the Oscars door. A R-rated stop-motion animation, which is the first in the history of the Academy Awards to get a nomination. My last stop-motion was the last year's 'Shaun the Sheep Movie', so that makes this kind of filmmaking is going extinct. For that reason alone, I just don't want to miss it out, as well as I prepared to enjoy every bit of it and so I suggest others to do the same if they find it interesting.\r\n\r\nMy expectation was quite simple which is entertainment. But usually animations are comedies, in that perspective, this is slightly a letdown. Wait, this film is for adults and of course the humours in this narration was delivered on its own style like a black comedy. It is a weird title right! But the film explains it in a simple manner. That's not it, there are more weird stuffs in it, like I was confused over the character voice tones for both the sexes and again the film had the reasons which will be revealed at a crucial segment.\r\n\r\nIt was something like 'Lost in Translation', about a middle-aged man named Michael Stone, who is on a trip to Cincinnati to promote his latest book. Slowly it unfolds what kind of person he's really and going further, his struggle in the married life comes the prime focus. So this tour opens a new door for him once again to fall in love which leads him for a tough decision to make. But at a certain extent, the reality check comes into play. About everything he's doing and all the life he left behind makes him feel he's trapped in some kind of delusion. His ultimate decision is where this tale going to conclude.\r\n\r\n> \"Sometimes there's no lesson.\r\n> That's a lesson in itself.\"\r\n\r\nThe camera never takes off its lens in its throughout narration on the main character, Stone. Right from the beginning till the final scene, the film follows him like in a real time. So the entire film was like everything that happened in a 24 hour. That's the character development you would get. Besides, there are scenes, like the sex part that may stun you. Because it was not like I have ever seen one, not in animation. Even compared it to the Hentai, Hentai was 2 dimensional pictures whereas this is technically a 3 dimensional, so the effect was much more realistic and the impact on the viewers definitely will be strong.\r\n\r\nThe real problem those who saw it to end up in a disappointment is that it's not your regular animation. Which is usually aimed for children and family audience, but adults too can have a great time, whereas this film had a very matured and sensitive contents. Maybe they did not want the display of the real life experience to be narrated with a bunch of toys. But in the perspective of stop-motion animation, it is a great artistic achievement. It is not only their anticipation that killed their joy, but failing to accept the fact that we see regularly in the live-shot films to see them again in a different format.\r\n\r\nWhat I liked the most in it was the message regarding the main character on his suffering. When he sits in front of the antique he bought for his son which makes him realise himself on what he's seeking in others around him. But what's his delusion is that he thinks the world is not balanced, everyone are alike. So what he actually needs is a redefined life, in which this film portrayed how close he came to one before everything shattered.\r\n\r\nThis is not just a comedy, but a very real film for the people who wants to understand the life on its different stages and threat it poses where every one of us go through in our lifetime. Surely it is no masterpiece, but there's no reason to ignore on the subject it deals. It will remain one of the best stop-motion animation, exclusively made for adults. There are grown up who simply ignore animations, because they think it is too cartoonish. Undoubtedly it will be a good film them to try.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"57603dc7c3a3687c5e0016fd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57603dc7c3a3687c5e0016fd","movie_id":291270}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I have to say that I did not have great hopes for this movie. However, I found it surprisingly enjoyable. As can be expected from a Marvel super hero movie it is not the most intelligent plot around but instead rather heavy on special effects.\r\n\r\nHaving said that the plot is not bad given the context. I have never read any of the Ant-Man comics so I had no idea what to expect. The little expectation I had was of some guy turning into some ant like creature smashing things left right and center. So it was somewhat of a surprise to me when I found out that the guy was actually shrinking himself to ant size. Actually I went a bit \u201cwhat the f\u2026\u201d when I first realized this and felt that this was going to be boring.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the end, I felt it worked out quite well. If it would have just been about some guy shrinking himself then it would indeed have been somewhat boring but the added coolness of this guy being able to command armies of bad-ass ants really helped stave of the boredom.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote above it is a Marvel super hero movie so it is heavy on special effects and, personally, I felt they where quite okay. There is of course quite a bit of action in the movie as well as a bit of humour. I quite liked the parts where the Ant-Man and his nemesis slugged it out in a children\u2019s room and a giant size Thomas the Tank Engine was thrown through the roof and into the garden. Maybe I liked it because Thomas the Tank Engine is a TV show that my kids liked to watch when they were smaller. There where of course a few of the usual Hollywood silly, brain-dead stunts like the tank scene. It could have been so cool but it was really ruined by the total lack of intelligence in the stunt following the cool revelation.\r\n\r\nI really liked Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym as well as Evangeline Lilly as Hope Van Dyne. I was not too impressed by Paul Rudd but on the while I guess he was not too bad. It is a bit of a shame though that when Hollywood feels they need to throw in a bit of family drama they always have to throw in a divorce. It is rather depressing for us that have lived through such a tragedy after all.\r\n\r\nBottom line, this was a surprisingly enjoyable movie. Far better than quite a few of the super hero movies that Marvel\/Hollywood have produced like for instance the abysmal Spiderman movies although that is of course a personal opinion.","id":"5a797cd1c3a368224e01f813","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a797cd1c3a368224e01f813","movie_id":102899}
{"author":"mattwilde123","content":"Reviewing this film gives me great pleasure as I thought it was very well made. It is a beautiful film about the isolation and the disembodiment of modern society. 'Anomalisa' tells the story of a man called Michael Stone played by David Thewlis on a business trip and we realise how lonely he is.The film is made using start-stop animation puppetry which had been chosen for amazing effect. Each character has the same face (seemingly like masks) and everyone has the same monotonic voice apart from the two main characters. This makes the themes of identity and loneliness so very profound and imaginative.\r\n\r\nThe repetitiveness of the main character's lifestyle comes to a halt when he overhears a guest in his hotel which is cleverly named The Fregoli which is the name of a mental condition to do with paranoia. This guest turns out to be voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh. She is the only other voice heard and Stone is enchanted by her and instantly asks for her to go back to his room. He makes her sing and listens to her intently. There is a very graphic sex scene which would be humourous in any other circumstance but it is very moving and beautiful.\r\n\r\nI won't talk any more about the story as it'll ruin it. 'Anomalisa' is a very clever film from the mind who brought us 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', 'Adaptation.' and 'Being John Malkovich' and it shows. Everything about it is expertly done. It is sad that this was only up for 'Best Animated Feature' alongside two dimensional children's cartoons at the Academy Awards and it wasn't recognised for being the great film that it is.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605","id":"58c1702ec3a36825db00a9aa","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c1702ec3a36825db00a9aa","movie_id":291270}

After winning the Mr Tamil Nadu contest for his perfect physique, he bags plum modelling assignments. Lo and behold, Lingesan gets a chance to model with Diya. How does he land this windfall?\r\n\r\nWell, the ruling male supermodel John (Upen Patel) is a chauvinistic pig. When Diya refuses to sleep with him, he threatens to blacklist her.

Further, she feigns love for him and turns the otherwise shy guy into a charismatic screen icon.\r\n\r\nIn his journey to fame and money, Lee makes more than a few enemies. An irate bodybuilder at his local gym, John - the model whose position he usurped, an egotistic advertising guru whom he offended with his principles, a gay makeup artiste whose advances he spurned - all of them want Lingesan dead.\r\n\r\nThis scheming quartet, along with a fifth guy (whose identity is suspense), takes revenge on Lee. They turn him into an unrecognizable ugly being (bearing an uncanny resemblance to Ephialtes from the Hollywood movie 300) in the hope that his life becomes a living hell. But, don't despair just yet; our hero also schemes to get back at those who stole his love and his looks.\r\n\r\nSuspend your disbelief and get into this fairy tale that is told by Shankar (the maker of magnum opuses like Indian, Sivaji-The Boss and Enthiran) on a grandiose canvas. Shot mesmerisingly by PC Sreeram on virgin locales in China and India, with world class CG work, this spectacle works because at the core, it's a romantic-thriller told simplistically.\r\n\r\nWhile the waif-like Amy looks mesmerising, Vikram bowls you over with a heart-wrenching performance whether he is handsome or disfigured. Santhanam provides the perfect comic relief. The first fight in a local gymnasium and the BMX bike fight on Chinese rooftops are an adrenaline fix. This is pure escapist fare but will resonate with those who read fairy tales at bedtime.","id":"55030056c3a3685b96004a8b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55030056c3a3685b96004a8b","movie_id":263471}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> In any world, the history keeps repeating itself.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the last films to I watch from the 2016 Oscars nominees. It was a Colombian production that represented the country in the 88th American Academy Awards. It had all the qualities to win that major international award, but lost the bet to 'Son of Saul'. In my perspective, after seeing all the five, no doubt, but this film's the real winner. The film was loosely based on the real occurrence that was written in the diaries of two scientists on their expedition into the Amazon's deep in search of something what intrigued the conflict between the two worlds.\r\n\r\nIt portrayed the beautiful Amazon in the black and white pictures and I loved it because, it recreated the world that was over 100 years ago. It would have not affected the viewers same if it was rendered in colour. It is awesome to see a film like this about the Amazon people after a very long time. Because prior to the 80s and 90s, there were plenty of African and South American exploration films made which rapidly reduced its number when comic book films became the frontrunner in the world cinema. So going back to the lost world was really an amazing experience that this film had given to me and you should not miss it as well.\r\n\r\nIt takes place in the first half of the 1900s that breaks into a two part narration. In the first, where a German scientist Theo, looks for a help from the last surviving young man from his tribe, Karamakate, to explore the jungle for the scientific research. In the second, 40 years later, an American scientist, Evans follows a similar kind of quest who once again seeks help from the aged Karamakate. When Karamakate realises their agenda, concerns for the peace and stability in the region, so goes for the measure that has to be taken.\r\n\r\n> \"Ants like money. I do not. The taste is bad.\"\r\n\r\nIt was like lost in translation. During the invasion of the remaining parts of the South America in the Amazon basin on the Colombian side, how the both worlds suffered was the part of this narration and cultural collision was one of the main topics. Most of the film was shot alongside of the rivers Inirida and Varupes, especially the final scene location was so beautiful. The film concept was similar to the 'Anaconda 2', but there's no intense action-thriller, especially there's no fast and aggressive serpents in the act. The scientists are looking for a certain kind of plant which is considered sacred and protected by the Amazon tribes.\r\n\r\nIt was boring in the initial parts, because I did not know what to expect. So I just kept watching as whatever it was focused on. But during the end of the first act, I started to like it. Because it was not as complicated as I thought and it was not the art film like those without the plot and background score. So at the end of my watch, I'm very satisfied. The actors were stunning as the amazing Amazon basin is. Of them all, the 'Borgman' actor was the only familiar face to me.\r\n\r\nIt is a powerful film, with a bit of a documentary style presentation. The main theme was about the history repeating itself. In your lifetime if it repeats means a second chance to divert it from the possible future nuisance. So how the one who cares would reach and solve it is what this film was told. The film characters were brilliant and Karamakate will be remembered. A neatly narrated tale that will remain people's favourite for a very long. One of the films of the 2015 and of the Oscars nominees that nobody must miss it.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"577ab4039251410581001069","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/577ab4039251410581001069","movie_id":336808}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Keep dreaming brings nothing, need to go out and try to make it happen!\r\n\r\nThe posters, teasers did not impress me at all. The thought the film going to be a flop. Surprisingly the film was much better than I anticipation. This is a biographical-sport film and very inspiring. The story of a British boy in the early 70s who dreamt to be an Olympian, but the problem is he has not found his sports. By the time in his 20s, he finally finds his interest and gives his best to make his long pending wish to come true. The remaining narration reveals his journey to the world's one of the big events where he aims to soar like an eagle.\r\n\r\nHugh Jackman was not any terrific, he was awesome like usual, but in a supporting role. I think Taron Egerton will be the next British sensation. This film worth seeing for his phenomenal act. The real Eddie too appreciated that. The whole film revolved around these two characters and I think making it a comedy worked out so well. Nicely shot film in the beautiful places, especially those risky ski jump stunts were excellent and the direction was undoubtedly the best.\r\n\r\nThis film is not particularly about the sport, it is about one showing his passion towards his undertaking. Eddie can be seen as a role model, no matter what he achieved, his fighting spirit is motivating. I think the youngsters should watch it, especially those who are after their dreams. Not just sport persons, but any field persons. I don't know about the repeat viewing, but watching once is enough for the confidence uplift. One of the must see film of the 2016.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"57a374d89251410a5f002f3b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57a374d89251410a5f002f3b","movie_id":319888}

Meanwhile the niece (Maika Monroe) is having secret meetings with the cowardly boy of the other family (Rhys Wakefield).\r\n\r\n\u201cEchoes of War\u201d (2015) is a realistic post-Civil War Western that shows what happens when an ex-soldier brings the war back with him. It\u2019s cut from the same cloth as \u201cPharaoh's Army\u201d (1995) and \u201cSommersby\u201d (1993). \u201cRide with the Devil\u201d (1999) and \u201cCold Mountain\u201d also come to mind.

Meanwhile Maika is entrancingly fair. Like \u201cPharaoh\u2019s Army\u201d everything smacks of real life. While the movie\u2019s no doubt low-budget, it doesn\u2019t seem like it at all. The filmmaking is thoroughly professional with a pleasing sense of aesthetics. The negative 1-Star shill reviews are absurd; pay no mind to them (the producers must\u2019ve ticked off the catering service). There\u2019s a brief sex scene, but it goes with the realism of the picture; it\u2019s not raunchy or sleazy at all, just realistic and mature. It\u2019s life\u2026 and death.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes and was probably shot in Austin & Bastrop, Texas.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-\/B+","id":"5ba680c90e0a2635f00108db","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ba680c90e0a2635f00108db","movie_id":333594}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The hard work always pays off.**\r\n\r\nI love Japanese film and have seen all kinds of them. Yet discovering one more wonderful film like this made my day. Now this is one of my all time favourite. The reason is it is a very inspiring tale, based on the book of the same name, which was originally based on the real life event of the author. Despite it dealt with a serious issue, the story was narrated with lots of fun. You know, if you are telling a most important story that does not mean it has to be slow, dull and artistic presentation. The film looked like some kind of commercial film with an awesome background score, but at the end, it accomplished everything it wanted to tell its viewers quite smartly.\r\n\r\nThis is a couple of year old film that I somehow managed to check it out now. Only regret is that I'm watching it so late. No need to be confused that it is not an out and out chick flick. It should be watched by all, especially the students and their parents, together. A beautiful message regarding the importance of education. That's not it, it also focused on parenting issues, teaching methods and friends influence. Not everybody born with a gift to do good at education, but it can be developed with proper care and coaching. That's the film's notion which finely presented on the screen.\r\n\r\nSayaka was born in an average family. Her father was keen to make her elder brother a pro baseball player since his childhood. So her mother took care of her and her little sister's childhood. Being frequently changing school, she never made friends, but finally when she did, her education doomed. Now on the edge of finishing school and entering college, she has not learned anything, just to pass the entrance exam. From her teacher to her father, very sure that she has no future. That's what she has to prove them wrong. With her mother's everlasting back, she takes up the biggest task of her life which is going to impact her life forever.\r\n\r\n> -xX] If you call a student a loser, they believe it. They lose confidence. [Xx-\r\n\r\nThe film had lots of inspiring lines. I felt this was one of those films must be shown in the schools. Apart from the education, the parenting failure was another highlight of the film. It was not like the child was completely abandoned. It was the split parenting. It happens when parents failed to unitedly treat equally all their children. One of the reasons could be the field of interest they share with them. Or maybe forcing on them with their failed dream. A kid's family influences his\/her beahaviour out in the society, as well as society's in the house. These two to balance, one must have good parents and teachers. And not to ignore the friends.\r\n\r\nThe music was so good. I think OST is worth a buy. It helped the film to keep the pace in check. Apart from colourful and fun narration, it also gets us with sentiments. Maybe that part seems too intentional, but as for the Japanese standard\/culture that I've learnt through watching films, it was natural. The shocking part was the domestic violence which is rare in Japanese films, particularly among those I have seen. The education system varies in different part of the world, but the effort, the hard work are same. No pain, no gain is the motto. You can't just attempt and win. The path always filled with ups and downs. The one who faces them with the right attitude earns right result.\r\n\r\nThe basic platform was so common, even though the overall film was well told. From the writing to direction and music, a one. All the cast was excellent too. The runtime was just below the two hour mark, but a story like this, nothing bothers. To achieve cinematic result, the story kind of lost the realistic touch, but we must not forget that as I said it was based on the real which simply adjusted to two hour film. The young lead actress won the Japanese Academy Awards. For such an important message film, this is an under-noticed film. I'm not excited just because being a Japanophile. Definitely a must see film and recommend it to all!\r\n\r\n_9.5\/10_","id":"5a770fe292514105a6045685","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a770fe292514105a6045685","movie_id":349498}

Sure, if you expect some deep story with a lot of moral cleverness in it you are going to be disappointed.

It has many issues and barely hangs together at times.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you try to ignore that for a while and just try to view it as a piece of, fairly fast paced, visual entertainment, well then it hits the spot quite well. It is frequently beautiful to watch. The action sequences are not bad and the story is, if nothing else, certainly not the usual thirteen to a dozen B-movie repeats. The acting is, well, also generally of B-movie quality but it is not downright bad and, once I got in the right mindset for the movie, it did not disturb me.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I quite liked this movie but I guess you have to be a bit of sci-fi fan, with an emphasize on visuals, to do so.","id":"5a3cd24792514154750aeb07","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a3cd24792514154750aeb07","movie_id":76757}

In fact it's very much a safe sequel, reverting to the original formula without the classy edges of Spielberg's deft touch.\r\n\r\nThere's a likable cast fronting up the pic, with Chris Pratt as the hero carrying some olde adventure chops about him, and Bryce Dallas Howard (her natural beauty sparkling on Blu-ray) a fun femme side-kick.

{"author":"Bulletproof5FDP","content":"**Jurassic World: A Jurassic Disappointment**\r\n\r\nAs a fan of the Jurassic Park franchise, especially the first movie, I am quite disappointed with Jurassic World. I was honestly super stoked for the long-awaited sequel to Jurassic Park, but in the end, the movie lacked the charm and mysticism from Jurassic Park. From poorly-developed characters (with the exception of Chris Pratt's Owen Grady) to idiotic plot elements, Jurassic World's only saving grace is the fact that it's a sequel to Jurassic Park. \r\n\r\nThe dinosaurs honestly look awful and pale in comparison to the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. The CGI is so obvious and doesn't look realistic at all. Jurassic Park found the right balance of practical effects and computer-generated imagery, giving viewers the feeling that the dinosaurs feel so life-like. Jurassic World basically uses minimal practical effects in favor of CGI galore. It's sad that a 1993 movie has better CGI than a movie made in 2015.\r\n\r\nClaire and her nephews Gray and Zach, are cheap imitations of John Hammond and his grandchildren Tim and Lex. Claire is primarily motivated by greed and exploiting the dinosaurs. Hoskins just wants to use the dinosaurs as military weapons. Dr. Henry Wu is a bit more antagonistic, revealed to be secretly creating hybrids for Hoskins as military weapons. The only character that's given some form of development is Owen Grady, played by Star-Lord a.k.a Chris Pratt. His motivations are for researching Velociraptor behavior and actually treats the dinosaurs like living creatures and not just exploited science experiments. Honestly the only redeeming factor throughout the entire movie.\r\n\r\nThe Indominus Rex tricks the personnel into thinking it's escaped confinement by clawing away at the top of its enclosure. They somehow believe the dinosaur escaped, but wouldn't security be alerted right away? The enclosure doesn't come equipped with bells and whistles? To much surprise (not), the Indominus is actually inside the enclosure with them. This idiotic plot choice allows the Indominus to escape.\r\n\r\nZack and Grey revisiting the original site of Jurassic Park brought back so many nostalgic memories of Jurassic Park. One of the best moments of the entire movie, absolutely loved when they picked up the Jurassic Park banner and the goggles used by Tim. But what killed the moment was when they managed to get the original Jeep started. It's been sitting for over 20 years, non-operational. But for plot convenience, they learned how to fix vehicles previously. \r\n\r\nI thought the assault upon the park attendees by the pterosaurs was chilling, swooping up people in the process. Gave a sense of terror that you could actually feel. One of those people being Zara, Claire's assistant. She is attacked by a pteranodon and then eventually eaten alive by the mosasaurus. Her death was just way too drawn out and totally undeserving. A death like this should have been reserved for the villain.\r\n\r\nThe final battle between the Indominus Rex and Owen's pack of surviving Velociraptor brought me back to the battle between the T-Rex and raptors in Jurassic Park. Then Claire brings out the T-Rex, the very same one from Jurassic Park, and manages to outrun the T-Rex IN HEELS. I was rooting for the T-Rex to win, then the Mosasaurus swoops up and drags the Indominus into the lagoon. \r\n\r\nThough this movie attempts to bring back the Jurassic Park charm, it ultimately fails to capture that same magic. Unlike The Force Awakens, another similar movie that calls back to its roots, Jurassic World managed to be much worse than its source material. You feel no true connection to the characters or dinosaurs, the excitement factor is gone, and the music is not memorable at all. \r\n\r\nMy Rating: 5.5\/10.0","id":"58d554b19251411fd502e9fe","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58d554b19251411fd502e9fe","movie_id":135397}

Theirs lowest point ever as the filmmakers, but still not that bad flick. The movie lacked in many areas, and one of those is failing to have at least one stunning fight\/war scene. I know it was only the beginning and there will be a sequel, maybe ends as a trilogy, but the story was very weak for an intro movie.\r\n\r\nLooks like one-liner, precisely to say kind of similar to 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'. I mean in a thin idea, the whole story takes place. Something like a space expedition for a chosen one, hopping from a planet to planet, seeking answers and protection. The title character, Jupiter Jones, played by Mila Kunis, with the help of the Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) takes a risky venture when their lives were threatened. Finding who's behind and other truth brings the end of the narration, which runs for just over a 2 hour.\r\n\r\nPerformances were okay, but kind of doubt their inclusion in the project. Mostly the cast was the younger ones, maybe except, Sean Bean. Many of them are only the recently emerged stars. So it was a big responsibility in a big budget movie and they did it.

In the narration as well it does not properly reveals, more like an approximate count of something. It is a Russian story, I mean the Russian characters and the locations. It begins after the world war two, in Moscow, a top police officer caught between the departmental politics and a case. After the his investigation ended without a result, the sacked officer gets a lifeline to begin again life in another town. But the trouble follows him when he started to investigate the children's deaths. The result of the case brings the end to the tale with a tiny small twist.\r\n\r\nThe actors were decent, not very impressive. Especially I understand since it was internationally produced, they preferred English language, but I would have liked it in the original language to get best appeal. It was too long film, the first half was very boring. Because it was most unrelated to what comes in the later part of the film. When the narration shifts its base out of the Moscow, that's where it really gets very interesting. So after first 60 minutes, the real story begins.\r\n\r\nThis where the actors got better. Noomi Rapace and Tom Hardy, both were like the kicked off with full of energy. So the second half of the film makes it watchable. Directed by a 'Easy Money' filmmaker who also brought in his Swedish actors to play the smaller roles. It was not good as I expected, but ended well.

Even structurally, the film feels like a sort-of Kalavani-meets-Vaagai Sooda Vaa, with the first act and the epilogue trying to humour us the way former did while the central knot \u2014 a water crisis \u2014 has the gravitas of the latter.\r\n\r\nBut to get to that, we have to spend quite a lot of time on things that are inconsequential to the plot. Right from his debut film, Sarkunam has shown that he prefers to tell his story in a languid manner. He is not a filmmaker who uses the jump cut as if his very life depended on it. This style suited Kalavani, which was a rural romcom, and in Vaagai Sooda Vaa, it made sense because of the film's setting \u2014 the late 60s. But here, the initial setup feels overlong and uninteresting. Too much time is spent over the villagers' attitude towards people who have done time in prisons in Singapore or Malaysia. Too much time is also spent on the been-there-seen-that romance between Paari (a fine Atharvaa) and Thamarai (Anandhi, who smiles a little too much in most scenes), which, while crucial to the plot, never makes us care \u2014 they have been attracted towards each other since they were young and start wooing one another as soon as Paari returns to the village after being deported from Singapore.\r\n\r\nThese scenes are juxtaposed with scenes from the neighbouring village, Vayalpaadi, which depends on the water from a pond in Paari's village, Nedungaadu. But Nedungaadu's big shots, which include Thamarai's father, a rice mill owner (a miscast Lal), and the panchayat president, are against giving water to the village. Thamarai's father actually has got the pond in an auction and pollutes its water on purpose. But Paari, whose father died in a clash between the two villages decade ago, wants to do the right thing \u2014 let his neighbours use the water. Things come to a head when Thamarai's father comes to know of their romance. The same day, the panchayat president is attacked by a man from Vayalpaadi and the mill owner tries to use the incident to whip up tension, create a clash between the villages and kill Paari. Now, the young man must use his wits and survive the night to not only save the neighbouring village but also save himself.\r\n\r\nThe initial portions remind us that Sarkunam has the ability to transport us to the film's setting by creating a lived-in universe. He also shows that he still knows how to pack in little surprises (Paari helps Thamarai win a cycling race but the pay-off happens some time later, when this provides him the opportunity to gift her the mobile mobile that he has been trying to give her) and quirky moments that make us smile (like the scene where the heroine's mother takes a Bluetooth headset for a hair clip). But Chandi Veeran actually feels alive when the actual plot kicks into gear. The various challenges Paari has to overcome to outfox Thamarai's father and stop his villagers from attacking the people of Vayalpaadi keeps us on the edge of our seats. And his final speech \u2014 a call for being humane, sharing what we have and shunning violence \u2014 to make them see sense is heartwarming, even as the film comes close to being preachy.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the film cannot find its tone (it's funny one moment and dead-serious the next) and so, the narration suffers. The filmmaking, too, lacks grace, with hurried camerawork and choppy editing that make the film visually inelegant. We never see the confident Sarkunam of Kalavani and Vaagai Sooda Vaa. Perhaps, the commercial failure of the latter has made him wary of taking risks. Often, we get the feeling that the director has given in to the ghost of failure whispering in his ears to just give what the audience wants \u2014 comedy. That should probably explain why we get an epilogue that is tonally far removed from the climax and makes a joke of the intent of the film.","id":"55e0256192514177d4001e10","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55e0256192514177d4001e10","movie_id":349198}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Its a sci-fi age and robot rules.\r\n\r\nIt came as a little surprise. Obviously I was looking for this film, but not expected to reach at this level. The film was really brilliant despite the influence of plenty of other films. Yes, the ideas were borrowed from the movies like 'Short Circuit', 'I, Robot', 'RoboCop', Real Steel', \"Bicentennial Man', 'Transcendence', et cetera. But that did not bother me at all. I would call it an inspiration to make a new product out that already existed.\r\n\r\nIt was not completely depended on Dev Patel's role, otherwise woulda been a disaster. Its the Hugh Jackman, eventhough his character was not on the frontline, because of his presence, the movie was filled with some exciting and thrilling moment. His role was pretty much same to 'Real Steal', but showed in a different shade.\r\n\r\nSilly concept, even dialogues were so stupid. I don't know, maybe because of the South African accent. But the screenplay was very good. Fast and gets the point quickly than wasting time for buildups. One of the best robot movie and it will be remembered. Looks like the sequel will be more furious and going to be an action packed item, if there will be one. Worth to watch it at least once.\r\n\r\n7.5\/10","id":"55cce429c3a3681bff000343","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55cce429c3a3681bff000343","movie_id":198184}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The global warming theme on a smaller scale.\r\n\r\nAn independent film about a man from the Arctic who is sent by his elders to the New York City to seek a permanent solution they are facing due to the assault on the nature by the southern people. I have heard it was based on the real, but for the lack of source I can't confirm how much true it is. For the voices over the global warming and considering recently concluded 'climate change conference' in Paris, I thought giving it a try would uplift my spirit on this matter.\r\n\r\nDefinitely a good idea for a film, a serious theme, even though it did not turn out to be as I hoped for, had a little fun watching it. A short film, not even exceeded the 80 minute mark. Since it was a low profile flick, there's no big casting or the grand spending for making it, but merely an alright film. It was dull in parts due to the stretch, otherwise could have made it a fantastic short film. And a bit it looks like a cross of documentary and feature film in the narration part.\r\n\r\n> \"Life is so full of difficulties.\r\n> But in my homeland, our sense of family bond us together.\r\n> Like a warm coat against the cold wind.\"\r\n\r\nWhat I think about the movie is, it was not bad, as well as brilliant. Very predictable, especially the end went as I expected, that's sad. But a couple of scenes in the entire film were somewhat out of the ordinary. More like it was for the children that deals on the global warming, but for the adults and their matured minds, it kind of fails to convince due to a shortfall of exploration on the subject.\r\n\r\nYou know it only brought the serious topic on-board, but the intention was not given to explain it, or discuss them. So I feel it missed the great opportunity to open up on the debate and spread the message as what a theme like this supposed to do.\r\n\r\nAfter this I've watched a couple of other movies, but this will be the last review I'm writing on this blog for this year (2015). As a movie fanatic, I had another wonderful year and plenty of excellent films as well as so many bad ones. Finally, I wish all the WCA readers a very happy new year 2016. I'm hoping for another successful year ahead and try to keep the WCA alive utmost.\r\n\r\n6.5\/10","id":"568a340fc3a3685f89014359","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/568a340fc3a3685f89014359","movie_id":300686}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Some risk taken in romance were unimaginable.**\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I did not know it was a real event based film until the texts from the film's end. But even before that I liked it very much. The film was very edgy, I have not seen such film in a quite long time. It feels like a familiar theme, but that is only the theme, the story was marginally different. Emma Watson was amazing, maybe this her best performance I have seen so far in her career. Daniel Bruhl was not bad either and so other co-stars.\r\n\r\nThe locations, the atmosphere created for narrating the tale, all were amazing, just feels like a very real. The story of a young German couple in the 70s Chile, when the military coup takes place, the supporters of the overthrown president were arrested including these two. Now they are separated and one of them was sent to a secret detention camp. The other one decides to rescue him by risking her own life by joining the same organisation. That's the film to reveal how she plans and all other troubles during her undertaking.\r\n\r\nDespite what this film reveals, very sad to read the end text. I have been looking for such kind of thriller for some time, so really I'm happy I saw this one. The pace was moderate, but the developments at the right time gives the edge. So from the entertainment perspective to revealing facts, this film well managed. From the director of 'John Rabe', another same intensity film, the majority of those who watch it would definitely like it.

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Finding the reclusive author of \u201cCatcher in the Rye\u201d in 1969*** \r\n\r\nIn 1969 a persecuted prep school student in Pennsylvania (Alex Wolff) runs away to find the author of \u201cCatcher in the Rye\u201d in the hills of New Hampshire to get his permission to produce a play based on his classic novel. Stefania LaVie Owen is on hand as the girl from a nearby school whom he travels with while Chris Cooper plays the curmudgeonly recluse J.D. Salinger.\r\n\r\n\"Coming through the Rye\" (2015) is a coming-of-age drama based on a true story. Being set in an all-male boarding school with sequences involving a female school, you can\u2019t help but compare it with \u201cDead Poets Society\u201d (1989). While it\u2019s not great like that movie, it\u2019s quite good. They\u2019re really not that similar in the first place because \u201cComing through the Rye\u201d is just as much of a road movie as it is a historical boarding school flick.\r\n\r\nWolff is good as the likable & sympathetic protagonist while Stefania is a winsome cutie. The story takes off when the two team-up in the second act. Their honest relationship is the core of the tale with the boy\u2019s possible interactions with the author playing a secondary role.\r\n\r\nSomeone called the movie \u201cphony\u201d because Salinger\u2019s classic book looked \"down upon those who refuse to accept life as anything other than miserable and unforgiving. Its sincerity is guided by distrust in others and it spits in the face of affection and benevolence.\" Gee, ya think that might be why Salinger is depicted as an antisocial curmudgeon in the movie? Besides, it can\u2019t be too phony if the events are based on a true story with 90% accuracy according to writer\/director James Steven Sadwith.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 37 minutes and was shot in Orange County, Virginia.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> In an usual day an unusual occurrence.\r\n\r\nIt was a fantastic small-time thriller. I was completely surprised with its unusualness, either it be roles or the story or the locations. Looks like a best B movie, but Kevin Bacon's presence boosted the spirit of narration. One of the shortest movie, all the way simple yet strong and believable occurrence.\r\n\r\nYou can't ask for character development here, because it just takes place in a fine afternoon and ends at a terrible evening. Never intended to reveal before events or to disclose what might happen later. Everything was based on the very unusual circumstances. When people cross each others path and expose their secret affairs that put them most vulnerable position. Far from the big towns and out of the human sights with the characters countable on one hand.\r\n\r\nThe main attraction was the two boys and their innocence like daring attitude takes them to the unplanned adventure. Nothing like another highly intelligent, computer or the science geeky overhyped city boys, but the natural rural kids. Creepy suspense with often struck with dark comedies, you just can't get better than this. I recommend it in the view of entertainment and for those who seeks it, but not to place it in your masterpiece collections.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd\/10","id":"567c32b09251417de3003a42","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/567c32b09251417de3003a42","movie_id":310133}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> At first in the past, all good things in the world were always denied.\r\n\r\nBased on the real life story of a Nigerian forensic pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu who discovered CTE disorder that most of the American football players are suffering from. So he fought for his theory against the NFL who was denying it. I was neutral when #OscarsSoWhite broke out, but for this movie I definitely agree on that. Whether he would have won or not, Will Smith name should have been in the best male actor in the lead list.\r\n\r\nThat's not at all, this movie did not qualify for any other category in the event which is not unfortunate, but deliberately the Academy chose a wrong side to stand. Felt like they are supporting NFL instead of fact and its own product. This biographical movie talked mainly about one particular sport, maybe there are other sports in the globe that might cause CTE as must as this one. Since Dr. Omalu's research came from NFL players, so it was all about between them.\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderful movie, I was very surprised for it. In the past, every good thing in the world was always opposed in its beginning, but later accepted widely like the global warming. I hope people aware of such thing is exist and act accordingly. No need to abandon the sport, just change the rules and the style of play. This is one of the best movie you could find from the 2015. I think it is a must see biopic, the credit must go to Ridley Scott who is the man behind for this movie to happen.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"56f3f113c3a3682fe6002d8f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56f3f113c3a3682fe6002d8f","movie_id":321741}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> One of the most realistically approached adventure movie based on the real.\r\n\r\nI was completely surprised with the movie. Because I was expecting 'Vertical Limit' kind of movie. Like, you know, there's no heroic adventure with the incredible stunt sequences in it. But it was very real and more real. Usually while adapting the true events for the screen, unnecessary overdose stunts created to commercialise the product. But in this it was too much closer to the real world adventure, like a documentary film.\r\n\r\nIt was a man versus the mother nature and nothing else. The human villains were not included or the romance and other subplots. It was a multi starrer movie. Lots of big names played only a small role and magnified the expectation for the movie. But like I said expecting awesomeness will lead you to a great disappointment. One must approach this movie with a clear mind for a good result, because I felt the film very honest, and being honest is always a bit boring.\r\n\r\nThe film was emotionally very strong. No character developments, not individually, but the entire film was focused on one particular expedition taken by a couple of trekking teams that goes wrong after they got hit by a storm. This is Jason Clarke's one of the best films in a lead role, as well as for the director of 'Contraband'. I definitely regret missing it out in digital 3D. It is a good watch, absolutely refreshing from the mainstream commercial films.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"56b3815892514114e1002275","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56b3815892514114e1002275","movie_id":253412}

No matter how many lives are lost over the years, there will always be another group of adventurers ready to take on the mountain and the elements that come with her.\r\n\r\nThe ill fated 1996 trek up Everest gets a worthy cinematic treatment here. Sure it suffers from some of the pitfalls of the disaster movie genre, such as weak characterisations and fake sequences, but emotional investment is high and ready to be grasped by those so inclined. The drama on the mountain is gripping, and thankfully this is matched by the frantic concurrent story strands involving the family and friends waiting at base camp and the family homes. Cinematography is often breathtaking, the acting performances as solid as one of Everest' rock faces, but it's the story that sells itself.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> About a dog and his master who gave a new hope the little creatures.\r\n\r\nAn Australian adventure-drama inspired by the true story about the wildlife conservation, but it does not follow actual details. Like in the real life, it was between father and daughter, unlike grandfather and granddaughter in this. So there many other changes were made in order to get the film right shape, but the theme remained true to the original.\r\n\r\nThis was the second film after the last week 'Brothers of the Wind' about the wildlife I had watched and I'm very happy with both. A film for everyone with the balanced contents between the film characters and the message it wanted to tell. I mean it was not about the dog or a girl or the penguins, but they all equally shared the parts. I think the animals were used well.\r\n\r\nThe film focused on a southern Australian small coastal town, where on a tiny island the little penguins are living for the centuries. But now the numbers are going down due to the fox attacks. So the people are worried that the place might lose its special status. Then they decide to protect it, but all the effort was in vain until a chicken farmer and his mischievous dog named Oddball become the game changer, while everyone was in the panic mode.\r\n\r\nIt is a modern fairytale, that's what they say in the opening. Because fairy tales do not have any violences and so in this the fox attacks were merely a concept to develop the plot. In reality those were obviously heartbreaking if you are an animal lover. The good thing is, the film does not have them like a Disney Nature film. So those who seek facts, logics and strong appeal in a film, I would advise them to stay away from it or you can just put away your adultness to have a good time with it.\r\n\r\n> \"If you want the biscuit you gotta risk it.\"\r\n\r\nThis film was not based on a rare concept, but definitely very rare on what it deals with. Like as my knowledge I don't remember seeing a film or a documentary film about these little penguins. So it is totally worth, but disappointment was it was a human perspective story. About the human's intervene while nature fighting among themselves to extinction. Fox hunts penguins and that's a natural order, but when the balance was disturbed, the human's involvement to restore it is not questionable as we're the dominated species on the earth.\r\n\r\nMost of the cast was Aussies and a couple of them were internationally recognised. Predictable story, especially the ending is not a complicated part. Somewhat fun, but most of the time the drama takes over like the struggling relationship between father and daughter. Sometime innovative ideas come when one in a such scenario. The film explored on that basis to tell a decent tale.\r\n\r\nThe kid was good, along with the dog, and the farmer who was also known as Swampy, the only one who tried very hard in the comical role to keep rhythm up. In a few scenes the camera work was great, the aerial view of the seaside was lovely. It was nominated for the best cinematography in the last Australian Academy Awards, but did not win.\r\n\r\nThis is not a massive hit film or well recognised in the rest of the world. Even if you watch it today, you will go to forget it tomorrow. Then you might be wondering why it should be watched. Well, it is one of the finest family films of the recent time and a message deliverer. In one film many plots were covered, like a man-dog, father-daughter-granddaughter relationship, midlife crisis, wildlife conservation; this film was full of sub-plots and yet it makes an overall decent film. I won't recommend it, but definitely not a waste of time.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"5787dc5ac3a36839200018e1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5787dc5ac3a36839200018e1","movie_id":356905}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Isai begins with a voice-over that tells us the film will show us what jealousy can do to a genius. And it dives straight into the plot. AK Shiva is the new hotshot film composer in town and the man he has dethroned, Vetrichelvan, who was ruling the scene for 30 years, is enraged by his success. He is the Mozart to Vetrichelvan's Salieri. Earlier in the film, we get a scene that is similar to the one in Pudhu Pudhu Arthangal \u2014 Vetrichelvan is signing autographs but when Shiva turns up, the fans rush to him leaving him all alone. The man is so consumed by rage that he goes and murders the director who gave Shiva his big break! And because of this rage, he is unable to play music and so decides to ruin his rival's life and career. For this, he hatches a plot to mess up with Shiva's mind and drive him insane.\r\n\r\nSJ Suryah is one director who goes to any extent to keep his audience entertained. And, in Isai, he opens up his bag of tricks after a gap of 10 years and shows that he has still got his groove. There is an exaggerated quality to the performances, shot compositions and the score (he makes his debut as a composer here) in Suryah's films, but they should be seen more as a stylistic choice. Isai isn't as taut a thriller as Vaali but despite being overlong (lengthy scenes with too much dialogue), it is fairly engaging. The film doesn't truly come together as a whole but the scenes have the stamp of a director with a sure hand. \r\n\r\nShiva is shown as a musician who is fascinated by everyday sounds and finds music in them (he even goes to a forest to record the sounds of nature for an album) and so, we willingly buy into most of Vetrichelvan's plan to upset his universe. As Jim Carrey in The Truman Show, Shiva doesn't realize that everyone around his acting a specified role and starts doubting if he has genuinely gone mad. Sathyaraj hams it up quite a bit in the beginning but as the movie progresses and becomes a little chaotic, it is his casual villainy that keeps us entertained. The scenes between him and Ganja Karuppu, who as his servant, gets into a Catch 22 situation every time he opens his mouth, are quite amusing. \r\n\r\nThe erotic tones in the romantic scenes once again underline the fact that, for him, love will always be inseparable from lust. Interestingly, for a director who doesn't let go of an opportunity to show his heroine's skin (maybe, he wants to pander to his fan base and keep them satisfied), Suryah's heroines generally have a huge part to play in his films and that is the case here as well. Jennifer, the girl he falls in love with and marries, is quite an interesting role but Savithri, despite the better lip sync, seems too fragile an actress for this complex character. \r\n\r\nBut, there are times when the film turns frustrating as scenes go on and on, in convoluted fashion, with no end in sight. And with the climactic twist, which neither feels organic nor ingenious, Suryah only seems to be acknowledging that he couldn't come up with a satisfying end to the story he set originally out to film. All it does is give him a loophole to brush away the plot holes. Or, maybe, it his way of telling the whole world that SJ Suryah the director has literally woken up from his decade-long slumber.","id":"5502ff9d92514174f6000f6b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5502ff9d92514174f6000f6b","movie_id":280883}

The soundtrack was also really good.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605","id":"58c17107c3a368265b00abda","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c17107c3a368265b00abda","movie_id":276907}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Two men stood against on the different side of the border for the same cause.\r\n\r\nI was not sure what to expect from this film. By seeing its poster, my mind was very clear that it definitely some serious subject. I'm kind of a person who's not okay with the lions killing a zebra on the animal planet, so I was worried about the clips they might show would be too violence. You know, in the movies everything's fake, and this isn't a movie, but a documentary. That's why I simply disliked 'The Act of Killing'.\r\n\r\nThe opening scene was something like 'Breaking Bad', so I thought it might told from the bad guy's perspective about how their network and business would work. But everything drastically changed after the 5-10 minutes of the film. It's where the original story commence.\r\n\r\nThe two main characters were introduced who are fighting for a same cause, but separated by the international line. Across the border, under the different society and government, how these two sacrifice their lives in battle against the dangerous networks that threatens the peace is the story.\r\n\r\nIn a small town on the southern border of the US, a small paramilitary team headed by Tim has taken such a measure to prevent the all kinds of trafficking. In the same line, Dr. Mireles from the Michoacan, Mexico, goes a bit bigger and stronger by forming a force with the volunteered people with arms to fight for the same mission.\r\n\r\nThe film had many the phases, not like the chapters or the episodes, but like a split in the narration to cover the other side of the story. The stories of two men and their undertaking was the prime focus. That's what I thought, you know I felt it was a modern day 'The Magnificent Seven', but in the larger scale of everything. Only until a twist that surprised me, because I was not thought a tale would turn like this.\r\n\r\n> \"I believe what I'm doing is good.\r\n> And I believe what I'm standing up against is evil.\"\r\n\r\nSo what's the twist? I tell you, you know, one man was doing his task all by himself with the help of a few other buddies. On the other side, the man's contribution becomes the nation and international news and publicity. In such circumstance, a fame can turn the destiny of a man on whatever side. It's not like why he did what he had done, but a default human nature.\r\n\r\nI thought 'Heli' was a fictional work. After seeing this documentary I'm not sure how to judge any country by what they depict in their films. Every nation has its flaws, but I wondered why Mexican government was so blind over drug trafficking as shown in this film, if the information was correct. The absence of the federal law enforcement agencies on those disputed places is really a humiliation for the government after this film officially entered the Oscars race.\r\n\r\nI don't think taking action again them won't collapse the nation or the economy. And again, I'm not the right person here to analyse and predict the nation's fate. I've never been to Mexico and I know little about Mexico, but all this only because of the curious to know the truth, that's all. When it comes to the filmmaking, I don't know how it was made.\r\n\r\nDocumentaries usually follows with the series of interviews and the recorded clips, in this it was a live shot like any entertainment film. Maybe I must look for director's Q&A for the answers. But something was sure, that production happened at the right place at the right time.\r\n\r\nThis a very good documentary film, very gripping and interesting storyline with the characters. I don't watch documentaries on the regular basis and to be honest, I saw it for the Oscars nod, to know what its special. I don't think it is going to win, certainly I can't either rule out the chances as it made this far. Anything might happen, so wait and see.\r\n\r\nIt had a few dull moments, lot like a pause in the narration or took a wrong diversion after the first half. But during the conclusion, brought back to the track and clarified many doubts, yet leave a few unanswered. Not for the sake of the Academy Awards nominee, you can give it a try if you feel you're interested to know why the people are taking arms in their hands to fight the evil force that corrupting our society.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"56a4cdea925141524c001cfe","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56a4cdea925141524c001cfe","movie_id":317952}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Just when it can't get any better...\r\n\r\nThe first thing I noticed was after seeing the movie is there's some kind of mistake in the Oscars nominee. Rooney Mara should have been on the lead role list, while Cate Blanchett in the supporting character's. Maybe the Academy people misunderstood that the title role must be the lead character. Theirs switched place actually does not make any sense. Anyway the Oscars never made sense at all.\r\n\r\nThis story was okay, but adapted screenplay and direction, especially the music was excellent. For the ending scene alone, you will be tempted to raise your rating than what you initially thought it deserves. I was not expecting the movie to be awesome, so I'm not upset for the overall movie.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, the last thing I want in this movie is to see Cate Blanchett in naked. Maybe out of respect or her age or she's not attracted to me, there are plenty of reasons that I can't figure it out which one, but after knowing what this theme is, I was only praying for that not to happen. And obviously that is unavoidable, otherwise the movie will lose its soul and strength.\r\n\r\nWell, it was better than I thought, both the actresses were good, but Rooney Mara dominated. Whatever category she's in for the Oscars, I'll be happy if she wins. It is not a must watch, but a decent movie and betters in some parts.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"56d9a5d3c3a3681e3602220f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56d9a5d3c3a3681e3602220f","movie_id":258480}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A tale of the man who gave a breakthrough in the human psychology.\r\n\r\nA movie about the experiments on the human behaviour and for us, there's nothing in it but to study those characters along. This is more a documentary than the cheerful characters and the story with a twist. So forget it if you are looking for an entertainment film.\r\n\r\nBased on the true story of an American social psychologist Stanley Milgram. The film narrates the story of his controversial experiments and personal life that takes us back to the 60s. Not all the discoveries were accepted in its first revelation. Sometimes it takes time to realise its benefits like perhaps this one.\r\n\r\nThe film was boring because it was a drama about an important turning point in the human psychology. So all the major parts of the story were just talking and it never required physical stretch from its characters like running and chasing around. If you're interested in psychology and its related stuffs, then you might like it.\r\n\r\nBesides, the romance was a small part of what the film was focused on as its title mentioned. It does not mean I dislike it for not enjoying. In fact, I would have rated it better only if it was a documentary film. But still I'm happy with the product.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I guess you could say that this movie felt a bit like Friday the 13th meets The Exorcist. Well, I guess that is not entirely fair to The Exorcist since that movie, although being old, is a way better movie than this one. This is not a bad movie but it is no shining star either. It is pretty much what you could expect. A bunch of insanely stupid teenagers boozing and doing insanely stupid and illogical things while a supernatural entity decimates them in various gory ways.\r\n\r\nI would say that this movie is pretty decent taken in the context of these kind of movies of course. Insanely stupid, drug inhaling teenager is not exactly stellar material for a really good movie after all. I fail to understand why this theme seems to be so popular among horror movie makers. Also, with the amount of booze and drugs the idiots consume they should hardly be standing during most of the movie. There are some of us out here that would like a well done, intelligent horror movie once in a while after all. If that is what you are looking for this one is not your movie though.\r\n\r\nExeter is a fairly standard recipe type of movie. Previously mentioned gang of insanely stupid teenagers (with possibly one exception) decides to have a party at an abandoned asylum with a dark history (of course). The asylum is a depressing and filthy ruin so why anyone would want to have a party there is beyond me. The booze and drugs flows and after a while these idiots, to no ones surprise, decides to perform some dark ritual. As everyone can guess this leads to a sequence of badness and mayhem.\r\n\r\nMost of said teenagers behaves in the usual insane, illogical and downright ludicrous way as the supernatural events comes pouring down on them. Naturally their numbers starts to dwindle after a while due to various more or less spectacular and gory episodes involving sharp as well as blunt objects and body parts being removed from their natural places.\r\n\r\nThis is far from the worst teenage horror movie I have seen. The acting apart from the illogical and silly behavior, which of course was in the script, is not too shoddy and the movie is generally not badly implemented with reasonable special effects and a suitably dark and sinister ambiance in the run down asylum ruin. As a horror movie and a gore fix it is quite passable. Do not really expect to be scared though. The movie is quite predictable and the story is mainly a vehicle to deliver a sequence of gruesome scenes at regular intervals.","id":"55e2a57e92514162bd001ce3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55e2a57e92514162bd001ce3","movie_id":226458}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A woman's preparation to fight the outlaws.**\r\n\r\nProbably on underrated film, but for me, I'm sure it is an underrated film. From the director of 'Warrior', another excellent film to include in his filmography. A well written screenplay, but that's where the problem is according to those did not like it. Because it was kind of 'all's well, ends well' story. That does not mean it is full of clich\u00e9, maybe they expected the film to be more harsh and violent like most of the high profile western films do.\r\n\r\nSorry to those who did not enjoy it, but I did. It was nothing like only for men, but still R rated. Yep, I understand the last 10-15 minutes was so intentional, so what, the story wrapped perfectly in a right way. I must appreciate the cast, particularly the lead two actors, Natalie Portman and Joel Edgerton. This film is not an opportunity to give the best character display, but everyone did their parts quite finely.\r\n\r\nEwan McGregor was a disappointment with his useless role. I mean it was a good one, but not made for him. I think the villain character lacks the toughness. That leaves it a one sided theme, so you might not know how the developments happen, but you will know which way is it heading in the earliest.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Them Bishop boys are coming for you? You don't need a gunslinger. You need a goddamn regiment.\r\n\r\nJane Got a Gun is directed by Gavin O'Connor and collectively written by Brian Duffield, Anthony Tambakis and Joel Edgerton. It stars Natalie Portman, Joel Edgerton, Ewan McGregor, Noah Emmerich, Boyd Holbrook and Rodrigo Santoro. Music is by Marcello De Francisci and Lisa Gerrard and cinematography is by Mandy Walker.\r\n\r\nJane Hammond (Portman) has to turn to her ex lover, Dan Frost (Edgerton), for help when it's revealed that the notorious Bishop gang are heading her way in search of her husband Bill (Emmerich).\r\n\r\nIt's going to be one of those films more talked about for what it could have been than what it is. Changes in production staff were unbound, from director, writer, photographer and some big name cast changes, it was a production blighted and destined to be on a loser. It hasn't helped that with it being a slow paced character based picture, and a Western at that, the market for a fan base was already running low on potential supporters. So what we left with?\r\n\r\nIt undoubtedly is one for hard core Western fans only, it's hard to envisage newcomers entering into the genre for the first time, perhaps lured by the casting of Portman, being won over to the point of seeking out other classic Westerns of past and present. Yet it's got a lot going for it, because if you have the want, then it may just take a second viewing to fully absorb and enjoy. \r\n\r\nAt its core it's a straight Oater of redemption, opportunities waylaid by fate, and of course a good old good versus bad axis. Relying on a flashback structure to set up the character dynamics, it can get a bit disorientating at times, hence the shout out for a second viewing. However, it may not be the perfect way to build the principal characters, but they are worth the investment for there's a big emotional pull there.\r\n\r\nHaving laid the foundation for the first two thirds of the pic, we shift to good old honest violence, for siege read backs against the wall, and not without invention, in fact there's much resourcefulness on show, with Jane at times very much leading the way. The last third pays off handsomely, even if there's the (arguably) inevitable sugar coated candy to swallow as part of the final deal. Cast are dandy and turning in perfs of note, though it needed more of McGregor's John Bishop, because with what little he gets he does make a villainous mark.\r\n\r\nIt looks terrific, Walker's photography bringing to mind the genre work of Roger Deakins, with the New Mexico locations blistering in their beauty, and while the sound mix for dialogue exchanges is a little poor, the musical score is thumping in its tonal appreciations. It's tricky to recommend with confidence even to Western fans, especially in a year when \"Jane\" had to compete with the more rambunctious Magificent Seven reboot, but give it a chance if you liked something like Slow West, and you may just be pleasantly surprised. 7\/10","id":"5880e2a4c3a368310600d848","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5880e2a4c3a368310600d848","movie_id":174751}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> The best life lesson comes from our own experience.\r\n\r\nI recently reviewed a French film called 'Marie's Story', and that led me to check out another masterpiece 'The Miracle Worker'. I loved both the films which are based on the real story that sets around the same time, but in the different continents. This was inspired by those two, other than that there's no connection. In fact they have given a credit by mentioning the Hollywood version. Only a similar theme, but the plot revolves differently. Like it gives an insight of some misconception on the autism.\r\n\r\nIt was actually about a 18 year old rebellious girl Jack, who meets a child with autism. After her young sister was taken away by the child service, she plans to fight back for her custody as they were promised to their mother that they would stay together. Now all she has to do is to find a job, but for her criminal record, she has only one way to get one and she pushes for it. So the story begins when the struggle for her sister guide for a new and unexpected life for both her and the family she meets.\r\n\r\nThe major misunderstanding is it is not all about autism, it was only a part of the story. But the original tale is about a girl whose life transformation from the teenhood to the adulthood. You could say it is a kind of mix of coming-of-age and self-discovery. The phase of that life is very crucial, especially for those who had lost their parents and struggling to find their own place in the society. So the learning process comes from their own experience than anybody's guidance. In that perspective, it was a beautiful and a simple family drama that inspires us. It was not based on the real story, but a very close to one, that's how it leaves the expression on the audience.\r\n\r\n> \"Just felt like my heart was ripped out of my chest and served on a cracker.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl who played the role of an autistic child was good, not fully impressed, but the effort was highly appreciable. As I said the story's focus was on AnnaSophia Robb, though Famke Janssen has given a decent performance too. Most of the human inventions were the accidents and so the most of the relationships. It is until they meet, the right person for each, then their life would be changed forever. Like perhaps Annie-Helen and Marie-Marguerite from the films I mentioned in the first paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe human bond is very unique, but moving to the modern world's society, the rules have kept changing on treating the individuals because of the status of their life. So for the orphans, especially in the first world countries not easy to tackle such situation. This film highlights some of the issues, where and how the teenagers are getting lost.\r\n\r\nLove and care are what most essential for the children, that's what family is for and with that kind of support they will achieve good things in life. But not the same case for the orphans who're treated as some kind of robots and forced to do against their will. It is good for their future, but a messed up system and its officials behaving badly like handling a prisoner. That's how Jack looks at from the perspective of her own life, until she meets a family who seek her help and realises the life is not as complicated as it looks, but we've to opt a right path to travel which needs a great sacrifice on the way to accomplish.\r\n\r\nIt is a very good message film. When one fails to realise, just let them to experience themselves until they come to realise. Sometimes it will be too late to begin again, but nothing is impossible. It is very sad that the film is undiscovered by many. It is no masterpiece, but the quest was very clear to depict the world from the teenager's perspective about how they look at the society, especially the system that laid eyes on them when no other eyes are looking after them. I Highly recommended it, especially for the drama fans and the family audience. Perhaps it might be one of the must see from the last year.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"5752fdd69251410915000122","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5752fdd69251410915000122","movie_id":342464}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Letting it go.**\r\n\r\nThis is like the US version of 'Gabrielle'. About a young woman with Asperger syndrome, trying to date, despite mixed support from her family. This is a cool film. One of the best of its kind. Because this is not the first to explore on such theme. Yeah, they all kind of look the same, but in a different scenario with different syndromes that I even did not know its existence. An unusual romance-drama that focused on as what the director says, 'everyone is worthy of love'.\r\n\r\nThe Jane who has just turned 25, still living with her parents and overprotected by her sister. A big fan of classic romance films and now she decided to take control of her own life. Her interest in having a boyfriend is a good sign for her family, particularly her parents who are moving away. But her sister comes as a big obstacle, especially when she finally found someone interested in her. Which leads to fight back, and how her efforts pays off that comes in the remaining parts.\r\n\r\n> \u275dI've been so focused on the person you were that I wasn't seeing the person you've become.\u275e\r\n\r\nAn indie film, a crowd funded film. A wonderful screenplay and the direction. There were no blank spaces, they all filled with the fine events. Even I liked the pace and the length of the film. But I liked the casting very much. That's the best happened to it. The title role, Jane was awesomely played the actress. Like the saying 'every dog has its day', this was her spotlight and she shined like a rainbow on the summer. Her sister role as well by Eliza Dushku was great, so the remaining cast.\r\n\r\nYou know most of the story, but how it progresses on its own style was the key to its success. This is not just about Asperger syndrome, but like any family who have had a hard time letting it go after coming to realise their position. It was not exactly a romance film you would expect. Because romance was the least focused part, except the initiation for the rest film, which was built on that platform. With the influence of romance, the story takes off from there till the last.\r\n\r\nOne of the year's best and a must see independent film. The target audience is the families, but very much suitable for all ages. There's no way it could have been better. Only if some other filmmakers, film productions attempted it, they would have altered to their style of filmmaking. Otherwise the core of the theme remains the same. With the least known actors and the crew, this is not some film, but a fine film, an appreciable effort. This is an under-noticed film, as well as underrated. It needs your uplift, so don't turn it down.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"597e0971c3a368545101957d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/597e0971c3a368545101957d","movie_id":355890}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Eetti revolves around a sportsperson but it is not a sports film. It is a masala action movie that has smarts but is undone to an extent by the compromises that the director makes to his story. This, he seems to have done to ensure that the layman isn't turned away from the high-concept premise, but he shouldn't have feared so. As Thani Oruvan proved earlier this year, it is very much possible to attract crowds to an action film without resorting to needless comedy and romantic tracks. It is these segments that prove to be the film's Achilles heel and puts Eetti into the 'Could have been better' list.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with a health show on TV on the medical condition Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, a bleeding disorder where the blood doesn't clot for those afflicted with this. We are then told that Pugazhenthi (Atharvaa), the film's protagonist, has this disorder. Pugazh is a college student and a champion athlete in Thanjavur who has made it to the national athletics meet breaking the national record. A wrong call acquaints him with Gayathri (Sri Divya, in yet another bland role), a college student in Chennai, and predictably, this association blossoms into romance. Pugazh, who comes to Chennai for the meet, saves Gayathri's brother Dinesh (Thirumurugan), who has got into trouble with a fake currency racket. Now, the gang is after him as well. Can Pugazh, whose medical condition causes him to faint at the slightest scratch, take on knife-wielding gangsters?\r\n\r\nEetti is at its best when it gets into action mode. The pre-interval stunt, a Run-like scenario where the hero runs away from the goons chasing him only to turn the tables on them, delivers the adrenaline rush that we expect from a film in this genre. Even the scenes where the villains hunt for Pugazh are decent enough, and the climactic fight, when Pugazh takes on Eka, the right hand man of Sampath (an effective RNR Manohar), the head of the gangsters, is done well, though the villains come off as less intelligent when they fail to take advantage of the hero's weakness. The stunt choreographer, Rajashekar cleverly introduces sharp objects during the fight scenes that add an extra bit of tension as we know of the hero's medical condition. And he smartly integrates the athleticism of Pugazh into the stunts and shows us how the guy manages to evade his attackers.\r\n\r\nEven the initial romantic portions \u2014 a wrong call that becomes an excuse for the hero to communicate with the heroine \u2014 are fun. But Ravi Arasu stretches this track unnecessarily with one too many songs, even in the second half. A supposedly funny scene with Adukalam Murugadoss is a test of patience. So, when it had to shift gears and race to the fun, the film moves from the one scene to the next in a jerky manner. Thankfully, Atharvaa, who literally sweats it out to make the athletics portions believable, holds things together and carries the film past the finish line.","id":"56836635925141133400dd7a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56836635925141133400dd7a","movie_id":280878}

It is very imaginative, for a start, colorful in ways that capture the eye, and its message is as deep as you want it to be.\r\n\r\nBy that I mean it would be productive and fun to watch this with children of all ages. The older or more mature the child is, the deeper you can delve into the issues of what to do about feelings of anger, sadness, and so on. With young children, you could even watch it first time through as it is, and save comments or life lessons for additional viewings. There is plenty of action and humor to be found here to entertain hem on that level.\r\n\r\nAnd as a side note, we have no small children to watch this with, but it is also a good movie for adults to settle into, especially during times of stress or worry. We read a recommendation for it during the COVID19 crisis.","id":"5e87d446b84f940014c8f32c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e87d446b84f940014c8f32c","movie_id":150540}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Bare or Bear Puzzle?\r\n\r\nInto the Grizzly Maze is directed by David Hackl and written by Guy Moshe and J.R. Reher. It stars James Marsden, Thomas Jane, Piper Perabo, Scott Glenn, Michaela McManus and Billy Bob Thornton. Music is by Marcus Trumpp and cinematography by James Liston.\r\n\r\nEstranged brothers Rowan (Marsden) and Beckett (Jane) reunite out in the Alaskan wild. They set out into the wilderness to see if they can humanely trap the ferocious grizzly bear that has been savaging the locals.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately in the pantheon of movies featuring Mother Nature's angry beasts stalking humans, this one is very average. Which considering the cast list is not only something of a shame, it's also surprising. The stock roll call of characters with various hang-ups, disabilities or troubled back stories, stumble through the wilderness being menaced by the awesome Red Machine (Bart the Bear the best thing in the pic). Sadly director Hackl doesn't have an eye or ear for a good fright, while his blood letting exercises quickly wear thin come the later stages of the piece.\r\n\r\nThings aren't helped by the flatness of the digital shooting, which only emphasises the poor CGI segments. On the plus side the enviromental messages hold tight, even if the family traumas threaten to avert the points. The location photography - with Vancouver standing in for Alaska - is pleasing in making the scenery a prominent feature, while the finale is good on action entertainment terms, even if the resolution is a touch hokey.\r\n\r\nUltimately this just isn't suspenseful or riveting on either the \"when animals attack\" basis or the fractured character dynamics. 5\/10","id":"5da90336ce6c4c0018b5f2ed","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5da90336ce6c4c0018b5f2ed","movie_id":244316}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"The struggles of a sisterly connection are put to the test in symbolic darkness during a massive, freakish power outage in director Patricia Rozema\u2019s intimate, gripping and quietly thoughtful post-apocalyptic drama **Into the Forest**. Academy Award-nominees Ellen Page (\u201cJuno\u201d) and Rachel Evan Wood (\u201cThirteen\u201d) are the cinematic siblings in Rozema\u2019s (\u201cKit Kittredge: An American Girl\u201d) meditative, tension-inducing tale about the futuristic flirtation with global panic and disillusionment when the world faces the possibility of a modern-day meltdown in technological dependency. In short, **Into the Forest** is a low-key character study touching upon not only the survival of the deteriorating societal elements but also the bond of sisterhood glued together by faith and fear under dour circumstances.\r\n\r\nRozema\u2019s unassuming yet disciplined direction and thought-provoking script creates a low-toned \u201cend-of-the-world\u201d cynicism that psychologically works in her minimalist melodrama. Also, the film\u2019s leads in Page and Evan Wood provide a heavy dose of believability as the periled sisters trapped in the unpredictable confines of the ominous and isolating Canadian woods out in the middle of nowhere as the worldwide woes of a collapsing powerless predicament threatens the global community. Rozema does an admirable job of establishing layers of disorientation on both a collectively worldly scale and smaller, personalized scale for its clingy siblings-in-distress. **Into the Forest** truly resonates when the audience is forced to realize the frightening footsteps of its sisterly protagonists facing the mental and emotional scrutiny of their jeopardized existences.\r\n\r\nConvincingly atmospheric and contemplative, **Into the Forest** manages to be chilling without being over-exaggerated and cliched as one might anticipate in the routine doomsday dramas looking to exploit its nightmarish nuances. The film, as mentioned previously, is set in the near future where sisters Nell (Page) and Eva (Evan Wood) along with their father Robert (Callum Rennie) reside in an expansive house in the woods located in the Pacific Northwest. The narrative wastes no time setting the foundation for its percolating premise when the loss of electricity causes an obvious impact of the uncertainty--stranded out in the broad rustic boundaries without the immediate access to the daily and crucial amenities needed. Nell and Eva come to the realization that the power may not be restored at all. As a result, the starkness and disbelief elevates as the young women must confront the harsh realities as their supply of food and other necessities are diminishing day-by-day. Thus hopelessness, haplessness and helplessness start to rear its ugly head for the unsteadiness of Nell's and Eva's fragile sanity.\r\n\r\nRozema uses **Into the Forest** as an effective landscape for the self-examination of how civilization can easily unravel in a moment's notice. The commentary is not lost on the complacency, indifference and arrogance of mankind taking for granted the gift of planetary conveniences--whether naturally conceived or technologically enhanced. Perhaps **Forest** is not as deep-seeded in traumatic forethought as one might expect but it certainly feels uplifting, genuine and insightful in its message of human despair predicated on a colossal whim of chaos and destruction. **Forest** is unflinching and reflective and clearly shows an edginess and eloquence that is not easily associated with the typical fear-the-unknown fables that are cranked out of Hollywood with bored redundancy. Thankfully, talented performers such as Page and Evan Wood are able to convey that sense of vulnerability that triggers a realistic concern to comply with the film's haunting, creepy theme.\r\n\r\nCanadian filmmaker Rozema is no stranger in presenting prickly and complex women in transition of a reactionary canvas of feminine growth and self-discovery. Previous Rozema-helmed film projects such as the aforementioned \"Kit Kittredge: An American Girl\" from 2008 and debuted feature \"I've Heard the Mermaids Singing\" (1987) demonstrate the similar traits that embodies the determined spirit and inner doubts and dilemmas of Forest's harried heroines searching for comfort in the eye of threatening madness. Hence, Page and Evan Wood aptly carries the skillful angst and anxieties on their burdensome shoulders in Rozema's resourceful character-driven showcase of a crumbling and catastrophic World Order.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, **Into the Forest** marches into the wayward woods of darkness in what amounts to be a surreal, disastrous fairy tale tainted in psychological turmoil. Let's say that the likes of Little Red Riding Hood have nothing on the exposed turbulence of **Forest's** sisterly dystopian divas in Page's Nell and Evan Wood's Eva.\r\n\r\n**Into the Forest** (2016)\r\n\r\nRhombus Media\r\n\r\n1 hr. 41 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Ellen Page, Rachel Evan Wood, Callum Keith Rennie, Wendy Crewson, Max Minghella, Michael Eklund, Jordana Largy\r\n\r\nDirected and Written by: Patricia Rozema\r\n\r\nMPPA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction and Fantasy, Post-Apocalyptic Drama, Psychological Thriller\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n**(c) Frank Ochieng (2016)**","id":"57a791729251415f87004ffc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57a791729251415f87004ffc","movie_id":334538}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"India Pakistan is the kind of film that you might not feel compelled to watch, but if you do catch it, you might not mind it. It is unremarkable in every way with its share of problems but still manages to be a mildly diverting entertainer. The reason for this is that the director N Anand keeps things at a spoof level where another director might have gone for melodrama or action, for which the story offers plenty of scope. \r\n\r\nFirst there is the romance between Karthick (Vijay Antony) and Mellina (Sushma Raj) who have fallen in love at first sight not realizing that soon enough they will be turning into rivals. A Vannakam Chennai-ish mix-up results in the two agreeing to share an office space only to realize later that they are both lawyers. They strike a deal that whoever gets a case first will stay in the place while the other will move out. And thus begins their squabbles and the two try to run down one another in the race to get a client. And as luck would have it, they both land the same case: a childish land dispute between equally juvenile village big shots \u2014 Kaattamuthu (Pasupathy) and Marudhamuthu (MS Bhaskar). Meanwhile, a parallel track, that is straight out of Nadigan, involves one of the leads unwittingly being in possession of a DVD that is an evidence for an illegal encounter and Sampath ( Sharath Lohitashwa), the cop behind the murder, is after them. \r\n\r\nIf India Pakistan works, it is mainly due to Pasupathy and MS Bhaskar who are in top form and keep the laughs coming with their antics. In a different movie, Pasupathy's Kaattamuthu would have been a fearsome person but here, even when he commits murder, the film portrays him in a comical manner. It also helps that the actor, who can at times be stiff, has loosened up his body language to play this role. And MS Bhaskar, as the superstitious Marudhamuthu, proves to be an apt comic foil and watching him speak his lines in the Thirunelveli slang is a delightful experience. The climax, when the two, along with their cohorts (which includes a bevy of minor comic actors), team up with Karthick and try to rescue the heroine from Sampath is just a madcap sequence that has us laughing despite the silliness of the scene. \r\n\r\nHowever, to get to this point, we are forced to spend the entire first half watching the cat-and-mouse fight between Karthick and Mellina. Vijay Antony (whose expressions continue to be placid) and Sushma Raj (who, surprisingly for a Tamil film heroine, gets her lip-sync right), unlike Shiva and Priya Anand in Vanakkam Chennai, aren't actors who can handle comedy that well, and so, after the first couple of scenes, things turn redundant. The narrative even takes an overlong digression and moves to the village of Kaattamuthu and Marudhamuthu. A couple of songs also add to our frustration. It is only when the action shifts to the city, that we heave a sigh of relief.","id":"55976ab3c3a36855e0000a32","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55976ab3c3a36855e0000a32","movie_id":336259}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"As I did in my review of the first instalment, in this movie series I should probably point out that I have not read the books. Some people claim that this movie do not follow the books but, obviously, I cannot comment on that. So my review is based on the movie and the movie alone. I have to confess that I mostly watched this movie because I did watch the first instalment and felt obliged to see where the story went.\r\n\r\nThis movie have quite a few fairly cool special effects, especially the ones when Tris is in the virtual reality world trying to open the cube with the message to the inhabitants in the closed up city. Unfortunately this pretty much sums up the good parts of the movie.\r\n\r\nAs with Divergent I found this movie to be fairly mediocre. One reviewer said that this was a movie dumbed down for the teenage audience. Unfortunately I feel that he was right. Also unfortunately I think many teenagers are a lot smarter than Hollywood believe they are.\r\n\r\nThe plot is, well, mediocre. The acting is fairly meh. The main character, Tris, really lacks any form of charisma and spends most of the movie going around in some state of melancholy feeling sorry for herself and everything that happens around her. Apart from Four most of the people were behaving immaturely, cluelessly, froze up or panicked whenever something nasty happened and switched allegiances back and forth like you changed shirts.\r\n\r\nWhen Tris finally opened the cube I was expecting something cool and unexpected. What we got was a rather dull message about the city and its \u201cpurpose\u201d. I complained in my review of divergent that we got absolutely no background information as to how the people had ended up in this ridiculous situation with a closed city and these factions that I still do not understand what they were supposed to solve. The message was supposed to explain this but it explained absolutely nothing except that the divergents were some kind of purpose or solution.\r\n\r\nThe ending? Well again this is a book series so it is not surprising that it ends in somewhat of a cliffhanger but it was really a cheap ending, one that you would expect from a TV series episode.\r\n\r\nSo I cannot say that I liked the movie very much. The virtual reality special effects scenes were fairly cool but that was about it.","id":"55e003efc3a36826a40016c9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55e003efc3a36826a40016c9","movie_id":262500}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Time travel is such a magic, it also involves great tragic.\r\n\r\nOne of the proofs that Indian films are getting better every year. Very soon it will be placed next to the Hollywood, ahead of European, Japanese, Korean for sure when it comes to international revenue. Because there's fierce competition between Bollywood, Kollywood, Tollywood, Mollywood and many more. Not only among the filmmakers, but fanbase\/followers as well.\r\n\r\nIt is happening because of the younger generation. While they are experimenting and propelling to the future, the senior filmmakers and artists are wasting their reputation for mindless commercial films which is only moving backwards. It's time for non-Indians to learn about other than Bollywood and I also hate when people call all the Indian movies Bollywood.\r\n\r\n> When the time is not matter, everything is possible.\r\n\r\nWhile 'Endhiran' making its debut, they said it will ignite the sci-fi era in Indian cinema. Half a decade has passed and of course, some films came, but this is the major time travel movie I have ever seen in the Tamil language. Though, it was a B category movie. Because the cast has no major star values other than in the local market and it was directed by an incoming filmmaker. I think it was well written screenplay, it was not an intelligent, but easily understandable by everyone. I mean even by the older and rural people.\r\n\r\nTime travel is not new in Indian films, but very very least explored theme. It did not waste time to explain the rules and mechanism from the basics, I think because of familiarity with Hollywood flicks among Indian audience. But still keeps a very simple story and due to layers in time (not the story), looks a little muddle. Not easy to predict, but feels like missed by a very close to fingertip.\r\n\r\nAll in his movie, Vishnu has done a wonderful job, but only a couple of films were somewhat widely  recognised. Mainly because of the low cost movies and failed to promote, in another way to say, filmfestivel movies. Yet another similar outcome from this one which should have helped him to rise, but did not. He is a best all-rounder in the CCL's Rhino, hope his day will come as an actor well.\r\n\r\n> \"Telling a girl and posting on facebook is the same.\"\r\n\r\nThe other actor, Karunakaran was also excellent. He was the comedian and the sidekick before this film, but in here he one of the two leads. Like I always say, the songs are the drawback in Indian films and in this film they did not completely discarded, but reduced the numbers by around 50 per cent. The good thing is, all the songs were with the story, not some unnecessary drag to the outside of the topic.\r\n\r\nFantastic visuals, the standards were pared with any major English movies. But the graphics are what, only the time machine and the rest were story with human characters. The first hour was so fun and romantic, and the remaining hour was a thriller that keeps picking the pace till the final battle. Overall a two hour movie, definitely short and sweet as an Indian film.\r\n\r\nI liked everything in the movie, from an attempt to make this experimental movie for the first time to production quality and performances. But, other than the songs, without the romance track in the narration, still feels impossible to survive its own as a perfect sci-fi-thriller. Excluding a few minor flaws from the movie, this is a very good film considering a low-budget Tamil movie.\r\n\r\nI have heard (might be rumours) there's a possible for a sequel and this time the guest actor, Arya will be making his presence in a full fledged role. It must happen, because it was a brilliant narrative that can go up to become a trilogy. Especially his star value would make the franchise reach every corner. For those who want to see it, I remind don't anticipate like of Hollywood, British films. For Indian standards, it was a much better than nonsense masala films. Highly recommended, if you have not tasted Kollywood yet, it might be a better one to begin with.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"55f71831c3a3686cfd00ae30","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55f71831c3a3686cfd00ae30","movie_id":330418}

He was quite conscious during the emotional scenes and his body language still resembled that of a comedian. Also, having been used to seeing his reactions and tics in a comic context till then, it was a little difficult for us to make that adjustment of looking at him as a hero. But Inimey Ippadithaan shows that the actor is gaining confidence. He looks comfortable in the romantic scenes, he manages to convey sadness better and his physical makeover (the toned physique, the coloured hair, the sunglasses and the stylish costumes) makes it all the more easy for us to accept him as a leading man. He even gets to fight, not in mass hero manner but in thamass hero way and even gets a punchline \u2014 sirippu kaamichu dhaana paathirukka, scene kaamichu paathadhillaye. But let's not kid ourselves. He isn't going to give the Jiivas and Aryas trouble at least for the time being. Comedy is still his biggest weapon and the actor is in sparkling form in this film, which is structured to his strengths. We get the quintessential Santhanam similes, which hit their mark quite often, though there is a fair share of ridicule disguised as humour (on women, obese people, dark people and so on).\r\n\r\nThe plot is basically a retelling of what we have seen in many previous films \u2014 the dilemma of a man who is in love with a girl but is betrothed to another girl, his attempts at finding the right time to reveal the truth and set things right and the consfusion that results due to this situation. In films like Bama Rukmani and Veera, this kind of situation continues even after marriage while in films like Naam Iruvar Namakku Iruvar and Ninaithen Vandhai, things get resolved right before the marriage. Inimey Ippadithaan resembles the latter in most aspects. We have a decent young man in love with a glamorous (read bold and skirt-wearing) girl, while the one to whom he gets engaged is quite traditional (the salwar, sari type). As in that film, the hero here has a maternal uncle (Thambi Ramaiah) who knows his predicament but just complicates matters. We have a strict father who will not hear his son going against his will. We get episodes involving mistaken identities (the pre-interval scene in which Seenu talks to both Maha and Akhila on the phone at the same time) and nailbiting scenes where the hero could get caught at the most inopportune moment (Maha comes to the same restaurant in which Seenu has brought Akhila and his efforts to get away from the place without being seen by Maha) that serve as the source for the film's humour.\r\n\r\nBut because it has a comedian as the hero, the directors, Murugan and Prem Anand (who go by the screen name Muruganand), are also able to make some bold moves, most importantly in the climax, which surprisingly isn't comic \u2014 the film acknowledges that part of Seenu's predicament is also a result of his own cowardice and he has to pay for that. It is both a poignant hat tip to another comic hero and his film (K Bhagyaraj, Chinna Veedu) and redemption for the earlier politically incorrect jokes.","id":"559769759251413da2000b21","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/559769759251413da2000b21","movie_id":344334}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The mystery box and the power hungry leaders!\r\n\r\nThis is not a bad sequel, I quite enjoyed it, but I think I liked 'Divergent' better. The story continued a very short after where it ended in the first. In this part, it was all about power hungry where many try to get that top post. On the other side, there will be an attempt to open a mystery box that found which might reveal some important detail about them.\r\n\r\nLooked like a very good storyline, unpredictable stuffs, but not utilised to its full potential. Though the actors were good, especially Shailene was sexy in her short hairs. I think she came straight out of 'The Fault in Our Stars' to take up this role where her brother in this film was a boyfriend in that.\r\n\r\nVisually as well very captivating with those great graphics and it is first digital 3D film in the series. It has numerous small twists, especially during decrypting the mystery box. So I felt the middle parts were the best part of the film.\r\n\r\nI thought this film would take place outside the wall, but a new story was developed and still kept the mystery about the rest of the world. I don't know the book, but that's my disappointment. I hope the next film in the series would go beyond the wall and explore some new things. So I'm looking forward for the 'Allegiant'.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"5787bc1792514131c0000c5a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5787bc1792514131c0000c5a","movie_id":262500}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> We actually know this story, but not the truth until now!\r\n\r\nRon Howard's latest sea adventure, stars Chris Hemsworth in an important role. So the people comparing it with 'Moby Dick', because both the film is about the same story, but one was inspired and the other one was, I mean this film was based on the actual event. I had seen the BBC film 'The Whale', not a bad film for a low budget television film. Most importantly, it revealed the truth about what I was not aware of from one of my favourite sea adventure films.\r\n\r\nI never read the book, but saw the British version, so I knew what I'm going to witness. Still, I was very interested to check it out, because it is a grand film and as expected I loved the visuals. Those sea adventures were very realistic, except the action sequences which is obviously cinema gimmick. The surprise part was the narration. It was a flashback story, something like 'Life of Pi', a man recall his old memory of his survival at the sea with other crew members of the ship Essex when it was attacked by a big white whale.\r\n\r\nIt is kind of impossible to believe what this film says is true. And obviously what we see is not what exactly happened, but very close. So see this film to believe it. Whatever it is, I totally enjoyed watching it. The 2 hour long never looked too long. There are a few mild disturbing scenes due to the theme concept, but it is a good family film. If you like 'Moby Dick' then you should watch it. Definitely an underrated film by the film critics.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"57951d07c3a36837ae008525","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57951d07c3a36837ae008525","movie_id":205775}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"A scientist (Arya) in the year 2065 invents a time machine and to prove its capability sends it back in time to 2015. However, the machine is seen by three persons in the past \u2014 Elango (Vishnu Vishal, solid), a young man who is finding it hard to catch a break, his friend Pulivetti Arumugam (Karunakaran, whose quips keep you in splits), a pretend astrologer, and Giridhara Parthasarathy (TM Karthik, equal part crazy and funny), a inventor. The three are involved in a minor accident and they witness the time machine appearing out of thin air while they are recovering from the shock. While Parthasarathy plans to keep it to himself, he ends up in a coma and Elango and Arumugam use the machine to further the latter's astrology business. They recover things that have been lost by people by going back in time but do so under the guise of astrology. However, during one such excursion into the past, they meddle more than necessary and this prevents the death of Kuzhandaivelu (Ravi Shankar), a gangster and extortionist, who is actually tragetting Rajarathinam (Jayaprakash), the father of Elango's girlfriend Anu (Mia George). Soon, things begin to spiral out of control and their lives become living hell.\r\n\r\nTime travel movies can be a lot of fun and that is something that debutant director Ravikumar seems to have realized straightaway. There is a lot of humour in Indru Netru Naalai, and much of it comes out organically \u2014 the comedy scenes are very much part of the plot. That is why the early trips that Elango and Arumugam take in the time machine have a touch of humour about them. After hearing on the news that gold prices have shot up, the two friends journey back in time to the pre-Independence era, pick up a lot of jewellery and when they pay the jeweller in modern-day currency, he returns it to them saying, \"Velinaattu kaasu ellaam naan vaangarathilla.\" It is only then that it strikes them that contemporary currency will not have any value in the past.\r\n\r\nThis is something that we must have all, at one point or the other, fantasized about \u2014 how we could become super rich if we could go back in time and invest in things when they were cheaper. It is such relatable moments that make the film and the concept easily accessible to us. Time travel movies can easily become a mindbenders but here, there is always clarity in the screenplay \u2014 though, sometimes, at the cost of brevity. And these moments are really fascinating; in one song, Elango takes Anu through moments from her childhood and at one point, she ends up kissing herself when she was a newborn baby! Yes, it is a slightly illogical moment but it is also a deeply touching one. The scene in which Elango, Arumugam and Parthasarathy chance upon the time machine is presented in thrilling fashion. And the fact that the friends decide to use Arumugam's profession as a camouflage to use the machine (in one cheeky scene, a person requests them to find the missing Malaysian airplane!) and make money is a masterstroke \u2014 that rare instance when astrology is actually science. And, the visual effects are not tacky and we readily suspend our disbelief during the time travel scenes.\r\n\r\nBut in the second half, the wonder of time travel is used to tell a cliched gangster tale. The whole episode where Elango and Rajarathinam seek the help of Kuzhandaivelu's mentor and rival feels unnecessary given how little impact it has on the plot. The film is also a little short on energy \u2014 yes, we laugh at the jokes, wonder at the science and care for the characters but the narrative lacks pep in places making the film a tad overlong.","id":"5597691a9251413da2000b13","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5597691a9251413da2000b13","movie_id":330418}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Pretty good bear attack flick with James Marsden, Thomas Jane and Piper Perabo*** \r\n\r\nSeveral people coalesce in a region of Alaska called the Grizzly Maze where a rogue bear is on the loose: A local man recently released from prison (James Marsden), his ex-girlfriend (Michaela McManus), his estranged deputy brother (Thomas Jane), the deputy\u2019s photographer wife (Piper Perabo), a half-crazy hunter (Billy Bob Thornton), a compromised sheriff (Scott Glenn) and an AmerIndian poacher (Adam Beach). \r\n\r\n\u201cInto the Grizzly Maze\u201d (2015) is a bear attack movie and, more generally, a wilderness adventure\/thriller. When it comes to these types of films \u201cThe Edge\u201d (1997) reigns supreme, as does the brooding \u201cHold the Dark\u201d (2018), although the latter has no bear (actually \u201cThe Edge\u201d is only partially a bear attack movie, as it goes much deeper than that, like \u201cHold the Dark\u201d). While nowhere near as effective as \u201cThe Edge\u201d and \u201cHold the Dark,\u201d \u201cInto the Grizzly Maze\u201d is about on par with the Indie \"Backcountry\" (2014) in all-around entertainment; and it\u2019s superior to the prosaic \u201cGrizzly\u201d (1976). \r\n\r\nWhere \u201cInto the Grizzly Maze\u201d excels is the locations and awesome cinematography. This might be the best-looking forest flick ever made. The cast is exceptional too. In these areas it\u2019s superior to all the above movies with the possible exception of \u201cThe Edge\u201d where it\u2019s at least on par. The conflict-habituated relationship of the brothers (Marsden and Jane) is amusing and it\u2019s nice to see Piper Perabo again, who was about 38 during shooting and looking better than ever, top to bottom. Meanwhile McManus has a stunning face and mesmerizing eyes.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 34 minutes, and was shot in the Vancouver area, British Columbia, and Big Bear, California (the bar scene). \r\n\r\nGRADE: B\/B-","id":"5d5302779a8a8a414ae46556","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d5302779a8a8a414ae46556","movie_id":244316}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"The most amusing thing in Eli is the way its hero, Vadivelu, reads the pre-credits smoking disclaimer. Now, that should give you an idea of how the actual movie is \u2014 overlong, dull and largely unfunny. The director, Yuvaraj Dhayalan, seems to be after a spoof of spy movies but the filmmaking has no comic rhythm and the script, which rehashes elements from movies as varied as Ragasiya Police 115 and The Departed, is too slack that scenes just go on for ever. \r\n\r\nThe plot revolves around the police trying to capture a gang of cigarette smugglers headed by Nagarajan ( Pradeep Rawat), who has managed to elude the cops because of a mole in the police department. So, the commissioner ( Adithya) approaches Elisamy aka Eli (Vadivelu), who aspired to become a cop but ended up as a small-time crook after failing the test because of a minor technicality, to infiltrate the gang, collect evidence against them and find out who the mole is. \r\n\r\nOne of the most infuriating aspects of Eli is that things happen without any rhyme or reason. We wonder why the film had to be set in the 1960s. Maybe, the period look is supposed to automatically give the film a funny tone. But then, the look isn't followed throughout; we see modern-day buildings, grounds and things in the background every time the action takes place outdoors. Ironically, it is the writing that feels dated. The villain smuggles cigarettes. Why cigarettes and not the usual not diamonds or drugs? Just to give the film a 'message'. We get a duet where Vadivelu lip-syncs to Aaradhana's Mere Sapnon Ki Rani and romances Sadaa (who is technically the heroine but appears only in the second half). Why a Hindi song? Probably the filmmakers thought Vadivelu singing a Hindi song would be funny \u2014 it isn't. \r\n\r\nThe film is filled with characters who think they are funny but rather come across as irritating. The dialogues have to make us laugh instantly but the timing is quite off that you can count the moments where we break into a chuckle. As for Vadivelu, he gets a feet-first introduction befitting a top hero, gets to do stunts and tries hard to make us laugh but there is hardly any spark in this material for him to keep us entertained. Some of his physical comedy works but there are times when it becomes grating (like when he tries to make faces like a rat). The film is a wake-up call for the gifted comedian whose career is currently at the crossroads.","id":"55976955c3a36855e0000a19","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55976955c3a36855e0000a19","movie_id":342003}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"Jane Eyre meets House of Usher with ghosts of the past\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2015 and written & directed by Guillermo del Toro, \"Crimson Peak\u201d is a Gothic drama\/mystery\/horror about a young woman (Mia Wasikowska) in the opening years of the 1900s who falls in love with a mysterious English man (Tom Hiddleston) and moves from Buffalo, NY, to a creepy English manor, where his weird older sister also lives (Jessica Chastain). Ghosts of the past make themselves known, ultimately leading to the truth.\r\n\r\nAside from Jane Eyre and House of Usher, both of which have been filmed several times, \u201cCrimson Peak\u201d has similarities to haunting Gothic flicks like \u201cBram Stoker\u2019s Dracula\u201d (1992), \u201cThe Others\u201d (2001) and \u201cMary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein\u201d (1994), but it\u2019s thankfully nowhere near as ridiculously melodramatic as the latter. The spectral horror is more low-key than \u201cDracula\u201d and \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d which is why I cite \u201cThe Others.\u201d Psychological Gothic horror like \u201cDemons of the Mind\u201d (1972) and \u201cThe Eternal\u201d (1998) are other comparisons. If you\u2019re in the mood for a movie like these, you\u2019ll probably appreciate \u201cCrimson Peak.\u201d\r\n\r\nHonestly, this is one of the most sumptuously LOOKING movies I\u2019ve ever seen. Take, for instance, the numerous scenes of Edith (Mia) walking down the lavish halls in an alluring white nightgown and flowing blond hair. The Gothic lushness is to die for.\r\n\r\nSome people think the story is meh, but it\u2019s no better or worse than the plots of the seven movies listed above. Whilst the first act in Buffalo is somewhat tedious, the movie picks up interest once Edith (Mia) moves to the unsettling English chateau, which has seen better days. I read a critic\u2019s list of a dozen questions in an attempt to tear the film to pieces, but I easily answered all of them, which showed that this critic was intentionally LOOKING FOR something to dislike. Every potential quibble is effortlessly explained by clues in the picture or simply reading in-between the lines.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 59 minutes and was shot in Hamilton, Kingston and Toronto, Canada.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> CREED is the new ROCKY.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I was looking for the 7th film in the 'Rocky' series, so this spinoff was totally unexpected. But it is the right thing since the Rocky Balboa is getting old. Besides, in this reboot era, keeping franchise alive and leaping into the next generation was a very smart move. By doing this, they're keeping the original series fans with them to back it. I hope this will only get going like the Bond movies, since the young star, Jordan has another 30+ year potential to continue the 'Rocky' legacy by delivering some hits in his belt.\r\n\r\nI don't know how they have done it, just kept everything so simple yet delivered a successful movie. The director of 'Fruitvale Station' and its actor Jordan's second successive run. I wish the combo return for the third time for another grand scale flick. Of course Stallone's presence made a big difference, but the way his character was portrayed, I feel the next film will get more emotional, especially between Rocky and Adonis like Rocky and Micky. And I'm also hoping for a bit better romantic tale on the side.\r\n\r\nI grew up watching 'Rocky' movies, so I wanted badly it to be at least a decent, but it is a fantastic flick and I definitely suggest for those people like me. The youngsters as well can taste the new beginning in the Rocky legacy. CREED is the new ROCKY. The blueprint for the screenplay was exactly same as the original movies, even the music was very comparable yet everything was updated to the current timeline. Now I'm looking for a follow-up in the next 3 years.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"56cdebf5c3a368127f0000fb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56cdebf5c3a368127f0000fb","movie_id":312221}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Ghosts are real, that much she knows.\r\n\r\nSeen all the Del Toro films, but this one was not any good compared to his recent year's class. The film has his signature mark, the gothic style atmosphere, visually spectacular, but the story did not strike as expected. Definitely my blame is on the writing department. Though the actors were so much better in their character exhibition, especially the lead trio.\r\n\r\nThe opening convinced it will going to be a terrifying horror. Seriously? The writer brought ghosts for a concept, but ended penning a fantasy-thriller. In the middle of the narration there was too much drama that dragged the story. And in the third act it turned totally into a killer-thriller. It should have been more frightening, they wanted it to be a faulty human nature kind of twist than supernatural things. Well, they gave what they wanted, not what we the audience looking for.\r\n\r\nI did not completely disliked the movie, I enjoyed it other than its plot. The costumes were very nice, the music well blended with the screenplay, but I was disappointed with the reason given as the motivation for all the trouble faced by character Edith. After all the hype, what it revealed was too little and too sudden with guessable stuffs.

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"The feasting of the eyes comes to mind when realizing the polished opulence of writer-director Guillermo del Toro\u2019s Gothic supernatural production Crimson Peak. Undeniably luscious and wonderfully bizarre, Crimson Peak is a psycho-sexual thriller that resonates with the enticing visual senses and registers with the proper amount of off-kilter seduction and twisted charm. For filmmaker del Toro his unconventional narratives have always been peppered in exquisite bounciness regardless of their hit-or-miss effectiveness. In joining past del Toro genre-ridden offerings that range from the revered cult-like stimulation of Pan\u2019s Labyrinth to the misplaced but eye-popping stiffs such as Blade II and Pacific Rim it is safe to declare Crimson Peak as another elegant and gaudy candy-coated canvas of del Toro\u2019s imaginative cinematic vision.\r\n\r\nAesthetically stunning and armed with a sophisticated lining of suspense, Crimson Peak does not necessarily exude any real momentum of toxic scares or memorable chills. Still, it manages to rely on its Gothic-induced romanticism that is enough to accept this splashy and offbeat vehicle on the merits of its unique brand of animated style. Sure, there are displayed predictable paths to tap into Crimson Peak\u2019s erratic pulse and maybe del Toro and fellow co-screenwriter Matthew Robbins could have injected some more convincing bits of subversive edginess to spice up its modest creepiness. Nevertheless, one can appreciate the borrowed Hitchcockian overtones combined with the arresting set designs and peculiar ensemble. This alone invites Crimson Peak as a colorful costume drama layered in concentrated showiness.\r\n\r\nThankfully, the October release of Crimson Peak should echo the spooky spirit of Halloween appropriately and offer some seasonal sizzle for the macabre-embracing moviegoers. The story may not be startling to the point of an innovative revelation but the winning element\u2013at least one of them anyway\u2013is the exceptional art direction and production design that suitably defines del Toro\u2019s mystifying universe of nostalgic ghostly aberrations. Crimson Peak will not be confused with high-minded horror anytime soon but it does effectively promote its lush, Gothic-induced romantic vibes.\r\n\r\nBudding American novelist Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska, \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d) has one specific belief system to hang her literary hat on and the sentiment is self-explanatory: \u201cGhosts are real!\u201d. This haunting message has plagued Edith since she was a young girl growing up in Buffalo, New York in the early 1900\u2019s. Edith was an only child of privilege and an apple in the eye of her widowed wealthy father in businessman Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver). Naturally the protective parental instincts kick in as Cushing is weary of an opportunist that might wanting to court his eligible daughter Edith.\r\n\r\nEnter the seemingly shifty and broke British aristocrat Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston). Sharpe has an agenda and it is quite clear. Apparently Sharpe wants to shop around a potential profit-making mining device and needs financial support and promotion from an influential American contact. Coincidentally, Sharpe starts a relationship with promising writer Edith whose Daddy Dearest happens to be a prominent industrialist. How convenient, huh? The skepticism about Sir Thomas Sharpe starts to mount for the concerned Carter Cushing as he stands by and regrettably witnesses his precious offspring Edith\u2019s affection for the cunning character.\r\n\r\nOf course Sharpe is not the only target that moneybags Cushing needs to worry about as the loving companion to his treasured Edith. Sharpe\u2019s older sister Lady Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain, \u201cThe Martian\u201d) accompanies her sibling on his mission to do whatever he has planned for his personal gain. So now Cushing has double trouble with the mysterious brother-sister Sharpe tandem as they are embedded in the indelible psyche of the artistic Edith. However, the Sharpes have spun their web as they now have turned Edith into a member of their family as both wife and sister-in-law. Thus, a fresh existence begins for Edith Cushing Sharpe on the other side of the pond in Northern England where the Sharpes\u2019 Cumberland-based estate Allerdale Hall is located.\r\n\r\nRealistically, the less-than-stellar Allerdale Hall is not exactly the ideal venue that caters to the so-called prominence of the aristocratic Sharpes. The vast Victorian house is relentlessly drab and does not reflect the impressive homestead that it should be in status and structure. In making matters worse at Allerdale Hall Edith is restricted from stepping into certain parts of the dilapidated dwelling. Plus, Edith is overwhelmed by the recurring appearances of pesky apparitions that roam in and out of the expansive hallways of the isolated, blood-colored domicile. Lastly, the creaky goings-on is not helped a bit by the drastic change in hubby Sir Thomas\u2019s demeanor as Edith feels duped by his on-going indifference. Edith has to feel uneasy and uncertain about what she has gotten involved with concerning the grasp of the mischievous Sharpes and the life-long warnings of afterlife spirits in the decaying manse that she has been taught to take seriously since childhood.\r\n\r\nThe sinister symbolism is adequately atmospheric and the erratic pacing makes for some rather genuine, tense moments. However, Crimson Peak does show some flashes of being a slight boofest melodrama that undermines its titillating convictions. As an eerie romancer Crimson Peak feels a tad uneven. The three-way love triangle pitting Wasikowska\u2019s Edith against both Hiddleston\u2019s Sir Thomas Sharpe and Charlie Hunnan\u2019s Alan McMichael (Edith\u2019s first suitor before Sharpe\u2019s arrival) could have been explored but felt rushed and pushed aside. The whispering presence of shadowy ghostly figures floating about within the decrepit walls of Allerdale Hall makes for some convincing hair-raising hedonism that is compatible with del Toro\u2019s topsy-turvy color-toned exposition.\r\n\r\nOverall, the real scene-stealers behind Crimson Peak\u2019s brightly spry makeup belongs to the film\u2019s handlers responsible for the glossy sheen of this eye-fetching film project. Credit the sumptuous contributions in the aforementioned art design and sets (not to mention the crisp cinematography and fashionable costumes) to propel Crimson Peak\u2019s entertainment value beyond the tepid lapses in manufactured jitters.\r\n\r\nCrimson Peak (2015)\r\n\r\nUniversal Pictures\r\n\r\n1 hr. 59 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Mia Wasikowska, Tom Hiddleston, Jessica Chastain, Jim Beaver, Charlie Hunnan\r\n\r\nDirected and Co-Written by: Guillermo del Toro\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror and Romance\/Supernatural Thriller\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating ** 1\/2 stars (out of 4 stars)","id":"5622acc1c3a3680e1d00c6fe","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5622acc1c3a3680e1d00c6fe","movie_id":201085}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A small accident can lead to a great achievement, but difficult path is certain.\r\n\r\nIt is a semi-biographical film about a person who invented a modern hygienic mop. So all the depicted events and characters were partially real, but for the cinematic reason they have been fairly altered for a good outcome. And yes, I loved it. A very inspiring film among all the Oscars nominees this year. In some way I also felt Jennifer Lawrence should have got the award for her fine character display.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I was not interested in this, so I wanted to get over it silently as soon as possible. But I ended up enjoying a lot and instantly it became one of my favourites of the 2015. What I expected after watching its trailer was like I judged it by its cover. As I hesitated in the earlier, but strangely now I'm recommending it to all.\r\n\r\nThe story of a woman who grew up listening her grandmother's motivational speeches. But realises the life is tougher than she thought and making a living is very competitive. After so many struggles in the life, she finally invents something that changes her and her family fortune forever. But like any new initiative does face, the problems arise and how she is going to fix them is what the remaining film narrates.\r\n\r\nA very interesting film in the perspective of the career option. Forget the doctors, engineers, lawyers and those who're settled in their lives with a good job in hand that pays big, but there are billions of people, to them it will definitely serve as an inspiration to ignite their future.\r\n\r\nThe rating for this looks like a fair value, but still a very underrated film everywhere. Amazing actors, a little funny and a little emotional, but a very impressive film directed by the one who bought the Oscars to Jennifer Lawrence for their earlier venture together. I don't know what's between her and Bradley Cooper, but looks like their onscreen chemistry is doing something big impact. This is their's fourth project together and second with the director, so I hope they do more in the future as well. This is really a wonderful film, so don't miss it.\r\n\r\n8.5\/10","id":"57603b7ac3a3687ceb00169f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57603b7ac3a3687ceb00169f","movie_id":274479}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"The pre-release buzz around Mani Ratnam's O Kadhal Kanmani was that it is a sequel to Alaipayuthey and while the maker has denied this, nonetheless, the film does feel like a spiritual cousin to the earlier film. The circumstances that led to the films couldn't have been any similar. At the time he made Alaipayuthey, Mani Ratnam had delivered a couple of films (Iruvar, Dil Se) that did not work at the box office and questions were raised on whether this avowedly mainstream filmmaker was not connecting with his audience. This time, after the failed experiments of Raavanan and Kadal, these questions are being raised yet again. \r\n\r\nAnd the filmmaker shows that his touch is in tact and he can still make a romance come alive on screen. With some help from PC Sreeram, whose gorgeous, superbly-lit frames capture the beauty of both Mumbai and the cramped quarters of the lead couple, and AR Rahman, whose hip songs and background score, keeps the scenes throbbing, Mani Ratnam has given us a romantic film for this generation. Unlike Kadal, which never came together as a whole despite some standout moments, the scenes here flow organically, and let us soak in the breezy romance between Adhi and Tara (Dulquer Salmaan and Nithya Menon, who sizzle on screen). \r\n\r\nThere are scenes that seem to mirror, as if purposefully, Alaipayuthey. As in that film, the meet-cute happens at the railway station and at a wedding. The pair woos each other on the train. Even the financial background of their families (Tara is super rich, while Adhi is a middle-class boy), and their fashionable jobs (if Alaipayuthey's Karthik was working in an IT startup and Shakti a medical student, Adhi here is a video game designer, while Tara is an architecture student) are similar. Like Shakti, Tara goes on a study tour (here, it is Ahmedabad) and like Karthik, Adhi follows his lover there. There is also an older couple as in that film informing their romance. And, there is even a search for a loved one that finally makes the lead couple realize what they actually want. \r\n\r\nBut this is a love story about youngsters from this generation, who tend to give career the same importance as relationship. So, unlike Karthik and Shakti, who couldn't wait to get married, Adhi and Tara want to be together but at the same time, realize that their relationship comes with an expiry date (much like Arjun and Meera from Ratnam's Ayitha Ezhuthu) as she will be moving to Paris for higher studies while he might go to the US or the UK to earn more money. So, they settle for a live-in relationship and stay in the house of the elderly Ganapathy ( Prakash Raj, who gives his most understated performance since his brief role in Vettaiyaadu Vilayadu) and Bhavani (Leela Samson making a spirited debut). Ganapathy is a retired bank officer and Bhavani, a classical singer whose Azheimer's is in its early stage. Their easy-going relationship is one of the highlights in the film. \r\n\r\nStill, for all its infectious vigour, crackling dialogue and youthful vibe, there are times when we sense that we are watching a film that is lacking in punch as this tale is short on conflicts. This is especially true in the second half when, after a point, the characters seem to be repeating themselves (the whole sequence when Adhi and Tara decide to enjoy their last few days to the hilt seems redundant). Too much screen time is also given to the video game that Adhi is developing (an action thriller set in Mumbai where the hero has to rescue the heroine from a two-headed villain), which feels like a script that Ratnam discarded at some point in his career. \r\n\r\nBut these are minor niggles that we need not be concerned too much about right now (but still need to be mentioned because we have come to expect so much from this director). They don't really take away much from how entertaining the film is, and more importantly, this is the time for us to celebrate a return-to-form of one of our premier filmmakers.","id":"55976b68c3a36855e8000a9a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55976b68c3a36855e8000a9a","movie_id":329135}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> The modern warfare, and its advantages as well as drawbacks.\r\n\r\nA new kind of war. When everyone is worried about robots might take over our jobs, it meant military as well. There was not robots in this, but a war fought from a safe distance and soldiers don't have to be physically trained so well, even the geeks with the gaming knowledge can take over. So a film about the modern warfare where the casualty rate is very minimum and can be accomplished before any major assault take place.\r\n\r\nFrom the South African director of 'Ender's Game' fame. This is slightly a similar theme, but a real world affair and a real time presentation. Initially I thought it was a remake of the Hong Kong film of the same name. We had seen drone attacks in the films, but they won't last for a few minutes. This film was entirely about how drone missions work that told with detail.\r\n\r\n\"Never tell a soldier that he does not know the cost of war.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a very good film and they must make a sequel to it. This film will get a special status going towards the future. There were no physically exceptional performances, the stars' presence and their verbal expressions were stronger. So there many thrilling scenes with great lines, especially Alan Rickman's final dialogue. This film was his final film and he was excellent like the usual. Even the Abdi's role was small, but powerful and so Helen Mirren's, but Aaron Paul and the rest were decent.\r\n\r\nThe story was good, but I did not like the too much sentimentalised. Because all's fair in love and war. You won't make a film to please the terrorists and their sympathisers. Other than that it is a masterpiece.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Probably the best live-shot Cinderella I've seen.\r\n\r\nDisney has done it again. Everybody knows Cinderella story and what this film gave was as it is with the help of modern CGI works. When I heard about the Disney's live-shot version is getting ready, I had a serious doubt, but not anymore. Nowadays, the filmmakers know how to pull it off a big budget movie with ease. Especially from Hollywood, if one market fails, it will raise in another as the recent example was 'Age of Extinction'. I am glad this movie met a great success despite it was not a surprise material as a story, but was as the quality of product.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs nearly for 100 minutes, that does not feel too long as the narration had a wonderful pace. Everything was awesomely handled by the director of 'Thor'. It's a new era of the live-shot movies, which borrows the stories from the fairytales, folklore and classical animations. Recent 'Maleficent' was one of the great examples and this film as well enters the book of triumph.\r\n\r\nLily James was very good, I haven't seen her much, because she's kind of a new actress in the spotlight. She's cute and adorable, I love to see her in many movies in the future. While Cate Blanchett, I never had any disbelief in her and she delivered it perfectly. An ideal movie for a family to watch at the weekend. I think children would love it, so at least watch it for them, with them.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"55ba5eebc3a3684af1004ad4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55ba5eebc3a3684af1004ad4","movie_id":150689}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Discovering a whole new world beyond the 4 walls.\r\n\r\nWe all know the German folk tale 'Rupanzel', and this is a similar kind with entirely different motive. All the above it is not a fairy tale set in the medieval period, but inspired by many real events of the present era. A couple of years ago I saw a German movie called '3096 Days' based on the true story. When I heard of this movie is being made, at first obviously I remembered that title, but after seeing the poster alone convinced me not the same. Automatically the expectations rose, and now it's got the 4 Oscars nominees, including the best motion picture.\r\n\r\nThe both halves of the movie were entirely different from each other like the two sets of story, but the core of the theme remains same. The first half was a crucial part that takes place completely in a single room with a minimal cast. It does not go through the intro, just begins to tell the story like it's already happening and you might take a few minutes to realise the state of condition. The next half is a reaction to what happened in the previous. And again this is also an important storytelling section because like the title, it was not all about the room, but beyond that 4 walls and its roof and floor like how it affected the mother and son.\r\n\r\n> \"If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.\"\r\n\r\nThe movie does not talk about the crime feature at all. Not even considered to reveal behind the motive. So the other side mystery remains as it is. The whole narration was one sided, everything was seen through the eyes of a five year old boy. He begins with the line 'Once upon a time...' like a fairy tale, because it is to him and with his cute little performance along with Brie Larson's, the movie briefs their struggle for freedom.\r\n\r\nIt was a too casual opening, like nothing bad is really happening, just they're weird people or maybe agoraphobia, except they're not. You know when we say we love to be kids again to escape this complicated adult life, sometimes we won't mean it except it was a normal reaction to the situation we're in. But what if a five year old boy wants to be four again when her mother thinks its time to him know what the real world looks like. Yeah, that's a too much to take in for a young boy, but that's the best chance they had to break free from the psycho who put her mother in that room.\r\n\r\n> \"When I was small, I only knew small things.\r\n> But now I'm five, I know everything.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a tidy place, but the camera angles were impressive. I know it was shot in a studio with a wide open space behind the camera, but that does not the viewpoint in the actual story. When the first half ends, it is an indication of the good parts are over, at least that's what I thought of, but what came after was the unexpected expansion in narration. Usually most of the similar tales end in that part itself like for example 'Prisoners' and the rest is understandable stuff that won't be shown.\r\n\r\nWhen a tale had a ending like 'happily ever after', still some people desire for it to continue a few more minutes to know how happy really they are and that's what this film's second half.  Remember, most of the similar themes have multiple perspectives, like how victim's family is coping with, cops are pursuing the suspect, abductor's plans and motive, and captives struggle. Like I said it was all about what a mother and her son goes through those years in captivity and after that.\r\n\r\nThere were some suspicious characters and events like I had a bad feeling over the doctor's soft talking, also the mother-son's master plan when in captive. Those are tiny diversions to viewers assume differently against where the story is heading. It is all about the mother and son's mental trauma, especially for the little boy similar to when Tarzan is in a big town for the first time leaving behind his other life. It was a perfect pace as well, neither hurried nor a slow development. The movie was a big break for many, especially for the Irish director, and Brie Larson and of course for the kid. Definitely one of the finest movie of 2015 and a must watch.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"56cdf28b92514152bc000200","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56cdf28b92514152bc000200","movie_id":264644}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"So you fall in love with a girl. You think she loves you but then one day, she tells you that she loved you because she thought you were rich and now wants to dump you because she cannot accept a middle class guy as the man of her dreams. You try to reason with her and tell her that love \u2014 and not money \u2014 drives life but she isn't in a mood to listen to you. Worse, she humiliates you in public and walks away leaving you stranded literally in the middle of the road. What would you do? If you were a sensible, thinking individual, you would either thank your stars that you did not end up marrying someone who was clearly not your type or you would give it back to her and walk off with your head held high.\r\n\r\nBut Karthik (Jayam Ravi, who tries too hard to make us feel this is fun), the protagonist of Romeo Juliet, is definitely one-of-a-kind. He is so fixated on his girlfriend, Aishwarya (an ill-fitting Hansika, whose exaggerated expressions and bad lip sync never allow the character to seem real) that he goes after her with vengeance to win her back in the most ridiculous manner possible. He gatecrashes during her engagement to Arjun (a stoic Vamsi Krishna), a multi-millionaire, blackmails her by saying that he will inform Arjun of her previous love affair and then forces her to find him a girl who is quite like her! And, by the time she has finally understood what true love is all about (thanks to Arjun, who is such a control freak that he even hires a handwriting coach for Aishwarya because he doesn't like her handwriting!), humiliates her in public \u2014 quite clearly a tit for tat \u2014 before accepting her. But, we are not supposed to delve into the morality of his actions or feel offended at the insensitivity of the characters (quite a few characters use rape in the context of amusement). And also not feel sorry for Nisha (you can't help but feel sorry for Poonam Bajwa, who plays the third wheel), the girl who Aishwarya fixes him up with and who genuinely loves him. Because, you see, Romeo Juliet is a romantic comedy and we have to take all of these in the right spirit. So, even though Karthik is essentially harassing Aishwarya, we should root for him and see all his actions as 'fun'. Finally, here is a film that could prove to be a worthy challenger to Valiyavan for the title of the Most Preposterous Movie of the Year.\r\n\r\nThat said, Romeo Juliet does begin interestingly. The titles play over romantic scenes from the films of popular stars from MK Thyagaraja Bhagavathar to Dhanush. The songs by D Imman are peppy and catchy enough. And Aishwarya, at least initially, seems different from the run-of-the-mill heroine roles we see in our films. In a refreshing twist, it is she, the heroine, who stalks the hero; she even takes the first step and proposes to him by gifting a ring. She is not one bit bothered about admitting that she holds money over everything else. And she is quite clear that she doesn't want to be a martyr wife. When Karthik pleads with her to not break the relationship and tells her that he will achieve anything if she is with him, she retorts, 'Nee saadhikkaradhukkaaga ellaam ennala kalyanam pannikka mudiyadhu.' But then, this is a Tamil film, and the heroine is expected to be tamed by the hero and so, the director turns this somewhat fascinating character into a cliche.","id":"559769919251413d9c000a85","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/559769919251413d9c000a85","movie_id":280942}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A small contribution by everyone matters a lot.\r\n\r\nThe organism survives only if the surrounding environment favours. But it takes thousands of years of evolution to find its right place. Its existence is only to restore the balance in the nature as much as fast it can. Because the organism moves one place to another and help elements to meet one another which can't do themselves, in a result the reaction happen. The extinction happens when the balance between naturally existing elements and living organism was disturbed. The Earth has seen such five mass extinctions and now on the verge of sixth only because of one species, the man. There's no one in this universe to question his supremacy, but himself in the form of scientists, environmentalist et cetera. This documentary talks one of that small topic, analysing its root cause.\r\n\r\nFrom the Academy Award winning director for the documentary 'The Cove', once again, his focus came to bring the awareness about marine species that disappearing due to excessive hunting. From Japan's dolphin hunt to now the focus is on the Chinese's misbelief that causing animals like tigers, rhinos, marine animals to face the threat.\r\n\r\nIn this film, the Oceanic Preservation Society followed the source to find how and where it all begins. Since it is related to marine life - shark fin and manta ray gill trade markets were the target. That leads the crew to travel all the way to Indonesia, where a small coastal village is one of the major supplier to the Chinese consumer.\r\n\r\n> \"We have this illusion that it's the big things in the environment that count. But if you lose the small things... Everything else fails.\"\r\n\r\nFor the Chinese population density, just think what might cause if they believe in something that is not right. Since the rise of China's middle class, they can offer anything from anywhere in the world. Because of this demand the rich in biodiversity like India, Africa, Indonesia is affected due to poaching and other illegal activities. What they need is proper scientific education about their misbelief. Make the Chinese immigrants to mingle with the rest of the world, not to live and die in their own den called 'China city'.\r\n\r\nI am not a Chinese hater, but their misbelief is outrageous, especially for their population strength, it is 5 to 10 times faster than what the rest of the world's misbelief causing threat. Every nation has its own negatives, today it is China, tomorrow it will be India and then United States followed by Europe and Africa. Now it is not only up to the world leaders, but every citizen has to care, even a small contribution means a lot. The recent Paris climate conference has brought only a small halt, especially on the natural resourcing, yet other similar field has to come into force in a similar treaty.\r\n\r\nThe civilisation happened when human thought he does not fit with the natural habitat anymore for his excessive brain power and left it once for all behind other species by creating his own world alongside. Animal and plant farming is the way he discovered to cope with his hunger. But what we don't know is these farming is still occurring on the face of the earth that contributes whatever the changes the planet sees. But that does not it, overpopulation is another bigger issue. There are more consumers than farmers and farm products, thus leading us to go back to wild to hunt which is seriously causing imbalance in chemical and biological world.\r\n\r\n> \"So, this is really the last line of defense, keeping animals that are extinct in the wild in a captive situation.\"\r\n\r\nGoats, sheeps, chickens never go extinct, not under the human watch. Because since the time of human came to exist, till now, these livestock animals' count exceeds more than any other species ever lived on the Earth, including human. You breed it immoderately and kill it immoderately, it does not matter till you're not affecting the natural inhabitant.\r\n\r\nMy point is these animals need plants and if plants go extinct, the oxygen supply will be cut off leading global warming to the next mass extinction. So it needs to be balanced, which can be done by balancing daily our diet between meat and plant. When the demand automatically reduce, the restoration begins. Here the 'automatically' means in the hands of humanity.\r\n\r\nThat's what this film is trying to say. Focusing on the marine was their prime intention, but the discussion led to many other sub-topics. Unlike the director's previous film, it did not stay on one issue, but kept rotating on the various subjects by revealing the causes and the solution. At some point it lost its track, and started to advertise a fancy stuff. But that is a major way getting the attention of today's people in the digital world. Whatever you might think of me, but the truth is I was heartbroken several times while watching this film and had tears. This film is not a masterpiece, that's why it did not get an Oscars nominee except for an original song, nevertheless the voice it raised against is a true commitment.\r\n\r\nRecently I stopped to visit zoos, the place I consider is a prison for animals who have committed no crimes. But in todays world situation, looks like the captive is the final line of defence. If there is a another world, people with much more vigilant about their natural world, I would definitely like to go for it. But earth is what we all have and we're failing to take care, when it comes time to run, you will have no place to go. Just look at the recent reports of pollution in the Chinese cities, it is what I had seen in movies like 'The Mist', 'The Road', is all coming true. The apocalypse is not too far from reality. Like in this film say, it is not too late to join hands for good.\r\n\r\n10\/10","id":"57029607c3a3685688003182","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57029607c3a3685688003182","movie_id":300792}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> It is more than just raising the livestock to them.\r\n\r\nJust a week ago I saw 'F\u00fasi' which was about an overweight person with the mind of a child. And now another excellent Icelandic movie that centres on the livestock farmers. One of the best movie about the farmers I have seen. It is not all about their farms, but the love and dedication towards their work. About the art of raising animals that passed through the generations who never abandoned their ancestral village to look for a better life somewhere else. But what happens when suddenly a great threat pose to their way of life that they all only known. That's what this film talk about.\r\n\r\nThis story is about two brothers Gummi and Kiddi, who have not spoken for decades. They live next door to one another in a remote village raising sheep. When one theirs ram wins a prestigious regional contest, that lead to discover a fear of scrapie epidemic, a disease that might wipe out their local breeds. After this incident, the conflict between the brothers escalates further. So what happens after the entire village lose their business to a viral infection brings a dramatic ending to the story.\r\n\r\nThis is the advantage of watching world cinemas. You will get a chance to learn a different culture and other unfamiliar stuffs. Nowadays Hollywood is about big budget and superhero movies. Small scale films like this are very occasion, but I'm missing nothing through my love to films around the globe.\r\n\r\nI love realism films, but still this film gives a cinematic experience with the beautiful interior landscapes of Iceland. Most of the film takes place in the winter, but all the important outdoor sequences came prior to that season. Still the second half is the best part of the storytelling. After all Iceland without ice\/snow is unimaginable.\r\n\r\n> \"If we've scrapie in the valley, we're screwed.\"\r\n\r\nThe story has a small twist in the halfway mark, that you could see it coming. But the third act was so awesome, because the pace picks up and brings the unexpected ending. Yet, I was little disappointed the way it concluded. I like the details, I don't always like understandable phrase in a film's ending. Those things are effective for the movies that going have a sequel. So what I meant is the end should have been a bit more specific about what actually happens. If it is about the brothers, not the livestock, then the theme is slightly misleading with all the developments.\r\n\r\nI was tempted to rate it close to maximum, like as I said the finale took away the fractions of my 'like' towards this wonderful drama. The lead actor from the 'Virgin Mountain' can be seen in a tiny role in a couple of scenes.\r\n\r\nI've heard the ram that acted in this called Garpur was credited, but it was not like any special performance. The movie was very slow, but I like this kind of narration when a story demands its own time to bring anything it wanted to tell on its own perfect way. There are scenes with some dark humours, so it is a semi tragicomedy.\r\n\r\nThe initial parts, maybe the first act looks like an ordinary rural narration, but if you learn about the story and its character prior to your watch then you might feel comfortable with the pace. This film was sent to the recently concluded Oscars to represent Iceland, but failed to make into the ultimate round. Forget the American Academy Awards, this is still an excellent movie. I won't hesitate to suggest it to you all, it is a dull start, but you would feel worth watching it in the end.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"571cdfca92514115e200302b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/571cdfca92514115e200302b","movie_id":336222}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"cRajathandhiram begins with the sale of a bike. Two prospective buyers approach the guy who wants to sell the bike. The mechanic whom one of them has brought also jumps into the fray when he hears the price. Soon, one man pays for it and takes it home. But when he comes out to show it to his family members, the bike is gone. And, then, we see that the other three players we saw in the previous scene are all friends. They are con artists and they have successfully staged a con. In the voice over, Arjun, the mastermind behind the plot tells us that they are not cheating anyone but exploiting the greed of others to make some money. We immediately think of Sathuranka Vettai, whose hero, too, operated on this same principle. In a few minutes, we get a scene involving a MLM meeting and our fears of a retread only increase. \r\n\r\nBut then, Rajathandhiram reveals itself to be a totally different film. Arjun and his friends Deva and Kullan are approached by Madhavan Iyer, their go-to-guy, who wants them to rob the jewellery shop of Azhagappan, a big shot jeweler in the city, for his friend Dharma. They initially back out, and Arjun even goes to Azhagappan and informs him of the plan, but give in when they learn the real motive behind Dharma's request. And thus begins an exciting game of double and triple crossing that keeps us on the edge of our seat till the end. \r\n\r\nMaking a heist film is as tricky as pulling a heist for everything depends on timing. With Rajathandhiram, AG Amid has managed to perform the trick very convincingly \u2014 the filmmaking is quite nimble and confident that it is hard to believe that this is the work of a debutant director. This is most evident during a pre-interval con scene that takes place in a hotel. The protagonists are forced to stay on their toes and steal a bag and in fact, even the actual heist fails to come close to this one's nerve-wracking tension. \r\n\r\nAmid takes his time to introduce the various players, their motives and their relationships. Then, he clearly lays out the heist plan and expertly spins a web of deceit and cunning. He also manages to introduce a romantic angle to this tale that not only feels out of place but also becomes one of the reasons for the heist to take place. \r\n\r\nThe false notes occur in the closing portions when Arjun begins to grow a conscience and the film does lose a bit of edge. A hero doesn't always have to be lawful and as long as what he does is morally right, he will always endear himself to the audience. There is a reason why Danny Ocean doesn't give up his ways; he will turn into a character that is less fun. Even the detailed account of why Dharma wants to stage the heist isn't needed. He wants to take revenge on Azhagappan is all that we need to get emotionally involved in the heist, and the flashback makes it seem overtly sentimental, especially in a film this cool. Also, the manner in which Azhagappan's son-in-law behaves after he comes to know of the truth is less convincing. \r\n\r\nBut these are just niggles, for there is so much to admire in the rest of the movie, from SR Kathir's fluid cinematography to Praveen Antony's dexterous editing and Sandeep Chowta's understated score. The actors, too, are apt. Veera strikes the right tone as a smooth operator and Darbuka Siva's timely zingers are a hoot. And, it is always a good thing when we get a heroine who can emote and can speak Tamil without making it seem like miming. We wonder why Regina doesn't get more opportunities here. Even smaller characters are quirky and convincing \u2014 like the laidback inspector, who keeps reining in his anxious subordinate while dealing with the heist. But it is Pattiyal Sekar, who is the surprise package. As Azhagappan, he is very effective in conveying quiet menace. We are just into the third month of the year but rest assured, Rajathandhiram will certainly find a place among the best films of the year.","id":"551063a79251416bd10031eb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/551063a79251416bd10031eb","movie_id":330399}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Coldness and bleak does not just describe the weather conditions in rural Iceland where writer-director Grimur Hakonarson\u2019s slice-of-life farming drama Rams (a.k.a. \u201cHrutar\u201d) takes place. It can also apply to the distant brotherly relationship of the film\u2019s two main protagonists and their lingering four decade-old estrangement. Surprisingly, it would take the critical conditioning of the obstinate siblings\u2019 ailing livestock to bring them together in realizing the foundation of loss and emotional indifference. Thus, Rams secures its impacting quirkiness as an Icelandic fable about the reluctance of familial closeness and the self-interest of brooding brothers to begrudgingly come together and demonstrate care and commitment to the woolly wonders that unassumingly bind them at the hip in a time of business-oriented crisis.\r\n\r\nThe premise finds brothers Gummi (Sigurdur Sigurjonsson) and older Kiddi (Theodor Juliusson) living side-by-side on their farming properties. They both take pride in dutifully breeding their sheep. In fact, Gummi and Kiddi routinely enter their sheep in the village\u2019s \u201cbest ram\u201d contest annually to find out who is superior in this regard. There is no question about the siblings\u2019 competitive spirit when it come to showcasing their impressive ram for decorative display. The problem, however, is that Gummi and Kiddi have not spoken to one another for forty years despite their close proximity to one another and the mutual professional that they both share in sheep herding contests.\r\n\r\nBoth Gummi and Kiddi are renowned for their excellence in producing top-notch sheep as their prize-winning rams are among the country\u2019s best specimens imaginable. Importantly, the sheep represents more to the eye than just winning products of each isolated man\u2019s benchmark livestock. In many ways the rams are their loyal companions and looked upon as filling a void for an otherwise lonely and alienating existence. Neither Gummi nor Kiddi has married or bore any offspring so the only thing of value that they have to show for is their farming identities and award-winning status at major community ram functions for sole bragging rights.\r\nUnfortunately, tragedy will strike the brothers both personally and professionally as a lethal disease infects Kiddi\u2019s flock. The news of the crippling virus forces the authorities to declare that all sheep must be destroyed before the epidemic spreads further. \r\n\r\nNaturally, the news is devastating to Kiddi and Gummi as parting ways with their beloved beasts strikes a deeply saddened chord. What else can substitute for the brothers\u2019 daily obligations of nurturing their four-legged \u201cfamily members\u201d once the sheep are gone? In short, this only escalates the loneliness of each brother\u2019s dire predicament. Now what?\r\n\r\nThe decision to eradicate the infested sheep in the territory not only has disillusioned Gummi and Kiddi but has pushed the panic button for all the farmers in the vicinity. Remember, the jeopardized rams are the reliable source of major income for these destitute farmers so the concern about survival and problematic profiting is a considerable worry to say the least. Sadly, these frustrated farmers have no choice but to abandon their precious lands in hope of rebounding elsewhere in the aftermath of this disastrous dilemma. Nevertheless, the brotherly duo become defiant  doing what they must to preserve their vulnerable sheep as well as hold onto their exposed properties. The challenge of trying to hide whatever techniques they are applying to save the sickly rams from the intrusive authorities is daunting but extremely necessary in their hasty minds. The time to break the silence for Gummi and Kiddi is NOW as they must reconcile the existing indifference to rescue the constant element that has made their lives purposeful\u2013the symbolic affection for the sheep that has always plugged out their disconnection towards one another.\r\n\r\nHakonarson steadily builds the psychological tension in Rams and allows the audience to appreciate the emotional bridge that both Gummi and Kiddi have to cross in order to maintain their sense of self-worth and fragile stability. There are many things on the line here in this gentle revealing narrative beyond an outbreak of treasured livestock. Actually, it is the threatening outbreak that shines the cautionary light on the possible extinction of everything near and dear to a couple of old stubborn men set in their immobile ways. Sure, familial ties can be severely broken but on the other hand they can be restored because the concept of family should be solid regardless of the systematic cause for resentment and mental detachment.\r\n\r\nThe actors are effectively believable as Sigurjonsson\u2019s Gummi and Juliusson\u2019s Kiddi aptly portray scruffy aging brothers saddled with deep-seeded malaise as the only passion they can muster up is their common obsession for catered love and devotion to their trusty creatures\u2013something so foreign and fatalistic to them as blood relatives. Rams is quite moving although the featured angst of broken-heart brothers is not exactly what one would call meaty fodder for the soul. Still, Rams is convincing and relatable for those having difficulty in mending the fence for the genuine soul whose companionship and consideration you need the most at an uncertain time of quiet despair.\r\n\r\n**Rams (2016)**\r\n\r\nCohen Media Group\r\n\r\n1 hr. 32 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Charlotte B\u00f8ving, Sigur\u00f0ur Sigurj\u00f3nsson, Theod\u00f3r J\u00fal\u00edusson\r\n\r\nDirected by: Gr\u00edmur H\u00e1konarson\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Drama\/Foreign\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: ** 1\/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng (2016)\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R","id":"56c82a8f925141173c001e6a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56c82a8f925141173c001e6a","movie_id":336222}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**About an aspiring DJ and his friends circle.**\r\n\r\nI've never seen any actor worse than Zac, yet he keeps making films. That's not it, so far he had failed to take the right project to work with. His films are either having no story or a silly concept and his roles among the worst. I could have liked this film if it was done by some other young actor. It looked a decent storyline on how an aspiring DJ is fighting to make progress. Living with his friends, then suddenly an opportunity knocks and followed by some issues surround it that should be solved to see the success in his passion in the music. So the remaining is to reveal how the things go on for him.\r\n\r\nToo slow narration, and it is being a music genre, a little soulless. Yeah, there's no rhythm. All we have seen a DJ while performing, but what his life would be like is what this film was focused on. Directional debute for a documentary filmmaker and he should make a couple of things right for his next film, including casting right actors and preparing an engaging screenplay. Some people might like the film, but not for me. This is completely an ignorable film.\r\n\r\n_4\/10_","id":"5935ce0992514104e600337d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5935ce0992514104e600337d","movie_id":301351}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Separated, but joined hands for their child.\r\n\r\nMy latest German film about a family with the dark secret. A film that's not so popular, looks like not even in the Germany. But I chose it for the title alone. Followed by reading its synopsis I couldn't just turn away. It is definitely the German version of the Japanese flick 'Suspect X'. That does not mean it is a remake, but based on the similar theme that revolves on an entirely different platform. If you like that film, you should check this out, but it is simple and very interesting tale, not as intelligent as that one and never tried to be one.\r\n\r\nThe film was about a divorced couple with one teen daughter shared custody. It might be a separation by a mutual understanding, but for their daughter, Sarah, it is a pain to watch them apart. One day during a camping she accidentally commits a crime. When her parents learn about it, they join hands and decide to hide it, thinking it might spoil her future. But Sarah uses this opportunity to bring them back together. On the other side, one lie to another and many more, how long they can carry on is revealed in the remaining film.\r\n\r\nThere's no surprise for parents trying to save their child from the legal battle. Anybody would do the same thing in most of the circumstance after examining what actually went wrong. It reminded me 'Papanasam', a similar kind of film, but this narration targets only on the one side. The pursue from the other side was less than ten per cent. So it creates a mystery atmosphere about everything you saw might have another angle to give a different opinion on the situation of the film characters. That's how the focus remained on the family with their every move making them hard to stay strong and face the future troubles.\r\n\r\n> \"What if everybody knows about it? School, facebook, family, friends, everyone.\"\r\n\r\nThe suspense remains among the characters, but most of the viewers would know exactly what's going on. The writers did not try to hide anything to save a twist for the end part, they wanted to tell a simple crime-drama involving a family as much possible decently and they did it. People might think they are clever for figuring it out everything earlier or the writing was so weak, but that's a mere diversion for what happens in the final quarter. I think the film ended strongly than its earlier part. While watching it you might think it is an okay film, but once you watched it, it could change your overall impression.\r\n\r\nIn the old days people hiding crime to escape the punishment, and of course for what family, friends, neighbours think about them. But now the latest addition is the facebook. Going viral on the social media has much impact for ones future than the law punishing them. This where our future is heading. Tracking a criminal through the internet is easier than the outside world. Anyway, this film did not go for those materials, but used it as one of the reasons for making a crucial decision.\r\n\r\nOverall, it is almost a good film, an above average. But in the end, what and how much we expect from it is directly involved with for the final result. So I'm saying if you go for it with an open mind, you could enjoy it better. This story is not something you see regularly, at a time not the best film of the year, yet worth a try. I would have said it should have been better in a few parts, but that changes nothing because of the theme and I totally appreciate the filmmakers for making a decent film than anything worse. So I think you understood me that I'm indirectly recommending it.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"57951f7f9251412c1f0014a7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57951f7f9251412c1f0014a7","movie_id":319211}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A pretty decent horror flick if not a masterpiece.\r\n\r\nNot a horror film of the year yet it narrates a quite interesting story in a simple manner. The title itself reveals everything about it. It revolves around a couple who had lost their only child in a car crash. When they move into a country house, they won't relaise it is haunted until it was too late. Obviously the reason behind the house is occupied by the dark forces was disclosed, but like any horror film it had waited until the third act to do so.\r\n\r\nThis story actually sets in the 70s. The clothes, hairstyles, language, cars, and the buildings, they all take us to the 40 years back, but the screenplay was a disappointment. Like I said it was not trying to be a very clever, but filled with predictable stuffs. Anybody could guess any scenes in the movie and he usually won't be wrong. That's the this film's negativity, other than that it was an okay type.\r\n\r\nNot fully impressed by the performances, it was decent though. But the characters were good and shot in a fine location and its surrounds. For a small budget with the unfamiliar faces and an unheard director, it was not that bad, especially the length of the film was too short to feel boring.\r\n\r\nThis kind of films are not worth recommending, but keeping in my that horror films are usually gets a low rating, even 50-50 rated films too can be considered as a watchable. So all I', saying is that just be careful while deciding on this.\r\n\r\n5\/10","id":"576025149251415e27002a91","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/576025149251415e27002a91","movie_id":291272}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"In his previous film Goli Soda, Vijay Milton demonstrated that he can make a familiar masala tale feel fresh with his treatment. 10 Endrathukulla, too, is a masala movie, but strangely, this film lacks the liveliness and inventiveness that made Goli Soda stand out. Rather the focus seems to have shifted from script to scale \u2014 smart writing is traded in for exotic locales, larger-than-life characters, over-the-top action choreography and overall blandness. \r\n\r\nThe first half of the film draws heavily on the plot of The Transporter. Here, we have Vikram (his name or rather the lack of one \u2014 he calls himself James Bond, Mani Ratnam, Bill Gates \u2014 is meant to be a running joke though we soon realize it as a pointless one), as a skilled car driver who works at a driving school, but takes on no-questions-asked mercenary work for money. Dass, a local gangster, comes into his life, and offers him one assignment \u2014 to deliver a package to Uttarkhand in three days. He agrees, but en route, he discovers that he has company in the form of his driving school student, Shakila. As expected, romance blooms between the two during the journey, but in the second half, Vikram comes to know that Shakila is the 'package', and learns why she is important to the people who have kidnapped her (which is linked to a serious caste-based massacre that opens the film). He decides to save her from the terrible fate that awaits her but time is fast running out. \r\n\r\nYou can see why an actor like Vikram would have chosen this script. After the physically demanding I, this lightweight role would have come across as a welcome change of pace, and the actor does his best. Samantha would have seen it as an opportunity to stretch herself a bit in terms of range, instead of playing just another pretty girl who behaves like a nutcase (though she does get to play that as well for most parts of the film). But with a plot that is slight and even vague till the final act, they can do only so much, and they only end up with another Rajapattai and Anjaan on their resumes. The director takes time to set up things and even when the plot kicks in, there are speed bumps in the forms of songs (Charmmee appears in one and does a strip tease of sorts), comedy (the efforts of Shakila to get a license, which include a mandatory scene involving Mano Bala) and action sequences that are hardly thrilling. The multiple villains do not help. Pasupathy gets a few scenes initially and then is turned into a comical villain. Abhimanyu Singh is introduced with so much build-up and is given quite a bit of screen time only to be dismissed later as just a hireling making all his scenes seem redundant. Rahul Dev looks like the main villain but then we realize he isn't. As for the romance, the most noteworthy scene (for all the wrong reasons) is one where Vikram accidentally touches Samantha's breast (while looking for a key in her pocket) and the soundtrack nudges us to this fact with the sound of a horn. And her character doesn't even care! \r\n\r\nTo his credit, Milton does give us a second half that is relatively engaging. We even get a twist \u2014 involving look-alikes \u2014 that is far-fetched but at least peps up things a little. And the striking scenery gives us something to feast our eyes on. But these are minor satisfactions that we derive mainly to lessen the feeling of disappointment that envelopes us as we watch the film. Milton's hero might finish things off before you finish counting 10, but his film that refuses to take off even after we have finished counting 100.","id":"563029da9251414ab700ca94","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/563029da9251414ab700ca94","movie_id":330414}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The woman who knew every inch of the middle-east!\r\n\r\nIt is a kind of female version of 'Lawrence of Arabia', the lead actress herself told that. A biographical drama of a British woman who had played an important role in many middle-eastern affairs during the early 1900s. After the tragic death of the man she was madly in love, the young Gertrude Bell decides to travel across the middle-east to write about it and to do some archaeological research and other stuffs. After the decades of travel on all the corners of the region, what she achieved was the film disclosed in an inspiring way.\r\n\r\nI love this director's films and filmmaking style. It is his first time since last 6 years, but not good as I expected. It is a bit of both, documentary and feature film. Awesomely shot, I loved the camera work and actors too did so well. Nicole Kidman was brilliant, might be her best for portraying in a real life character. Yet something was missing from the film. Maybe the film came at the wrong time, should have been made at least 15 years ago. Otherwise, it is an Oscar worthy product.\r\n\r\nThis film is worth watching for the beautiful desert landscapes and obviously for Kidman. The issue with the story is the focus which completely relied on Kidman's role. She was everywhere and leaving blank on the other end. Something like showing what she accomplished was the notion, so in perspective, it could have made a better documentary film. Some people might like it, especially if you're from the middle-east. But don't expect I would recommend it, because I won't. Whatever I said the film was not bad, just a 50-50 kind.\r\n\r\n5\/10","id":"57c8b06992514148e300095d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c8b06992514148e300095d","movie_id":157843}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> No entertainment, just a character study.\r\n\r\nFilms are made for many purposes and I don't know what this one is about. They say it is a psychological-thriller, but yes, there is some psychology in it, but definitely no thriller, just a boring drama which means a character study material. The entire film was shot in a lake house and occasionally its surrounding area. There is no story in it, just the characters and they're being themselves that narrated in the days basis for a week, but those days were from the random years without a clear picture of what date, month or the year.\r\n\r\nThere is lots of close up shots like it pushes you back from your seat suppose if you are leaning towards the front. The cinematography was what I felt uncomfortable, but overall not bad. I think the actors were good, both Katherine Waterston and Elisabeth Moss, just for this film because I've seen them in the better roles.\r\n\r\nLow budget and limited cast film, as well as short but not sweet as I anticipated. So I don't think everybody would enjoy it, I don't know who is the target audience, but I'm sure it will reach them who are going to defend it from people like me. Those who are not seen it, but want to, I only advise them to be careful while choosing it.\r\n\r\n3\/10","id":"57c8afe9c3a3685bf10008b6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c8afe9c3a3685bf10008b6","movie_id":300542}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Some secrets need to be left untouched for good.\r\n\r\nThis little British romance-drama was not expected by everyone. Without Charlotte Rampling's Oscars nominee for the lead role, it would have been an easily forgotten. Because it is very slow, the story is just okay, but the performances are the saviour IMO. At this age, Charlotte Rampling was looking so good on the screen, her youthful costume was maybe the reason.\r\n\r\nThe story of a long married couple, the whole movie takes place on the eve of their 45th anniversary celebration. A week to go for their big day, the wife discovers some hidden secret by her hubby. While digging it only gets bigger, but how it would affect their present relationship was told quite interestingly. It was only a single perspective tale, so the detail on the other side are not briefed to us that well. But everything was quite understandable.\r\n\r\nIn some relationship, some secret needs to be left untouched for good, only if it is not hurting anybody. Life is a long journey if you're an old and to look back your path. What happened a long time ago is not to be judged for the in between timeline events. In someone's perspective, some past incidents are fair. The beauty of this drama is simply lies how smoothly narrated this complicated issue between a husband and wife. Because even if you're not a regular movie goer, still you can name a couple of similar titles, but how unique this was when comparing with those is that's where it betters. It was not so good, but much better in many ways, in its own way.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"56d9a3809251412e2800510c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56d9a3809251412e2800510c","movie_id":311291}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Facing what you had left behind to chase your dream.\r\n\r\nThis is so underrated. I mean it is not a great film, but surely does not deserve bashing. One of the rarest appearance on the screen for Meryl Streep. Totally transformed into a rock star and coming together with her real life daughter was another highlight. Impressive performances by others too. The Music was good with a combination of bit emotions and comedy.\r\n\r\nIt was the story of an aging rock star who failed to reach the heights. She once gave up on her family over the passion of music and now she returns after receiving a call that her daughter is in a trouble. So the tale focus on her struggling life, as well as because of her past she won't get a warm welcome. It's time to fix everything and as the years pass what changes brings is the remaining narration.\r\n\r\nThis is life. People are motivated to chase their dreams no matter whatever stands between them. This was a similar theme where a woman goes after what she wanted to be, but her family comes in between. And you know the success is not for everyone, so in that situation, how a person reacts to all the miscalculations in her life is what this film is about. It was actually a well told story, but the critics did not like it and given some lame excuses. To me it was a decent film, definitely not the worst, so all I'm saying is you should try it if you like music.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"577aa9cac3a368770a00207e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/577aa9cac3a368770a00207e","movie_id":275601}
{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"Ted 2 packs more unhumorous stuffing within its formulaic synthetic fur. MacFarlane is a talented comedian, I\u2019m sure of it. His profusely crude humour captivating millions with his legendary \u2018Family Guy\u2019 TV show. Even \u2018Ted\u2019 was tolerable to a certain degree, and that\u2019s saying something. Yet here we are, with an inevitable sequel, that essentially felt like a glorified episode of the aforementioned animation. It\u2019s cutaway structure for unrelated gags. Relentless wave of pointless cameos. Ted becoming Peter Griffin. Close your eyes, let the voices infiltrate your senses and you\u2019ll soon realise it\u2019s just \u2018Family Guy\u2019, just less funny. Ted now married and struggling to maintain his relationship, has his rights taken away when he is no longer viewed as person but property instead.\r\n\r\nA particularly strong aspect to this comedy that more or less is the power source of its story, raising a civil rights lesson in ethics and morality. It was so *interesting* that Morgan Freeman himself got involved and slam dunked the jury with his God-like soothing voice. And despite Seyfried actually picking up the script\u2019s remnants and transforming the scraps into a functional film, it\u2019s utterly forgettable. So much so, that once Wahlberg becomes drowned in rejected semen samples (literally swimming with the sperm...), I experienced a moment of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu (ironically, so did Ted). Surprisingly, I had seen the first half before. Yet it took me a decent forty minutes to encounter this epiphany, that\u2019s how unmemorable this comedy truly is.\r\n\r\nIt exercises all of the same plot points from its predecessor, the inclusion of the mentally unhinged Donny and the friendly break-up between the leads cement this sentiment, and rarely explored new avenues. Sure the friendly chemistry remained intact, but only one or two lines made me frustratingly chuckle, mostly due to Warburton\u2019s comedic execution (urgh, that voice...). Besides that, there\u2019s nothing here. Same old MacFarlane profanity. Worth a squeeze if you enjoyed the first film, but exhausts its preset lines of dialogue extremely rapidly. \u201cI love you\u201d? Eh, please don\u2019t.","id":"5e21db218f26bc0011745920","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e21db218f26bc0011745920","movie_id":214756}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**An alien themed drama during the cusp of the WWIII.**\r\n\r\nWhat would you expect from a B movie, but it looks like a mainstream film for the Australians. Yep, it is an Aussie sci-fi-drama, but sets in the United States. The world is at war, so people everywhere struggling with their jobs. But in a small town, a mysterious object from the sky falls and soon it was claimed by a single father after he was healed by its touch when he met a car crash near the site. The government people too after it, but how these two groups confront each other while the country is falling was told with a small twist at the end.\r\n\r\nThe poster looks like 'Intersteller' or 'Tron', but the film was different. Kind of a simple version of 'Evolution' and a mix of others as well. I felt it was well written, but not convincingly made. Keeping a simple story, revolving around a mysterious object, it had the strength to come out strong, but doesn't wanted to be the high octane action film and the budget was the issue. So in its limited cost, it impacted managed to become a decent film, but I think the direction should have been a bit cautious. There were lots of sci- fi-dramas succeeded because of the good directions.\r\n\r\nI call it a wasted opportunity, but if you keep your anticipation low knowing unfamiliar cast and crew, then it might satisfy you a little. Totally an Australian cast, but in the American accent. Decent performances, and technically it looked okay, since it did not require heavy graphics.

Out of what is clearly a massive homage to _Judgement Day_, _Genisys_ gives away the entire plot and central \u201ctwist\u201d in its promotional material months before its release, just like _Judgement Day_ did!\r\n\r\nAll levity aside, _Terminator: Genisys_ is not great. They took some risks with their casting and it didn\u2019t explode in their face which is nice, a lot of the effects were ver visually impressive, and it was fun to see the weapons of the future be purple lasers again, but these aren\u2019t things that make a good movie by themselves.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> The return wasn't as exciting as the previous one.\r\n\r\nNo surprise why this film failed to excite me, but a few people thinks its a passable sequel. The original movie was atypical, so the success followed it. In my perspective better that should have left as a one-off movie. But as a low budget product, they knew it was going grab back twice, thrice they spent because of the star value and indeed the first film's influence.\r\n\r\nThere is no story, simply based on the usual Hollywood road adventure like the flicks 'Fanboys', 'Dumb and Dumber To', 'Not Suitable for Children' et cetera, except the character Ted which makes this theme a special. A couple of good jokes and that's it, the rest were ineffective, sometime keep repeating the same ones. The 2 hours in a too plain concept, is way too long to sit and watch\/focus.\r\n\r\nThe cameos were weak, or maybe worthless\/meaningless, especially Liam Neeson's. The best things were the production quality, acting and like I mentioned before, the character Ted. For the one time watch, I think kind of manageable, but definitely not suitable for repeat viewing or to recommend it to the others. But overall, a little disappointed with the outcome. They have got one more chance to end this franchise on a high note as a decent trilogy if the next film gets a better storyline.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"567c2f54c3a3684bc9004101","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/567c2f54c3a3684bc9004101","movie_id":214756}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Neeson is good at it, none other would've played better than him.\r\n\r\nPretty entertaining action flick with a fast paced narration. A typical Liam Neeson's movie. Take a gun and go hunt down the bad guys or protect loved ones from them kind of movie. Under his league, like always he was awesome. This has been a already heard story, like a trivia say. Yes, it was similar to 'Road to Perdition', but happens for a different reason and with the different cast. Still the movie was better that I expected.\r\n\r\nI went speechless when I saw Neeson was begging in the opening scene. Because that's not his style, action heroes like him, Jason Statham, Bruce Willis et cetera, they don't fit in those roles. But what came just a few minutes later was like switching to second, third, fourth and fifth gear in a quick session. You know you can't judge a book by its cover, same applies for this as well. The film was good, I mean better than average, better than ratings and reviews across the web.\r\n\r\nIt was kind of unofficial 'A Man with a Gun' trilogy (I made it up) after 'Unknown' and 'Non-stop'. Because if you check it out all these three film's posters, Neeson will be seen with a gun in the similar fashion. Hope this director and actor comes together to do more movies in the future, since it is a rocking combo. Well, they all might not be the masterpieces, but enjoyable at the time of the watch. Especially it will not disappoint Neeson's fans.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"55e74851c3a368377e000638","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55e74851c3a368377e000638","movie_id":241554}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> There comes a time for everything in life.\r\n\r\nBy seeing the poster you will get a close idea of what this film is about. Still the movie delivers with a decent storyline. The title is a metaphor of what the movie is illustrating. There's nothing to inspire from it, its just based on the facts that was rendered very realistically. Like how the overweight people are seen by their co-workers and how they are treated in society for being different in character.\r\n\r\nThis is a very good movie about a 43 year old man named F\u00fasi, who still lives with his mother. As by himself the life is so wonderful for having a decent job and a faithful friend. But reminding himself for living in the world where people have a different thought for a guy like him is what he has to worry about. That bars him from socialising and makes him a weird person. But looks like he does not care much about it or those who bully him. A guy with a good heart, but not spotted by others.\r\n\r\nThere comes a time for everything. Two girls enter his life. A little neighbour girl Hera, who instantly become his playmate and Sj\u00f6fn, a woman of his own age with a mental issue. This so exciting part of the movie, like there's always someone waiting for everyone in the world to unite with. He has to choose between being a child like Hera or to grow up and move on in life with Sj\u00f6fn. After an incident he learns what's the best, but faces complications. That's where the remaining film turns its focus, but how the tale ends is not what something we would want to see.\r\n\r\n> \"You are becoming a real chef. I guess she does not cook much.\"\r\n\r\nThese days the filmmakers try as much as they can to avoid the cliche, especially in the conclusion section. That's what I disliked in this, but still appreciate the original ending. Humanity had seen and still facing racism, issues related to gender equality, religious and LGBT discrimination, and many more. Along with all this, what this movie narrated is a very common matter to worry about from every culture and society. Like I said, it is not trying to educate us, but you can't ignore the seriousness of the film contents.\r\n\r\nThe scenes often filled with light humours. A little love story and a little play story, but overall about the life and its difficulties. This film is a glimpse of what it would be like being a different from others either by characteristically and\/or by appearance. The film characters show their emotions, but sentimentally not appealing as it should have been. Usually that is what we all expect in a theme like this. I think for a narration like this that would have been so depressing. So it is not a tearjerker movie after all.\r\n\r\nIt was like 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' meets 'Terri'. A sensitive matter, a big concept in a small movie. A well written screenplay and beautifully performed, especially by the lead guy. Any professional actors would have played the role easily, but not as perfect as him. I don't remember of seeing any Icelandic movie in a long time, but I'm very pleased with this one. I would surely suggest it, before that, you should remember it is not a genuinely entertaining or a sincerely motivating film, but lies between them, that is kind of both I say.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"570fc754c3a36831e1000658","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/570fc754c3a36831e1000658","movie_id":320736}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The dark side of the Indian police force.\r\n\r\nAnother sensational movie from Dhanush K. Raja, the producer of 'The Crow's Egg' that I recently reviewed in this site. This time he joined the hands with the writer, director who bought him a best actor award at the Indian Academy Award for the movie 'Playground'. The film was based on the novel 'Lock Up' that loosely inspired by the experiences of the author who is an autorickshaw driver now.\r\n\r\nI already mentioned that Indian cinema is waking up, knocking the doors of the international film critics, films festivals and film buffs. Thanks to the young generation in the film industry, looking for the international market expansion. It's time for you to check it out some of the Indian parallel cinemas, not the masala films. If you think you're totally in an unfamiliar territory, then it will be good to you start with this one.\r\n\r\nIndia is like the European Union, where each nation speaks a different language and its own culture, likewise each Indian state has a different language and culture. That's why it might be called the Indian subcontinent. This story begins when three Tamil labourers who are illegally living in a city park to save rent money from the work in the neighbor state Andhra, will be taken to the police custody without letting know them the reason. The rest of the film exposes the law enforcement agency's brutality on these young innocent men to force to accept a crime that is not committed by them which is a violation of human rights.\r\n\r\n> \"The influence is more important than skill when it comes to promotions.\"\r\n\r\nThe film has two phases and they were not focused on any particular characters. It is a couple of different events based flick that connected to each other by the characters. But everything is about corruption in the police force and common people who affected by that. Kind of unpredictable scenes with the decent twists. The first half takes place in Andhra Pradesh with the backdrop of some robbery case and then in the next half it moves to Tamil Nadu with once again a cop tale, but different scenario.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Indian police's torture chamber. The dark side of the Indian police force. Not all about the bad cops, but also involves those honest ones caught between dishonest ones from the higher power. There was a small romance plot in the opening, later it vanished when entire story focus shifted to police interrogation. The pace had many up and down, that helped to turn things around like transforming from one state of condition to another.\r\n\r\nThis theme was exactly opposite to the old saying 'lightning never strikes the same place twice'. You can call it a bad luck, but for some people like the youngsters from this movie who came from the poor families from the rural without proper education, it is a matter of life and death and injustice. I won't be surprised if international remake are made. It won this year's Indian Academy Awards in the three categories including the supporting actor which was one of the important cop roles.\r\n\r\nThis is a Kollywood film, but watching it feels like a some dark tone Korean crime-drama-thriller. I have seen some of Indian cop films, but so far this one was the best when it comes to the realism yet not depicted them in a good way. I highly recommend it, but don't expect a genuine screenplay with a grand twist. It makes you feel how the innocence was taken away from the poor by the people with power, really heartbreaking.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"571cdf2a92514135ff0049c7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/571cdf2a92514135ff0049c7","movie_id":372226}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Visaaranai is an uncompromising, hard-hitting and spine-chilling account of abuse of power. When the film begins, we see Pandi (an effective Dinesh), a migrant in Andhra Pradesh, leaving the park where he and his friends have been spending the nights (it is their way of saving the money that they might have to spend on a residence) in the wee hours of the morning and rushing to open the provisional store where he works. It is still not dawn yet but the store's owner is slightly miffed that Pandi is late. A group of men come to the shop asking for an address, but Pandi makes them out as cops from Tamil Nadu and tries to distance himself from whatever their agenda is. The group moves on and moments later, a man comes and asks him if his name is Pandi. The instant he replies yes, the man catches Pandi by the scruff of his neck and forces him into a waiting vehicle, where his friends are helplessly sitting and signalling him not to do anything silly because the men in the vehicle are cops. They are taken to the police station where, all of a sudden, the cops start beating them without bothering to ask them anything. \r\n\r\nAll this happens in the first ten minutes of the film and we are as clueless as the group of friends as to why they are being treated this way. Pandi thinks they are in trouble because he had, during the previous night, in a foolhardy manner shouted out in public to the girl whom he is in love with (Anandhi in a cameo) \u2014 a domestic help in the house of a cop \u2014 that he will help her get away from her employer. But then they stumble upon another friend, who tells that he was returning to their place in the night after watching a movie when he was caught by the cops, who mercilessly beat him and asked him to confess to stealing from a house. It is only then that they realise that they have gotten into a sticky situation. The beatings and torture continue, but a resolute Pandi forces them to not accept the charge as they had committed no wrong. But the cops, who are under pressure as the robbery happened at the house of a relative of a higher official, are eager to \"close the case\" \u2014 because closing a case is easier and convenient than actually solving it \u2014 by making Pandi and his friends accept to the crime. And the unfortunate group, which gets a ray of hope when they manage to get out of their situation \u2014 thanks to Muthuvel (Samuthirakani, solid as ever) the Tamil Nadu cop whom Pandi had encountered in his shop, who uses them to nab KK (Kishore), a white collar criminal with political connections \u2014 but only end up entrapped in a far more sinister situation from where there is no escape.\r\n\r\nBased on M Chandrakumar's novel Lock Up, Visaaranai unfolds as two neatly divided halves, and as we saw in Vetri Maaran's Polladhavan and Aadukalam, there is a substitution of antagonists in the second half. In fact, for while in the second half, we feel as if we have moved into a different film when the sub-plot involving KK unfolds. Our protagonist almost fade into the background, popping up now and then to remind us their ordeal might still not be completely over. KK is perhaps the most poignant character in a film that is filled with tragic characters and Kishore, who plays this character with such understatement that he makes us care for him even when we know that he is going to get our protagonists into deeper trouble. He knows the game he is playing and is very well aware they both he and Muthuvel are mere pawns in the game, a fact that he points out to the other as well. And yet, when he realises that he has been condemned by his own 'friends', he still finds that shocking. And it is a shock for us as well, as until then, this character seems to exist mainly to show us the contrast in which the underprivileged are treated compared to those who are rich and close to the powerful.\r\n\r\nWhat is scary is the randomness with which Pandi and his friends get into situations that threaten their very existence and it sends a chill down our spine. Just like how they ended up at the mercy of cops in AP, who caught them out of the blue, they become victims in a game played by individuals who have been exploiting the system for their personal gains in an all-too sudden manner.\r\n\r\nThe first half could easily have become the sort of tragedy that we see in Bala's films. We have underprivileged protagonists who have to endure torture at the hands of a caricaturish villain (Ajay Ghosh, who plays the ruthless inspector with glee). Characters get beaten to within an inch of their life. There is even some black humour (the cop offering prasadam to Pandi and his friends before beating the hell out of them). But there is also restraint in the filmmaking (another filmmaker would have shown us a scene of Pandi's girlfriend being sexually abused by her employer, but here, this information is delivered to us with the same force through a single effective line, even GV Prakash's score is largely discreet) and a context to the actions. We see how those in power can threaten those below them when Pandi's employer pleads with him to accept to the crime as he has been warned that he, too, might get into trouble.\r\n\r\nBut it is the terrific second half, which could easily have merely stopped with being an edge-of-the-seat thriller, that gives the film its moral weight. Vetri Maaran forces us to analyse the actions of the characters, question the unfairness of it all and feel angry with the way the system works. His cops are the exact opposite of the cops we find in the films of Gautham Menon \u2014 self-preserving individuals who have been hardened by the system and have realised that the only way to survive is to play the system to their advantage. Like the low-ranking cop (a superb E Ramadas), who breaks into a mini lecture about the value of human life only to suggest how they could get out of a potential mess by murdering a few lives. We see these men stage a suicide and shootings in cold-blooded fashion and with hardly any guilty that we instantly realise the fate that is in store for a 'decent' cop like Muthuvel, who wants to maintain his integrity in a world where there is no place for that trait. When the screen fades to black in the end, we feel as if it is we who have been shot at point-blank range and that is Vetri Maaran's success.","id":"56b9caa5c3a3681e5d002186","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56b9caa5c3a3681e5d002186","movie_id":372226}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Big city sci-fi thriller with Bruce Willis and Thomas Jane about artificial humans***\r\n\r\nIn the near future, a big city resort called Vice utilizes artificial humans wherein clients can fulfill their debased fantasies, including rape, robbery and murder. An artificial female (Ambyr Childers) escapes and seeks sanctuary at a city church. Bruce Willis plays the entrepreneur of the resort, Thomas Jane a disheveled cop who wants to put him out of business and Bryan Greenberg the man who resides in the church, but he ain\u2019t no pastor. \r\n\r\n\"Vice\" (2015) mixes the concept of \u201cWestworld\u201d (1973) and \u201cFutureworld\u201d (1976) with elements of \u201cBlade Runner\u201d (1982), \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d (1993), \u201cUniversal Soldier\u201d (1992) and \u201cThe Island\u201d (2005). While it only cost $10 million and you can\u2019t expect blockbuster production values, it\u2019s more polished than the average SyFy flick, which usually only cost $3 million or less.\r\n\r\nPractically the entire movie takes place at nighttime in the big city and I like the reverent tone. Jane is great as the city cop and Willis is his reliable self in a role he could do in his sleep.  Childers comes across as a low rent meshing of Malin Akerman and Alicia Silverstone, but in her mid-20s. She\u2019s a\u2019right, but it would\u2019ve been better with someone of the caliber of Scarlett Johannson or Silverstone when she was younger.\r\n\r\nWhat turned me off is the eye-rolling way the security guards at the resort couldn\u2019t hit the side of a barn; meanwhile the cop rarely misses. Sure, this is done in a lot in movies, but there\u2019s a way to do it that looks relatively realistic and doesn\u2019t insult the intelligence of the viewer. Not so here.\r\n\r\n\u201cVice\u201d thankfully shoots for some depth amidst its action thrills. For instance, there\u2019s the question of robotic self-awareness, which was explored with Data in Star Trek: The Next Generation. Then there\u2019s the debate over media violence & sex, whether in movies or video games. Does it provide an outlet for people to purge their debased desires or does it encourage that behavior in the real world? Lastly, there\u2019s a halfhearted commentary on religious fundamentalism and spirituality.\r\n\r\nWhile lackluster in some ways (due to its low-budget), I liked the reverent tone and the profundities amid the thrills, not to mention Jane\u2019s entertaining performance.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Scouts guide to the night of the living dead.\r\n\r\nAt first I believed it was a children's horror movie, I have not even known it was rated R. In the opening scene itself convinced me that it's going to be aggressive as the progression commence. Yeah, it lived up to my last minute expectation. A fine time pass movie for the regular audience, definitely it won't suits for the critics' viewing.\r\n\r\nWhen the three friends find virus outbreak in their town that turns everyone into zombies, they plan to make into a safe place along saving a few others in their attempt. Surely this is what every zombie movie you have seen dealt with. The same old adventure in zombie theme, but the characters and the scenarios were different with lots of fun. I was surprised at that part, surely a cult status will be tagged for it.\r\n\r\nOverall movie was decent, but being a horror-comedy was its strength. Just leave the logics behind and enjoy the entertainment it offers. In the end you will be convinced for your patience. It is the movie you might like it, but can't give full marks. One of the many reasons was, it is not a mainstream actor or the filmmaker's film. But still the entire team was awesome, and delivered its purpose. It was not a box office hit, but still I expect there will be a sequel.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"56e6fbf7c3a3685aa400a643","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56e6fbf7c3a3685aa400a643","movie_id":273477}
{"author":"mattwilde123","content":"I thought this film would be a cross between 'Superbad' and 'Zombieland'. I think I was too accurate. There is nothing original about this film. I suppose originality is not what you are looking for when sitting down to this film which is fair enough but every single character has been ripped from the pages of previous 'teen' movie scripts that have gone before it and the humour doesn't even make it stand out.\r\n\r\nThe story does move on slightly from the tiresome quest of American teenagers wanting to get laid when the zombies appear (spoiler alert!) which kept my interest slightly. The over-the-top gore was fun but only distracted me slightly from how poor the other aspects of the film were.\r\n\r\nOverall, the screenplay and performances are nothing to write home about but it was quite well directed.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u00bd","id":"58c16fff9251411d7b006596","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c16fff9251411d7b006596","movie_id":273477}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"We certainly get the inside joke about wanting to skewer something as raucous and ridiculous as lambasting nonsensical and numbing grade B horror flicks that are worthy of such scrutiny. After all, the temptation is just too much to resist in not exposing such throwaway thrills of intentional insipidness, correct? Plus, incorporating a mixture of smarmy filth and frolic involving menacing zombies, hormonal teens, bouncy bimbos and any other fright-driven clich\u00e9s that one can think immediately off-the-cuff should be enough to satisfy the creepy concoction of craziness, right? Well wrong...especially when the experimental goosebump gags fall flat and feel synthetically repetitive in the over-indulgent and inane fear farce Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse. \r\n\r\nSure, some will automatically gravitate to the outlandish Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse and invite the spirit of the movie's manufactured foolishness as an elaborate playful put-on. In many ways, co-writer\/director Christopher Landon wants to promote the silly-coated salaciousness of his teasing teen-oriented terror tale with a sly wink and anticipates that the audience will embrace Zombie Apocalypse as an unconventional, naughty-minded tangy treat for giddy thrill-seekers. Sure, Landon's off-kilter humor horror show is meant as an escapist ruse and wears its badge of honor as a brain-dead flesh-and-blood fright fable garnering cheap chuckles. Nevertheless, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse feels relentlessly lazy, mean-spirited and connects as a raunchy wasteland of sluggish juvenile jolts and jabs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no excuse for Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse to present such a witless,  misplaced macabre mess. In an age where spoofing zombie flicks in cinema can be high-minded and heralded in both creepiness and creativity in the shadows of such riotous offerings as Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland, it is inexplicable how something like the rancid and toothless Zombie Apocalypse can be so arbitrarily clueless and contemptible in its strained search for crafting off-balance laughs. Again, it is realized that zombie cinema--however serious or silly-minded--is not exactly on the food chain of being considered a viable selection for the American Film Institute anytime soon. Still, there should at least have been some sense of smartness and perception injected in the aimless zaniness that Zombie Apocalypse emits routinely in its languished lunacy. Instead, Landon and his fellow screenwriters invite a series of empty-minded shock value shrills to the proceedings and hopes that the viewers will embrace the cluttered chaos without question. Sadly, some will do just that (read: the indiscriminate teen demo in general) as they will go with the flow and bask in the baseless swamp of tasteless titillation. Consequently, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse is about as adventurous, amusing and intriguing as a medieval stoning in a rural town square.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse needs the approval of its boys locker room impishness to feature such graphic and goofy-minded displays of sexual body part piercings to pad the already morose stupidity put forth in desperate vain. If your idea of horror-minded high jinks include the subjection of zombie-related severed penises and constant groping of female breasts then guess what...Zombie Apocalypse will certainly satisfy one's hormonal guilty pleasures in a heartbeat. In addition, it pays to also have some stunt casting and add to the dumb cheekiness where the likes of the once celebrated Oscar and Emmy-winning veteran actress Cloris Leachman serves as the token oldster to certify the gimmicky warped proceedings (perhaps Leachman's former Mary Tyler Moore Show co--star in the beloved pop cultural and iconic Betty White was not available to sign on the dotted line for this teen terror train-wreck?).\r\n\r\nThe premise, while highlighting the gore and boyhood gratification of wet dreams, involves a group of youngsters that belong to a scouting organization while being taught the efficiency of  leadership and self-reliance. Naturally, these boys will put their merit badges to the test as they must combat the overflowing presence of threatening zombies that are infiltrating their small community. Not only must these adolescents learn to battle each other competitively and tackle their own nagging growing pains but know they must band together and slaughter the walking dead menaces that look to make some serious ominous waves within their bedroom town.\r\n\r\nThe teenage terminators that are called into action are Ben, Carter and Augie (played by Tye Sheridan, Logan Miller and Joey Morgan). Of course this trio fits into the distinctive archetype of youth labeling. Ben is the clean cut kid with some semblance of sensibility. Carter is a handful as the insufferable horndog. Lastly, Augie is the geeky hanger-on. So there you have it--the mini-sized Three Musketeers out to destroy some zombie butt and take down numbers in the process. \r\n\r\nThe feminine eye candy wrapped up in this monstrous madness includes Carter's sister Kendall (Halston Sage). Kendall also serves as the convenient object of affection for the love-struck Ben. And what would a horror flick be without the resident curvaceous gun-toting, butt-kicking beauty with the killer instinct of zombie zapping?  In this case, that role would go to strip club siren Denise (Sarah Dumont) whose skill in eradicating the zombie pests as she struts around like an armed jiggly cheerleader in heat becomes increasingly distracting (or maybe not for some that might find this bombastic and busty Barbie Doll lustfully \"liberating\"). \r\n\r\nThe boys' scout leader (former Saturday Night Live alum David Koechner) is the accident-prone wonder whose penchant for overcoming various injuries is supposedly laughable yet the joke of his clumsy confrontations quickly tires out and grows old. However, the scout leader is essential to the storyline for the tykes because he suffers the fate of becoming one of the zombies that needs to be destroyed. It certainly does not help matters any when poor Kendall's safety is jeopardized and the boys (especially Ben in particular) along with Denise's assisted brashness must rescue Carter's pretty sibling and protect the town's masses from the zombie intruders.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse is a woefully tepid tease that does not care much about its sloppy execution. The scattershot script constructed by Landon and fellow scribers Carrie Evans, Emi Mochizuki and Lona Williams vacillates back and forth in complete cartoonish chaos and it is never clear as to why any of us would want to put stock in hoping that the periled protagonists of this banal roguish romp emerge victorious? The combination of humor, sentimental vibes and sketchy scare tactics overlap and is perceived as annoyingly inconsistent. The deplorable and disposable foundation for the sexual depiction of the females in Zombie Apocalypse is insulting and does not invite any sense of truth or revelation besides flashing feminine skin for the sake of giving this horror hiccup some trivial sauciness. The hoards of zombies being butchered in some imaginative selective scenes is at first kind of challenging in an offbeat, exaggerated sort of sinister way. The repetitive slaughtering gradually becomes off-putting and you are left wondering rather or not you were better off chopping off your own limbs for enduring this boisterous bomb in the first place. \r\n\r\nHopelessly choppy and chintzy, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse could have been stunningly irreverent and still carried out its nuttiness with a coherent slice of clever mockery attached to its brand of mayhem. The zombies genre seems all the rage now within today's pop cultural climate. Of course with the continued disconnected gory gumption of damaged duds such as Apocalypse the future invitation of visiting the zombie zone in entertainment may become as extinct as the dinosaur. \r\n\r\nScouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse (2015)\r\n\r\nParamount Pictures\r\n\r\n1 hr. 33 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Tye Sheridan, Logan Miller, Joey Morgan, Sarah Dumont, David Koechner, Halston Sage, Cloris Leachman, Patrick Schwartzenegger\r\n\r\nDirected and Co-Written by: Christopher Landon\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror and Suspense\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: * 1\/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng (2015)","id":"563e5f7692514118670046cd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/563e5f7692514118670046cd","movie_id":273477}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Uttama Villain is one of those films with a meta narrative where the line between the reel and the real becomes hard to distinguish. It stars Kamal Haasan as a superstar, Manoranjan, who goes back to his mentor Margadarisi (played by K Balachander, the real-life Margadarisi, who shaped Kamal's career) and asks him to direct him one last time after he learns that he has only a few days to live. This ticks off his father-in-law Poorna Chandra Rao, the producer who turned him into a superstar, and his wife Varalakshmi, who move out of the house with his son, not realizing the real reason behind his move. Manoranjan also learns that he has a grown-up daughter from Yamini, the love of his life, who he had to leave to marry Varalakshmi. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the film within the film, a period comedy titled Uttama Villain, Manoranjan plays Uttaman, a man (who is also an actor \u2014 a Theeyam artist) who is mistaken to be immortal, and a devious king, Mutharasan, believing the rumour, wants him to reveal the secret behind his immortality. But with time running out for Manoranjan, can he become immortal on screen? \r\n\r\nUttama Villain is first and foremost a glorious showcase for Kamal the writer. The script superbly blends subtlety with slapstick and the emotional moments never descend into full-blown melodrama. There are times when we get the feeling that Kamal is dipping into his own movie star life \u2014 the opening song Loveaa Loveaa seems to be his admission of acting in roles not suited to his age, pairing up with heroines half his age; when he seeks out Margadarisi, the director tells him he cannot make a story of the star that he is now; when he is consoling his son after revealing to him the illness, it is marred by fans who invade this deeply private moment. Such acute observations add texture to the scenes and make the characters more alive for us. The Uttaman portions are quite a contrast and serve chiefly function as a means to give a break to the heavily dramatic nature of the scenes involving Manoranjan. \r\n\r\nWhile the terrific score by Ghibran complements and enhances the drama, visually, the film lacks the dazzle of the writing (the Uttaman segment is mounted like a skit, with tacky visual effects) and the performances of Andrea and Pooja Kumar are strictly OK; if you wish the former had been more expressive, the later does the opposite. Among the huge list of supporting characters, it is only MS Bhaskar, who gives an affecting performance as Manoranjan's manager Chokku, and K Balachander, whose recent demise gives this story an additional emotional heft, are the only stand-outs. The slapstick portions involving Uttaman should have been crisper and given that by know we are familiar with Kamal's tics, his performance as Uttaman doesn't hold any surprise. But the actor more than makes up for it with Manoranjan; he doesn't strain to make the role more empathetic and it is a remarkably restrained, heart-tugging performance from an actor who, at times, has a tendency to overplay his roles. We come to care so much for this character that by the time the film ends, we realize our eyes have become misty.","id":"55976ad79251413da2000b50","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55976ad79251413da2000b50","movie_id":273870}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Subhiksha stops Vinod at a public place and declares that she is in love with him. Then, she vanishes from that spot leaving him to search for her in vain for days. Finally, she meets him and tells that she was just playing a prank. But Vinod, who has fallen for her, keeps chasing her and so, she tells him that she will agree to be his lover if he can beat Ashwin. This Ashwin is an international boxer \u2014 a silver medalist at the Olympics, no less \u2014 while Vinod is barely familiar with the sport. \r\n\r\nIf you find this Maan Karate-like set-up ludicrous, this is definitely not the film for you. With one of the most preposterous scripts in recent times, M Saravanan, the director of Engaeyum Eppothum disappoints in Valiyavan, which wants to be a youthful romantic film, a family drama, a sports film and a revenge film but if you are posed this question, better choose none of the above. \r\n\r\nThe first half is a complete letdown, with overlong sequences of Vinod trying to find Subhiksha's identity, too many songs and a flashback involving the leads' first meeting, where Jai goes overboard with his drunk act that is so unfunny (the only moment of note is when he kisses a beggar on the lips). Dialogue delivery has never been this actor's strength and yet, he is made to provide unnecessary voiceovers, which he mumbles to himself. Meanwhile, Andrea emotes as little as the costumes she wears, and the absence of chemistry between these two actors takes away every bit of romance there might have been in this story. \r\n\r\nThings are somewhat better in the second half when the director gets down to the actual plot. Vinod's embarrassment in not having protected his parents (an endearing Azhagamperumal and Anupama Kumar) during an incident and Subhiksha's involvement in making him erase that bitter memory. This is where we finally get some amount of drama, but even here the script keeps trying to become bizarre. Vinod is taught boxing by a security guard and then a swami he meets at a temple! Meanwhile, Ashwin's character is made even more despicable with the revelation that he agreed to lose the gold medal in exchange for cash in a Swiss bank account! \r\n\r\nSome parts of the film, though, are interesting \u2014 a mildly amusing flop show of a date, the father-son drama between Vinod and Raghu, the relationship between Raghu and Subhiksha (they are co-workers and confidantes despite their age gap), and the manner in which the director withholds information and then reveals why some characters behave in a certain way. This somewhat lessens the absurdity of the incidents in the first half but the film never manages to land a punch.","id":"55976c3dc3a36855e0000a51","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55976c3dc3a36855e0000a51","movie_id":280149}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"The opening scene of Vaalu features a robbery with men wearing masks that have the faces of the superstars of Tamil cinema \u2014 Rajini, Kamal, Ajith and Vijay. Before we start thinking that this is some sophisticated heist, we are shown what they are stealing \u2014 a crate of beer! And we get the sight gag of 'Ajith' riding the bike with 'Vijay' on the pillion. This is the moment when debutant director Vijay Chander makes his intentions clear; we are in for an anything-goes movie whose only aim is to keep the fans entertained. This is not necessarily a bad thing and Vaalu ends up as a reasonably enjoyable film.\r\n\r\nThe plot is actually stitched together from the must-haves of romcoms and masala movies. We have the mandatory 'heroine doing a cutesy thing when the hero first sets sight on her' moment (here, she is seen petting a rabbit!), a plot device that brings them together (a fairly interesting one involving a lost mobile phone), a wisecracking friend ( Santhanam, delivering a one-two punch this week with this one and Vasuvum Saravananum Onna Padichavanga), a fairytale family (including a father who is so friendly that he advices the son to flush the bathroom more when he has had a drink), a morapaiyyan who is also a gangster of sorts, his henchmen whose only role is to fly through the air every time they are hit by the hero, a hospital climax and tonnes and tonnes of hero build-up. But what saves the film from being just another Tamil cinema romance is how the director manages to package all these things together in a manner that feels fairly fresh despite the three-year production hassles that the film faced (though the actors' appearances changes dramatically within short periods) .\r\n\r\nVaalu rides mostly on the screen presence of Simbu and the actor, who is returning to screen in his first full-fledged role in the last three years (his last release as a hero was Podaa Podi), makes an energetic re-entry. He is there in almost all the frames. He romances, sings, dances, fights, does comedy and utters lots and lots of punchlines. In the song U R My Darling that takes a leaf out of Shankar's Sivaji, he appears as MGR, Rajinikanth, Ajith, and even positions himself as the next in line. Some of it is, as usual, very much over-the-top, but it feels nice to see the talented young star back in action. And his chemistry \u2014 and history (the two were in a relationship when they started shooting for the film, but broke-up later) \u2014 with Hansika, who gets a role that demands her to simply be a pleasant presence, gives the much-needed fillip to the romantic track.\r\n\r\nBut the film is too long and at times, Vijay Chander overdoes things... like the needless pre-climax fight between Sharp and Anbu's henchmen, the innumerable duets (Thaman's heavily auto-tuned songs sound very similar to one another), the lengthy episode involving Priya's visit to Sharp's home.... Plus there is hardly a truly dramatic moment, so there are times when we feel that the film is just drifting along from one amusing scene to another without an end in sight. However, the director displays a knack giving a slight twist here and there to cliched scenes (the final meeting between Sharp and Anbu, for example) that keeps things somewhat engaging.","id":"55e024d8c3a36826a8001e35","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55e024d8c3a36826a8001e35","movie_id":260778}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**When the family vacation turns into a nightmare!**\r\n\r\nHaving not seen any previous films in this series, I had nothing to compare with it and to blame for. Though I have seen many similar films, but it was not as bad as they say. In this kind of theme, the basic storyline always remains same, the remaining parts like the characters, locations and the diversions in the story developments are the key. I think they did that decently, the two new directors who also penned the screenplay.\r\n\r\nWell, this is the story of the Griswold family of a couple and their two teen sons. After realising his family is spiritless with the normal life, the husband surprises his wife and the children to go a vacation. The trip is supposed to have fun, but they find hard to come along in a single mood as a family. Meanwhile, their journey begins to face many hurdles, though they are not giving up. So how memorable their adventure becomes is what unfolds in the remaining section.\r\n\r\nThe cast was good. Both, Ed Helms and Chritina Applegate was impressive, though the film is not laudable. Not all the jokes, but some of them were really cool and most of them were adult stuffs. Yep, this is an R rating film, not a family film, despite the impression you get from its posters. So for the grown ups, this is not a bad film to give a try. I can't suggest or reject on the merit of its previous installments, because I've already given the reason.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"M Rajesh's first three films were comedies about a good-for-nothing guy chasing a beautiful girl and managing to win her hand. He tried to move away from this formula in his previous film, the grossly misjudged Azhagu Raja, which ended up as something painfully unfunny. So, now, he has gone back to his tried-and-tested formula in Vasuvum Saravananum Onna Padichavanga ( VSOP). What Rajesh has done is almost similar to what Sarkunam did in last week's release Chandi Veeran \u2014 taking bits and pieces from his previous successful films and giving us a new film that feels familiar. The only difference is that he manages to succeed... to an extent.\r\n\r\nVSOP has everything you expect in a Rajesh film \u2014 a stalker-ish hero, a heroine whose only requirement is to look pretty, sarakku, misogynist dialogues, bromance, and most importantly Santhanam. The comedian is more or less the second lead in this director's films and that is true in VSOP as well. In fact, you could even call him the first lead here \u2014 not just because it is his character's name that appears first in the title, but also because the plot revolves around his character. And Arya sportingly takes the backseat to let Santhanam take the centre stage in most of the scenes. And the actor doesn't disappoint, and comes up with one wisecrack after another. Some of them hardly make us smile, while some are recycled from his previous ones, but a majority of them are funny and crack us up quite a bit.\r\n\r\nThe film actually takes a while to get going and the comedy in the initial scenes feels forced. It is only after Aishwarya enters the picture that the film starts to find its footing and the arc involving the friends trying to use her friend Kausalya (a competent Vidyullekha) as bait and the plan backfiring on them is very hilarious. The scene where Saravanan, Vasu and Aishwarya land up at Kauslaya's doorstep in the middle of the night to insult her family is especially a stand-out moment. And the tendency of the film to never become too serious \u2014 even when Vasu and Saravanan split-up for a brief while \u2014 works in its favour. And bringing in a surprise guest star in the climax is a nice touch.\r\n\r\nBut the strong whiff of cliched scene set-ups (like getting Shakeela to play a female character who fights for men's rights) is and redundant songs (Imman seems to have been on autopilot) leave us with a feeling of deja vu. In fact, the too many references that Rajesh uses (in terms of background score and dialogues) to get us smile only indicate laziness, an absence of originality, and even desperation. But the best thing is that he keeps things from becoming boring and the film ends up as a mild diversion.","id":"55e02502c3a3684b4a001dd1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55e02502c3a3684b4a001dd1","movie_id":352113}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"For her sophomore effort, Aishwaryaa Dhanush has come up with a film that is far removed from the bleak world of her solid debut, 3. Marking this departure from grim to grime is cinematographer R Velraj (whose name is used for a cop character); in place of the brooding visuals of 3, he gives Vai Raja Vai, a playful, sprightly thriller, a grungy look (most often) that calls attention to the dirty, dangerous world which the protagonist is dragged into. The film isn't perfect, far from it, it has a few weak spots that could have been disastrous but the confidence with which Aishwaryaa manages to narrate this story helps us tide over its issues.\r\n\r\nIn a few swift strokes, Aishwaryaa gives us all that we need to know about her hero. Take away the element of ESP and Karthik (Gautham Karthik, effective) is just your normal middle class youngster with a modest job and an introvert attitude. But he has a loving family, an uncomplicated romance (Priya Anand playing his plant pathologist love interest) and clear-cut values that are his emotional support. While Aishwaryaa doesn't flesh out Karthik (or those around him) fully, we understand why he deems his power as both a gift and a curse. And Pandian aka Panda (Vivekh, continuing his career's comedian to character actor trajectory convincingly after Naan than Bala and Yennai Arindhaal), is quite a contrast to this character.\r\n\r\nHe is flashy and self-possessed but scratch the surface and we get a sad loner with questionable morals. When Panda begins to understand Karthik's gift, he doesn't mind using it for his personal gains, even though the latter sees him as a friend. The manner in which he draws Karthik into his plan is done in a convincing manner and nicely sets things up for what is to come. Similarly, we also admire how Karthik manages to get the mercurial Randhai (Daniel Balaji, who, for a change, doesn't go over the top) out of his way. The pre-interval scene where Karthik demonstrates his power to Randhai is packed with energy and while nothing quite manages to pack in the same punch as this scene, Aishwaryaa keeps the story hopping along so there is hardly any dull stretch.\r\n\r\nThe problem with Vai Raja Vai is that tonally, it is all over the place. One moment it is grungy, the next slick, then lighthearted and suddenly spoofy, so we never get a hold of what the film wants to be. And despite the under two-hour running time, the film feels 20 minute too long. The romantic track feels perfunctory and the picturisation of the songs have a 'Let's just get this over with' vibe and lack any personality. And for a film that deals with ESP, the screenplay is somewhat predictable and there are hardly any challenges for the hero to conquer. Even the casino sequence, for all the pre-release hype and the buildup it is given in the film, feels like an anti-climax. Thankfully, the climax makes up for this disappointment giving us a star turn in the form of Dhanush's special appearance and the actor has fun reprising Kokki Kumar, the impish gangster (who seems to have softened quite a bit) from Pudupettai. It is an ingenious move that would have been quite a pleasant surprise if only had the makers not revealed it in the trailers.","id":"55976af4c3a36855d6000c61","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55976af4c3a36855d6000c61","movie_id":273866}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Rounding out his cop trilogy that began with Kaakha Kaakha and Vettaiyaadu Vilayaadu, Gautham Vasudev Menon gives us yet another chapter from yet another cop's life, although this is more a character study of a cop than just one episode from his life. When his father is shot dead by a gangster, a teenaged Sathyadev (Ajith) yearns for revenge. But, should he cross the line between good and bad? Sathyadev chooses the good side and becomes a cop. He eliminates a most wanted gangster, Matthew ( Stunt Silva), by befriending one of his henchmen, Victor (Arun Vijay). A few years later, Sathyadev is attracted to Hemanika ( Trisha), a single mother and a dancer. But when Hemanika is murdered on the eve of their wedding, Sathyadev goes on a cross-country sojourn with her six-year-old daughter Esha ( Anikha). But, five years later, situations force him to put on his cop shoes after he stumbles upon an illegal organ harvesting group that is being led by a ghost from his past \u2014 Victor. The gang's next target is Thenmozhi ( Anushka), an intrepid young woman, and Sathyadev decides to protect her at all cost. \r\n\r\nEveryone has a moment in their lives when they have to choose what they want to become and in Yennai Arindhaal, both the protagonist and antagonist get such a moment. While Sathyadev chooses to be on the right side, loses people close to him of his choice and still manages to vanquish evil, Victor refuses to cross the line that separates the bad from the good. The director underscores this element in a crucial scene where Sathyadev and Victor speak to each other over a phone. Gautham splits the screen so that we see Sathyadev on one side and Victor on the other with a fine line separating these two characters. And, suddenly, an earlier scene where Sathyadev is deciding on what to become \u2014 a cop or a gangster \u2014 feels all the more important. He would have turned into another Victor if he had chosen the latter! Not surprisingly, Moondru Mugam, a film about a fearless cop and his two sons who grow up into contrasting characters, is playing on a TV screen during this scene. \r\n\r\nThe romance segments of the film seem to be other versions of the romantic tracks we saw in Kaakha Kaakha (a bold young woman attracted to an enigmatic cop) and Vettaiyaadu Vilayaadu (middle-aged cop falling in love with a single mom). That is not to say they aren't interesting. Gautham is one filmmaker who knows how to write female characters and here, Thenmozhi and Hemanika are well-rounded characters. He, in fact, begins the film with Thenmozhi's life, just to tell us what kind of woman she is, rather than begin it with her first encounter with Sathyadev. And with Hemanika, he brings out the doubts that a divorced young woman with a child would have when she is courted by a decent man. \r\n\r\nBut the film does seem less punchy than Kaakha Kaakha and Vettaiyaadu Vilayaadu; it falls a bit short when it comes to matching the emotional undercurrent in the former and the detective thriller beats in the latter. The thriller elements, especially, are subdued, mainly because the director is focused more on the character study aspect and so, the first half feels less exciting. A sub-plot involving another gangster only increases the running time without adding much to the plot. But once Victor enters Sathyadev's life, Gautham changes gears and we get the cop thriller that we were expecting. Arun Vijay, despite sharing certain resemblances with Gautham's villains from the other films, manages to be effective in this role. Though, the role of Victor's wife ( Parvathy Nair) is underwritten and we are baffled when he puts himself at risk for him in the climax. \r\n\r\nUltimately, the film belongs to Ajith and the star is in such fine form here. Playing a character that gives him the chance to be someone his age, here, he turns on the charms when he is with the heroines and taps into the coolly aggressive and self-possessed persona that we saw in Mankatha and Billa. And, Gautham and cinematographer Dan Macarthur superbly capture the star's charisma and swagger (the actor sports four to five distinct looks throughout the film) that we cannot look at anyone else when he is on screen.","id":"5502fdb3c3a3685b9e004341","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5502fdb3c3a3685b9e004341","movie_id":300983}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Another weekend and yet another horror film. And so, we get ready to be scared but Unakkenna Venum Sollu is largely bland, repeating tropes that we have seen in almost every other horror film to make us cower in fear. Jump scares, lonely and large bungalows, kids, rain, power cuts, lonely apartment corridors, doors closing with a bang, no lights, slow tracking shots, scary-looking toy, quirky exorcist... we get them all, but they hardly have any effect. Perhaps, this has to do with horror fatigue \u2014 for the endless stream of horror movies have definitely sensitized us to the obvious scare tactics, but mostly, it has to do with an unconvincing script and lifeless dialogues and line readings that make scenes unintentionally funny (the entire theatre bursts out laughing when a doctor says, \"Gaucher is a rarest of rare disease\"). The constant intercutting between the different strands in the plot, which should have made the film all the more tense, actually does the opposite because it is done in jerky fashion with no feel for the material. As Maya showed us last week, it takes a filmmaker with a vision and technique to even make us care.\r\n\r\nThe premise does look promising \u2014 on paper, at least. Pooja (Deepak Paramesh) and Karthik (Jaqlene Prakash), a live-in couple, break-up and the pregnant Pooja, who gives birth to a child, chooses to give it way. The baby, which is adopted by Judy, a psychologically disturbed woman, dies the same night, but returns as a ghost to demand justice from its parents for abandoning it. But director Srinath Ramalingam ruins it with ineffective scenes and illogical characterization. Take for example the main reason behind the breakup. Pooja wants Karthik to get a job after he is given the pink slip at his current office; he decides to go to Singapore to get a job, and she thinks he's irresponsible because he is leaving her alone to face her pregnancy! We actually end up symapthising more with the ghost, Daisy (Anu), because she doesn't deserve such parents.","id":"5608b336c3a36812070069d3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5608b336c3a36812070069d3","movie_id":361494}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A likely friendship in an unexpected circumstance.**\r\n\r\nSeeing how much the film succeeded, I was not expecting a wonderful drama. I am satisfied with it though, like it portrays about being pregnant, particularly about the teenage pregnancy. They did not go deeper on that topic to just disclose the negatives, instead they told a heartwarming tale, the relationship between two unlikely pregnant women. After a high school teacher and her student got pregnant unexpectedly, and having a common, they come closer to get by together those tough times. During the period, they plan for their future, but many bumps on the road, how they tackle it was revealed in the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nI have heard that Cobie Smulders was really pregnant during making this film. She was good and the highlight of the film. I haven't seen her many solo films. So I find her a much better actress and beautiful than in any of her multi-starer films. Her co-star was not bad either. An interesting storyline, and well written, but not enough to impress a large group of audience. Some people would enjoy it though, probably women who went through a similar situation in their lives. Sometimes we expect a film and reject it if it does not stand up to that par. But some films just reveal what it is intended to and this is that kind of film, whether you like it or not, it will be what it is.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58b0973392514174ed000b0b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b0973392514174ed000b0b","movie_id":306197}
{"author":"thatmovieguy","content":"Under The Rainbow is only writer\/director Luke Ramer\u2019s second film, and his first feature-length, but you\u2019d never know it when watching. Between the extremely well-written script, the top-notch acting from a cast of amateurs, and some great visuals through the trippy story, Ramer grabs us and forced our jump down the rabbit hole.\r\n\r\nUnder The Rainbow follows the story of Vivi (newcomer Rae Labadie, in a stand-out first performance), a drug-addicted 17-year-old who lives with her alcoholic, mess of an uncle after her mother died during childbirth. After an attempted suicide that she can\u2019t fully remember, Vivi awakens to find herself in a strange and dangerous other world. She is rescued from a lunatic Jester, a hunter for the Queen of this new world, by a man named Vilmos, who believes that Vivi could be the savior of his world, a girl whose arrival was foretold by The Prophet. It doesn\u2019t take Vivi long to realize that the only way for her to get answers and find a way back to her world is to confront the Queen, and discover the dark secrets of her life.\r\n\r\nAlthough the film\u2019s story revolves heavily around drug use (both the main character and her best friend are portrayed as constant drug users, and the \u201cRainbow\u201d to which the title refers is also a drug, capable of transporting people between the worlds), but doesn\u2019t play as some preachy cautionary tale, nor conversely as a pro-drug statement, either \u2013 which is something that many films, even psychedelic ones like this, have a hard time accomplishing. There always seems to be a lean one way or another, whereas here, it\u2019s merely a plot device.\r\n\r\nDespite very few acting credits among the main cast, everyone in the film was perfect, especially lead Rae Labadie, and also Brian Dibonaventure, who played the silent Jester. His maniacal look as he wipes blood over his mask and lips was incredible, a true visual that shows not only Dibonaventure\u2019s ability to portray real evil behind an expressionless mask, but also Ramer\u2019s ability to capture exceptional, beautiful, and graphic shots for his film.\r\n\r\nThe film features several scenes of brutal violence with decent amounts of gore, but I wouldn\u2019t consider this a straight horror film. Instead, Ramer has created something else entirely \u2013 a dark, twisted, psychedelic tale of violence, with equal elements of horror and fantasy. A truly beautiful, thought-provoking piece of underground cinema, Under The Rainbow is a serious trip.","id":"5581e280c3a3686faa00001d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5581e280c3a3686faa00001d","movie_id":344901}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> One more the man versus the robot film, but not bad.\r\n\r\nProbably this is the breakthrough the director was looking for. A limited cast low budget science fiction drama. All the faces were fresh, I liked them, but should have been a little better. I won't deny that I enjoyed watching it, but I can't say it is a very clever screenplay. Because it was slightly comparable to 'Ex Machina', though the story derives when we had a conception like 'what if'. Just like 'Big Stan' and 'Get Hard', though this film was planned before 'Ex Machina' and sadly released after it.\r\n\r\nThe story of a journalist who interviews a scientist who developed an advanced AI. A week long interaction and when the final day arrives something terrible happens, that's going to flip the story you had seen so far. The whole film was shot inside a large house, there is no outside world, except in one scene which takes us to the terrace. I did not figure it out the secret, but I kind thought of it, so when it happened at the end I was not surprised.\r\n\r\nFor a B movie, it is a great quality. If you want to check it out a second string films, this is not a bad one to consider. There is no major, any impactable graphics to the narration, but in most of the crucial section was managed well. So the production quality is much better than I expected and so the overall film. Nowadays it is a very common for filmmakers to choose the robot theme in drama, but how good their film would be is our question and this one passed the test.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"57951bbe9251412c1f0012ef","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57951bbe9251412c1f0012ef","movie_id":137333}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Encountering an unexpected and its impacts forever.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese foods considered as the healthiest food in the world. Yes, it's a food and restaurant related theme, and those who loves them should give it a try. It was another film like 'Midnight Diner' that I saw a couple of months back, which focused on a small eatery as this one. What fascinated me was its simple storyline and the realistic approach. It was based on the novel of the same name of the original Japanese title 'An' which translated as 'Bean Paste'. It is not just a food film, but well explored relationship of the people from different generations. This is quite common I found in the Japanese films, yet very distinct from other similar ones.\r\n\r\nThere were three characters in the films that kind of represents past, present and future. Where they all learn some important lessons from each others. I don't know that was intentionally done, but that is how I saw it. The most of the story's perspective was from the middle aged man, Sentaro who runs a small dorayaki shop which regularly visited by the students of the nearby school and the locals. His story is kind of depressing. Not the film, just what he went through in his life and after that his life remained quite a low without an alternative. Though, there were no flashbacks, but just revealed by orally when the right time comes.\r\n\r\nOne day a very old woman named Tokue comes asking for a job after seeing the signboard outside the shop and somehow she manages to grab it. Later she teaches him to make his own bean paste. This is the part I like very much, because it might have not revealed fully how to make a bean paste, but definitely you would feel you want to taste it right away when you see the beautifully prepared paste filled in the tray. So I won't be surprised if you visit a Japanese restaurant just to make your first taste of dorayaki or whenever you visit there, remember this film and ask for it.\r\n\r\n> \"It's like a first date, the young couple needs to get friendly.\"\r\n\r\nSo with such a development, the film takes a leap to the next stage of the story. Where the shop sees the rise in customer influx and by its success, Tokue offered to stay and help further. On the other side a middle school girl, Wakana who has not decided about her future, whether to attend the high school or get a job in Takue's shop which obviously went to the old woman. In the meantime, all the three develop a close relationship to each other in the short time. Despite from the different social group, but the strong connection with the shop. But one day as the gossip spreading like a wildfire all over the town about the shop, followed by a couple of unexpected events, the story nears to its end part with an emotional episode.\r\n\r\nThe most of the film looked like a poetry. The director, who also wrote the screenplay did an awesome job. The cast's performances were outstanding. I have seen them all in different films, even though I did not recognise them at first. I think it is the actors and the wonderful cinematography that made this film looks better than its story. People put their recipe in a book and publish them or make the videos and release online, but I think this kind of film is definitely would make lot impact on, even for the non-food lovers to have a close look which would generate a serious desire and hunger. Just like 'The Ramen Girl', but not as good as this one. A film that preserves a precious dish digitally and makes reach corners of the world.\r\n\r\nBy now you know that I loved it, but there's something I did not like from it which is the third act. Actually, that final act was a bit drag. Compared to the earlier sections, those last 20 or so minutes were quite an unnecessary stretch. I am an easy prey to sentimental scenes, but for this film I did not feel a thing. Other than that, how it all ended pretty neatly wrapped which I applaud loudly.\r\n\r\nWhatever I said all the good and bad stuffs about it, there are some other topics as well in it which came as a side message, but that overtook everything on the final stage and ended as it was the centre of the story like that about treating an older person with disability. I had said many times before in my earlier reviews that I easily fall for seeing the old people suffering which happened in this. So heartbreaking. Except a very few defects that affected me which might won't make a big deal for others, I recommend the film, especially for the drama fans and food lovers.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"57b503979251413d44000099","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57b503979251413d44000099","movie_id":319373}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Not your usual Bond movie, but still a good entertainer.\r\n\r\nWhat I liked from a couple of last Bond movies was they were off the regular 007 style, like not overly rely on spy's special gadgets. This change has been since the day one of Daniel Craig as a famous British spy, James Bond. Anyway, he's the most fittest (muscular) Bond I've ever seen and he's celebrating 10 year anniversary with this film release. But the question is whether he to do another film or done with the franchise. The doubt after the confusing end of this film.\r\n\r\nThe end was quite clear on the story perspective, so I kind of felt it was a farewell for Craig. But, later I came to know that the official source says Bond25 will be his fifth and so on till he opts out himself. 'Spectre' was a very simple Bond movie I have ever seen, but I can say the production quality was so good that you can't resist the enjoyment. The actors, they were also good, but not as I anticipated. Maybe many scenes were very ordinary for a Bond movie, that's comparable with the nowadays action movies, otherwise it was not as bad as critics expressing their disappointment.\r\n\r\nYou can't believe what I was disappointed, you know when they say what the C stands for - is that the best word they come up with against the M for Moron? Anyway, James Bond movies have always had ups and downs, the last film 'Skyfall' was a mega hit and now this has not stood up to that standard. But very entertaining with all the actions and unexpected turns in the narration. As a spy movie, it was okay, but as a Bond movie is what might upset you, so its upto you how you look at it. But to be honest, I enjoyed it.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"56c093a59251412be0000529","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56c093a59251412be0000529","movie_id":206647}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Uncovering the sins committed by whom the millions of people believe in.\r\n\r\nA documentary film would show the real faces of those offenders to shame them. That's the reason I desperately wanted it to be a documentary, then I would have definitely given a maximum mark. There's no complaint about this movie, but adaptation means fakes acting, fake settings and awards goes to non real achievers. Anyway, this movie kind looked a semi documentary and liked the way it was made.\r\n\r\nThe movie exposed a very important scandal. If something is open for a debate in the US means, the rest of the world would follow the same route. That's where this theme was inspired by. It all begins with a group of journalists from the Boston Globe with their new editor instruct them to research on sexual abuse of children by priests. So their lead only gets bigger and puts them to recover more evidence in order to publish. How they come up with the story that shake up not only the nation, but the entire world is the remaining.\r\n\r\nA collection of bunch fine performances. There's no lead actors in this. Everyone is in the supporting roles. Out of 6, it got nominated both male and female in the category of supporting role for the Academy Awards. I am very disappointed, Mark Ruffalo's performance in 'Infinitely Polar Bear' deserved another nominee. Anyway, this 15 year old story still looks a hot topic. It was a great comeback for the director after critics assaulted him with their words for his previous film 'The Cobbler' only to show their rage on Sandler. It is a must-must see. Beware, is is not your weekend entertainer, but based on the real.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"56cde9fec3a36812680000b9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56cde9fec3a36812680000b9","movie_id":314365}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> From nothing to something!\r\n\r\nIf you are wondering this is a B movie, I would say yes, but no. Because I have seen some of this director's movies and he gives the best in this category. Not so popular, small budget, low production quality, all these does not mean not worth a watch. In fact, this film somehow got two most recognisable faces, Marisa Tomei and Jamie Lee Curtis in the supporting roles. And not to forget George Lopez was better than these two who appeared in a prominent role.\r\n\r\nThis film was based on the true story of the robotics club of the community high school from Phoenix, who went to participate in the national underwater robotics competition. That was the year 2004, four unlikely, undocumented Mexican immigrant students came together for a project that meant for university level teams. The rest of the story tells their journey from nothing to something.\r\n\r\nA very inspirational movie, just like 'October Sky'. But in the beginning I was quite not sure, because of the production quality. Then realised that the issue was something else. The film talks mostly about immigrants, due to the majority of characters Mexicans, I felt like watching non-American movie, thus it did not look like a regular Hollywood brand. It comes under the category of 'Life of Pi', 'Memoirs of Geisha' et cetera, where it demands the new faces but still a very much Hollywood.\r\n\r\nYou know these kids who had no experience, built a water robot from the scraped and cheapest spare parts which cost only under $800 and competing with reigning champion like MIT is like ISRO against NASA. Because ISRO sent a low cost rocket to Mars at a very first attempt where many giant countries in the space program had failed to do. And won 2015's space pioneer award, which was very much similar to this movie. So this film is just like a school version of that and an example for nothing is impossible if you put your effort with a right mindset.\r\n\r\n> \"The first rule of engineering is...\r\n> you never build anything with real material...\r\n> until you build a proof-of-concept model.\"\r\n\r\nNot the whole narration is about the robot, but it is the center and awesomely constructed stories of all the characters that connects to it. Since the kids are illegally staying, their's each tale about the struggles in the society as well as in the family was emotionally told. Individually, they are nothing than a thief, a prey to the bully, a prey for the domestic violence and an ordinary fat kid. But their talents in the various fields brought them together by a teacher. As a team they achieve something more than a miracle. \r\n\r\nA movie like this must be shown to students in the schools to motivate their interests. A car thief and a mechanical engineer have the same knowledge, but the difference is one is educated and the other one is illiterate or the school dropout. If the talents are utilised well in a childhood itself, the future will always be brighter. I think every school need to appoint a teacher whose work is to interact with students to find their gifts and to show the right path.\r\n\r\nIn this movie, the timing of those four students and the new teacher was absolutely perfect. And so they saw the life changing moment. It does not happen like that in everyone's life, so sometimes it should be the parents. If both, teachers and parents fail, that's the trouble for that kid as well as the society. This film is not the most popular one, that's the most disappointment. Just don't ignore it, it is a definitely a must see by all the age, because inspiration is not just for the youngsters.\r\n\r\n8.5\/10","id":"55d38521c3a3683b8000043e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55d38521c3a3683b8000043e","movie_id":264337}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Well, cinema\u2019s most treasured and resilient British spy guy is back as the legendary James Bond makes his twenty-fourth outing on the big screen in the highly anticipated and slickly-made Spectre. Worldwide Agent 007 fans understandably maintain their embedded expectations and vision as to what calculating and cunning mission their suave and sophisticated gun-toting, martini-sipping espionage thrill-seeker will encounter in his latest globe-trotting episode. Whatever Bond enthusiasts have in mind for the future twenty-fifth entry of the \u201clicensed to kill\u201d Lothario they should simply settle for the present stimulating currents that trickle as mind-bending material in the polished and percolating Spectre.\r\n\r\nAs for the dynamic performer that have served his time with action-oriented cinematic sensibilities through three previous super-charged James Bond installments, the steely-jawed and diligent Daniel Craig is back on the saddle again for his fourth stint as the crafty 007. Naturally both ardent and casual Bond followers can rattle off the filmography of Craig\u2019s on-screen tour of duty as the debonair and daring secret service operative and even rate the previous films as they compare and contrast each edition.  Some may give special attention to Craig\u2019s first foray into stepping inside Bond\u2019s explosive shoes for 2006\u2019s Casino Royale that is considered a spectacular introduction for the dramatically trained actor. In 2008\u2019s Quantum of Solace, it was a mixed bag at best as Bond followers for the most part gave this second 007 rendition an ambivalent sign of approval (not too many were thrilled with the awkward movie title either). Thankfully, 2012\u2019s Skyfall bounced back for Craig\u2019s take on the roguish Bond and made for some exceptional brownie points as the cagey spy returning to creative prominence. Now 2015\u2019s Spectre hopes to make some hearty tie-ins to Craig\u2019s past big screen adventures as the stoic jet-setting dynamo ridding the world of masterful riff raff.\r\n\r\nIn actuality, Spectre is serviceable in that it is an elaborate and excitable reminder of the preceding Bond films where bits of nostalgic elements from yesteryear are sprinkled throughout its presentation. Sure, some wily 007 fanatics may spot a few of the tossed in nods to the aforementioned Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace in particular as the proceedings unfold. For the most part, Spectre acts as a mere bridge to the launching of the upcoming 25th Bond actioner in waiting. To be fair the other Bond films have served as a welcome mat to the next chapter of the late Ian Fleming\u2019s engaging and charismatic man of action so why should not Spectre be any different in this regard? Still, this spy caper has its signature swagger that Bond aficionados relish with familiarity: heart-pumping action sequences, exquisite locales, desirable and devious Bond women, majestic car chases, larger-than-life villains and their loyal henchmen, imaginative gadgets and inventive technology and yes\u2026the indomitable James Bond at your service. Nevertheless. the minor knock on Spectre is that it could have risen to the occasion more than it did as it occasionally feels as if it is going through the mischievous motions. It never resorts to the levels of Bond-ish drudgery in Quantum of Solace so that certainly is a relief in that aspect.\r\n\r\nSpectre does incorporate its share of opulence, mystery, suspense, shadowy tension and perilous plight. However, where the standard Bond film-making characteristics are somewhat consistent and captivating (i.e. the breathtaking opening sequence of the Day of the Dead celebration in Mexico City) there is also a questionable consideration for the weak-kneed Bond theme song in Sam Smith\u2019s \u201cWriting\u2019s on the Wall\u201d which seems so inadequately suited for a James Bond signature tune. Even the indifferent observers of the James Bond film franchise for the last five decades can attest to the two most important stamps of a Bond film\u2013its opening scene and surging theme song.  Thankfully, Spectre\u2019s grand opening sequence obeys traditional Bond practices but Smith\u2019s doggedly tired-sounding \u201cWriting\u2019s on the Wall\u201d feels as it belongs attached to an old televised After School special from the mid-70s. Wouldn\u2019t you give your kingdom for Paul McCartney and Wings\u2019 \u201cLive and Let Die\u201d or Carly Simon\u2019s \u201cNobody Does It Better\u201d or perhaps even Sheena Easton\u2019s \u201cFor Your Eyes Only\u201d?\r\n\r\nOne thing that can be said about Craig\u2019s Bond in Spectre and that is his image transformation has been elevated to that of a fashion plate whose GQ stylized look has taken quite a step up. Not since Roger Moore\u2019s Bond has there been a clear case of dazzling attire on display for Agent 007 to strut his stuff in spiffy clothing accessories throughout his ventured travels. Craig, billed as a \u201cblue-collar\u201d Bond whose demeanor is more blunt and workman-like, takes comfort in basking in the finesse shadows of a classic Agent 007 almost foreign to his distinctive spin on the iconic spy. In fact, the overall vibe for Spectre seems to lie in the middle of old school and new school James Bond mythology where the shading suits both camps of the ever-lasting film franchise.\r\n\r\nDirector Sam Mendes, who handled the direction for the previous Skyfall, finds the right tone and temple for Spectre that certainly shows off its lavish and ambitious production values as the set designs, scenic locations, fabulous pre-credits action sequence are all indescribable in majestic scope. No one can accuse Spectre as to not holding its own in visual functionality. Wisely, Mendes does not forget his Skyfall background players as they reunite with Craig\u2019s Bond and partake in the sensationalized cat-and-mouse caper. It is refreshing to see Ralph Fiennes back as \u201cM\u201d not to mention Ben Wishaw\u2019s \u201cQ\u201d front and center. And a Craig-fronted Bond film would not be the same without Naomie Harris as Miss Moneypenny.\r\n\r\nAgent 007 fans will find a common \"Bond\" with Daniel Craig and his fourth outing as the licensed to kill Lothario in the stunning and kinettic SPECTRE\r\nAgent 007 fans will find a common \u201cBond\u201d with Daniel Craig and his fourth outing as the licensed to kill Lothario in the stunning and kinetic SPECTRE\r\nIt is a given that the diabolical criminal network known as SPECTRE has always had its affiliation with the Bond universe especially in the classic Sean Connery Bond-age years. Instinctively, SPECTRE\u2019s evil heart and soul was pumped continuously by that organization\u2019s dastardly mastermind Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Oscar winner Christoph Waltz does the sordid honors of taking the reins as Bond\u2019s nemesis Franz Oberhauser in Spectre with devilish delight and is more colorfully corrupt thanks to his handy go-to muscular minion Mr. Hinx (ex-professional WWE wrestler and \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d star Dave Bautista) echoing the memories of beloved brute Jaws (played by the late Richard Kiel) from The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker). \r\n\r\nWe can never forget that along with Agent 007 folklore comes the responsibility of being labeled a treasured Bond babe. And although the latest sultry women represented in Spectre will never make us forget the iconic likes of Dr. No\u2019s Ursula Andress (Honey Ryder) or Casino Royale\u2019s Eva Green (Vesper Lynd) for that matter they still hold their own and give a measure of titillation to both Bond and the vast amount of male admirers wishing they carried a gun and wore expensive tuxedos while being at the receiving end of a provocative smooch by these vibrant vixens. Lea Seydoux\u2019s Madelene Swann and Italian siren Monica Bellucci\u2019s Lucia are on board as the Bond bombshells for hire.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, Spectre has its up and down moments and never is quite sure about standing alone as an independent Bond story or being dismissed as a pit stop for 007-related flashbacks and reference bits ode to yesteryear\u2019s glory of the super spy\u2019s engaging and raging exploits. The verdict is that Spectre ultimately satisfies one\u2019s craving for the invincible James Bond whether you can to relive his vintage reputation or look forward to a millennium-enhanced production that will grow with the ageless wonderment pertaining to Fleming\u2019s literary ladies man-turned movie-making mainstay of action-packed cinema for half a century. As one-time Bond songbird Carly Simon would attest in her soothing lyrics, \u201cnobody does it better\u2026\u201d  Yet in the dimensional escapist world of James Bond this particular go-around could have been a tad bit better.\r\n\r\nSpectre (2015)\r\n\r\nSony Pictures\r\n\r\n2 hrs 28 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Naomie Harris, Ben Whishaw, Dave Bautista, Monica Bellucci, Andrew Scott\r\n\r\nDirected by: Sam Mendes\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Spy-Espionage Caper\/Action & Adventure\/Suspense Thriller\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** 1\/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng (2015)","id":"563ed3f9c3a3681b4d034302","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/563ed3f9c3a3681b4d034302","movie_id":206647}
{"author":"tmdb40011370","content":"A friend recommended this film to me. I was reluctant because I am no big fan of Micheal Keaton. But I watched it anyway purely because of the disturbing subject matter. \r\n\r\nClearly this cover-up resonates throughout the US a great deal, but living in England for most of my life I don't think the shocking revelations ever rang out much other than for a random story-line that probably got buried after the immediate events of 9\/11.\r\n\r\nI won't repeat the story here because other reviewers have already covered that; but what I really admired about the film was how very underplayed it felt throughout. The pacing, the somber soundtrack, the unhurried editing, even the narration all helped capture the suffocating mood of the story as it unraveled in shocking detail.\r\n\r\nThere was no histrionics that you sometimes get with films that are about to expose something deeply shocking. I am reminded of films such as \"The Insider\" and \"All the President's Men\" where the the lives of the investigators\/victims\/whistle-blowers are put into immediate danger by a \"dark force\" should they expose their findings to the public. \r\n\r\nBut with Spotlight, such things were avoided. Instead everything was kept at a \"civil\" level between The Boston Globe and The Church, even though you could feel an underlying dread or threat simmering throughout. \r\n\r\nI particularly liked the ending because even though the story was published and the victims finally came forward before the credits rolled, there was no big fanfare declaring how wonderful the Spotlight team were in exposing this evil. Instead it left us with a reminder that the abuse of children by the RC church was (and probably still is) a world-wide problem; not helped when you learn that Cardinal Law was never arrested, but was later reassigned to a high ranking position in the Vatican, even though both he and the Vatican itself was perfectly aware of the crimes committed by the Church against innocent boys and girls.","id":"5decda590257640014523def","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5decda590257640014523def","movie_id":314365}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A redefined wonderful spy movie.\r\n\r\nI know Melissa McCarthy since 'Gilmore Girls', but never thought she would rise this far, especially to dominate in a movie with the presence of the big names around her, that too in an action film equivalent to top quality. She's one of my favourite actresses, even I enjoyed thoroughly her under-appreciated 'Tammy'. So this is where the action stars become comedians and comedians action stars. Indeed, it worked out so well.\r\n\r\nIt shames comedy-spy flicks like 'The Pink Panther', 'Johnny English' etc. From the director of 'The Heat', helmed another perfect female oriented comedy. Jude Law was a decent as usual, but Jason Statham was unbelievably awesome in his tiny part. I had plenty of good laughs, the loud ones after a long time. I still remember the unicorn joke and I can't stop laughing. And roof over a bike, gadgets and so on... I find Melissa McCarthy's line deliverance are so funny and I enjoy her films specially for that reason.\r\n\r\nI know they used a stunt double and blue\/green screens in the crucial segments for a better result. But still she excelled in all stunt sequences that required physically herself in front of the camera. One of the trivia says, after the end of each day shooting, she looked like fell down an elevator shaft. Her hard work definitely paid off very well.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of adult oriented comedy, so strictly it is for grownups only and may be matured teens. I'll be definitely disappointed if they won't make a sequel for this. If they do, I hope they retain all the cast, especially Statham along the lead actress. And finally I'm looking forward the director-actress's the third collaboration, 'Ghostbusters'.\r\n\r\n7\u00bd\/10","id":"562bc74dc3a3681b590054a7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/562bc74dc3a3681b590054a7","movie_id":238713}

There is not much of sensitivity put into the matter.\r\n\r\nSecond, they are exposing a huge case of system \"missbehavior\" (to say the least) in the Catholic Church hierarchy and you see how the whole city of Boston is treating this institution with great care. Then, this movie is about showing to the world how the exposition was done and the treatment to the Catholic Church is almost as exquisite as the one that has enabled this institution to hide all this cases.\r\n\r\nFor gods sake!

{"author":"cutprintchris","content":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cutprintfilm.com\/reviews\/spectre\/\"<\/a>\r\n\r\nIn hindsight my excitement for Spectre seems a bit foolish. After Skyfall, director Sam Mendes openly stated that he wouldn\u2019t direct another Bond movie. And even so, Skyfall wasn\u2019t the best of the new Bond films by any measure \u2013 dragging on for much too long. But somehow I got sucked into the hype of Mendes\u2019 vision for an homage to the classic Bond, with that somewhat iconic poster of Craig mimicking Roger Moore, and trailers the emphasized a kind of retro re-visitation of some old villains and themes. But Spectre is none of those things, instead it is a film where everyone involved feels like they are just going through the motions. Spectre tries very hard to be an homage to the vintage James Bond classics, but instead ends up feeling more like a mockery of the series.\r\n\r\nFor starters the script is outrageously weak and predictable. Bond goes from shootout, to chase, to sex scene, saying and doing the exact same things he has done for the last 23 movies. Instead of a complete story, the film is just a collection of set pieces and scenes loosely stitched together. And while some of them work well on their own, by the second or third fight scene, you won\u2019t be able to stop yourself from yawning. When you aren\u2019t yawning you\u2019ll be laughing, and not in a good way. The dialogue is downright cheesy. Gone is all of Bond\u2019s smooth charm and ability to sting his opponent\u2019s with his tongue just as much as with his gun. Instead at one point, he throws a watch bomb and says: \u201cTime flies!\u201d\r\n\r\nBond is one a secret mission, assigned to him by M (Judi Dench) via a video message delivered after her death. The film doesn\u2019t ever attempt to invest the audience in this mission, or in Bond\u2019s motivation for seeking out Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz) \u2013 which apparently has something to do with his foster-father and his childhood, again \u2013 but it never seems important to the story or to James. Meanwhile, a new joint secretary, Max or C as he is known (Andrew Scott), is attempting to unite the world\u2019s intelligence under one surveillance network \u2013 and through doing so making the Double-0 program obsolete. Lucky for him, Sam Mendes is already doing that for him.\r\n\r\nHowever, Spectre is a beautiful film. There are about five or six huge set pieces, all of which are wonderfully filmed. And if you are just in the mood the veg out and watch Bond cruise through the streets of Rome in a prototype Aston Martin, than this is the movie for you. But things go on for entirely too long, which would be fine if something of interest were happening. But almost nothing does. Bond gets in a situation and gets out, all while throwing a few pithy, laughable, lines out.\r\n\r\nDaniel Craig has never been more disconnected from the character James Bond, than he is in Spectre. I must say first, that I love Craig as an actor and as James Bond \u2013 he is my favorite of all the Bonds. But here, he is uncharacteristically not James Bond. A scene for instance where bond throws his gun into the river, is done in such a fancy foppish way that I cringed. It is tough to properly convey how Craig misses the mark in Spectre, but when you see it, you won\u2019t be able to help feeling the same way.\r\n\r\nMaybe Sam Mendes and screenwriter John Logan did succeed at creating a perfect homage to the Roger Moore era Bond films? Because in reality, none of those films standout as great movies. From start to finish, Spectre feels like someone filling out a madlibs of Bond scenes, and praying that when they read it back, it makes some sense.","id":"563e06159251413b1300c821","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/563e06159251413b1300c821","movie_id":206647}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Going across the Atlantic to find the lost love.\r\n\r\nA western movie set in the 1870 United States, but entirely shot in the New Zealand. The story of a 16 year old boy, Jay, from Scotland embarks a journey in the New World in search of his love, Rose. Later a bounty hunter joins him and makes sure his safe travel. Technically, it was a road movie, but reveals the plot from the other angles as well in the spare times like during camping at the nights.\r\n\r\nThe narration was too slow and the story was ordinary, but it was enough for me to get engaged. If you wait until the final scene, especially till you figure out the puzzle of the romance theme, you may like it better. The end was so good, just like what a western movie fan looking for, a gunfight. Interestingly, that was not to be heroic, except all the earlier disasters pushed for the finale and the post finale. It is rated R, because it is so brutal in some way and for being faithful to the genre.\r\n\r\nIt might not be a dream debut for the director like the big cast, the high budget and a great commercial success, but giving a satisfying movie in a simple way was his accomplishment in his first attempt. Kodi Smith-McPhee is almost 20 and he's yet to play his independent and powerful enough character that will bring acknowledgement. It was a close one, the narration started like it was his, and he was everywhere in the movie. Then going further, especially when it nears the end, he was kind of fading. But he was awesome, along with Michael Fassbender. Not a must see, as well as not refusable if you get a chance to see it.\r\n\r\n7.5\/10","id":"55f715069251414f6d005825","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55f715069251414f6d005825","movie_id":223485}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A tale about not love at first sight.**\r\n\r\nA romance comedy that begins with two people meeting in an unusual circumstance during their college year. Later the story moves forward to the present where their life status was revealed, particularly romantic life and relationship issues. This story seems familiar, but the filmmakers tried narrate it as much as possible from a new angle. So the majority of us know how it all ends, yet watching how the film is to reveal to us all those contents is not quite bad.\r\n\r\nThis is a different kind of romance film than I thought. There're more about sex than being romantic or emotional. But still nice film with some good performances and length of the film was also good with decent pace. Both the lead actors were quite interesting. They're not as popular as those we see regularly in this kind of theme, but their roles were justified with their fine efforts.\r\n\r\nThe first half was okay type, but the next half, particularly the last half an hour makes the film at its best. Whatever the opening was, but it ends well. It is not a greatest love story ever told, still enjoyable one. You can blame many things and\/or scenes of it, but it entertains on its own way. So I think some people would consider it a good film, but most won't. For me it is an average, maybe a slightly above that. The film is not worth suggesting, even though not a waste of time.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"57ed892bc3a3686cf800045b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ed892bc3a3686cf800045b","movie_id":288036}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**It was not their usual summer!**\r\n\r\nBased on the short film of the same name helmed by the same director. I recently saw many Canadian films, so here comes another one. This is a small film. Not by running time, but cast and production wise. A summer vacation tale, focused on the three boys. You know, summer is always a game changer for kids. This is the season where they learn about the other side of the world. Most of the coming-of-age events take place. Surely this is another one, but I liked it very much.\r\n\r\nThe title could imply many things, but one of the meanings was the same as 'coming-of-age'. I meant, suddenly if you learn something, you realise its significance, then you won't be same as before. You try to act accordingly in the given situation. Like any teen films, you can expect fun stuffs from this. The adventure was good. Not thrilling ones, but like what normal kids do. What I most hated was harming insects. It might be nothing for the majority of people on the planet, but that was a disturbing image for me. I had almost turned the film down.\r\n\r\nThere's no intro. The story just began and moved forward. Because it is easy to get along. Even the narration did not stick to any one's particular perspective. Though most of the time it was Adam's. The teenager came with his parents to spend the summer at their cottage located Canadian side of the Erie Lake. With two friends, he set to venture places around for fun. He's a decent kind, but not the other two. So because of them, he learns their way of making the day. But there's a limit for everything. Once that limit crossed, the story takes a turn and head straight for the finale.\r\n\r\n> \u275dShould take the opportunity while it's open, before it closes.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe film was predictable. Not like scene by scene, dialogues, but what might happen next. That's probably not by everyone. From the opening few minutes itself, I knew there's something big is coming up. But I had to wait for it till the last. I haven't seen the original short, though this story was so perfect for that kind. They extended it and I liked those developments which added more details, familiarising the characters and the situation. The writing was the tricky one. Not smartly done, though convincing one. There's always a clue left behind for what might come later, like a straightforward storytelling. So you basically watch it looking forward to that event.\r\n\r\nStill, the film was interesting enough to hook up with it. The film characters were awesome, very distinctive, which made the film possible. Though some dialogues should have been better. Most of them were improvised, which sometimes feels cinematically unfamiliar. Nevertheless, nice job done by all the cast, particularly the three boys. For other than the cinephiles, the ending could be an unexpected, because of the lack of exposure on what film would turn which way.\r\n\r\nA good film for teenagers to watch, but not for anyone younger than that. Because thematically, it was slightly strong. Referred sex, but no nudes. This is being a Canadian film could be the reason not recognised widely, but it deserves better than that. Not just this one, but many fine similar films met with the same fate before. I'm ninety-nine per cent sure you have never heard this title before. But if you had watched and liked such as 'The Kings of Summer', 'Paranoid Park', then why not try this one. It won't be your film of the year, but there's less chance for you to dislike it.\r\n\r\n**7\/10**","id":"5a1ecc27c3a3680b8f07b584","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a1ecc27c3a3680b8f07b584","movie_id":336666}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"One's a falling angel - the other one's a rising devil.\r\n\r\nSlow West is written and directed by John Maclean. It stars Kodi Smit-McPhee, Michael Fassbender, Ben Mendelsohn, Caren Pistorius and Rory McCann. Music is by Jed Kurzel and cinematography by Robbie Ryan.\r\n\r\nIt's the late 1800s and a teenage Scottish aristocrat travels to the American West to track down the girl he loves with all his heart...\r\n\r\nThere has been a number of modern day directors who have not only refused to let the Western genre die, but also to not be afraid to take it to a harshness of the West level. They have chosen to strip it back to a sense of realism, with no frills and bunting, just a show of tough times populated by tough people and people tough out of luck. Slow West is one such Oater.\r\n\r\nFor his first full length feature, John Maclean has chosen to make a genre of film he clearly knows something about. It's got some familiar tropes - greenhorn, grizzled bounty hunter, deadly gang et al, but Maclean has still made a fresh picture, one that not only intrigues and excites, but also humours by way of some black comedy inserts.\r\n\r\nEssentially it's a travelogue piece, McPhee's lovelorn Jay Cavendish ends up being escorted on his journey by Fassbender's mysterious tough guy Silas Selleck. It's an odd yet engaging pairing, and as they are pursued by Selleck's old gang, and they come across a number of eccentric or devious characters, you may find yourself hoping that all the hidden agendas - the secrets bubbling away in the background - do not shatter the surrogate relationship neither was looking for.\r\n\r\nHis heart was in the wrong place.\r\n\r\nAh, but yes! Maclean shows gumption to go all mud and blood on our butts, building everything to a quite terrific final quarter of film that has rode in on a black stallion straight from noirville. No printing the legend here, it's a bitter commentary on the romanticised view of the Old West. Western fans keen of ear will pick up on some historically spiky dialogue exchanges, whilst also noting the nods towards the immigration angles, where Maclean doesn't pull punches as to how desperate the Old West was for many of those who travelled hoping for a better life.\r\n\r\nPredominantly filmed in New Zealand (superbly standing in for the American West), the panoramic cinematography is stunning, while it's great to see the backdrops are not just mountainous desert scapes, this journey goes through forestry as well. Cast are on prime form, Fassbender seems to be a given these days and it's hoped he will do a Western again, and McPhee plays off of him with genuine conviction. Then there's Mendelsohn, who has to be one of the finest Australian character actors working today, he's perfectly cast here, so his fans know exactly what they will be getting.\r\n\r\nThe poster art is hugely frustrating, showing Caren Pistorius with a big beaming smile on her face, that is very much a bum steer. You would be wise to take more note of the faces of Messrs McPhee, Fassbender and Mendelsohn on that poster, for their facial portraits are more in keeping with this cracker-jack Western. 9\/10","id":"56dc3020c3a368689d0023db","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56dc3020c3a368689d0023db","movie_id":223485}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Urumeen has a dash of everything- patriotism, revenge, violence, romance, fantasy and plenty of blood bath. The narration begins in the 17th century backdrop, for which debutante director Sakthivel Perumalsamy has delved into motion capture technology, Kochadaiyaan style. Some of the important leads to the plot are in this part and it would get difficult to understand the story if this portion is missed.\r\n\r\nThe story then unfolds in 2015. Selva (Simhaa) is a BE graduate, who comes to Chennai from his hometown Madurai looking for a job. All is well until he gets hold of a mystical book. He starts getting mysterious calls after 12 pm giving him premonitions of the events to come, albeit in the form of numbers. (which are explained when the events occur) He soon finds a job in a call center where he meets his college crush (Umayaal) Reshmi Menon and romance blossoms.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, John Cristopher (Kalaiyarasan) a tea seller-turned-finance mafia don has been on a murder rampage along with his brother Solomon (Mahesh) and a few sidekicks. Umayaal approaches their company to sort out a financial dealing and Solomon begins troubling her. When Umayaal complains about the same to Selva, he decides to teach him a lesson. Just when he is about to get to Solomon, he is set on fire by a gang.\r\n\r\nUnable to comprehend what's happening around him, he approaches Charlie (a psychiatrist of sorts) and asks if the book would have any relevance to what's happening around him. When Solomon's murderer reveals the reason of killing to Selva, he gets into revenge mode.\r\n\r\nThe story again goes into a flashback mode and this time around, the plot is set in 1939 in a tea estate where a patriotic rebel Chezhian (Bobby) and Krishnan (Kalaiyarasan) are good friends. When Krishnan is promised a tea estate in Kozhikode in exchange of his friend Chezian, he helps the British trap him. And we again travel back to the current era for the final revenge.\r\n\r\nThe problem with Urumeen is that the director has tried to infuse too many elements into one film. While two flashbacks are already a lot to take in, the second story takes its own sweet time to unfold. After a long-ish fight sequence, we realize that we are still left with the final revenge in the current era. And considering how ruthless John is portrayed in the film, it's disheartening to see him go down without a fight toward the end. Though the plot is an interesting one, the narration falters as vital links to the reincarnations haven't been explained well and leaves you confused.\r\n\r\nBobby Simhaa pulls off his role as a confused individual well, but it's hard to see him as a hero (playing for the first time) looking for a cold-blooded revenge. Kalaiyarasan, has done justice to his character as a villain we would love to hate. Reshmi Menon has nothing much to do in the plot overloaded with violence and bloodbath. However, kudos to Sakthivel Perumalsamy for approaching a complex story in his maiden venture.","id":"56656373c3a368510e001b8d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56656373c3a368510e001b8d","movie_id":332083}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**How long one's eyes can keep secret!**\r\n\r\nMy confession is I haven't seen the original film. I had several opportunities, but for various reasons I stayed unwatched till now. Firstly, I won't consider it a remake since both the films were adapted from a novel. Yet no one can stop the people comparing between the two, just to find out which one is true to the book. In my perspective, I think the original source was written keeping the Argentinian society, because that dark tone narration suits them. I have seen many Argentinian films, but for the American kind of storytelling, it does not appeal. Even though it was not a bad film, I somewhat enjoyed, maybe because I haven't seen the other version.\r\n\r\nThe actors were great, but it was Chiwetel Ejiofor's film, He dominated the screenspace, and Nicole Kidman and Julia Roberts were slightly disappointed with their small roles. But overall, they all made it a decent film, particularly the direction impressed me for handling neatly knowing it is already once made a film. The story was suspenseful, yet it feels familiar and lets you predict the each scene before its commencement. Yes, I thought it was holding something big for the end part, and then it gives out all clues leading that way. So I kind of assumed what the end twist might be and that happened, but a bit differently.\r\n\r\nThis kind of screenplay totally works for a Korean style filmmaking, but Hollywood is expert in a different field. Wherever it comes the film, a film is a film, so I won't blame it on a regional ground for lacking of something. But it should have been a bit better, maybe more thrilling and making the characters more stronger with emotionally appealing could have worked, particularly for a certain group of audience. If you're watching this story for the first time, then you might enjoy it, but for the other reasons you might not. Whatever, not a bad film for watching it once.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"57d30815c3a36820000007bf","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57d30815c3a36820000007bf","movie_id":290751}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Not very innovative, as well as not that bad.\r\n\r\nLike the previous year, the 2015 was also considered the year of sci-fi in the film world. Plenty of large and small scale flicks came out and among them I was eagerly waiting for this one. If the story is what you always prefer with a fine production quality, then this film won't disappoint you. The performances were also well supported. Then what was this film's issue?\r\n\r\nThe last time widely accepted movie by Tarsem Singh was when he engaged in the screenplay development. After that he did not see much success where all his directed ones were written by others. My perception is that he must do those both department where he's good at it. Take this film as an example, an awesome story and had a good cast, but the writing was let down according to many who saw it.\r\n\r\nEven in the short period of appearance, Ben Kingsley's role's legacy carried out till the end, because the concept was designed like that way. Being one of the top actors, Ryan Reylands films are not that celebratable. Though he's doing a decent flicks often and those were failing to recognise in the higher level, which did not spare this one as well.\r\n\r\nPeople are comparing it to 'Face\/off', but to me it looked more like coming together of 'The Island' and 'Skeleton Key'. Whatever it is I had a good time. Not a fresh concept of an idea, but narrated differently and it needed a bit depth in showcasing everything in the film.\r\n\r\nMy formula\/secret for watching a movie successfully even it considered as an average or worse is, I won't bother for all the departments come together to become a well crafted product like the critics expect, because I'm a movie fanatic and love watching them almost most of the time than arguing about its flawed contents. If I find anything solely interesting like acting, music, story, visuals, I respect the efforts. So do I to this one and believe me it is much better than what the critics say so.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"568a3236c3a36860e902a34d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/568a3236c3a36860e902a34d","movie_id":238615}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The first crush.**\r\n\r\nThe film was completed back in the T15, but it only released recently. Another Hollywood's Indian connection theme. This is about an Indian family living is the United States. Everything was told from a young boy's viewpoint. Growing up in a traditional Indian house, daily facing the western society, his struggle on caught between two cultures were shown to us as a hilarious life adventure.\r\n\r\nI have been waiting for this film, at some stage I had forgotten its existence. When I came across an old trailer I've had saved in my hard drive, immediately I started to stream the film. It does not have big stars nor the big budget. It was a simple comedy about the culture collision. So there's no reason to expect it to surprise me. I enjoyed just as the way it was.\r\n\r\nThe original title was 'Good Ol' Boy', upon release, it was renamed. Both the titles justifies on what the film had narrated. It was a 70s tale, a little Indian family in the United States is almost living the American dream had to face the cultural differences. A young boy from the family named Smith is obedient to his parents, but when love bug bites him, all are going to change forever.\r\n\r\nWhen a most famous family in their neighbourhood becomes close to them, kids from both the families develops a think friendship that goes all the way from their homes to the school. But it was more than a friendship for them. As the days of months of cultural exchange between them while their parents struggling to get along, finally, what brings the twist in the tale takes us straight to the finale.\r\n\r\n> -xX] There she was, a touch of heaven a mere 30 yards from me, yet a heaven unreachable. [Xx-\r\n\r\nThe story was a flashback. The old Smith recalls his childhood memory, particularly his first crush. The cross culture narratives are really fun, especially when they highlight the outcome. Because the outcome is not same for everybody, but how they make it for their comfort. It was a typical Indian parenting. But the kids wanted to experience the real America. Just like the Oscar nominated animated short 'Sanjay's Super Team'.\r\n\r\nI think the writing was good, that included writers from both the cultures. Yet there were some scenes, too offendable, if you are an Indian. Because Indians easily offend for everything. Since it was a comedy flick, those things do not mean anything so seriously. It was just a way to make it very funnier, but the things became sillier. That's a traditional way of making a Hollywood comedy. If you are familiar with that, you will get it. But they have pushed it hard, yet the film was not harmed with boring cliches.\r\n\r\nFrom the picture colour tone to everything, takes us to the 70s, like it was made 30-40 years ago. Nice casting too. Particularly the boy. And not to forget his father as well who might have been a supporting character, but a show stealer. Jason Lee too had a decent role and so the rest of them. A feature film directional debut for the filmmaker and he was not bad at all. He should only get better from here on.\r\n\r\nIt is entertaining. A good timepass film, a good weekend film to watch with family and friends. It was a nice comedy that's gone unnoticed for several reasons which are common for such small titles. But in this digitally streaming world at your finger tip, that's should not happen. If you are reading this, then I say try it. Of course it was not a great film, but one of the best films of the year. The critics say it was a nice film and so those small chunks of people who saw it also thumb upped. Now it's your turn to join them or go against than totally ignore it!\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5a771fbc92514105a6046567","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a771fbc92514105a6046567","movie_id":426469}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> When an enthusiastic baker's skill was tested.\r\n\r\nThe ninth film in the 'American Girl' series, in that, fourth straight film for the director. Honestly, I have not seen all the films in the series, but I enjoyed those I've watched. This is a decent movie for all, especially for the families with the kids to watch on the weekend. I was not expecting it to be a fantastic, because children's films have certain limits and I know that very well. Usually the filmmakers push for a G or a PG tag for their product, that's why a film like this always appears to be so cheerful, and at a time silly as well.\r\n\r\nA typical 'American Girl' movie, but only the theme was different. This time it is about the baking. A young girl Grace is passionate in baking who thinks one day she's going to take over her grandparents' bakery. In the summer holiday, she's forced to drop her all the plans with her two best friends, after an unexpected visit to aunt's in the Paris is decided. There she meets her cousin Sylvie who's not friendly and uncle who runs a small bakery with the quality foods. The cultural difference makes her to struggle to understand the French way of baking, but in the end she overcomes it and decides to take it back to the home to save her grandparents' troubled bakery.\r\n\r\n> \"Take risks. That's how you make amazing things happen.\"\r\n\r\nIn the several occasions I had postponed watching this for no reasons, but finally I saw this now. To declare it is a good or a bad movie is a very tough decision, but I can say I enjoyed watching it. Not all the adults going to like it, because there are too many scenes that feels so stupid for the matured people like us, especially the dog parts that makes us to say 'whaaat?'. But that is usual and expected in 'American Girl' films, so you have to ignore it if you decide to try it. There won't be any similar issues with the children, especially the girls who are the ones going to enjoy it more than anybody of us.\r\n\r\nA simple movie about baking, that means it is not going to demonstrate how to bake bakery items for us, but still it inspires the kids. One thing is for sure, after watching this you will definitely feel you want to taste a delicious cupcake. Most of the cast was new to me, except Virginia Madsen. But everyone was good in their respective roles, especially the new face who played the title role. This is not an easy movie to suggest, but if you got a young girl in your house like a niece or a daughter, definitely worth it to show them and a reason for us to join them, especially to know how much they adore it.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd\/10","id":"572a03c6c3a3683297001783","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/572a03c6c3a3683297001783","movie_id":338100}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> There's only one way out and it is to fight back!\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'Blue Ruin', yet another crime-thriller. This time it revolves around a rock band who trapped in the neo-nazi enclosure on the outskirt of the city. So how do they plan to get away from the green room they're locked in, and armed men are outside waiting for them to take down. The film filled with lots of tense moments and mostly unpredictable stuffs which is a one day event.\r\n\r\nI was not surprised, I just expected something as smart as the director's previous film. He retained his favourite actor, Macon Blair to play an important role as their third collaboration in this multistarrer and he once again did well. This theme is not the first time explored, it is a well known, but the setting was very unique. All the actors were amazing, but truly very sad to hear the news about Anton Yelchin. He was a young and a wonderful actor and his '5 to 7' was my favourite.\r\n\r\nAt first, I thought the plot was so silly. I wondered why they did not use the excessive force as they're capable to tackle such situation. But that's the best part, because they threw away the clich\u00e9 and approached for something new way to deal it. So the writer, I mean the director did great to carve a rare and thrilling film of the year.\r\n\r\nThere's no martial arts, criminal gang's collision or the cops fighting the bad guys; it was about how the normal people confront during a hostile situation in the real world. Blue and Green are done, now I'm waiting for the director to announce his next colour project.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"5787cdabc3a3683932001341","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5787cdabc3a3683932001341","movie_id":313922}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The mother of mother, that means who cares you in two-folds.\r\n\r\nThere are many aged actors in Hollywood, since Lily Tomlin acted in it, I won't consider it a bad choice. Because she was amazing in the title role, I never doubted since I saw the first trailer and the movie delivered as much as I expected. The rest of the cast was also fantastic. I liked the simplicity of its storytelling.\r\n\r\nIt was a short movie. I think that was an advantage for a small theme movie like this. Don't underestimate it for its small budget, the production quality was great, but you know it's packed with predictable stuffs yet very entertaining, a slightly under-appreciated movie. It was shot within the 20 days and in the era of mega films like 'Fury Road', there are audience to acknowledge for a little flick like this. Whatever your verdict going to be I say just watch it.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of original 'American Pie', who had lots of ups and downs in his career, but most of them were low profile flicks, even though those had big names in the cast. This is one of his best, at least in the recent time. I know this is just a one-off movie, but I won't mind if the a couple of sequels follows from here. Because this is a wonderful concept, not just for fun, I consider it a slice of someone's real life.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"570fc14d925141016f00249f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/570fc14d925141016f00249f","movie_id":309304}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> In the ocean of orcas, a family of four penguins seeks a way out.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those movies I've lost interest after seeing its trailer. When I decided to watch I had no expectations, but I liked the surprise it gave me. So much better and very entertaining with lots of nail biting momentum. You can't write a review for this without mentioning the terrace scene which was one of the highlights of the movie.\r\n\r\nRemember the 2013 flick 'The Impossible' about a western family while visiting Thailand for a holiday stranded and separated after tsunami struck. Feels like this one is kind of a sequel, because of the similarity and takes place in a neighbouring country, Cambodia. But here the visiting family has to face the threat posed by the men from and during the coup.\r\n\r\nUps and downs in the acting career are very normal and keeping that pace is essential. Right now Owen Wilson is maintaining it well and a few 2016 releases are the most anticipated ones. Pierce Brosnan's decent limited appearance had a prominent part of the storytelling. Comparing recent wonderful movies, Lake Bell carried out phenomenal stage of her career.\r\n\r\nI thought it would be old fashioned like the 80s and 90s flicks about people trapped in a local conflict. If you are yet to watch it, I'll clear your doubt that it is the same old theme, but amazes you with many thrill scenes. So this movie is very enjoyable and you would have a good time. Not recommended unless if you're not looking for a masterpiece.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"568a3064c3a36836280129a9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/568a3064c3a36836280129a9","movie_id":192141}

{"author":"narrator56","content":"This is a pretty good documentary. It is refreshing to get the perspective from people other than the western climbers, and other than the sherpas as far as that goes, since this follows porters from Pakistan rather than the higher paid sherpas of Tibet. So it involves trekking rather than the climbing itself.\r\n\r\nSo we hear about the inequities of the porters employment, the lower pay scales as I already mentioned, the sometimes unfair expectation that they carry much more weight than what is considered standard without any increase in pay, and of course the danger inherent in their occupation. It is so hazardous that it actually affects the life expectancy of the male population.\r\n\r\nThis documentary also highlights the humor and wit of some of the porters in discussing their plight, so that the show is not a downer to watch. There was a bit of repetition in their conversations, and some comments by climbers themselves sometimes seemed to be off the point being made, sort of more about them than about the subject matter. Maybe that was the point of including it.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting look at workers who have practically no voice of their own in the scheme of things. Perhaps the countries who issue the permits to the climbers employing the porters need to put more guarantees and safeguards in place for their citizens taking on this hazardous, low paying work. I believe that was done to some extent for the sherpas.","id":"5e89b440d207f30016989173","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e89b440d207f30016989173","movie_id":314292}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Right in the opening scene of Naanum Rowdy Dhaan, director Vignesh Shivan makes it clear what we are in for \u2014 a quirky \u2014 and at times darkly funny \u2014 comedy. We see a young boy, Pandian, sitting inside a prison cell, and just when we think that he is a juvenile prisoner, we are shown that he is actually the son of the station's inspector, Meenakumari. He strikes up a conversation with a small-time gangster (Naan Kadavul Rajendran, who gets a funny scene later on, which involves a pistol which makes a 'meow' sound when it goes off) in the cell, and this inspires him s much that he decides that he wants to become only a rowdy and not a police officer. \r\n\r\nThe boy grows up into a young man (Vijay Sethupathy) who behaves like a rowdy (his den is painted with fluorescent paint where the rates of various jobs (from cutting off one's hand to cross calling are graffitied), even though the only tussles that he is asked to mediate is between schoolboys. And the story he had heard from the prisoner in the cell impacts his life once again. A character from the story, Kadambari walks into his life. She is a hearing-impaired girl whose cop father, who had gone after Killivalavan (Parthiban), the gangster-politician responsible for his wife's death, is missing and she requests him to track him down. Pandian is smitten by the girl and decides to help her. Things come to a stage when Kadambari tells him that she will live with him only if he can defeat the gangster who took away the people close to her. \r\n\r\nThe plot might come across as a serious revenge drama, but Vignesh Shivan displays a lightness of touch throughout that makes the film so much fun. And, he keeps things breezy even when situations get serious. There is always a funny one-liner or a bouncy musical cue waiting to make us relax, and the comical and emotional beats of the film are brought together seamlessly in an admirable way. He is aided in this task by his music director Anirudh's rollicking score (and songs, which, for a change, are not bathroom breaks but add to the mood of the scenes), cinematographer George C Williams' gorgeous frames and editor Sreekar Prasad's cuts which keep even the serious scenes fleet-footed. The segment where Pandian and his friends try to kidnap Killivalavan is among the hilarious moments we have seen in Tamil cinema this year. The plan, as we expect, goes gloriously wrong, but is comedic gold. \r\n\r\nThe director also adds a bit of novelty to the storyline by showing us certain scenes and then going back to them at a later stage to give us a complete picture. Early on, Kadambari is brought into the police station when she is found wandering alone at night and picking up a fight with the cop. And when Vignesh shows us what had actually happened, things fall into place with an ease that is to be seen to believe. \r\n\r\nThere are a couple of moments where the film threatens to descend into melodrama. One happens when Kadambari gets news of her father's death and mourns for him. This scene goes longer than necessary and is shot in a self-conscious fashion (a close-up of Pandian and Kadambari's lips) that only yanks us out of the film. The other takes place in the midst of a shoot-out when we are told something has befallen Pandian's mom. We get a pay-off to this scene during the closing credits but it only comes across as indulgent. \r\n\r\nThe actors are terrific. There is none of the mannered performance that we saw in Vijay Sethupathy in films like Orange Mittai. Instead, he seems relaxed and that helps turn the character into a charmer. Parthiban has some crackling scenes and the actor manages to make Killivalavan comical and menacing at the same time. This is one of the strong performances of Nayanthara; perhaps, dubbing for herself has actually helped. And her disability is refreshingly handled in a matter-of-fact way (there is no solo violin wailing in the background to make us empathise with her) and the film has fun playing around her impairment (the scene where she is kidnapped by Anandraj, who play a small-time rowdy, is hilarious). RJ Balaji raises a smile every now and then with his pop cultural references. He even uses the screen persona of yesteryear villains Anandraj and Mansoor Ali Khan to add humour to the scenes. The only one who gets lost is Radikaa, with a character that stays offscreen after the initial scenes. Maybe, that is why the director chose to have the closing credits scene.","id":"56302962c3a3681b6100f0d0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56302962c3a3681b6100f0d0","movie_id":320910}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Naalu Polisum Nallairutha Oorum (NPNO) begins with a tour of Meiyur, the village where the film is set in. It is a model village where everyone is friendly with one another. The villagers are very accommodative and considerate \u2014 when a thief (Yogi Babu) who had come to rob the temple breaks a leg in the process, they do not beat him up and hand him over to the police; instead, they advise him, 'Paathu thirudunga' and mend his broken bones. But most of all, they are virtuous, so much so that they leave a gold chain on the road for two days in the hope the person who lost it might come and find it. This honesty is what has resulted in the village receiving the Best Village award from the president for five consecutive years.\r\n\r\nThis integrity is also what has made the police station in the place redundant \u2014 we see a board there saying 'Sunday Holiday'! The station exists mainly as a recreation centre for the four cops, who while away their time watching cricket on the TV or playing carom. And once in a while, they are of use to the villagers who might need help in finding their cows. So, when a letter arrives saying that they are to be transferred to Ramanathapuram, a hotbed of violence, the cops are, naturally, reluctant. And they hatch a plan to register a crime, so that a police station becomes a necessity for the village. What they don't realize is that their actions might have far-reaching conclusions that will not only affect them but also the entire village.\r\n\r\nThe central conceit of NPNO \u2014 cops trying to stage a crime to retain their jobs \u2014 is taken from the 1939 film Ask A Policeman, and the team has been smart enough to acknowledge it in pre-release interviews. While that film uses the premise for a whimsical comedy that is distinctly British, debutant NJ Srikrishna uses it to tell a conventional story with an even more familiar message that involves Newton's third law.\r\n\r\nThe first half is engaging enough as we are introduced to the place and the characters, including the four cops played by Arulnidhi, Singampuli, Bhagavathi Perumal and Rajkumar. Though Arulnidhi, as the hero gets a cheeky introduction scene (in true masala movie style, where bullets bend and bounce off things to hit their targets) and a romantic track (that is very blah), it is Singam Puli who comes across as the protagonist. He gets to be in most of the scenes and his antics in these portions are quite hilarious. The skit-level humour is entertaining for a while, but after a point, we start wishing for little more sophistication in the writing and filmmaking (which is in TV drama territory). But the second half is more of a letdown, mainly because the director has difficulty in maintaining the tone of the film, which abruptly changes from farce to realism (read preachy), and by the time we reach the bleak \u2014 and abrupt \u2014 ending, we feel as if we have ended up in a different film.","id":"55b8880dc3a3684af10013d1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55b8880dc3a3684af10013d1","movie_id":280107}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"In Oru Kal Oru Kannadi, Udhayanidhi Stalin played a carefree guy who starts wooing a girl after meeting her on the road. In Idhu Kathirvelan Kadhal, he played an amiable fellow who is determined to win the heart of a young woman. In Nannbenda, he plays a happy-go-lucky young man who falls in love at first sight and starts pursuing her. Based on his three films so far, you might not be wrong if you think Udhayanidhi Stalin is repeating the same character. Like Gautham Menon, who has admitted that the heroes of his cop trilogy (Kaakha Kaakha, Vettaiyaadu Vilayaadu and Yennai Arindhaal) are an extension of the same character, maybe, Udhayanidhi's characters in his three films are one and the same. These three films should, perhaps, be called Three City Trilogy, given that each of these films is set in one particular city (Chennai, Coimbatore and now, Trichy). \r\n\r\nThe film actually opens in the least-expected way with Udhayanidhi's character Sathya and his friend Sivakozhundhu (Santhanam, obviously) breaking out of prison. We are told that they had been in prison for killing someone and are now planning another murder. And then, we get the flashback, which reassures us that everything is going to be as expected. Sathya comes to Trichy to meet Sivakozhundhu but is love-struck seeing Ramya ( Nayanthara). So, he chooses to remain in the city, woo her and marry her. She starts reciprocating but when she opens up to him on her past, Sathya just ridicules her for giving weight to a non-issue that threatens to break apart their relationship. \r\n\r\nNannbenda's beats are very familiar but thankfully, the film knows it too and doesn't take itself seriously unlike Idhu Kathirvelan Kadhal. This gives it a lighthearted vibe and director Jagadesh manages to keep the tone cheery for the most parts. Every time the film threatens to become heavy on drama \u2014 like the interval block, when Ramya tells Sathya that she has spent time in prison for murder \u2014 he immediately lightens the mood. When we learn of Ramya's past after the intermission, all we can do is chuckle and roll our eyes at the sheer ludicrousness of it, but the film, too, is aware of how absurd it is. \r\n\r\nThe director also doesn't strain too much to make things humorous and Santhanam is in form here, chipping in with his one-liners to ensure that the laughs don't dry up. But the film lacks comedy sequences that are riotously funny (say, like the airplane scene in Oru Kal Oru Kannadi) and some of the supporting characters and arcs \u2014 the hatred Sathya and Sivakozhundhu's schoolmate Thangadurai, a cop, has for them; two warring rowdies; a robber gang that Ramya exposes \u2014 are not as interesting or funny as they could have been. The film could also definitely lose a couple of songs (though, this is one of Harris Jayaraj's better works in recent times) and be all the more better for it. But it exploits formula to the hilt and like a well-oiled machine, does what it set out to be.","id":"55976be49251413da2000b60","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55976be49251413da2000b60","movie_id":329591}
{"author":"Gimly","content":"A better cast, worst scripted _Bruce Almighty_. The execution is severely lacking, and as much as I adore seeing Simon Pegg and Kate Beckinsale ham up the screen, it seems obvious how much better this could (and should) have gone. What we are left with in _Absolutely Anything_ is a movie that was engaging, yet glaringly bad, the sort of thing I didn't hate watching, but will never watch again.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._","id":"5aa4985fc3a3687c13017304","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5aa4985fc3a3687c13017304","movie_id":86828}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> In a rare case when friendship comes before the family...\r\n\r\nThis is not like one of those you have already seen cancer themed film, there's two main characters and their two sets of struggles. They both are very close friends since childhood. When they grow up, one settles down comfortably in life, but fall seriously ill and another one struggles to build a family.\r\n\r\nI think the film's strength was the development in every scene without wasting a bit. There's always something happens that keeps us alive. I expected the usual, but it gave me a different entertainment. In the movie everything was between two friends, even each had their own family to care about, this story concentrated what came between them and how they fought together.\r\n\r\nGreat direction, shot in wonderful places, but the actors were decent. They should have been better, especially Toni Collette. To me the sentiments were very weak knowing the theme belong to the tearjerkers. Initially you might think it is a female version of '50\/50', almost it was, but tried to be a different with additional story expansion. Overall a good movie, little fun to watch, you might enjoy it, but I can't guarantee.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"570fbf629251416a5600135c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/570fbf629251416a5600135c","movie_id":290762}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A sudden sparkling change in a moody life.\r\n\r\nThe second collaboration between the director and Greta Gerwig. I just love their works, together they write awesome story and create a cinematic magic. Kind of rare filmmakers, only a very few from the past to compare these two to them. It was another quirky comedy, especially if you liked 'Frances Ha' you would like this as well. I hope they would come for the third time to complete 'An Untalented Girl from NYC' trilogy.\r\n\r\nIt was not as good as the previous film, but nothing short of awesome entertainment. I am surprised a few of those who liked that movie did not favour it. I knew it would be a chick comedy, accordingly, I was not expecting beyond that. But like all the time when I decide to watch a movie, I wanted it to be a better entertainer than the one I saw in the earlier. That's what everyone do, it was like the sea tides, the rise and fall is inevitable. Some would like it and some won't, but to me it was a very good.\r\n\r\nUnlike 'Frances Ha', here there are two lead characters, both are young adult women, but the entire narration was from one person's perspective. That is, a college freshman Tracy. How her life follows, especially after meeting a girl who's soon-to-be her step-sister. As in a new place and socially inept, she finds her way to be joyous and adventurous, meets some new people and makes them friends. But how long this unplanned pleasure remains with her and what are all changes makes to her rest of the life is the remaining movie.\r\n\r\n> \"I am so impressed by you and so worried for you at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a simple and soft narration, but engaging characters and well paced with a chain of fine comedies. Apart from writing and direction, the supporting cast was the best feature. It was a tiny twist at the end, but extremely essential to break the steady sequence to bring a diversion. Since that part, I have been wondering about the conclusion, but the makeover was really excellent, I think it was touching yet as I expected.\r\n\r\nThis is Lola Kirke's major role I've seen. She was fantastic and I hope to see her in more films in the lead. It was one of the best on-screen chemistry between her and Greta. There were many beautiful lines spoken between these two, very memorable and quotable ones. With all these top quality, if one still don't like, then he must be bored of watching plenty of similar themes. But that should not be a reason to trash it, because that is his personal issue to deal who's dumping on this one is totally unfair.\r\n\r\nThis movie was unique, fun, touching, heartbreaking, likeable characters, filled with cheerful moments and overall one of the best recent films I have seen. It was more like a friendship movie on trust and commitment. The portrayal was at its best, an example of how a life can turn around in a matter of time. But how much more trustworthy is this sudden change and the best uses of it was the movie that told very nicely. I won't say it is a must see, but personally I feel that way.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"570293cec3a368568c003848","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/570293cec3a368568c003848","movie_id":309245}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Some over-stuffed blockbuster actioners boldly boast their explosive and invigorating productions with dynamic glee. Well, the \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 film franchise echoes this same sentiment, with flashy fifty-something star Tom Cruise still carrying that boyish exuberance that never seems to miss a beat, and can breathe a sigh of relief because the latest chapter will not disappoint in its adventurous, adrenaline-rushing skin. Yes, Cruise is back as IMF super spy stud Ethan Hunt in writer-director Christopher McQuarrie\u2019s power-surging \u2018Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation\u2019. Notoriously slick, ambitious, wildly impish and vastly intriguing, \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019 incorporates superb direction, writing and, of course, its no-nonsense dosage of non-stop shenanigans to fuel the audience\u2019s escapist palates.\r\n\r\nIn actuality, \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019 is a hyper and hip throwback to the original blueprint for this kinetic movie series that took viewers by storm when it first premiered back in 1996. The minor outcry for the box office sensation that was the \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 big screen offering back in the late 90s was quite understandable since it did not seem to stay entirely true to the iconic 60s television series thus being dismissed as a volt-driven vanity piece for the high-strutting Cruise. Still, the cinematic \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 experience did not peter out but steadily built a devoted fan base that wanted to endure the high-flying hedonism of Cruise\u2019s espionage daredevil Hunt and his band of cunning cohorts. It is definitely safe to say that the stellar \u2018Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation\u2019 has delivered a bang for its buck in a summertime cinema hunger that thrives for such sleek, innovative spy thrillers that charm more than harm. Maybe \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019 will not let anyone forget the exploits of the legendary James Bond spy capers anytime soon but hey\u2026Cruise\u2019s hotshot Hunt has a colorfully distinctive way of promoting his \u2018shaken, not stirred\u2019 moments as well.\r\n\r\nSo how did the collaboration of filmmaker McQuarrie and his chance-taking lead Cruise give \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019 its deliciously sinister, overactive pulse? The fact that the overzealous stuntwork (much of it performed by Cruise with daring enthusiasm) is imaginative and the story feels smart and clever certainly has a lot to do with the magnetic appeal of \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019. Hey, the TV advertisements even give a generous peek into the pulsating platitudes that the MI universe will swallow with robust anticipation. Watch IMF agent Hunt hang on to a speedy airplane with his dear life in the balance. Watch IMF agent Hunt jump into a deadly spiral of a waterfall. Watch IMF agent Hunt race a piercingly fast motorcycle (or car\u2026take your pick) and enjoy the road raging carnage with poetic prominence. Okay\u2026you get the picture.\r\n\r\nThe premise in \u2018Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation\u2019 has more bounce to it than a basketball during the NBA playoffs and that is not necessarily a bad thing to note. While Hunt continues his mission to stop the team\u2019s latest despicable foe (Sean Harris) and end the operation of the insidious operation known as the Syndicate there are feathers being ruffled because of the federalised threats to shut down the IMF empire through the suggestion of a top-notch CIA director (Alec Baldwin). Naturally, IMF head honcho Brandt (Jeremy Renner) tries to prevent such hasty actions as his team of agents must overcome some of the controversy and confrontations from previous disastrous events that have warranted the threatening hints to shutdown his governmental outfit.\r\n\r\nCruise's Agent Ethan Hunt is leaving on a jet plane and doesn't know how long he'll be back again in the eye-popping actioner MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE-ROGUE NATION.\r\nCruise\u2019s Agent Ethan Hunt is leaving on a jet plane and doesn\u2019t know how long he\u2019ll be back again in the eye-popping actioner MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE-ROGUE NATION.\r\nOne cannot say enough about the ponderous yet action-packed \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019 as this exceedingly spry and hyperactive spy caper keeps one on their anxious feet while never letting up for a gasp of air. The exotic locales, showy opera houses, heart-pounding action sequences, innovative chase scenes on wheels, over-the-top baddies, well-choreographed fist fights and, of course, Cruise\u2019s roguish Hunt and his willingness to soak up the mischievousness and mayhem of the proceedings allows this particular \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 installment to resonate so soundly in its off-kilter, energetic greatness. The supporting players such as Simon Pegg\u2019s Benji and Ving Rhames\u2019s Luther are on hand to contribute to the landscape of the triumphant cloak-and-dagger goings-on. In particular, Rebecca Ferguson is the transfixing tart whose presence as Cruise\u2019s enigmatic female lead is easily a scene stealer. Can she be trusted or not? Who cares? In the long run, Ferguson\u2019s inclusion is almost mandatory just to spice up this first-rate popcorn pleaser a tad bit more. Tom Hollander (\u2018In the Loop\u2019) adds some flavor in the mix as the unpredictable British Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nMcQuarrie (who worked with Cruise previously on \u2018Jack Reacher\u2019 and helmed \u2018The Way Of The Gun\u2019) had a tough act to follow in terms of trying to keep stride with prior \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 big names in auteurs Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams and Brad Bird. Indeed, that is a tall order to fill. However, as the Oscar-winner screenwriter for \u2018The Usual Suspects\u2019 McQuarrie has shown that his take on the fifth edition of the \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 film franchise with \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019 can easily be as defiant and defining as any of his predecessors\u2019 intense, eye-popping outings.\r\n\r\n\u2018Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation\u2019, with its lavish set pieces and sophisticated sense of winding and grinding with the twitchy antics of Cruise leading the pack, is perhaps the closest thing to resembling the elegance and excellence of the indomitable Agent 007.\r\n\r\nMission: Impossible-Rogue Nation (2015)\r\n\r\nParamount Pictures\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 12 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, Ving Rhames, Sean Harris, Rebecca Ferguson, Tom Hollander, Simon McBurney and Zang Jingchu\r\n\r\nDirected and Written by: Christopher McQuarrie\r\n\r\nRating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Spy Thriller\/Action-Adventure\/Intrigue and Espionage\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s Rating: *** 1\/2 stars (out of 4 stars)","id":"56207f7092514171d4006ad6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56207f7092514171d4006ad6","movie_id":177677}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"So after all that, I\u2019m pretty convinced that the _Mission: Impossible_ series just isn\u2019t for me.

There\u2019s actually a lot of parallels between those two lines of movies. \r\n\r\nPertaining specifically to _Mission: Impossible_ though, this one truly is the best of the bunch in my opinion. It has it\u2019s most complete female role to date, in fact, you could say that of any character. This is the first film that doesn\u2019t feel like it entirely hinges on Ethan Hunt\u2019s input.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Greta in woodland!**\r\n\r\nThis is a short Aussie film, kind of inspired by 'Alice in Wonderland', but originally based on the stage play of the same name. A teen comedy set in the 70s and revolved around a birthday party. So, newly moved into the town, Greta, finds hard to make friends, except a boy. Entering 15th, her family wants to throw a big birthday party inviting her new schoolmates, against her will. On the occasion, something goes wrong and the next minute, she's in a strange place with strange events and people. Her adventure begins to return home and the party she had left behind in halfway which revealed in the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nI thought it was a children's and family film, but some of the references like relating to sex was a bold move. Though nothing was serious, if you are not considering the matter to the deep. It was just like any teen film, a simple topic. Creatively enough, but not impressive enough film. Those 70s were the plus point, especially for a comedy, that timeline is always so funny.\r\n\r\nDecent performances and filmmaking, should have been improvised the screenplay. But my guess is the budget. It is a small cost film, but if they had better financing, surely they would have pulled it off so much better than this.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> The adventures of the family of scientists.\r\n\r\nAs a film fanatic who grew up watching lots of 2D animations, I'm very happy to see they're still alive in other parts of the world after Hollywood abandoned them for 3D animations. Especially when it comes to this kind of animation, obviously the France produced some extraordinary films in the recent years such as 'Ernest & Celestine', 'A Cat in Paris', 'Zarafa' et cetera. This is an internationally produced film in the French language, but available in the English language too, which was based on the graphic novel by the French cartoonist Jacque Tardi.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a young girl Avril that takes place in the 1940s, Paris. But it all begins many decades earlier that reveals how a family of three generations were pursued by the powerful men. It is the parallel universe story, especially when it comes to the technology, the world is underdeveloped and is in the steam age. This film is about the science and invention where Avril's parents, grandparents were on the verge to invent an ultimate serum. Now those bad guys are after Avril and her cat, Darwin. So before they catch her, she must find her family members if they had survived the crash a decade ago to put an end to all the surrounding mysteries.\r\n\r\nUsually Europe means fairy tales with magic stuffs, but this is an sci-fi-adventure. Feels like watching a Japanese anime. Excellent story, the brilliantly developed characters with lots of suspense and thriller, so I don't think it makes sense to call it a comedy or children's film. Definitely for all ages, the film has a bit of everything to please the people from different generations. The sketches were another highlight, very catchy with the low bright colours. Directed by the two new directors, but their's experience is the fine result of this film.\r\n\r\n\"Cats don't dance. And they don't talk! So be quiet.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful world with the twin Eiffel towers, a bridge in the English channel kind of stuffs, yet it suffers from all types of severe pollutions. The global warming is the hot topic right now, but this film sets in 65 years earlier. So it comes in the line of 'Boy and the World', but all the focus was turned towards the family of scientists and their adventures than to press harder on the important issue. But throughout the narration, it is quite clear the world was affected by without the proper scientific progression and adaptation to save it. Avril might be the centre of the story, but the film character distributed widely and theirs story were well preserved to keep the excitement and pace steady till the end. So be prepared for some unexpected, because it's very matured yet a light humorous film.\r\n\r\nThe title might give an expression of a clich\u00e9, so if you expect a fantasy tale, then you're in the wrong place. But I'm surprised for how unique it was from other sci-fi films. Especially somewhat resembles 'Les Mis\u00e9rables' and some others, yet quite refreshing with all the twist and turns. When the actual story ends, there's an extended scene which makes us to dream for a sequel to come. But it all ended here, so a follow-up is very unlikely. Apart from the story, the technical brilliance was like par with the Animes, especially it reminds Miyazaki's films. These directors must keep doing films like this and who knows they may become the French versions of Tomm Moore.\r\n\r\nOne of the best animations of the years. A sci-fi which is not a dystopian theme. I said that because that's what very common in the current films. Instead, it is a mid 20th century story and totally an entertaining film with the breathtaking visuals. The story wise, it is nothing less than any similar live-action themes. It should have been very popular by now, but it is not and the reason is it is not a Hollywood. That's really very sad, but if you are an international film fan then you should give it a try and animation fans must not skip it. Like I said you won't often get a film matured, at a time funny as this one where adults and children can sit together.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"57c8b818c3a3685bfc000bea","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c8b818c3a3685bfc000bea","movie_id":340357}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A 40 year old letter and the road to redemption.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the director proved the script is very important to a film's success. He wrote it, basically he's a screenplay writer who had written many great stuffs and this film is his first directional venture. He excelled it by picking the right stuffs for the project. As the great actors on-board, it was shot in the fine locations and the music was wonderful. It should have been a dream coming true for him, for a great project to work with.\r\n\r\nThe dialogues were so brilliant like the poems. I'm sure you won't end watching it without having fun because there were many small-small jokes attached everywhere. It was inspired by the real story of a person, but I think they have made some changes for a cinematic translation, hence it is not a biopic.\r\n\r\nMainly it revolves around 4-5 characters and the cast were amazing in their respective roles. Especially the Al Pacino, without him this film would have not been this much exciting. If you're an his ardent fan, you will going love this from your heart and others as well find it a beautiful drama-music. He was nominated for Golden Globe Awards for his excellent title role display. A very appropriate film for him for his age.\r\n\r\nYou know in this era, film fans are looking for what superhero film is going to hit the screen, a heartwarming film like this is what makes them realise still there's a hope for small scale films. Only if they're a welcoming type. Especially for the yesteryears actor who are physically can't compete with the young generation actors, films like this is a breather.\r\n\r\nThis is a tale of an aging star singer who one day discovers a letter written for him by an another great singer of his generation when he was yet to taste the success. 40 years later, that mean now he decides to quit his music tour and begin to trace his family for the unfinished business. So the remaining narration reveals lots of inspiring and heartbreaking events. \r\n\r\n> \"If I am going to find any kind of redemption, I can't waste any more time.\"\r\n\r\nLife as a singer, especially being old and seeking redemption won't quite end as expected. Over the 40 years of addiction to drugs, booze and women, a self-discovery sail begins. In an unpredictable world, anything might happen and so this man's journey tells the impact on the family he's going to meet. It is not just about facing the one who he had abandoned long ago and now trying to fix it, but in reality, life is not easy, especially family means lots of commitment and choosing the best for it should be priority where this film opts that root to reveal a story.\r\n\r\nIt is almost a good family film, but for the theme the drug parts were essential, so that changed its rating. The sub-plots like how he tries to win a date add more on the romance side of the tale. Kind of predictable because of the heartwarming drama, but differences were made from the twists in the narration. Not of that breathtaking kind, just developed to have a fresh aspect an the well known theme. Especially the ending was so simple yet very cool.\r\n\r\nAs usual Bobby Cannavale was in a supporting role, but it was kind of different. He shined like a star, he appeared in a well noticeable character than ever. Along with Jennifer Garner, his performance in the film covered an important portion. So it is not just Al Pacino, these guys as well deserves to be appreciated for their contribution. A film that kind of resembles the recent 'Ricki and the Flash', except it was a male version. A product like this hard to come by, so consider to check it out. That means I'm recommending it.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"577aaf2dc3a368204f001715","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/577aaf2dc3a368204f001715","movie_id":256924}
{"author":"phoenyx2509","content":"If you're looking for to watch a Tamil movie that's a little off beat, a little different from the usual hero-heroine-villain-revenge-save girl-save day kinda story, Darling is just right! A one of a kind Tamil movie indeed. I don't think \"Horror Comedies\" existed in Tamil Cinema until darling came along. There may have been, but wouldn't have been as good. The only trouble I had at first was no subtitles. Luckily Herotalkies.com legally released it with subtitles on their website in 1080p a couple weeks later. \r\n\r\nThe best scenes were the one with Ghost Gopal Varma. Unending jokes with Kalidas's ridiculousness. Although being his first attempt at acting, G.V Prakash was actually able to pull it off, and did a pretty damn good job working on his expressions. Acting aside, the music is pretty commendable too. And Skype exorcism - wow! Now THAT's \"new\".\r\n\r\nMost would say the movie isn't that great, but I feel the movie deserves a pat on the back and a \"Well done\".","id":"54edd3ad925141796e003ed5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54edd3ad925141796e003ed5","movie_id":318941}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Step-dad versus stepped-in dad.\r\n\r\nIn the past for an action movie, Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg came together and now for a comedy, once again the unusual combo returned. Surprisingly the movie was more hilarious than what I thought after listening to those who saw it already. Being a comedian, Will Ferrell was as usual awesome, but Wahlberg contribution had an equally advantageous.\r\n\r\nThe story was a one liner, but individual comedy scenes made an impact for its grand scale success. Generally, the scenes from the comedy films are easy to predict, so in this I felt similarly, but in the many parts it kept turning in another direction. Tried its best to avoid cliches, but we know that's impossible. Either way, it carried out some decent laughs.\r\n\r\nThe movie was all about the dad versus the step-dad. When a man thinks he's finally getting along with his step-kids, then comes their real dad who threatens to take aback his wife and children. So they go head-to-head and followed by a chain of life changing events comes a suitable conclusion. But there's a loop in the end, so possibly we can expect a sequel. Knowing it was not the best comedy of the year, I was not upset either for overall movie. I can even suggest it if you are looking for a simple entertainment.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"56f3ed669251411a97002aa9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56f3ed669251411a97002aa9","movie_id":274167}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"If there is something Tamil cinema can be proud of in recent times, it is how directors have cracked the code to making horror films that do not just scare but also make you laugh. Hollywood has had horror comedies for a long time but here, it is heartening to see our directors adapting the must-haves of the genre to our culture and lifestyle so that we are emotionally invested in the films. \r\n\r\nDarling is actually a remake of the Telugu film, Prema Katha Chitram, but debutant director Sam Anton ensures that it works very well in this setting as well. Three youngsters, Kathir (GV Prakash), Nisha (Nikki Galrani) and Kumar (Balasaravanan), go to a beach house with the intention of committing suicide and they are joined by Athisayaraj (Karunaas), one more individual who wants to take away his life. The twist here is that Nisha and Kumaran actually have planned the whole thing to make Kathir give up his plans of killing himself. Nisha actually is in love Kathir and is hoping that he falls in love with her. However, the ghost in the place starts possessing her every time Kathir tries to get close to her. Why it does so and what it wants is the mystery. \r\n\r\nThe closest comparison to Darling would be last year's Yaamirukka Bayamey. As in that film, the ghost here terrifies the other characters but there is no mortal threat. Also, here too, it is the supporting characters who do the heavy-lifting, while the leads largely play it straight. The only misstep here is that while that film managed to keep the ghost's back story light-hearted to go with the tone of the film, this one gives us a serious flashback that somewhat makes us feel guilty for having laughed so much. The Gang rape and slit throats make for queasy viewing. The flashback episodes involving Kathir and Nisha, too, could have been shorter. \r\n\r\nWhile GV Prakash and Nikki Galrani make confident debuts, the film belongs to Balasaravanan and Karunaas. As he did in Thirudan Police, Balasaravanan comes up with witty repartees that crack us up while Karunaas makes a welcome return in a role that plays to his strength; his character acts as if he is in command of the situation and often ends up at the receiving end of the ghost's anger. Then, there is Rajendran, who, too, continues from where he left off in Thirudan Police. Here, he plays Ghost Gopal Varma, an exorcist-type character and the visual gag where he is shown as the Ghost Rider as he makes his entry is inspired. His bald head, thin figure and sandpapery voice make him effective for both villainous and comical roles but from the screams and whistles that his character gets, it is clear that he has made much more impact as a comedian.","id":"55030087c3a3687b69003e41","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55030087c3a3687b69003e41","movie_id":318941}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> When the truth and the consciousness of the world failed to work together.\r\n\r\nBased on the book of the same name, a story about a dreadful massacre in the rural America where a young girl lived to testify against her own brother and then she never recovered from it. So many years later, the case takes a new twist when some young crime solving enthusiastic shows interest in it and that's where the rest of the narration takes its direction.\r\n\r\nThe suspense was the highlight, though, feels like not a complicated puzzle. Brilliant writing for sure. You know, from a novel to screen is not an easy task. Sometimes book fans and sometimes film fanatics will be disappointed, but this was a good film. In my opinion, it was an underrated film. Some people are disappointed, because mainly their anticipation was too high.\r\n\r\nIt was the tall South African beauty, Charlize Theron's show. However the others came into the play when the narration was in the flashback. Since the film 'The Hunt', it is really scaring to see the little kids as the prime witness in a major trial. Because of their lack of the consciousness of the world, the truth struggles. This film was kind of similar, but only the final act resolves everything. Until then, as a viewer it is about trying to link all the possibilities. Surely a fine film for the one watch.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"5787c9da92514131c40010d3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5787c9da92514131c40010d3","movie_id":182560}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The clash of culture and modern lifestyle.\r\n\r\nThis is a Turkish film with the Turkish cast and crew, but financially co-supported by France. So it was nominated for the 88th American Academy Awards to represent France, after the Turkish film board denied to pick it. The film is set in the rural that tells a story of five young orphaned sisters who were raised by their stereotype grandmother and strict uncle. It depicts how those girls grow up without the parental supervise which is more essential than under others care and challenges they face due to difference between modern lifestyle they want to adopt and old traditions they inherited.\r\n\r\nI know everybody comparing it with 'The Virgin Suicides' and so I thought the same because that's what everyone thinks who had watched these two films. There are some similarities between these two titles, but not the same film, that's very clear. Because of the cultural difference they slightly drew a different storyline, other than that the core of the story remained same. Written and directed by a woman filmmaker, so the narrative was very good that details the issues surrounding women. Especially about the impact of the lives when people nose into others affair.\r\n\r\nIt opens when the five sisters were punished by their grandmother after the report came from their neighbour lady for them playing on the beach with the boys. Thereafter their life changes and day by day their happiness declines for the severely imposed rules against them in the house. Later, one after another, they all forced to marry the groom they have chosen for them in a traditional way. But the youngest among them all is the most rebellious, so when her sisters were enforced, she plans to fight back and that's the remaining story that tells what happens with the remaining sisters.\r\n\r\n> \"I don't care about the match, I want to get the hell out.\"\r\n\r\nThey say Turkey is more a Europe than the middle-east, except being an Islam nation. But this film briefs the domestic abuse in the name of culture and religion on the young generation. The truth is, there is an upcoming culture of the future among the youngsters of the human earthlings in the line of one planet, one culture. That is nothing, but getting themselves free from the thousands of years old rules. Obviously, in this advanced science and digital world, they're completely outdated, especially islam is struggling to cooperate with the future world. From that perspective, this film narrated a wonderful, an eye opening tale.\r\n\r\nI have heard the Turkish origins who had watched the film arguing about what it depicted is not true. I know that they know better than me on this, but what I want to tell is that any nation and its people go through this kind of cultural struggle\/revolution. Especially in the remote places who are cut off from the modern lifestyle in their daily routine, and when the chief of the house is an elder person who is very conservative. Whatever the advanced country is Turkey among other islam countries, there's still the gender equality issue's persist due to the religion. Of course not the whole nation, but among the orthodox families. That's the same fate of other nations and its religion as well that has to change.\r\n\r\nI have seen many Turkish films and this was very different from those, especially it digs on the positive and negative impacts of the old cultural practice which questions is it really necessary to carry on in this modern world? I am not a religious person, and I have no problem with the people of faith, but my take on this might really irk them. The elders should give chance to choose what their youngsters want, of course with supervised, instead forcing them to do everything in the old way what they and their parents did decades and centuries ago.\r\n\r\nYep, the film deserved it's Oscars nominee, but it did not win the prestigious award and that's okay because a better film bagged it. This director is going to have a great future in the filmdom, like the next Sofia Coppola. I hope her next work would be an international project. In the meantime, if you haven't seen it, give it a try, it is a good film that briefs in the line between the past and the future, there is present that ever exist where everything happens like the pains of the past, the present revolution and the future plan.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"573762d59251411518000d19","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/573762d59251411518000d19","movie_id":336804}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Far from the home, but the trouble's not over.**\r\n\r\nThe renowned French filmmaker, Jacques Audiard back with this new sensational film. This time he has chosen to tell us the story of a Sri Lankan Tamil Eelam freedom fighter who had fled to France after the war, followed by his struggles in the new place. The entire film was in Tamil language, but there some French dialogues too. I have been waiting for this, even after I got many opportunities, I had postponed them for some reasons. Finally, I'm very happy for not just got over it, but for the film that has powerful contents to give a peek into the immigrant's lifestyle, I mean not in a pleasant way.\r\n\r\nRight now it is a huge issue around the world to curb the immigration, especially the illegal ones. But some reasons are really heartbreaking, like in the film 'The Good Lie'. Usually the people like in this story are not welcomed, so they have to lay low and swallow all the troubles they bump into. Sometime the events reflect what happened back in the homeland. In a such way this tale takes place where a civil war fighter, Dheepan, from Lanka lands in France with his fake family of a wife and a daughter named Yalini and Ilayaal respectively.\r\n\r\nIn order to forget the past, he tries his best to start over a new life. Since he did not come wealth, he had to adapt whatever life offered to survive and to protect his family. Knowing living on the edge of the fire, they were left alone, but how long, because the fire flame always catches the vulnerable objects around it. So what comes later is the finale with a twist and to follow the end credits.\r\n\r\nI have seen many films about what this film was focused on, but this was somewhat different, mainly because of people from the culture of less known geographical area. I can understand Tamil, but I found hard to get this Sri Lankan Tamil lines. There were films about Sri Lankan refugees, those films like 'Nandha', 'Kannathil Muthamittal' are different kinds. Maybe this is the first western film to dig on Lankan Eelam topic, especially after the end of civil war and far away from the home. Though it does not take a side, except opening scene, the rest of the film is set in France.\r\n\r\n> \"Sometimes, they say things and laugh. I understand all the word, but they don't sound funny\"\r\n\r\nThey have got a simple storyline, but developed to its best. The progression becomes stronger, particularly when it reaches the final stage. I think the filmmakers did a good research, especially the cultural differences to highlight. That's the most of the film concentrated to only on the one perspective, but the threats what people like them face was also brought into the narration. Like caught between the two worlds and culture, and to defend themselves, to do what has to be done.\r\n\r\nVery realistic approach, but the question is do the things like this happen in real, especially in France? If you like Jacques Audiard films, then you should not miss it at all. These main actors are kind of new in front of the camera and they were amazing. Technically as well the film sounds good, but as I had heard, the filmmakers were hurried to finish it off when the Cannes Film Festival was around the corner. I think they have managed everything properly, and you would too appreciate the effort once you watch it.\r\n\r\nIt went to numerous film festivals and won some awards that includes Palme d'Or at Cannes. Kind of must see by the director's fans, even if you are not a fan, it is still worth a watch. Because you won't get another this or seen before. Even if you did, the cast wasn't the familiar one. That's the big difference here. The film has a message like, what one must be doing in his second chance of life. There are violences, feels strong, though the effects are raw, not the events or the scenes. Definitely not a masterpiece, but still I would recommend it for the adults.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"58446ce8c3a36844df00d38a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58446ce8c3a36844df00d38a","movie_id":314402}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The famous English detective at his old age.\r\n\r\nIan McKellen as Sherlock Holmes, totally loved it. Directed by an Oscar winning filmmaker, the film was based on the novel 'A Slight Trick of the Mind'. It focused the long retired Sherlock Holmes, who now lives in the English countryside where he meets a boy. He tries to recall one of his old cases, but struggles as he's very old to remember. So with the help of the boy, he undertakes to correct the book version of the story and besides, they together establish beekeeping as a hobby.\r\n\r\nIt was not that great, though an enjoyable small drama. Having a greatest detective character in it, you just can't expect a boring regular drama of the life. The narration had a multiple layer, in each how much Mr. Holmes dedicates himself to solves the case was nicely told. And of course, all of them had its own twist. After all, that's what everybody seeks from a film with Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\nI'm sure you would have seen several films and\/or series based on this character, but this film was something unique and only one kind, except if there's a sequel planned for this. Some people might be disappointed in this for being somewhat simple, but for a 93 year old man this storyline looked very appropriate and Ian did a fantastic job. I anticipated someone young actor for those flashback parts, but in the end, I'm happy that it was a one man show as it should be. It is a must see for his fans.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"57951d4cc3a3681f31003f91","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57951d4cc3a3681f31003f91","movie_id":280996}

We\u2019ve seen the concept before (think \u201cTrue Romance\u201d meets \u201cGrosse Point Blank\u201c), but the idea has never been as messy, sloppy and as ill conceived as it is here.\r\n\r\nUnlucky in love Martha (Anna Kendrick) has her world turned upside down when she meets and falls for gun for hire Francis (Sam Rockwell). Their love story blossoms over killings, knives and gun battles. The script, written by Max Landis of \u201cAmerican Ultra\u201d fame, is just too flimsy to work. I expected more from the writer.\r\n\r\nTim Roth and RZA turn in enjoyable supporting performances, but the two leads lend the most starpower. The film features the onscreen pairing of my dreams with Kendrick and Rockwell. The two have an undeniable chemistry, but both actors are completely wasted with this mess. I really, really hope to see them work together in the future in a good movie \u2014 they both deserve a far better vehicle than this.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Right\u201d is a fun idea that\u2019s poorly executed.\r\n\r\nMATT SAYS:\r\n\r\nIn \u201cMr. Right,\u201d Martha (Anna Kendrick) has recently broken up with her boyfriend after she discovers him cheating on her. A chance encounter in a convenience store leads her to start dating an unnamed hitman (Sam Rockwell).\r\n\r\nIf those two names \u2014 Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick \u2014 are all you need to hear to decide you want to see this movie, read no further. If you want to see the two of them play off of one another, this will be a meal that is mostly satisfying for you, but leaves you just a little bit hungry for something with more substance. There are probably vehicles that would have worked better for the two of them, but basically, it\u2019s enjoyable enough as a choice for a movie night at home.\r\n\r\nThe highlights: Sam Rockwell\u2019s dancing and dry delivery and the way that Anna Kendrick\u2019s millennial-angsty, world-weary-but-optimistic character plays off of him. Tim Roth\u2019s nameless soldier-of-fortune with inscrutable motivations. The rent-a-thug Steve (The RZA), who is nothing if not pragmatic. The lowlights: a terrible script that tries too hard to shoehorn a hardcore action plot into a film that works well enough without it. It\u2019s readily apparent why this movie didn\u2019t get a wider theatrical release.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed seeing it, but ask me a month from now and I\u2019ll barely remember it.\r\n\r\n**A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com**","id":"579cfc28c3a3683838000d99","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/579cfc28c3a3683838000d99","movie_id":333385}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A hitman with the 'killing is wrong' attitude.\r\n\r\nSomething is not right for 'Mr, Right'. It is not an event based action-comedy or something like man meets woman romance-comedy, but very random presentation. Where it begins and where it ends, you can't clearly say it is a well written script. The actings were decent, but the scenes aren't overwhelmingly impressive as it should be. Directed by 'Neon Flesh' famed filmmaker, after that film his other projects weren't up to the standards including this one.\r\n\r\nIt is written by the one who was behind the 'American Ultra'. There's a strikingly similar between these two and you won't deny if you had seen them. Especially Anna Kendrick's character to what the Jesse Eisenberg was in that film. If we go deep, Sam Rockwell as well might fall into the same category to what Kristen Stewart was. At some point, one of the film characters mentions the same secret project. So I think it is the same universe and a spin-off.\r\n\r\nSam-Kendrick combo was the highlight of the film. I hope they would do some serious subject together in the near future. The action sequences were good, other than that it's not funny at all or romantic. That means I did not enjoy it because the theme did not work for me which I felt very common these days. So it failed because of the lack of innovation and proper development, but the overall film was not bad if entertainment is the main agenda. I know there are audience for it and they will back it. I won't stand between you and your watch if you want to try it, I just say be careful, that's all.\r\n\r\n5\/10","id":"577aa59992514174bb001109","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/577aa59992514174bb001109","movie_id":333385}

But then even if they were this movie would still be flawed because it doesn't have a whole lot to offer on any level and the oversimplified look on racism is more than often cringeworthy.","id":"58f3716d9251413d72011a43","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58f3716d9251413d72011a43","movie_id":356301}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Brussels' an underworld love story.\r\n\r\nIt is a Belgian version of the film adaptation of William Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet'. But it is modernised and gangsterised crime-drama-romance. Sets in the present Brussels about the two black rivalry gangs, their dispute heats up further after discovering one of the members from each gang has fallen in love. In a result an ultimate gang fight undertakes and what comes after that is we all know it.\r\n\r\nThis is the most harsh version of the most beautiful romance tale. I meant not violently, though there are many fight sequences, but sexual contents were too strong. If you are a fan of the original work, then you might dislike the film. Because the portrayal of Juliet was so unpleasant which is realistic to the real underworld. But if you are a welcoming type, for the updated classical stories, then you will appreciate the effort. Yet it is more a gangster film than the romance. That's why the title is very simple that does not reveal about the influence of 'Romeo and Juliet', unless you read it somewhere else like the film's synopsis and trivia or the reviews.\r\n\r\nExcept it sets in the Belgian capital city, the actors, the directors all are not what I expected. I mean it does not give the Dutch\/Flemish atmosphere, but like it happens in the middle-east. Since the focus was on the underworld gangs, all the film characters were African immigrants of mostly first and second generation, but the two different regional races, the Moroccans and the black Africans. The first half was not good as I hoped for, but got better after the most waited romance parts were emerged.\r\n\r\n> \"You were born here, but you're still different.\r\n> You will always be a foreigner.\"\r\n\r\nI did not get the 'Romeo and Juliet' vibe for this film, because it was not actually a revised version, but it roughly borrowed the original plot and nothing much. So you shouldn't anticipate like the story you have known to appear in this film's scenes. From all this, one thing you have to keep in mind before choosing it to watch is that it is not a family or the children friendly film, especially not a date movie.\r\n\r\nI did not dislike it, but it should have been even better than the overall product. The actors were good and the production quality was much better. The story wise, this film holds no secrets or the twist, because we all know how it begins and ends, but the screen presentation was different with altered scenes and the characters including the locations. So there's more to talk about the filmmaking than the story, except how different it is compared to the Shakespeare's original narrative.\r\n\r\nThis film is one of those where I wanted to like it and rate it better, but I can't for some reasons. The original was a love tragedy that connected with two feuded families, but this film became an ethnic issue that is not welcomed for the present world's condition. For the art of filmmaking, it was a fine piece of work and for the entertainment's sake, it is under acceptable limit, but for the morality what a film teaches these days' youngsters is a mislead.\r\n\r\nAll the above, realism wins, because it looks like inspired by the real gang rivalries around the Brussels. To come to end on this kind of opinion only after I saw the film's end report that came before the credits. So it is a good film, well, mostly decent, that's what I think, but opinions differ from person to person. I am not suggesting it, but you may try it to learn what's yours.

God help us all. \r\n\r\nBlack Mass is the story of Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp), who was the brother of a state senator and the infamous violent leader of South Boston's Winter Hill Gang. It charts his criminal activities and his subsequent dealings with the FBI.\r\n\r\nDirected by Scott Cooper, Black Mass is one of those instances where a great lead performance deserves a better over all film. Depp literally inhabits the role of Bulger in a fully formed perf that reminds us of what a fine actor he can be. Unfortunately the edgy material to hand never really ignites in filmic form. Maybe we were spoilt by the offerings of Coppola and Scorsese previously? For this comes off as a cheap imitation of far greater films, with the crafters of the pic giving us something of a caricature piece.\r\n\r\nAlthough compelling as a lead character study, much of the narrative is rendered as playing it safe, putting emotive heart where it doesn't belong. Most of the support characters, and key to the story, are under developed, while the pace is decidedly attention sapping and not adroitly understated. Nevertheless, we do get good acting perfs to support Depp, notably Joel Edgerton as corrupt FBI agent John Connolly, while Masanobu Takayanagi's (Hostiles) cinematography is delicate of moody hues.\r\n\r\nThere's a fascinating story trying to get out of this, but the 15 year wait to get it to screen hasn't been worth it. There's some truly electric scenes, but they are few and far between, which gives us ultimately just a compact and safe piece of gangster film making. 5\/10","id":"5d7cd9c6069f0e147035b77b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d7cd9c6069f0e147035b77b","movie_id":261023}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**When a bunch of lazy office employees fate changed.**\r\n\r\nI watched this because it sounded like another 'Midnight Son'. But I did not find anything like that, in fact, I'm disappointed. It is a B movie and showing our displeasure is definitely not worth. Because I went for it knowing what kind of film it is, so expecting a miracle was a foolishness. Honestly, I enjoyed watching this film, but did not like. Though the effort, including the production quality and performances were laudable.\r\n\r\nI don't know many of these actors, that's how a film like this works, but they did their best. The entire film was shot inside an office. The tale takes place nearly two or maybe three days, but the narration stayed in the office and built a story out of it. It is the story of a bunch of lazy office employees who always plays games in their computer placing bets. But when their new manager arrives, he demands a good result for the company to grow. So overloaded with works, employees begin to act strangely, but couple of them comes to know the reason and decides to fight against it.\r\n\r\nI think some people would like it, but to find out you are one of those, you have to take a chance on this. The film had potential, but was not fully utilised to make it a classic like you say the one I mentioned in the very first line. Particularly the last few minutes were submerged with the usual horror-comedy stuffs, so boring. If it were clever in some parts, I would have personally recommended it. Overall a better screenplay would have saved the film, but believe me, still it is the worst film of the 2015 I have seen.\r\n\r\n_4\/10_","id":"57f41103925141398a0003ed","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57f41103925141398a0003ed","movie_id":317981}

At first, it was casual, but after observing her closely, she offers help in any way possible. That's when all the trouble comes out and the remaining film is to reveal how the tale concludes.\r\n\r\nFor a small film like this, including its short runtime, this film does not look boring. I said that because of the concept that you might feel familiar. There are twists and turns, yet most of the film is predictable, but not bad for watching it once. The cast, particularly Jessica Biel looked good, but the other woman contributed in the performance section. Started off like a drama, but ends with thriller. The film is not for everyone.

Note: there is no part 1 or 2 to this \"series\" though those movies are recapped in the beginning of this movie. And that is part of the joke that is this movie. It's played as if its a once lost VCR tape of a \"Midnight Morning Movie\" played on late night TV in the 80s. There's even a few commercial breaks when whoever \"recorded\" the show forgot to stop recording during the break... (PIZZA GOBLIN!!! Cheddar goblin?)\r\n\r\nI really liked this one. Looking through the cast\/crew it looks like this was a first effort for most which is pretty surprising, especially given some of the cameos. I'm really looking forward to whatever they come up with next.\r\n\r\nNote though that this was really hit or miss with our group. Most of us either thought it was okay or really liked it but I know at least one guy hated it (his opinion: too dumb, too long). Most of us laughed though.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Adhibar is an exercise in mediocrity that seems to be intended mainly as a feature-length branding exercise for its producer T Sivakumar. He is credited for the story of the film. He also plays a character who helps the hero and is introduced with a lot of build-up (the feet-first introduction reserved for a mass hero). And to top all this, there is a very blatant in-film advertisement for the producer's business venture.\r\n\r\nWe are told that the story is based on a real-life incident that happened in Sri Lanka, but there is so much randomness in the movie that we start wondering if real life can be this random. Characters behave in the most implausible manner and take instant decisions that no sane person in real life might take. We first see the hero, Shiva (Jeevan, who seems so uninvolved), in Canada, but he decides to come to India just because his mother tells him not to get into altercations there. He decides to start a real-estate firm here. He just starts to trust a lawyer, Eswaran (Ranjith, with a fake beard that is phonier than his character), who, he is told, is a noble man. He never even thinks twice when this lawyer is shown consorting with girls half his age with a drink in hand and has a brother who is a rowdy (Richard). Perhaps, he has never seen any Tamil film. An even more ridiculous moment happens when he immediately accepts a gangster (Nandaa, in a thankless role) as his friend just because the guy tells him he has reformed! Naturally, he is cheated and is sent to prison for connections with The Iyakkam (the film's way of referring to the LTTE) and it is only thanks to two people that he gets his life back on road \u2014 a straightforward CBI officer (T Sivakumar) and his prison inmate (the normally dependent Samuthirakani who seems to have been included just so his face might attract an unwitting person into the theatre).\r\n\r\nAnd there are supporting characters \u2014 the heroine, Suganthi (Vidhya), who is even more gullible than Shiva, her dad (Singamuthu), who believes a constable to be a high-ranking CBI officer, Shiva's uncle (the almost omnipresent Thambi Ramaiah) whose son calls him 'vada, poda' and breaks into a lecture on how parents should treat kids. There is also Kovai Sarala somewhere in this mix, as Shiva's employee who tries to cheat Suganthi. The only thing that these characters actually do is bore us to death with their irritating attempts at comedy. By the time the film ends, we feel we have woken up from a nightmare that never seemed to end.","id":"55e7bd1c9251413e35000d17","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55e7bd1c9251413e35000d17","movie_id":356517}

When shady Roman leader Tiberius (Adrien Brody) arrives with an army of 100,000, the other two groups team-up against them.\r\n\r\nSupposedly inspired by real-life events, \"Dragon Blade\" (2015) is a Chinese action\/adventure that cost $65 million and looks it. The film is top-of-the-line as far as production quality goes (score, cast, costumes, sets, quick editing, locations, etc.). Chan is entertaining as usual while Cusack and Brody surprisingly tower in their roles (I say \u201csurprisingly\u201d because I wouldn\u2019t have imagined them cutting it as Roman commanders in the ancient past). The tone is serious with goofy quick-edited action and a modest amount of humor that\u2019s actually funny.\r\n\r\nIf you happened upon any 2-3 minutes of this film you\u2019d automatically think that it was a very worthy adventure flick. Unfortunately, it\u2019s too manic for its own good. I tried to adapt to its hyper tone and did so until just past the halfway mark when the overkill action style pretty much lost me. I endured to the end, but it was difficult. It seriously needed to slow down and cultivate depth (but at least it tries to at times). \r\n\r\n\u201cDragon Blade\u201d lacks the confident poise of the excellent \u201cMongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan\u201d (2007) and instead shoots for overKILL.

{"author":"Rakesh sharma","content":"Director Chandraprakash Dwivedi beautifully recreates the Mohalla Assi in this religious\/political satire based the novel Kashi Ka Assi. The neighborhood of Assi itself is the protagonist of this movie. The identity of Assi is not just defined by the fact that it is ghat along the holy river, rather it is the also the people who live in that locality. People participate in daily \"parliamentary discussions\" on the changing society and importance of culture at the only place in Varanasi that has democracy, Pappu's tea shop. The characters in the tea shop look straight out of a satire novel in Hindi. The conversations at this shop tie the whole script together and take the story forward. What makes it worth watching is the context that is set around it. It also tries to depict the impact that major religion- based political events had on the people of the society. The humor is very intelligent and contextual, since it is a satire.\r\n\r\nThe story of the movie was a simple one, where a diligent and honest priest struggles to make ends meet, whereas other half baked gurus dupe the tourists to mint money and lead a comfortable life. It shows how westerners come to the city in search of spirituality and have no clue about what they want. How the city in its own corrupt ways connives to thug them, thereby destroying the moral fabric of it's culture one bit at a time. Ravi Kishan and other supporting characters deliver a wonderful performance as the whole locality revolves around these tourists.\r\n\r\nSunny Deol as the righteous priest beautifully projects the perplexities that the character goes through as he comes to term with the practical challenges of life. However, it is Sakshi Tanwar, as his wife, who really delivers a stand out performance, questioning his eccentricities and still standing by him as a pillar of support. Together they go through their struggles, to find a way to live with their values in this world.\r\n\r\nThe film got banned because of the cuss words used in the movie, but as a character says that in the culture of Varanasi, everyone is greeted with \"bhosadi k\" just like they are greeted with \"Har Har Mahadev\".","id":"5bece704c3a36812e000b6dd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bece704c3a36812e000b6dd","movie_id":356399}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Have you ever been to a stand-up comedy show which wasn't uproariously funny but not boring either and instead just pleasant? That is how Moone Moonu Varthai is. There is a plot but it exists mainly for us to hang out with the characters, catch a few moments of their lives, smile \u2014 not laugh, mind you \u2014 at the jokes cracked, and feel good when the movie is over.\r\n\r\nThe film begins with K Bhagyaraj (yes, the real Bhagyaraj) admitted in a hospital for a panic attack and Arjun (Arjun Chidambaram), who is also at the hospital, proposing to narrate a story to him. The director tells him that he will ask him to stop if he finds it uninteresting. Madhumita uses this as a Scheherazade-esque framing device and plays on Kollywood's common perception of Bhagyaraj \u2014 she is going to narrate a story that even the 'master storyteller' will be hooked on to.\r\n\r\nAnd the story is about Arjun, who has lost his parents and has been brought up by his doting grandparents (SPB and Lakshmi striking up an easy-going chemistry). This has also made him a carefree young man who goes to the extent of resigning his job just because his boss did not give him permission to go and watch a CSK match! He is, in short, a guy who has time only for beer and bromance. When his friend, Karna (Venkatesh Harinathan), is asked by his company to resign, the two hatch upon a novel business plan \u2014 to start a bad news delivery service, through which they will act as messengers for conveying unfortunate messages. He also strikes up a relationship with Anjali (Aditi Chengappa), Karna's flatmate. During one of their assigments, they stop a wedding not realizing that the bride is Anjali's sister. The lovers break up and how they get back together forms the plot. \r\n\r\nThis could have become a generic romcom but Madhumita's touch is very light that every development, big and small, is treated in a low-key manner. Even when Arjun and Karna have a fallout, things do not get sentimental and instead, the whole episode is brought to close with a nicely written patch-up scene that is far removed from melodrama. The same goes for the scenes involving Arjun's grandparents (who are named Malini and Krishnan, referencing Vaaranam Aayiram), which feel natural.\r\n\r\nAs for the romance, it follows the regular arc \u2014 a meet cute scene, a romantic moment, a conflict and a resolution \u2014 but is narrated in a breezy manner. The leads aren't exactly terrific but they don't make the moments feel offkey. But the film might prove to be a breakout for Venkatesh Harinathan, the designated 'nanbenda' here. Though he comes across as a motormouth, his is a brand of genteel comedy filled with puns and inoffensive one-liners. Of course, his jokes do not hit the mark all the time and some of them are plain mokkais but when they do click, we marvel at the wit.\r\n\r\nBut the movie isn't for everyone. The plot-obsessed viewers will, in fact, hate very much because there is hardly any 'weight' in the developments. Even the ones who find it entertaining will never love it but simply like it. The scenes have an episodic quality to them (Madhumita even manages to find place for a ghost story, the current rage in Tamil cinema), especially after Arjun and Karna set up their business, and in these segments, it is the supporting actors (MS Bhaskar, Robo Shankar, Harathy) who are put in the spotlight. These episodes have a TV skit vibe to them and might work better when they play in bits and pieces on television. Some scenes are too talky (the initial booze-fuelled ones in particular) that they make us restless. But there is something sweet-natured about the film that makes us ignore these issues.","id":"559768f1c3a36855e3000ae7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/559768f1c3a36855e3000ae7","movie_id":270779}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Man always solely wanted to dominate the world and its other species.\r\n\r\nAs far I remember I've not seen any Chinese or the Hong Kong movies in the past 12 months. So I have heard about this film a lot that it was the China's highest domestic gross movie ever. Since then I have marked it to check it out as much soon as possible and after the watching with a high expectation I'm here right away. I've been watching movies since my childhood, but it became serious after the 'The Two Towers'. So first I'm a fantasy film fan before becoming neutral. But still sometimes I'm very keen on them like I was for this one.\r\n\r\nIn the present era, we've zombies, superheroes, vampires, werewolves, aliens, robots, so on varieties for making a good entertaining flick. But just half a millennium ago when there was no motion-picture, but literature and the stage play, there were only good vs bad, god vs devil, man vs monster and beasts. So the modern creations were sci-fi and the old ones are fantasies. After CGI is becoming very flexible, the filmmakers are on the race to get on-board into one of those genre franchises. So nowadays we are witnessing head-to-head contest between these two genres, but a great treat for the movie fanatics like me.\r\n\r\nThe first impression was the film's posters which were done similar to the traditional Chinese paintings. Second, the decent trailer, I was displeased with the CGI characters in the clips, but watching them in the full flow movie it looked so much better. One of the best visually stunning Mandarin movies. Despite setting a record at the box office, the budget was doubled after the drug controversy over the original lead actor who was later replaced by another and re-shot his portions entirely including special effect were redone.\r\n\r\n> \"Monsters are the most cunning creatures in the world.\r\n> They hide in human skin, dress as human and speak human language!\"\r\n\r\nThe director had a handful experience from working on some Hollywood projects. Literally, it was his first solo, also the first live-shot directional debut movie and he nailed it. Very disappointing when it comes to the story, because it was just a one-liner which is well known since the inception of motion-picture. Set in the ancient period China when the humans and monsters lived together and later went to the war to dominate each other. Drawn a border between the two worlds that brought peace for the centuries until one day some kind of coup happened in the monsters' side. So the confrontation restores after a few monsters hops on the other side with human. How it all will be solved is the remaining action, adventure with lots of fun.\r\n\r\nQuite similar to current European migrant crises. People who flee from the civil war in the middle-east is not welcomed by the few locals which led to some violence in the refugee camps. In this movie as well, without realising they brought the same environmental situation between man and monster.\r\n\r\nOf course it is a children-cum-adult movie, but killing the cute monsters and cooking them, all of them are kind of gave me a sceptical feeling. Besides, it had romance as a sub-plot and Baihe Bai was so cute. Usually movies from this part of the Earth reminds martial arts. Since the director worked in 'Shrek' films, easily noticeable that some contents influenced from the other industries as well. The human skin thing reminded me the MIB and the song Indian films. The comedies are the uplift along the exciting stunts which fought among the live and CGI characters.\r\n\r\nThere are some thing that does not make sense, but in fantasy films those are logical that we can't consider as a flaw. But explanation needs, especially the inspired mythical story from another culture and that is where it quite failed. Overall movie passes the entertainment and quality test, but it is more a family movie and less a youngster's. Definitely a sequel is on the card after the tremendous success, if they fail to bring another movie, it will be their loss. For the foreign audience, especially the western world, it might be an average or an okay movie because of quite familiar with this kind of theme. Anyway, I recommend it for those who enjoy comedy-fantasy films.\r\n\r\n7\u00bd\/10","id":"563a4ef7c3a3681b54023a92","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/563a4ef7c3a3681b54023a92","movie_id":334298}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A quick way to be famous does not go well.**\r\n\r\nIt was based on the children's novel of the same name. Purely a children's film. That's why I find it average. The concept was too silly. Particularly, there are a few scenes that do not make sense to the grownups. Even for hypnotism concept they used in the story. So don't accuse it if you did not enjoy it. Other than that, the direction, actors, settings, musics were nice.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of orphan kids. In the rural England, no one has adopted them yet. Like orphanage kids from other films, this tale was too built with their struggles against the odds. Their caretakers are not so nice to them, especially the chief in charge. The kids too have divided and one of the gang decides to participate in a talent show. When that fails, drastically everything changes since then. In meantime a mystery book lands in one of their hands. With the help of it, an undreamt adventure begins.\r\n\r\nIt should have been a television film. Not because the production quality is poor or something, but the story, how it was narrated fits perfectly for small screen. Otherwise, a series would have been a nice idea. A fictional story, and took place at the corner of the Christmas, as well as released on the same season a couple of year ago. I don't think the second film would make it. But possible as a television feature. Not worth, but watching it with kids could do justice.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"59fe11f4c3a3686844020846","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59fe11f4c3a3686844020846","movie_id":350505}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Like a changing urban landscape, the humans as well!**\r\n\r\nWhen everybody around me liked the director's previous film 'A Touch of Sin', I didn't. As a film fanatic, reject such kind of film is not an easy job without giving a proper reason. I thought that was a missed opportunity. I surely like art films, not the boring one like those aimlessly narrated. I really loved some of the scenes there, but here it was completely different. Most importantly, anybody would understand what the film is trying to say without trying too hard.\r\n\r\nThis is a theme where the China's rise was revealed from the three people's personal life perspective that was categorised to the three generations or the timelines. That's not it, the communism was also highlighted, how it held back the people's freedom. The writer was really smart to smoothly disclosing that to the world. I mean the film never dragged the China's ruling party or its system, but all were told from its character who struggled and if you use your brain, you will get it why.\r\n\r\nThe narration was divided into three episodes. The first one takes place in the year 1999, in a small town somewhere in the China which is economically backward. The story follows a young woman named Tao, who is caught in a love triangle. But for the practical reason, she has to choose one of them and when she does, the other guy leaves the town with the heartbroken. This is the foundation, that dragged for nearly 40 minutes. Obviously slow, but very realistic approach.\r\n\r\nI grew up in the 90s, my country was not much different than what's in this film was shown. So I liked the atmosphere, all those the 90s set, the automobiles, lifestyle, the landscapes of the small towns et cetera taken me back to that time. But the thing is, it was China, society and culturally different. Anyway, it was past and what follows are totally flips the narration, including the perspective.\r\n\r\n> \"You know the hardest thing, about love is caring.\"\r\n\r\nThe second episode takes place in the year 2014, which is something like the present. It reveals what's the status of all the main three characters, like where they're economically standing and the personal life struggles. Tao's married life did not go well and her son is around ten years old who visits her from Shanghai. The one who left the town is now returned and battling for his life for some reason.\r\n\r\nIn the last 15 years, the China significantly changed and still, this entire part is set in the same town which is now economically moved forward. Like the changing urban landscape, how these characters too changed were what focused on this section.\r\n\r\nThen comes the final episode where it is now in the year 2025, that takes place somewhere in the Australia. The perspective was changed, the little boy is now in his 20s, seems lost is root. With his behaviour, you would notice that his lack of knowledge about his ancestors. He who has the differences with his father, decides to make his life as he wanted. That is why the parents should take responsibility to teach their children all the good things about their culture and traditions, and to carry on, it's up to them. Because losing one's identity could lead to the failures in the life.\r\n\r\nThis is the part I liked better. Because it was something like what I encountered in my life. Most of the childhood memories that returns after we're grown-up as the deja vu, like the history repeating itself. Here for pointing out the freedom one to buy a gun was indirectly hit the communism. I mean gun was not a threat, it was just an expressed how it affects people in all the similar circumstances. I meant, what something was hidden brings more eagerness for us to know about it than those are in the out. So forcing something on people is sometime is a bad idea.\r\n\r\nAll the actors were good, but apart from the slow screenplay, I liked the idea of this film. There are some other similar films, like how different generations behave and now this is among them, yet not the best out of all of them. Very much watchable, only if you are capable of handling slow drag. If you know this director very well or the fan of his works, you will find it a pretty interesting film. I won't recommend it, but I also won't either suggest you to skip it.\r\n\r\n_7.5\/10_","id":"5835db049251416d2201a61d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5835db049251416d2201a61d","movie_id":314388}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Every species has their own kingdom and the ruler.\r\n\r\nI thought it was going to set in India and a version of 'Monkey Thieves'. I don't recall it from the trailer I saw 18 moths ago. It's good, because Subcontinent does not mean India only. And I also thought it was about the commonly known in Asia, the Rhesus variety. So this story takes place in the Sri Lankan deep jungle of Polonnaruwa. About a small Toque Macaque kingdom established many generations ago in the rock castle surrounded by the ruined ancient temple.\r\n\r\nDirected by the 'Chimpanzee' filmmakers, yet another stunningly presented primate genus creature that's specifically made for the little children like all the previous Disney Nature films. Narrated by Tina Fey, in many ways I find much better than John C. Reilly for the 'Bears'. I said that because I am an adult male and I found her voice was sexy, especially the dialogue deliverance. Something like when the film characters funnily talk (the human assumption in the human language) to each other to excite our kids and to be a family friendly film.\r\n\r\nThe story follows the young female monkey called Maya. Like the majority of the colony she's a low-born, a lower ranked member under the Raja's rule, the alpha male and three royal sisters. Just like any human character films, this too has all the varieties like romance, drama, emotions, wars, survival, a life journey to rediscover and ultimately a revenge. All the above, the rise of the young generation, taking over from once a supreme leader.\r\n\r\n> \"Together, on the edge of their territory,\r\n> they wash away the city and relish the jungle around them.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever we saw in the film is not what exactly happened, because we can't understand their language and behaviours. But mostly translated and re-adjusting their acts to our understandable terminology. Somewhat it worked, mainly because it rated General. But in reality, it is always a harsh and dangerous environment in the animal world. Because rules are meant to be broken and challenged if you are strong enough to take the opposition. Physical strength is the most essential in the jungle to survive.\r\n\r\nThere will be no trials for the crimes, only on-spot punishment or you can expel yourself to avoid it and flee the spot. Only the film crew knows the truth and all these I meant to be for grownups. Because the raw and uncut animal documentaries we see on television hurts us in a way, if you are a light-hearted, especially to know how the food chain works and rivalry within the same species.\r\n\r\nAs for the kids, it was a finest documentary, very inspiring and knowledgeable. I learnt that monkeys can swim, not on the water surface, but dives to the deep into the bed. So far I am thorough with Disney Nature's production and distribution filmography and now I am eagerly waiting for the release of 'Born in China'. Because I haven't seen documentary films about Pandas, so it will going to be a very exciting one for sure. And another reason to celebrate is that the 'Kung Fu Panda 3' coming out around the same time. So mark these dates and reserve the days fellows, especially for the sake of your kids.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"561e8072c3a368721d0000bd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/561e8072c3a368721d0000bd","movie_id":295592}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> It's July 1969, the world's eye on the US, but they're one step and one man away from the humiliation.\r\n\r\nThis is really a brilliant concept, but lacks the production quality since it is a small budget film. At least they got some decent actors where Ron Perlman and Rupert Grint led it with full responsibility. The story of a CIA agent Kidman, who was sent to London to make some fake video clips of moon landing from a renowned filmmaker when pentagon thought the NASA mission might fail. But he meets the wrong men and loses the money. Now he got no time, but to find a quick solution and accomplish his mission, where some fun filled adventures follows in the remaining narration.\r\n\r\nIt is a French production, almost everything shot in England in the English language, but there is a bit of American flavour in it. Based on the speculation on the Apollo 11 mission, but it never took seriously on that topic, other than narrating humorously. Only the theme was new, but most of the jokes weren't. Overall, an average film, directed by some totally unknown guy, but as a B movie, it is acceptable. If you know what kind of film you're about see and anticipate according to that, then the time you spend for it won't end badly, except you're not going to give it a perfect score.\r\n\r\n5\/10","id":"57c8b0b492514148f300095f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c8b0b492514148f300095f","movie_id":272548}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A very familiar theme, as well as a small quantity entertainer.\r\n\r\nThe second movie for the director. His first, 'Project X' was an unexpected full treat. I simply loved that one, just for the entertainment's sake. I anticipated, 'Project XX' or 'Project Y', followed by 'XXX' or 'Z', but that never happened. I thought the director was setting up his own style of filmmaking, but this film did not clinch well. There's no story, just based on one evening event that stretches as far as another day by adding brief oral flashbacks to match with the rest of the storyline. But the fact is it was a comedy version of 'Hitman'.\r\n\r\nThe red band trailer I saw revealed many stuffs, but the movie still offered lots of variety from the different angles of the same stuffs. Jesse Eisenberg, I never expected him to play a character like this, he was good. But it was only a partial display, if there is a sequel, I expect that would be an uncompromised when it comes to the stunts and heroic adventure. Although I enjoyed the end credit animation.\r\n\r\nKristen Stewart was just hanging around, though her character had potential to be a game changer, so let's hope the sequel strengthens that part. Yeah, I'm kind of certain about the follow-up after seeing this film's ending, if they don't consider to make one, that would be theirs great loss. Anyway, the movie is a good entertainer, but not your unusual story as you expect it to be.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"56c08a49c3a36817ef00c0ff","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56c08a49c3a36817ef00c0ff","movie_id":261392}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Life on a thin line between pleasure and despair.\r\n\r\nDo you think anyone says 'I should have known him' after watching 'This Is It'. The answer is definitely yes. In the non-English speaking countries, many people don't know who Michael Jackson is or was. To me, this documentary is a similar case, I had no clue about who Amy Winehouse was or I never listened her musics before. So thanks to the director for this film and I also congratulate him for the Oscars nomination.\r\n\r\nThe movie was not complete. As any documentary this one too based on the recorded audio and video clips, and a series of interviews of whom she had worked with and closed ones. It was like a puzzle, but was arranged neatly in the chronological order. You know, you won't get all the truth from them, many stuffs remain mystery. So this is only a person's quality and character from many (people's) angles, but the accuracy, the honesty is with Amy that's never going to be revealed. Because only she knows about all she went through in her life like we do in our life.\r\n\r\nWithout arguably I agree films and documentary films are too short to squeeze all in about 2 hours to depict a person's entire life and people who watch it to judge that person is not justified. In this, the end was so sudden, like they had no more footages about what really happened. The trivia says Amy's father was not happy about the movie for the portrayal of his daughter, especially the last few years of her life. Only a very few know how much true this film is, but anyway something was very clear that he has not been the father she has wished for.\r\n\r\nEvery child deserves a good parenting. I feel Amy's struggle began from her childhood itself. But after the teenage, while becoming more independent, she lost her path, besides the fame poured in. She definitely had a gifted voice, she did not know how to manage it and someone should have been there to guide her. According to this film, I think the marriage was the beginning of the dark side of the Amy.\r\n\r\n> \"When you looked at her lyrical and melodic capability,\r\n> she was a very old soul in a very young body.\"\r\n\r\nI have not seen all the Academy Award nominees except this and 'Cartel Land', but I certainly think this film has the edge to win the best Documentary film. Definitely Amy's life story deserves to be made as a feature film and I'm up for it. Because somewhere I read the reply to a question 'why Bill Gates is not celebrated as the Steve Jobs? After all bother of them achieved a lot in the same field and contributed to modernise the computer technology'.\r\n\r\nThe reply was like this: 'Bill Gates was from a financially well settled family who was good at studies and his life was very smooth, support was poured from all the corners. While Steve Jobs was a child of an immigrant parents and had to struggle for his achievements. So he went through many ups and downs in his life and people have soft corner for that'.\r\n\r\nThis film had all qualities to inspire from the Amy's achievement as well as lessons to learn from her personal life. Everybody has their personal issues and so the Amy. Becoming a prey for the drugs and alcohol is very common these days among the celebrities. For example Heath Ledger, Philip Seymour Hoffman and many other stars are the victims for the drug addiction.\r\n\r\nThat does not mean their achievements are nothing. Simply, we see one of the many faces of them. After all, we're humans go after what we desire for, but everything has limits, after that what comes is a self-destruction. It is a very nice movie. If you know her and still want to know better, and if you don't know her and want to know about her, for both it is a must see.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"56b383cdc3a36806f8002012","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56b383cdc3a36806f8002012","movie_id":331781}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Some people never let go your hand!**\r\n\r\nWe ask for the fresh ideas and here is the one. This British film was not totally innovative, at least it tried to be different. This horror-comedy was directed by two brothers and it was theirs first feature film. This is the story of two who meet working in a supermarket. The 19 years old Holly and in his 20s, Rob, they instantly fall in love with their first encounter. But there's a problem that they can't sleep together, if they do, then Rob's dead girlfriend appear. So the reason for it and the solution if there is one, is what the rest of the film covers.\r\n\r\nIt was a little slow, though entertaining. Not a bad storyline, they developed it decently, but the twist was so ordinary. Nothing like we could predict it, but it gives a silly reason. If you are not expecting big, then it might work. The performances were not bad. It's not that funny, because it was a black comedy. Though the story takes place in the open society, the focus has been always between three main cast and a couple of others. That mean it comes to the point, not wasting for useless scenes. That's why it's very interesting, despite not very impressive. Like I said worth a watch for being a different from the usual films.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"5851b963c3a368315001946d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5851b963c3a368315001946d","movie_id":323694}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I would say that this movie is pretty much the kind of movie that I expected it to be. That being said I think it was a bit softer than I hoped it to be. I think that, again, the Hollywood plonkers have opted to make a movie that got a more palate rating (to them and their cash registers) than what it should have been. It is not as obvious as with Robocop and a few other movies but the feeling is there.\r\n\r\nIt is still a fairly entertaining movie. It is of course yet another special effects movie and as such it does not disappoint. It differs from a lot of the usual special effects movies in that the effects are pretty down to Earth in a bizarre way. We are not talking about superheroes or near magical technologies here but instead we have a devastated landscape, scrounged together equipment and a totally ludicrous desire to blow up the last remains of human civilisation. The bizarre vehicle designs and the totally ridicules behaviour of a lot of people in this movie is alone worth watching it to be honest.\r\n\r\nAs with the previous Mad Max movies this one stretches the bounds of reality (I hope) when it comes to human behaviour and how they waste the few precious resources, specifically gasoline and bullets, that remains after the apocalypse. It provides some spectacular scenery but it also puts a bit of \u201cwhat the f\u2026\u201d feeling to it all. Not that this part is not expected from a Mad Max movie though.\r\n\r\nWhat I think was my largest let-down in the movie was the Mad Max character itself. To me he is supposed to be a real bad-ass. In this movie he was not really that impressive. He certainly was far from the original Mad Max character in my opinion and was really overshadowed by the Furiosa character. I could have lived with that if this character would have been really impressive but she was not. She was cool but she was still underwhelming when comparing to anything in the original bad-ass Mad Max universe. I would say that Tina Turner and Mel Gibson still rules!\r\n\r\nStill it is a decent futuristic, apocalyptic action movie, maybe not living up to this old movie geeks expectations, but not at all a wasted movie evening. The sound track of the Blu-ray certainly gave my subwoofer an exercise as well.","id":"5a64efea0e0a2619f802ac7c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a64efea0e0a2619f802ac7c","movie_id":76341}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"If you, like many others, had been excited about Maari after watching its trailer, be prepared for disappointment. Almost all the best bits from the film are already in the trailer and the film clearly lacks the crackling energy that we see in the trailer. Maari largely feels like one huge build-up without any proper pay-off.\r\n\r\nThe story is set in a slum, where Maari (Dhanush, infusing the character with life), a small-time thug, whose heart is in pigeon racing. His rival is Bird Ravi (Mime Gopi), who has been completely overshadowed by Maari, who has become the go-to guy for a bigger don, Velu Annan (Shanmugarajan). Enter a new inspector, Arjun Kumar (Vijay Yesudas, making his debut), who is determined to crack an age-old murder that happens to be the one which gave Maari his fearsome reputation. We also get a sub-plot involving red sanders, probably to make this story seem topical.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, after Vaaya Moodi Pesavum, which was a half-silent movie, Balaji Mohan wanted to do something relatively simple and chose this script, which has its fair share of cliches. The director seems to be aware of this and he tries to keep things light and never lets scenes get overtly dramatic (in this, he is helped to a great extent by Robo Shankar, who is terrific as Maari's comic sidekick Sanikizhamai), but this approach doesn't suit this material, which is essentially a fawning-over-the-hero masala movie. Plot developments are treated a bit too casually \u2014 including the hero being sent to prison \u2014 that we are hardly invested in the proceedings.\r\n\r\nAnd to make things worse, after doing everything \u2014 stylish beard, coolers, trendy shirts to punch dialogue (Senjuduven) and devil-may-care swagger \u2014 project his hero, the director fails to provide him with strong adversaries. A hero is only as good as his villain, and the villains here are hardly intimidating. Both Vijay Yesudas (playing a character that is this film's equivalent of Virgil Sollozzo in The Godfather) and Mime Gopi are lightweights in underwritten roles, and never for a moment do we see them as a real threat to the hero.\r\n\r\nBut, Maari is no Anjaan (another recent film that had a star playing a don but fizzled out after building up its hero), though, at times, it does come dangerously close. There are some quirky touches that suggest some spark, though they are definitely not enough for the film to catch fire. The best scene \u2014 Maari reclaiming his turf \u2014 is pure masala movie moment, and a nice update on the scene in Baasha where every don comes and kisses Rajinikanth's hand. The villain's henchmen arrive at the market to collect the dues from the shopkeepers and Maari, who is unperturbed by them, coolly sits with feet up on a table and throws crackers around, making them jittery. And realizing who is in charge, one by one, the people of the place come and place their money on Maari's table. It is a quietly punchy scene and what the film needed is more scenes such as this one. But what we get are scenes that promise us something impactful but end up as underwhelming. Take the scene where Bird Ravi is left to lick his wounds after Maari refuses to pay him any due. We think he is going to plan something big to cut down Maari to size but instead, all we get is him whining to Arjun.\r\n\r\nEven the romantic track isn't lazily done, though it does follow the Tamil cinema template of an educated, pretty girl falling for a crude but goodhearted ruffian. Just as we roll our eyes when Sridevi (Kajal) begins to woo Maari after he helps her out in a financial transaction, Balaji Mohan introduces a twist into this and we are surprised. If only had he done such things throughout the film, we would have got the quirky mass masala movie that we were promised in the trailer.","id":"55b8887092514123d8001346","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55b8887092514123d8001346","movie_id":311166}
{"author":"Gimly","content":"**The following is a long form review that I originally wrote in 2015.**\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll keep this\u2019n somewhat brief, because I only saw the movie once and it was a few days ago now. Some time later on though, I will post a spoiler talk that goes into greater depth. For now though, enjoy this spoiler free review of _Mad Max: Fury Road_!\r\n\r\nThe number one complaint I\u2019ve been seeing about _Fury Road_ is that there\u2019s not much of a story. I would respond by saying, there might not be as much story as you could **want**, but there is certainly as much as you could **need**. The plot isn\u2019t deep, or complex, or intricate, or philosophical. but it\u2019s there, and it makes sense. Just last year, _John Wick_ showed us that you can get away with a pretty thin premise, if you work hard enough on building a thick, palpable world. And the world of _Fury Road_ is something else entirely, I can see why people aren\u2019t blown away by the story, but the world is incredible.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion as to whether Max himself, or his cohort Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron) is the star of the film. I would argue that neither of them are. Director George Miller is. This is his vision. Warner Brothers took a big risk when they handed a 70 year old man nearly two hundred million dollars to revitalise his franchise which has been dead for 30 years, then get out of the way and let him do his thing. But it paid off. _Fury Road_ is more of an \u201cexperience\u201d than most movies are, it just happens to be a great film, too.\r\n\r\nThe stunt work and visual effects deserve praise all to themselves. According to the filmmakers, roughly ten percent of all the effects were done with CGI. The other NINETY are practical, and it oozes with that spectacle. You really can feel the maximum force of the future sitting in that theatre, which is a rare and unexpected pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s my highest rated film of 2015 thus far, in fact, it\u2019s one of only five films I\u2019ve given more than 4 stars in the past five years. So please don\u2019t take the recommendation lightly when I ask you all to go out and support this movie. Just make sure you do it in the biggest, best quality cinema you can, because this latest entry to the _Mad Max_ franchise is worth it.\r\n\r\n91%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_","id":"5cb08c500e0a2626c8c45b94","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cb08c500e0a2626c8c45b94","movie_id":76341}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The adventure expands outside the maze to seek the answers.\r\n\r\nAnother teen movie in the mid series on the line of 'Divergent' and 'Hunger Games'. As an adult, I don't know what to expect from it, but entertainment was the priority. The first film was just an introduction that happened in a small and a single location like the film 'Cube'. Now it has outspread in a large extent with more new characters and takes a wider adventure in the wastelands.\r\n\r\nMany doubts from the previous film were cleared, yet a few need to be clarified and hoping for the next one to do that job. But anyway the suspense was this franchise's specialty, that simply reminds us the TV series 'Lost'. This second part can be compared with plenty of other post apocalyptic films, but still I liked it better than the first.\r\n\r\nThe best thing was they retained the same director and he's going to be here for the next film as well. But I'm more interested in the prequel, I mean the fourth film than the third which brings an end to the story moving forward. Because the maze holds the key for many unresolved issues. So I'm anticipating the prequel trilogy than the current one to learn how it all began.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, many new additions like zombies, bounty hunters in the mainstream boosted the film with its variety. Gives us a creepy atmosphere, along thrilling running and chasing. The twist was not that great, but kind of unpredictable, and again due to the mysteries surrounding it, it created more curious about what might happen next.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd\/10","id":"56a4c71d92514144ba0060f9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56a4c71d92514144ba0060f9","movie_id":294254}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Returning a product to the previous owner!**\r\n\r\nKind of a refreshing romance-drama on the cheating\/divorce theme. Written and directed by Rebecca Miller. A great comeback after the six years of gap, but not a masterstroke. The casting was very impressive, particularly it was Greta Gerwig's typical film. I mean, if you enjoy watching her films, then you would do the same for it. On the other hand, her signature performance kind of bored to me. I mean all her film character was kind of easy-go-lucky soft-touch and comedic girl, I want her to try the different roles and genres. Maybe that's the reason many people had turned it down. Ethan Hawke and Julianne Moore were in the decent supporting roles, but everybody shared enough screen to call its their film too and delivered some good lines.\r\n\r\nI had a good time with it, because it was better than I anticipated. The story was good and its entire narration they have developed it finely. Unfortunately, it is an R film, otherwise it could have been a film for all. Kind of it reminds us the Woody Allen's style of presentation. Because you know even in the tough times for film characters, they calm and coolly deals it. So that makes it is a stress free film, especially if you just had a bad day, it might help you cool down. But don't expect the loud laughs in the comedy parts, then you should not opt it.\r\n\r\nThe overall film is worth a watch, but don't believe those who are saying it is too bad. It might be bad for them, though definitely not bad to bash it top to bottom. The critics thumbed it up, and if you welcome decent films, then go for it and decide yourself. The film has lots of good qualities, but this could be the last film of Greta I'll be watching if she does not appear in a distinct role in her next, because like I said I already bored of her in the same old. Finally, I feel I want to suggest it, but not to everybody, particularly not the youngster, the grown ups might like it better.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"57ed85f59251414c920003ab","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ed85f59251414c920003ab","movie_id":312669}

What they never are afraid to do is to do something different and tell stories that Hollywood wouldn't or if they would in a very different manner . Where Hollywood would normally sensationalize something to the max they usually play down their stories to a more humane level. The characters in their films are usually a bit odd or dysfunctional in one way or the other.\r\n\r\nAnd this is definitly on that same page, with the title you would expect something really exploitative and wild but it's really low-key and more a character study than anything else.\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna say too much because the less you know is really better here I think, but it's a interesting and different indie drama comedy.","id":"590a4b49c3a36843c3006f35","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/590a4b49c3a36843c3006f35","movie_id":323679}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"As his previous five films have shown us, a Venkat Prabhu film cannot exist without certain must-haves. For starters, his brother Premgi Amaren will be the film's designated comedian. There will be cameos by the Venkat Prabhu company of actors (here, we get Jai, Vijay Vasanth, Aravind Akash, Subbu Panchu to name a few). There will be twists galore in the plot. There will be endless pop culture references (this one invokes Engaeyum Eppothum, Mankatha, 7aum Arivu, Kaththi, Singam 2, Pammal K Sammandham, Pizza, Vaaranam Aayiram, Naan Kadavul, Raja Rani, actor Vishal's fight against movie piracy, the catchphrase Ennamma Ippadi Pannreengalema and many more). The heroines will be strictly functional (Nayanthara's role here is more a cameo). The focus will be more on entertaining even if means sacrificing some of the seriousness in a scene. And most importantly, there will be a subtle subversion of genre \u2014 Massu Engira Maasilamani (MEM) has ghosts but it is not a horror film but rather a revenge saga in the traditional 'mass' film mould. Some of these might come across as forced but there is no denying that they have become the director's signature.\r\n\r\nSo, when we step into a Venkat Prabhu film, by now, we sort-of know what to expect. The fun lies in finding out how the director packages all these elements to surprise and entertain us. MEM shows that the director's flair for delivering an unpretentious and undemanding film is still intact, even if a slight amount of predictability has crept into the filmmaking.\r\n\r\nVenkat Prabhu makes his intentions quite clear right at the start when he introduces his hero, Mass. It feels like a typical hero's introduction scene with Mass taking on a few hoodlums who are stealing from a TASMAC shop on Gandhi Jayanthi. He fights them off and then we are told that the entire thing was staged. And even as we get the mandatory hero introduction song, the director uses it to introduce the heroine, Manini, as well and in swift strokes shows us that Mass has fallen in love with her. The plot kicks in when Mass and his friend, Jet Li steal from a local gangster to help Manini, but are involved in an accident while trying to escape the gangster's henchmen. Mass is admitted in a hospital and when he wakes up, he learns that he can see and talk to ghosts. He strikes a deal with this bunch of ghosts \u2014 they want him to fulfill their last wishes and he wants them to help him use this 'gift' and make money. But then he encounters a new ghost, Sakthi, who is his look-alike. Playing on his greed, Sakthi soon starts using Mass for his own needs. What happens when Mass realizes this and who is Sakthi?\r\n\r\nWhat makes MEM different from previous Venkat Prabhu films is that the second half becomes a bit sentimental and that is both good and bad. There are moments when the sentimental bit works very well. For example, the scene in which Mass learns of one of the ghost's cause of death and the moving song during which he satisfies the last wishes of some of the ghosts. But things turn somewhat melodramatic during the moment in which Mass finally learns who Sakthi is (though the revelation is a genuine surprise). And the backstory for Sakthi is also cliched and takes too much screen time. In contrast, the director gives us the backstory of Mass and his relationship with Jet Li in a matter of minutes without resorting to melodrama. The villains are quite generic but Venkat makes up for it with the character of Vikram, a cop, who is neither good nor bad. It also helps that Vikram is played by Parthepan who brings his own quirks to the role \u2014 in one scene, he romves the shades of a character who he is arresting and remarks in typical Parthepan-speak, \"Enna kalutunanu yaarum ketrakoodadhu illa?'\r\n\r\nThe songs are plain indulgences (the Thriller-like Poochandi is visually interesting but brings the story to a halt) and the pacing dips a little during the second half despite some nifty editing (KL Praveen), and even the director acknowledges this by making Jet Li remark that Mass has slowed down. The film lacks the raciness of Biriyani or Mankatha, but there is enough inventivesness and joie de vivre to the scenes to keep us entertained.","id":"55976a129251413d9f000a53","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55976a129251413d9f000a53","movie_id":329134}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Neither your regular dog movie nor an inspiring theme yet worth it a watch.\r\n\r\nNowadays there are no good dog films like a decade ago were. They're restricted to television for the quality only the little kids can get entertained thoroughly. This film is a good news for adults and not a usual story, only from the outside. I mean the story was associated with war, only in the initial segment and then the rest of the narration was somewhat feeling familiar.\r\n\r\nInspired by the war dogs who assisted the US soldiers during the war in the middle-east of what is this film is dedicated to. A dog named Max returns States from the service after met with a disaster. Now he's adopted by a family whose son had died fighting the same war along side him. With struggling to adjust a new life, Max finds a close bond with a boy in the family and that leads to an adventure in the nearby woods where they fight against the illegal activists.\r\n\r\nThe same boy from the film 'Lost in the Sun', but here he had full scope for his character. The rest of the cast as well very good, especially the dog. A good story, but anticipated a little better with more developments. Emotionally, it should have been stronger, but somewhat satisfying overall product it was. The locations were beautiful, especially the woods.\r\n\r\nThe end was decent as a story, but they did not get it right in pictures. Seems there's logic missing regarding the geographical area where blast takes place. I know it won't be your top 10 pick from the years, yet not that bad to skip it. Not a dog film I hoped for, but I accept it for the todays scenario where quantity declined. So I say go for it.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"576d7760c3a36874e4001ef9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/576d7760c3a36874e4001ef9","movie_id":272878}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"In the titles of Masala Padam, director Laxman Kumar (the cinematographer of films like Vennila Kabadi Kuzhu and the Thillu Mullu remake) shows us clips from the Lumiere Brother's famous Arrival Of The Train to those from Tamil cinema's superstars like MK Thyagaraja Bhagavathar, MG, Sivaji Ganesan, Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan, to tell us a bit of the history of cinema. The film begins with a newly released masala film being trolled by social media reviewers. One of them is hit by a car and believes that it was a hit organised by the film's producer. The producer denies the allegation and challenges them on TV to come up with a script in six months. They decide to follow the lives of three men \u2014 Mani (Shiva, who generates the laughs with his usual deadpan style), a middle-class sales guy, Krish (Gaurav, adequate), a rich orphan and Amudhan (Simhaa, one-note), a gangster \u2014 and ask their friend Diya, a travelogue writer, to flirt with all three of them. Will their plan work out?\r\n\r\nTrue to its name, Masala Padam is a potpourri of many genres \u2014 there is comedy, action, romance, drama. And it contains nods to numerous films down the years, by way of shots and plot lines. The most obvious one is the producer challenging critics, like Raghuvaran in Mudhalvan, to make a script that sells. Then, there is the Maan Karate-like initial set-up about a group of self-centred youngsters using a person for their personal gain. We even have Bobby Simhaa playing a fearsome gangster as he did in Jigarthanda.\r\n\r\nBut the film it feels the closest to in spirit is Kathai Thiraikathai Vasanam Iyakkam (KTVI), which was also about people who are racing against time to develop a script. As in that film, the screenplay tries to ride on its quirkiness. But unlike that underrated film, this is not essentially a commentary on the workings of the Tamil film industry, but rather a look at the movie-going audience today. It talks about the elite audiences and critics who keep comparing \"our films\" to world cinema (read art cinema) and expect them to be realistic and artistic like those films. It talks about the common man, who expects nothing but entertainment out of these films and unquestioningly accepts them and celebrates them and their stars when they satisfy his expectations. It talks about how social media has become a disruptive force when it comes to deciding the box office fate of films. It talks about how the cliches that we see in our films are actually part of the formula that makes a film a hit. As a character remarks, \"shit-ku ulla kooda oru hit irukku\". \r\n\r\nAs if to illustrate the fact, Laxman gives us three sub-plots that are cliched but keeps things engaging. We see the three men falling for Diya and she, in turn, developing a soft corner towards them, and how her presence influences their lives. Like Diya, we, too, come to care about these characters to an extent. But where the film falters is in never coming together as a whole unlike KTVI, which, despite its rather intentionally disjointed screenplay, was consistent from start to finish. It also feels less sophisticated technically, with the music, camera and editing, all of which seem just functional and never enhance the plot. And while the film explains why a masala film still works \u2014 they are a projection of the unattainable dreams of the lay man (\"cinema oru kanavu thozhirchaalai\"), it doesn't offer any explanation on why innumerable films that follow the formula fail and how offbeat films end up being successful sometimes. Perhaps, that is a question for which even the industry doesn't have an answer yet.","id":"561d0c369251415a6b003952","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/561d0c369251415a6b003952","movie_id":363181}

{"author":"Matthew Brady","content":"When I saw the reviews for this movie my first thought was \"Every critic has lost their minds... even me.\"\r\n\r\nThe story is about a post-apocalyptic wasteland - the fight for survival has twisted the remnants of mankind, turning most into mad, vicious gangs. In this chaotic world two rebels may be able to restore order while seeking their own forms of redemption: Max, a man who just wants peace after losing his wife and child and Furiosa - who thinks finding her childhood home is the answer.\r\n\r\nWhat a lovely day to be talking about Mad Max: Fury Road, because the trailers and the reviews for this movie have been off the walls mad. I mean five out of five star's! wow, just wow. The last Mad Max film came out in 1985, so it's a been a long time and so was this movie, as development took a long time. So I was curious and a bit shady for this movie, by seeing if George Miller (The director of the original films) was going to bring to the table. Now after seeing the movie and having a long thought about it, this movie is freaking awesome, no actually this is the best action movie of the year and probably the decade.\r\n\r\nGeorge Miller goes back to his roots and he doesn't disappointment. After all these years later he's still got it. He filmed all the action scenes with care and effort, because most of the action in this movie are mostly practical effects and that right there shows that Miller is going back to old school of action, and it's perfect. You are the man Miller!\r\n\r\nThe movie itself is mad and I do mean freaking insane. There's a guy in this movie who plays a flamethrower electric guitar on top of a speed vehicle and all through out the movie he was rocking it out. I don't know why, but little things like that made this movie so mad that it's enjoyable.\r\n\r\nTom Hardy as Max Rockatansky was good, I mean he wasn't as good as Mel Gibson but I still think he did a great job. Most of the time Max doesn't talk all that much, I mean most of he's lines are \"huh\", or \"Water\", but he has a couple of lines in the movie and it sounded epic all the time.\r\n\r\nCharlize Theron (as Furiosa) is basically the main character and Max is the supporting character. Charlize Theron was like a female version of Max in a way, because her character steels the whole show as her character is a strong female bad-ass that kicks so much ass that it's very rare in action movies today to do that. Now think of all the strong female character's in past action movies, well that's Furiosa right here.\r\n\r\nThe action scenes can be best describe as incredible and freaking crazy. The stunt work used during the movie was f**king amazing. There actually used practical effects mixed with CGI during the action scenes which looked so good and much better than over using effect's to make something look incredible and I know they used some CGI for scenes where it needed it, because it would be too dangerous or impossible to do, but for the most part it's all practical effect's. NOW THIS IS HOW ACTION MOVIES SHOULD BE DONE! THANK YOU MAD MAX: FURY ROAD FOR DOING THIS!!! Okay, I had to get that out there and sorry for shouting.\r\n\r\nImmortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays- Byrne), and yes he was in the first Mad Max movie, but here he plays a different villain this time and a menacing one as well. He was like a mix of Dark Vader and Sweet Tooth from Twisted Metal (Video Game). He was awesome villain that didn't take sh*t from anyone and always looked like he was going to cause a whole lot of trouble every time he's on screen.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography was just beautiful and some of the best looking shoots so far this year. I can't believe I'm saying that for a action movie that's been in development for years and it payed off perfectly. This is very rare for this to happen as a lot of movie franchises that have been in the making for years and years would normally come out to late where every body just lost interest and give up waiting, and the movie itself would turn out not so good, but here is much different. This movie broke new grounds of coming out late but still being a amazing thrill ride.\r\n\r\nThe other women in the movie know as the five wives are not just there to look pretty and be saved by any man, no they kicked ass in the movie and they actually did something. The five wives were strong women and this isn't just a mans movie, I mean most of the movie is the women kicking ass and being awesome. They kick more ass then Max ever did. That's why I got to give this movie praise for that.\r\n\r\nNow for the problems: I tried to look for things that didn't quite work for the movie and to be honest I couldn't find anything that I thought wasn't good. Well there was some slow parts in the movie but the slow parts where the action clams down for now it fills it's time with character development and back story and it worked.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: Forget \"Pitch Perfect 2\", this is the movie you should see at cinema. As a movie reviewer myself who wants action movies to be more then turn your brain off and enjoy whatever slob mess there in front of the screen, but what I want is a movie experience that I can look back on and say \"Now that, was one heck of a movie.\"","id":"5e2f2a45c56d2d00154e5d8d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2f2a45c56d2d00154e5d8d","movie_id":76341}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A tale of a father who stood by his daughter till the final.\r\n\r\nThe zombie apocalyptic drama that centres around a father-daughter relationship. When the daughter is infected by the necroa virus which turns humans into the cannibalistic, the loving father stands by her side, but how long is the remaining film.\r\n\r\nOne of the blacklisted screenplay and a low budget film that surprised me for having Arnie on-board. Chloe Grace Moretz was supposed to play the title character, would have been definitely a perfect fit. Because I've seen her excellence in the 'Carrie' remake, anyway her replace Abigail Breslin did perform well.\r\n\r\nI had seen many movies of Arnold Schwarzenegger, but as I remember this is the first time seen him in a casual, realistic and emotional outfit. Maybe his age is restricting him from taking up the tough roles to play as what he was known for, but still I'm happy that he's doing movies that fits him right now.\r\n\r\nFor the one reason it is called a horror and you know why, but it was not horrifying. A slow paced simplest zombie movie. Enjoyable film for the sake of the cast, yet forgettable and move on kind of flick.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd\/10","id":"56116c319251414ec60032b0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56116c319251414ec60032b0","movie_id":287424}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Just not my cup of tea.\r\n\r\nI have seen the first part and I don't remember I felt the same way as I did for this. My point is, this film is for women and maybe that including the gays. Being a straight male, I find it's not fun or entertaining, but I felt it pulled me further away as the movie progressed without balancing the content as a product for everyone.\r\n\r\nI know, no one asked my opinion. I respect the movie, at least it aimed for a certain section of the audiences. The road trip was fine to me, except the music and the dance parts. Thankfully, there's no nudity, except once, but still an R rated movie for strong sexual appeal.\r\n\r\nWhatever the theme was about, I expected a good story. But it was a lot like a documentary. No focus on any particular characters, but Channing Tatum was in a prime position. No development either in the story other than a group that embark a road trip to participate in a competition. Nothing anything like the first film, kind of detached from afar.\r\n\r\nSo I won't expect you to feel as the way I did on this, but you could consider my points and can judge whether want to watch it. Still, I'm not suggesting to boycott the film. I'm neutral, and all I'm saying is that it did not impress me, but it might you, especially if you are a woman.\r\n\r\n4\/10","id":"5697a58b92514154d20022e9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5697a58b92514154d20022e9","movie_id":264999}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Sometimes the right thing comes from the wrong.\r\n\r\nAnother excellent Simon Pegg movie. This is his fourth movie I'm seeing inside a month and I enjoyed them all, especially 'Hector and Search for Happiness' was my favourite. This was a romantic-comedy that takes place in just one evening. A story about blind dating, boy meets girl, they spend a quality time by sharing the details and later turn against each other. So a recycled old theme that was very well crafted.\r\n\r\nIf you see the poster what does the tagline says, well, that's what I was looking for. I had 'Date Night' in my mind, and thought it might be an altered British version. Other than that I was truly not expecting anything special, but a normal comedy, maybe sloppy. And it does only until a certain stage of the story, but 30 minutes later it overturns. So the best narration briskly took a slide towards joyous ride in the remaining 1 hour.\r\n\r\nI think, for right now Simon Pegg is my favourite British actor and you know the reason that I stated in the first paragraph. Lake Bell, who donned in a director's hat in her recent feature was so good on a 34 year-old role she played in this film. Together they were so perfect, one of the best on-screen couple with a wonderful chemistry. It was a story of two middle aged odd guys whose lives were shattered for some reasons. They meet accidentally and bond well. Once the truth got out, they repel away, but they both have something in common and that puts them on a test once they decide to correct the mistakes they have made.\r\n\r\n> \"After this shot I will stronger,\r\n> wiser and finally moving on.\"\r\n\r\nAt some stage in the life every person will going to be in their 30s and 40s (and some were had been there) like the couple from this film. The life won't be the same for everybody like that shown here, but can be understood, because that's the experience that define it. Despite romance crisis about the middle-aged guys, many dialogues were excellently written and funny as well.  A couple of lines really made me worry and I can't just ignore by saying it was just a flick.\r\n\r\nKind of easy to begin a story, like we're standing in an open ground and decide to move any direction we want in our 360\u00ba angle. But development is the key factor in the movie making and this film outshines. The real challenge was how to end it and once again it was a beautiful conclusion, even though I knew it was so clich\u00e9 for a romantic-comedy.\r\n\r\nOverally looked a fairy-tale like theme, which irresistible if you love touching romantic stories. Definitely a good movie from the director of 'The Inbetweeners' and I'm going to recommend it for those who also liked the similar movies below I mentioned. But remember it's only cinematically amusing than being realistic.\r\n\r\n7\u00bd\/10","id":"566eea45c3a36836b4012413","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/566eea45c3a36836b4012413","movie_id":332340}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Mahabalipuram starts off on a slow note but by the time it ends, it leaves one startled and shattered. Seldom has a story in recent times been told in such a gripping fashion that it makes it hard for one not to compliment director Don Sandy for his efforts. \r\n\r\nThe film, through a touching love story, highlights not just dangerous crimes that prevail in society today but also seeks to draw the attention of the public in general and women in particular to a serious problem posed by tech-savvy criminals. It makes an honest attempt to delve into the minds of criminals and deals with a pressing issue of society in recent times.\r\nWhile the film might itself deal with dark elements like deceit, exploitation, backstabbing, and dangerous crimes, it is not completely devoid of entertainment - a case in point being a funny episode that is showcased in the first half of the film when Panja makes an attempt to get close to his lady love. Getting to know she loves bajjis, he poses to be a bajji seller. The manner in which his friends keep relocating his shop in a bid to catch her attention is really funny. \r\n\r\nSome exceptional work by the film's music director K and really tight editing by its editor Kim Aam seem to have lent the director a hand in raising the quality of the film. The work of cameraman Chandran Pattuswamy also cannot be ignored in this regard. \r\n\r\nOne other factor that seems to have worked in favour of Mahabalipuram is its cast. Almost all the actors in the film deliver big time, causing the film to have a telling impact on its audience. Standing out are Virthika, whose role as Mahalakshmi, and Vinayak, whose role as Panja, leave a lump in your throat by the time the film ends. \r\n\r\nThe manner in which all the knots are tied off at the end gives the impression that director Don Sandy is one who knows his profession well. He deserves full marks for having made a film that not only scores as an entertainer but also seeks to create an awareness on a form of crime that society urgently needs to address.","id":"551062e7c3a368488600d202","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/551062e7c3a368488600d202","movie_id":270770}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Tales from an old apartment building!**\r\n\r\nA little multi-layered French comedy. The making was not unusual, but the storyline was. Based on the autobiography of the director. There could be more to come, so a sequel is possible like the Roy Andersson's 'Living' trilogy. There was similarity is style of storytelling, yet it was more clear on what it narrated for us.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure of the timeline, but it seems at least 10-20 years back. Guessing it with the settings. It was about the lives in an apartment building. Divided into three layers, the first one was about a man living on the second floor who never uses the elevator. But the time comes for him without other options. He meets a nurse in her break and befriends. So it continues for days.\r\n\r\nOn the second tale, an American astronaut becomes a guest in one of the residences where an old immigrant lady lives. Coming to the third and final, a teenage boy meets an actress who recently moved in to the next door. Their's friendship growing despite the generation gap was focused on. How all these tales begins and ends were the fun to watch.\r\n\r\n> -xX] It's weird to see you in the film. It's like you're a different person, from another life. [Xx-\r\n\r\nFrom all, Isabelle Huppert's presence made my curiosity about the film. She's the one who played an aging actress, I think she was good. Everybody else as well, quite good. Because it was not a high budget sci-fi film. But about individuals. Their lifestyle, profession and looking for something anew in life. So that's what makes the story, when they meet different people out of their normal surroundings.\r\n\r\nEach character was distinctive. So it was hard to predict the outcome, yet feels so close to familiarity with everything that happened. Not a straight comedy, it was more of a black-comedy. Though some parts were sensible. The blend of life drama and comedy with the wonderful performances lifted the film. Michael Pitt was the other familiar face in it. They kind of made fun of the American space agency, while the Hollywood acknowledging with super higher end products.\r\n\r\nSo, this is like another under-noticed film. But it is not like deserves major attention, except if you a cinephile. Other than that if you want to try it, then you should too. It surely won't disappoint. People hunt films with big names, but such small films like this can deliver somewhat better than those big flicks. I was a little late to watch it, in the end, I'm happy I did it.

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"It is quite an automatic instinct to compare and contrast the first installment of 2014\u2019s \u2018The Maze Runner\u2019 with the arrival of the latest entry in director Wes Ball\u2019s distant dystopian drama \u2018Maze Runner: Scorch Trials\u2019. The original blueprint effectively captured a unique time and place of mystique and other morbid curiosities.  The audience was craftily introduced to The Glade, a head-scratching venue out in the middle of nowhere while being surrounded by a massive maze that pretty much rendered its survivors in vulnerability and uncertainty. Well, \u2018Maze Runner: Scorch Trials\u2019 looks to revisit that same kind of mystifying aura where our young and daring protagonists face the surreal obstacles in a futuristic facility that begs for the same kind of grandiose ambivalence. Sadly, \u2018Scorch Trials\u2019 is a derivative follow-up shadow of its former pronounced presentation. This formulaic fantasy fails to provide any distinctive punch or promise to its more competent predecessor.\r\n\r\nAs a post-apocalyptic Young Adult-oriented narrative \u2018Maze Runner: Scorch Trials\u2019 never really invests in its adventurous characterizations that seem to blankly react to the jittery surroundings without any genuine conviction. It certainly is not advisable to saddle a pack of imperiled individuals in a cocoon of dream-like devastation and not have them equally match the imaginative SF sensibilities of their enthralling, enveloped universe. One can speculate as to whether \u2018Maze Runner: Scorch Trials\u2019 does any justice to the James Dashner epic-driven YA novels or not. Still, there should be a sense of excitable freshness and intrigue to this eye-opening film project that comes off strangely as remote and mechanical despite the whimsical feel to its wasteland of wonderment.\r\n\r\nSure, some will be partially engaged in the exploits of our young harried heroes bouncing from post to post in a desolate desert known as the Scorch where unpredictable encounters with undesirable creatures and the regional elements are recounted with Ball\u2019s simplistic by-the-dots direction. There will be your predictable share of over-the-top villains, outlandish yet awestruck special effects imagery and a centerpiece for youth-oriented romancing among the ruins. However, \u2018Maze Runner: Scorch Trials\u2019 should do a better job in whisking its viewers away in a bells-and-whistles story that should be convincingly subversive and challenging.\r\n\r\nBack in the Maze mold madness is Glade stud Thomas (Dylan O\u2019Brien) and his band of fellow wanderers in Theresa (Kaya Scodelario), Minho (Ki Hong Lee), Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), and Frypan (Dexter Darden). The group had learned that their \u2018a-MAZE-ing\u2019 (sorry\u2026could not resist) past experiences had been at the devilish hands of the evil paramilitary outfit known as WCKD (as in the pronounced word \u2018wicked\u2019). The head honcho of the aforementioned WCKD is none other than diabolical diva Dr. Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson). So now Thomas and his endangered entourage (along with a few more disposable tag-a-longs) are forced to roam in the treacherous Scorch where the ominous run-ins with the resident beastly zombie Cranks are inevitable.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are other factors working against Thomas and his Gladers. First, they must constantly hunt for their safety guaranteed in the arms of the resistance faction called The Right Hand based in mountainous terrain. Secondly, there is also the matter of an outbreak known as the Solar Flare virus that is running amok and the cure is to draw blood from those that are immune.  The underhanded Janson (Aiden Gillen, from television\u2019s \u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019) heads up the laboratory where the shifty agenda for collecting pure blood from unsuspecting hosts is hatched. So the dilemma is presented as such: should Thomas and his put-upon colleagues be the sacrificial lambs in an experimentation that could benefit the numerous lives of their exposed society?\r\n\r\nThe problem, among others, is that \u2018Maze Runner: Scorch Trials\u2019 never seems to distinguish itself among the crop of other YA-related feature films that seem collectively familiar in theme and tone. The long line of impish and impulsive fare that includes \u2018The Hunger Games\u2019 film franchise and \u2018Divergent\u2019 movie series has already saturated the movie market to the point of no return. Unfortunately, this leaves little room for error for derivative knock-off films such as \u2018Maze Runner: Scorch Trials\u2019 to not only echo the same kind of entertainment value but be considered a few notches off the scale in doing so.\r\n\r\nT.S. Nowlin\u2019s screenplay is shockingly synthetic and that is inexcusable for an escapist SF flick using Dashner\u2019s colourful and descriptive tomes as its inspirational source. A few of the interesting supporting characters come and go while registering some servicing interest such as the dashing duo Jorge and Brenda (Giancarlo Esposito and Rosa Salazar) that befriend the Gladers en route to their destination for comfort and calmness. Gillen\u2019s Janson is serviceable as the slimy opportunist blood baiter. Otherwise, the main performers that make up this cosmetic caper bring little to uplift this pseudo calculating landscape of imagined isolation and desperation.  Somehow, the charismatic presence of both O\u2019Brien\u2019s Thomas and Scodelario\u2019s Theresa seem watered down from the first film.\r\n\r\nFor the second time around it is kind of a tough sell for \u2018Scorch Trials\u2019 to get the obligatory mouse to chase after the cheese in this particular misplaced maze.\r\n\r\nMaze Runner: Scorch Trials (2015)\r\n\r\n20th Century Fox\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 11 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring:  Dylan O\u2019Brien, Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Dexter Darden, Ki Hong Lee, Patricia Clarkson, Aidan Gillen, Giancarlo Esposito, Rosa Salazar, Lilli Taylor and Barry Pepper\r\n\r\nDirected by: Wes Ball\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Sci-Fi Fantasy\/Dystopian Drama\/Young Adult Action & Suspense\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)","id":"561a0184c3a3681c28001a40","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/561a0184c3a3681c28001a40","movie_id":294254}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Maya begins in classic horror movie fashion. Vasanth Sridhar, an artist, tells his friend about the story he is illustrating for \u2014 a ghost story from the past involving an inmate in a mental asylum located inside Mayavanam, a forest. He tells how the ghost, Maya, haunts people who call her out and as the disbelieving friend does so to prove that it's all fiction, we see a shadowy figure. We are then told this was a prank but later, a character points out to a smoky form in the video sending a chill down our spine. The action then cuts to Apsara, an aspiring actress and a single mom, who is under financial trouble. She decides to take up the challenge thrown by the director of a new horror film to watch it all alone in a theatre at night. This, despite a distributor dying mysteriously after trying to do the same! Ashwin Saravanan skillfully connects these stories and when we get the revelation on who the ghost actually is and what it is after, it brings a lump to our throats.\r\n\r\nNayanthara has been Maya's biggest calling card but the actress is both a plus and a minus to the film. There is no doubt that she gives it the star wattage needed to create a buzz around the film and make people want to watch it, but her performance is a bland, generic one (even when her character is in a life-threatening situation, her face remains blank and made up) that does nothing to enhance the inherent drama in the script. Replace her with another star and the film will remain as effective as it is now. This is especially felt in the final portions \u2014 she makes the audience feel sympathetic towards the character, but a better actress would have made the audience feel they have a connection with the character. The director also relies too much on jump scares and cliched horror tropes (a ghost with long-flowing hair, headless torso and so on) and these become predictable after some time. The stretch in the forest in the second half, especially, feels overlong and repetitive after a point. The film is also overtly art directed (Ramalingam) \u2014 the arty-chic feel of Vasanth's flat or the poster-filled walls of Apsara's house never give the feel of real places and resemble something straight out of TV commercials. The score (Ron Yohaan), which constantly keys in how we should be feeling, takes away the impact of a few scenes and a minimalist score would have worked even better.\r\n\r\nBut these are minor quibbles and the film is otherwise technically competent. The cinematography (Sathyan Sooryan) superbly captures the haunting shadows that trees cast in the night. One of the plots is in black and white while the other is in colour and even though the scenes play out paralley, the nifty editing (TS Suresh) ensures that it is seemless on screen. The sound design (Sachin Sudhakaran and Hari Haran) is also a huge plus (a scene that takes place with Thiruda Thiruda's Chandralekha song in the background is a highlight) and offsets the overdone score to an extent. These elements combine to whip up an atmosphere of dread that is unsettling for most parts of the film.\r\n\r\nAnd for a debut effort, there is such assuredness in the filmmaking of Maya. Just as Karthik Subbaraj did with Pizza, Ashwin Saravanan seems to have made Maya as a showreel to prove that he has got cinematic flair. Unlike Subbaraj's horror thriller that was a neat feat of pulling the rug from under the audience's feet, Saravanan's Maya is a straight-out horror movie, an aspect that it shares with Demonte Colony. However, there is also genuinely moving emotional drama that recalls Mysskin's Pissasu. But Maya is wholly original and cerebral as well. Even after the film has ended, we keep thinking about it, replaying the scenes in our mind and thinking about the inventiveness in how the plot lines are brought together. And that is its real success.","id":"5604b73592514102730008ae","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5604b73592514102730008ae","movie_id":360251}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A conman and his ghost team!**\r\n\r\nI truly don't know what is the original title. 'Mass' or 'Masss' or 'Massu' or 'Massu Engira Masalimani'. Since 'Mangatha' I haven't seen any Venkat Prabhu's films. He has lost his midas touch. His films are used to be youthful and fun, but not anymore. This was a different than his usual theme, but did not deliver. Particularly, I hated the graphics. Those CGI characters ruined the film in the initial part, I thought it was a very cheap thing I ever seen in a big production film. The action sequences were so stupid as well. The comedies were okay, but still it had lots of references of old films. So you can't enjoy them if you are not familiar with the original.\r\n\r\nSurya is a very dedicated actor that you would find in Kollywood today, but the filmmakers are not using that properly. Compared to any other actors, he does many varieties of films. I watched it only for him and nothing else. I appreciate the experimental theme, but they did not get a better screenplay. The storyline looked decent, especially the flashback, but did not develop well. Like what the title hints, it was too much mass which suits better for Tollywood fans. Might be Surya fans or Venkat's would like it, sadly I'm not one. Surely you will have some laughs, other than that this is not good. So skipping it is not a bad option.\r\n\r\n_3\/10_","id":"5835ddeac3a3682f2a016493","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5835ddeac3a3682f2a016493","movie_id":329134}
{"author":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","content":"A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com\r\n\r\nIn the latest indie to set itself out as an \u2018intelligent\u2019 alternative to the classic formulaic rom-com, \u201cMaggie\u2019s Plan\u201d aims high, makes a strong effort, but sadly fails. It feels like another one of Woody Allen\u2019s more cleverless films, one that has decent enough writing but struggles to elicit any genuine laughs.(This film is written and directed by Rebecca Miller, adapted from the original Karen Rinaldi story).\r\n\r\nEveryone\u2019s favorite quirky hipster actress, Greta Gerwig, is perfectly cast at the titular character. Her charming demeanor works and plays well off of Ethan Hawke, who turns in one of his best performances as a professor of ficto-critical anthropology (if you find his title hysterically funny then you, my friend, are the target audience for this movie), and Julianne Moore (as a brilliant yet cold Columbia professor). The cast gives it their all; too bad these actors don\u2019t have a better script to work with.\r\n\r\nThis messy and uneven film can\u2019t seem to make up its mind regarding the overall tone. It\u2019s part screwball comedy, part hipster philosophy and part family dramedy. There\u2019s a huge emphasis on a toddler (the admittedly cute Ida Rohatyn) that was lost on me as a non-parent. I think the kid stuff is just too much and is completely unnecessary to the story.\r\n\r\nMaya Rudolph and Bill Hader are wasted in unremarkable supporting roles; their characters are never developed and seem to exist solely for a few punchlines (that aren\u2019t very funny). There\u2019s only a shell of a plot and not much ever happens in relation to it. The film is just a bunch of talking and a string of cute incidents that are all (sort of) related to Maggie\u2019s big plan. The film is very strained and the big \u201ctwist\u201d ending is something that only a true moron couldn\u2019t see coming from a mile away.\r\n\r\n**A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com**\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t hate this movie but I also can\u2019t figure out who in the world to recommend it to.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"The opening film, The Lost Paradise by Anil Krishnan, is a silent film about a convict who is released from prison and makes his journey home. It is cloyingly sentimental and the background score is filled with wailing violins that keep nudging us to empathize with the character. Gopakumar's Agavizhi is a genuine head-scratcher (it's a compliment, by the way) involving a triangular romance that as the filmmaker puts it in the end is about the collision of subconscious minds. It if filled with inner monologues (and English dialogues) that will make Gautham Menon blush. \r\n\r\nPuzhu is perhaps the most audacious film of the lot. The director, Charukesh Shekar, throws us directly into the climax of a story and we see two fatally injured men, burning with hate for one another, scrambling to kill the other first. It is shot in black and white with wide shots of the rocky, desolate landscape and extreme close-ups of the two men which give it the effect of a Western. Next, we get a \"message movie\" in the form of Nalladhor Veenai, which is directed by Monesh. It is about a teenaged school student being sexually abused by his tuition master trying to save a fellow student and it checks all the \"message movie\" cliches, confusing in-your-face treatment for hard-hitting storytelling. \r\n\r\nMadhu is totally mainstream. It is about a loser (someone who \"has arrear in committing suicide\") who tries to end his life one more time after the girl he is love with gets engaged, and his two friends try to stop it with the help of the girl. The director, Rathnakumar RM, has a light touch and the lines are genuinely hilarious with some of the vibe of Siva Manasula Sakthi, though he makes an ill-advised decision and slaps the tale with an extended bittersweet ending. But don't be surprised if this short, like Pannaiyarum Padminiyum and Mundasupatti, becomes a feature film in the near future. The final film, Neer, is by Karthik Subbaraj and takes place on a fishing boat in mid-sea, and is about three fishermen (one of whom is played by Vijay Sethupathi) and their encounter with the Sri Lankan navy. You are reminded of the film Neerparavai at some point but it is a quietly powerful that manages to quietly make a political statement as well. \r\n\r\nGiven that even feature films find it hard to get screens these days, the fact that Bench Talkies has managed to find theatres is in itself an achievement. And, as a first-of-its-kind initiative, it makes for a good enough watch, though some of the films and the filmmaking clearly have not managed to transcend the Naalaya Iyakkunar ethos.","id":"5502fac4c3a3685ba6004b15","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5502fac4c3a3685ba6004b15","movie_id":329588}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"Released in 2015 and directed by Daniel Junge, \u201cBeing Evel\u201d is a documentary on the rise, glory and fall of the stuntman who started the sport of motorcycle jumping and was the catalyst to widespread daredevilry of the sort.\r\n\r\nTo let you know how great this documentary is, I decided to check out 15-20 minutes when it was already past my bedtime and I ended up viewing the whole film. It\u2019s THAT compelling. The movie contains interviews with every primary person linked to Robert 'Evel' Knievel, including associates, employees, relatives, reporters and those he inspired. It\u2019s such a fascinating story of a flawed man who was obsessed with success and recognition to the point he regularly risked life and limb. \r\n\r\nFamily members point out that they lost Bobby Knievel to Evel Knieval as he conquered the world with his daredevilry and ensuing fame. To cope with the stress of regularly facing death and the ever-increasing pain of his multiple wounds he turned to alcohol, meds and loose sex. By the time of his Snake River Canyon jump he was so anxious he turned on the reporters, which was a bad move since they were the ground laborers that assisted his fame. After his 1977-78 conviction and six months prison sentence for assaulting the writer of his biography (which everyone involved said was accurate and, if anything, too tame), he lost most of his marketing endorsements and deals, including Harley-Davidson and Ideal Toys, which led to his bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nDespite his glaring downfall, the movie thankfully ends on a very positive note.          \r\n\r\nThe film runs 99 minutes.            \r\n \r\nGRADE: A+","id":"5a9321dc92514107a90112a0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a9321dc92514107a90112a0","movie_id":317655}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Legalism threatens to destroy a family in a remote Texas town that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight***\r\n\r\nA preaching kid wonder doesn\u2019t grow up to become the next Billy Graham as expected, but rather the joyless pastor (Todd Terry) of a small assembly in Nowheresville, Texas. His wife (Ren\u00e9e O'Connor) escapes into romance novels and other temptations while his sullen daughter (Cherami Leigh) plays in a \u201cvampire rock\u201d band. When a strategic crime draws national attention to the town it forces the family to confront their outward issues and core problem.       \r\n\r\nWritten & directed by Andrew Librizzi, \u201cBeyond the Farthest Star\u201d (2013) dragged its feet getting officially released in 2015. It\u2019s an intricate and morose Indie drama in the mold of the outstanding \u201cSnow Angels\u201d (2007), but with a faith-based angle. It basically mixes the style of David Gordon Green (\u201cSnow Angels\u201d) with that of Alex Kendrick (\u201cWar Room\u201d). \"Do You Believe?\" (2015) and \u201cGrand Canyon\u201d (1991) are other reference points in tone & theme, not to mention depth, reverence and wonder. But \u201cBeyond the Farthest Star\u201d had WAY less funds to work with, costing only $500,000. Yet it doesn\u2019t seem like it. Librizzi is an expert filmmaker who knows how to make the most of his limited resources.  \r\n \r\nThe flick is very dense and has the confidence to take its time; it also respects the intelligence of the viewer to read between the lines and figure out details. Every issue presented is real and I\u2019ve experienced them either firsthand or indirectly. Even minor scenes are superbly articulated and acted. You can tell Librizzi spent a lot of time on the script, working out kinks, etc. Speaking of the acting, I\u2019m surprised at how excellent even the peripherals perform, which ain\u2019t no small thing considering the challenge of pulling off the heavy material.  Cherami Leigh is great for her role even though she seemed to struggle a bit at the end (I can\u2019t say anything more without giving away spoilers).\r\n\r\nTwo snippets of songs from the \u201cvampire rock\u201d band are featured and they\u2019re outstanding, the best musical pieces on the soundtrack; yeah, even the Crystal Lewis track \u201cBeauty for Ashes.\u201d Cherami Leigh sings on \u201cDisappearing Act\u201d and I\u2019m assuming the other (even briefer) piece as well. Librizzi should\u2019ve let these songs play out longer; or feature them on the end credits; or, at least, the bonus material.  \r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s arguably too morose and lengthy for its own good, not to mention some elements are awkwardly implemented in the last act, like the Big Mart aspect. Yet, when you reflect on it, everything is there for a reason and makes an important point. I can relate to practically every point one way or another. Still, the conclusion needed more finesse. But, at the end of the day, \u201cBeyond the Farthest Star\u201d is an obscure weighty gem. It\u2019s awe-inducing (and occasionally amusing in a low-key way, e.g. \u201cthink happy thoughts\u201d). The fact that it only cost $500,000 is mind-blowing.         \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 59 minutes, and was shot in Leonard, Texas, which is located about 40-minutes (drive) northeast of Dallas.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-\/B+","id":"5d9a392abb2602002311e923","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d9a392abb2602002311e923","movie_id":228345}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A journey from from one rehab centre to another!**\r\n\r\nThere are some films from this director I liked, I consider them my favourites, but this is an average film. I always like his film story lines and characters, something better than what other filmmakers fails to do. This is another interesting theme and this time it was about the drug addiction. The story of a guy named Charlie, who just turned 18 and being released from a rehab camp for underage people. But his father who runs for the governor wants him to go for adult's rehab right away. He does not want to, but after no other option, he joins and meets a troubled girl Eva. A little romance blooms and followed by how it all ends bring a full stop to the narration.\r\n\r\nLooks a good theme, but the purpose was confusing. Of course, the drugs related issues, especially the film focused on the road of recovery from such addition. But it stayed more real than cinematic twists and turns. One way you will know how it all ends, but some of the characters were unpredictable. The end was good, concludes with a little message. Nick Robinson was really great. Initially I thought it was Jack O'Connell's film, mistook Nick Roinson as him from the poster. Lacks depth in narration, but really a nice film. At least you should watch it for Rob Reiner, if you're not convinced enough.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"5851a41c925141483a0056a9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5851a41c925141483a0056a9","movie_id":358895}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> You can call her the daughter of the Alps.\r\n\r\nNot everybody knows Heidi. People are taking about their favourite versions, but for me this is the first film and I loved it. Now I'm not going to watch the other versions, because I think nothing would surpass this one. I'll stand by my statement till someone convince me over. This is definitely the Swiss version of 'The Secret Garden', except the garden is so big and not a secret. Hailing from a Himalayan nation, I do love the Alps more for its beauty than the snowy and rocky Himalayas. Last month I saw another film theme related to the Alps called 'Brothers of Wind'. So lately I've been watching some fine films, pure children's films where adults too can have a great time.\r\n\r\nI think the casting was good, especially the little girl in the title role. She has given her best despite no prior experience in the acting. So whenever I remember this film in the future, her trademark smile as Heidi is the image I'll be seeing. This is the best family film with an awesome story. It might not make sense compared to the real world, certainly not to be considered as a fairytale. Not just because it has no magics, but it is comparable to Disney films. Very cheerful narration with a steady pace. Blending background score and equally matched greenery locations to the story, overall everything worked in its favour.\r\n\r\nThe film was based on a century old Swiss children's book of the same name. The film runs for nearly a two hours. The story of a young girl named Heidi, who lost both her parents and now she is left in her grandfather's custody who lives high in the Alps. She finally finds a place where she can be happy, but not for a very long. One day her aunt comes back to take her to another house where she will be accompanying a wealthy girl, Klara. After sometimes, the time comes to choose between her new friend Klara and the happy life back in the Alps with her grandfather. How the rest of the story shapes up is the another excellent half with a beautiful conclusion.\r\n\r\n> \"People like saying nasty things. You have to decide whether to trust your own eyes and ears or what other people say.\"\r\n\r\nThe film opens and ends with showing an eagle and we know that the Alps' magnificent creature which depicts the Heidi's life in the human form to go all the struggles to be free one day to soar high under the blue sky. But when she was refused by her aunt and followed by her grandfather, that is the moment anybody with the light heart would end up very sad for the inhumane treatment on a little innocent child. The adult might take it differently, but this film is for children and those who love children as the punchline says from the original book cover.\r\n\r\nFelt like I knew the story, but not really, except I was familiar with similar themes. Even though, pretty predictable and I did not care, but just enjoyed it. Despite all the issues, Heidi was not portrayed in the very harsh conditions. There are some evil characters, but not so terrifying as one from 'Cinderella' story or any other similar. This screenplay might be altered, but I don't know the original material to confirm that. This is a film for families, so the contents from it was balanced to fit on that.\r\n\r\nI think the director did his part so well and so the actors from the front of the camera. The cinematography was another highlight of the film. The camera angles totally caught my attention and I never stopped to admire the great Alps. The final scene in the film where Heidi runs by stretching her hands mimicking the eagle on the mountain along the goat herd, she stops suddenly and turns back to give a cute smile, you definitely don't want the film to end. But obviously you can re-watch like I did because it's well worth. I have not seen many Swiss films, but this is one of the best from that part and surely I won't end my review without recommending it to all.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"57a37adcc3a3683fa70034fe","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57a37adcc3a3683fa70034fe","movie_id":365045}
{"author":"NorthernLad","content":"I'm a huge fan of the found footage genre of horror movies. The bad part of this is, there are so few movies I would actually consider good in this growing branch of horror movies. This year I stumbled across this one and I am so glad I did! I love everything about this movie.\r\n\r\nIt has just the right combinations of creepiness and gore to keep me interested. It doesn't try too hard to impress the audience. It does what movies should do, allow the viewer to go along for the ride while not hitting them over the head with information or trying too hard to scare them. I would recommend this movie to any horror fan. I will be permanently addlying this movie into my top 5 horror movies of all time.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Never too late to fall in love!\r\n\r\nOn the budget of one million and the entire film was shot in less than a month, with not so marketable cast, I would say this film really did great. Critically acclaimed, film fanatics and people enjoyed it, as well as a wonderful box office against its spending. I loved the story which was obviously very simple in the line of 'Harold and Maude', but matured characters and well explored theme.\r\n\r\nSurely the character Doris was specially created Sally Field. She was amazing with other supporting cast. She as a 60 year old falling in love with a younger man who recently joined her office. And so the remaining film reveals how the story evolves with lots of enjoyable comedy sequences.\r\n\r\nThe music was good, especially the costumes of Doris, very colourful. How long we're going to watch the same old, old man romancing a young woman. This reverse was actually a less explore compared to that and this one is very pleasing in all the departments. One of the cute little romance-drama from the 2015 and you should try it if you're looking for a refresher.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"577aa8f8c3a368770e001e4b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/577aa8f8c3a368770e001e4b","movie_id":320588}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A father's desperate attempt to save his sick daughter!\r\n\r\nEven though the film visually resembling with 'Speed', the story was completely different and okay kind. It was from the 'The Tournament' director and has a good cast. De Niro playing a small role is a disappointment, but for his age it was not bad. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was good, but as most of the story takes place on a moving bus, it was not a performance based film, just a crime-thriller with some action sequences.\r\n\r\nThe story of a single father who needs a big sum for his daughter's operation. So he decides to rob a casino where he works which actually goes wrong and end up in a bus with the hostages. The casino men and the cops, both are after him, he's certainly got trapped without any option to get away with it is the film that ends with a decent climax scene.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw Gina Carano in 'Haywire', I thought she might be the next big thing in the female action star world, but disappointed with how her career shaped up. Even for this film the role was not up to her caliber. The story was the film's strength, but if you are focused you could predict some of the scenes. Really well shot film, the production was good and this is where the big stars and the B movie meets. Seen a lot worse than this, so quite enjoyable and instantly forgettable film.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"57c8b37292514148de000aca","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c8b37292514148de000aca","movie_id":336004}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is another one of those movies that you watch primarily for the special effects with you favourite super heroes slugging it out. It is a classical Hollywood product where the story is mostly there just as a vehicle for allowing the special effects team to do their business. As such it is a success.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of with a display of action and the afore mentioned special effects with an attack by the Avengers on a bad guy stronghold. Not surprisingly the events sows the seeds for things to come.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts off with quite an interesting story idea with the activation of Ultron. However, once he materializes as a physical entity, it became a bit of seen that, been there and done that. Ultron just turns into yet another \u201cstandard\u201d comic book villain a\u2019 la Megatron running around trying to look intimidating while implementing his diabolical scheme. Okay, there was a bit of originality here and there but with the good start I kind of expected a wee bit more.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, the movie does indeed fulfil its purpose of showing off a bunch of super heroes slugging it out in a flurry of special effects and, although the story idea was perhaps not used as intelligently as I had hoped, it is not bad (for this kind of movie of course) and hangs together pretty okay. Sure, it is somewhat contrived and the means by which Ultron tries to exterminate humanity is overly complicated but it is still a decent story.\r\n\r\nOverall the movie was entertaining and provided the necessary special effects and super hero fix for those who are inclined to enjoy those kind of movies. I certainly am and, not surprisingly, the kids liked it as well.","id":"5a66d16ec3a3680cfb006191","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a66d16ec3a3680cfb006191","movie_id":99861}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"**A long form review originally posted in 2015:**\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve just returned from two back-to-back viewings of _Avengers: Age of Ultron_, and I do not regret one bit going in for that second helping.\r\n\r\nI lost my steam on the _Age of Ultron_ wagon at a very inopportune moment. About three days before it came out. I was so heavily anticipating it for such a long time, that I was actually much more excited to see this movie when it was still two months away than I was waiting in line to get into the cinema it was playing at. The combination of the market-saturation and the fact that the _Ultron _hype-train has been running for literally years, with a first trailer dropping seven months before the damn thing came out, meant I got weary of the thing just a fraction too soon. But I\u2019m a sucker for the MCU, and there was no way I was missing the sequel to my favourite superhero movie of all time.\r\n\r\nI won\u2019t harp on too much, because I don\u2019t want to spoil anything (especially given that the movie isn\u2019t even out in most parts of the world), I will put out a spoilertalk on this blog at some point down the line, but for now just let me leave you with a couple of quick thoughts.\r\n\r\n_Age of Ultron_ is not the best film of all time. It\u2019s not the best superhero film of all time, it\u2019s not even the best MCU film. Honestly, I personally feel it\u2019s not even the best MCU Phase 2 film. But it is still good. And that\u2019s what\u2019s important here. But what do I mean by that? \r\n\r\nWell, for starters, in and of itself, I loved it, a breach past an 80% approval rating from me is no small thing. The things we enjoyed from the first _Avengers_are here. The mesmerising action spectacles of course, but I more mean the character moments we got between the Avengers themselves, that was my favourite part of the first film and we get it here again in spades. \r\n\r\nEvery new thing Joss has added to the plate works splendidly as well, real Hawkeye story, new heroes, a new villain, an updated world, all of these things are big ticks in lots of boxes.\r\n\r\nSo if everything from _The Avengers_ works and everything they\u2019ve added works great too, why is _Age of Ultron_ not a perfect film? For spoiler-free purposes I will not go into detail, but that\u2019s okay because the answer is quite simple: Everything in _Age of Ultron_ is great. It\u2019s what\u2019s not in _Age of Ultron_ that\u2019s the problem.\r\n\r\nJoss Whedon said that the film had to be cut by nearly an hour. That way you get more showings in, and that means more money. Now I\u2019m not saying we need every minute of that hour back, but what we ended up being left with, was just enough for _Age of Ultron_ to be the _Thor: The Dark World_ of the _Avengers _franchise (it was a far superior film to _Dark World_, but hear me out). _Age of Ultron_ is little more than a holding pattern. The set-ups for future films take up too much time for the story to bear the weight of some actual story, but everything that occurs in the film itself somehow also has virtually no consequence on world it is a part of. I can\u2019t say it more plainly than that: It\u2019s a holding pattern. It introduces some stuff, but it doesn\u2019t stand alone the first film did. It\u2019s not such a big deal when the solo-movies do that (like the aforementioned _Dark World_) because we have _The Avengers_ films for those to pay off in. But when an _Avengers_ entry is just more of the same, I can\u2019t fully get behind it.\r\n\r\nThat all said, _Age of Ultron_ is of course a lot of fun. A huge amount of fun, I can\u2019t state that enough. And there\u2019s literally nothing more important something in the entertainment industry can be. These are just the things holding it back from taking it up to the next level (or if I\u2019m being completely honest, even taking it to the level the first film was at).\r\n\r\n75%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_","id":"5b1678d7c3a3685352018aad","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b1678d7c3a3685352018aad","movie_id":99861}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Not a unique concept, but the rest were completely surprised me.\r\n\r\nTechnically, this was a another version of 'Jumanji', but a different universe. Originally it was not meant to be like that, because it was adapted from a series of children's book of the same name into a single movie. All the characters from the different books (book series) brought into one place, thus 'Jumanji' effect.\r\n\r\nWhen the fictional book characters come into the life, a group of youngsters team up to save the town from invasion. A tale that takes place in one day, especially most of the narration was a one night adventure. Totally an unexpected movie, but still not a masterpiece than just entertaining product. Maybe the actors were the reason, especially inclusion of Jack Black was the turn out. His second collaboration with the director after 'Gulliver's Travels'. And not to forget the CGI work was very acceptable for a little production like this.\r\n\r\nThis theme was a very old, but the characters were unique. Maybe it was a box office lucky, but people won't simply acknowledge for useless things. This film's success was the effort of hard work. I won't surprise if they decide to make a sequel. I meant the same team, not the lower grade filmmakers and actors.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd\/10","id":"57028f24c3a36856a5003379","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57028f24c3a36856a5003379","movie_id":257445}
{"author":"Gimly","content":"I loved the _Goosebumps_ books (and less so, but still, the TV show) when I was growing up. I think if a kid watches this weird interpretation now, at the age that I was then, they might enjoy it. But for me? It didn't work. I actually did appreciate more than I thought I would, but based on the trailers my expectations were **abysmally** low, so that's not exactly saying much.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._","id":"5c447f370e0a266d6bd37e23","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c447f370e0a266d6bd37e23","movie_id":257445}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"She's locked in this house and her dad's a psychopath.\r\nI have to say that being British born and bred I'm not at all familiar with Goosebumps, either the books or TV series etc, so I was going into this film blind as it were. With that in mind I'm not really able to review to fans of the original works.\r\n\r\nI went in with the hope of a good time, I liked the sound of the concept, I like Jack Black and I knew it was going to be well produced and no doubt heavily laden with the latest technological effects (ironically I had watched the splendid Jason and the Argonauts prior to Goosebumps, from one extreme to another or what?!).\r\n\r\nI got everything I expected and had fun without any frame of reference. If I wanted any more I could dig out some questions that would need to be answered, but why bother. I left at the end, as a middle aged film lover, contented. I would for sure keenly watch any sequel if it surfaces.\r\n\r\nDidn't do much for my Automatonophobia though... 6.5\/10","id":"585fb51192514115cf01cb44","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/585fb51192514115cf01cb44","movie_id":257445}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Well the Halloween season 2015 is upon us now and what better way than to cozy up to the youngsters at the box office than offering the innocuous tingly treat Goosebumps? The goofy-minded family-friendly frightfest does have the ingredients to muster up some interest for the little goblins out there looking for hearty rounds of boos and bumps. The question remains: does Goosebumps have the mindless macabre-related mayhem to sell its scatterbrained scary tactics to the trick-or-treat tykes looking for off-the-cuff jitters on the big screen?\r\n\r\nDirector Rob Letterman has armed the frivolous Goosebumps with aimless zaniness anchored on the nutty shoulders of the film\u2019s leading kinetic kook Jack Black. Unfortunately, the loose presentation of combined live action and animation imagery put forth in Goosebumps seemed rather strained and misplaced. Sure, it is noted that Goosebumps reinforce a wackiness rooted in nonsensical hilarity\u2026something considered safe and suitable for the kiddie crowd.  Nevertheless, Letterman\u2019s breezy kiddie creepy caper\u2013even with the free-spirited Jack Black at the helm\u2013registers with a lameness that would have some demanding youths rolling their eyes  for something more hip and edgy.\r\n\r\nGoosebumps is from the imaginative mind of R.L. Stine who has authored the vastly popular children book series while selling millions of copies worldwide. Stine\u2019s aforementioned Goosebumps book collection for young adults (YA) have led to a successful Saturday morning cartoon series as well. Now Sony Pictures Entertainment wants to capitalize on the craze and tap into the youngsters\u2019 consciousness with outlandish Pied Piper Jack Black heading up the charge in this toothless tale of juvenile high jinks.\r\n\r\nOne would think that Goosebumps could up the ante a bit with the backers involved such as screenwriter Darren Lemke (\u201cJack the Giant Slayer\u201d) from a story by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. Both Letterman and Black collaborated on the dud Gulliver\u2019s Travels thus corrupting the Jonathan Swift literary masterpiece with their big screen bomb. Black, who stole the show with his mini-sized co-stars in School of Rock, would be an ideal choice to appear in another children-themed entry mired in outrageous fortune. Unfortunately, Goosebumps merely chalks up its sketchy existence in being a jumbled ball of flimsy foolishness while never really connecting solidly with a cohesive story that brings the frenzied proceedings together. Besides, what could Goosebumps the movie offer in freshness that the countless Stine books and animated program had not touched upon before in its adventurous skin? The answer: not very much.\r\n\r\nFor teenager Zach Cooper (Dylan Minnette, \u201cPrisoners\u201d) the transition in moving to the bedroom community of Madison, Delaware from the hustle and bustle of New York is quite a letdown. Zach\u2019s recently widowed mother Gale (Amy Ryan) relocates for a new job offer and Zach has no choice but to accept his new less-than-stimulating surroundings. However, the one discovery that is about to make Zach a little more accepting of his new home is the pretty neighboring Hannah (Odeya Rush). The main obstacle that stands in the way of getting to know Hannah, sadly, is her over-protective father in stand-offish writer R.L. Stine (Black). The flustered Stine has some major issues with the creativity process when conceiving his characterizations.\r\n\r\nSoon Zach would have to join forces with the Stines and nerdy best buddy Champ (Ryan Lee,\u201dSuper 8\u2033) when he accidentally unleashes R.L.\u2019s monstrous creations onto the small unsuspecting town (it turns out that Stine\u2019s fictitious beastly book protagonists are in fact real menaces come to life). Can Zach and company save the day as these bothersome pests roam the unprotected streets at will? Will Zach earn extra brownie points in winning Hannah\u2019s heart as well as her reclusive father\u2019s approval?\r\n\r\nIt is a mixed bag reception for the scattershot Goosebumps. On one hand many of the ardent followers of Stine\u2019s written work will recognize the inclusion of some familiar notable villainous visitors that feature The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena, Revenge of the Gnomes and Werewolf of Fever Swamp (let\u2019s not forget Slappy the evil ventriloquist too). Plus, some would consider it a bonus in having Black\u2019s unflappable voice-over work earmarked for some of the standby monsters wreaking havoc in random fashion. The CGI special effects register with some semblance of awestruck momentum. Still, the manic moments piggyback one another and the cheap giggles, sight gags and punchy predicaments feel needlessly forced.\r\n\r\nStrangely, Black seems somewhat restrained as Robert Lawrence Stine. In fact, Jillian Bell\u2019s off-the-wall Aunt Lorraine is more of an energetic comical force than the usually high-strung Black. Both Minnette\u2019s Zach and Rush\u2019s Hannah are somewhat serviceable as the Romeo-and-Juliet tandem but they could have played up their on-screen chemistry more charmingly than what was presented by them in inexplicable blandness. As for the supporting adult players they arbitrarily pop in and out without a chance to fully realize their contributions in this flimsy farce geared at the indiscriminate pee wees.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the tots will get a decent rise out of the jolly emptiness that is Goosebumps. As for the rest of us we will probably get a better result in sucking on last year\u2019s recycled stale Halloween candy.\r\n\r\nGoosebumps (2015)\r\n\r\nSony Pictures Entertainment\/Columbia Pictures\r\n\r\nStarring: Jack Black, Dylan Minnette, Odeya Rush, Amy Ryan, Ryan Lee, Jillian Bell, Ken Marino, Halston Sage, M.L.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A vacation, an inspiration for the writing and a complete makeover.**\r\n\r\nThe fourth directional venture for Angelina Jolie, she also wrote it and her real life husband, Brad Pitt starred the screenspace with her in the lead character. This is a tale of a struggling writer who goes to a French seaside resort for an inspiration to write a new material. He takes his wife along and in the peaceful environment, seems they're doing well, until a newly married couple arrive for their honeymoon in their next door. All the complication surface and the old secrets are revealed, so that's how the film sets up and ends.\r\n\r\nI don't know what's with Jolie lately, she's not doing many films as she was before. Maybe her parenting commitment took over her acting career. Good to see her back, but seeing this film and its story, I feel she's really suffering that I don't know what it is. Some day in the near future if someone makes a film about her, that will reveal this time of her life. Anyway, they both looked great on the screen, but very sad they are parting away.\r\n\r\nThis is not some awesome story with twist and turns, just a straightforward drama, mostly the midlife crises in a married life. So here the performances were top notch, other than that is the beautiful locations. It's a two hour long film, not everybody feel comfortable with that, because the pace was very slow and the story is not that interesting. Particularly this film is not for the youngsters, but that does not mean all the grown-up would enjoy it either. Only some people find it better and for me this is an okay film.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"57ed88b0c3a3686cfe0003d4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ed88b0c3a3686cfe0003d4","movie_id":314385}
