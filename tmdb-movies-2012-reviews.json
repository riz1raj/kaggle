{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"We watched this movie more or less by chance last evening. We normally do not have Canal+ in our \u201cbouquet\u201d but they are making a drive right now so everyone can watch Canal+ for a couple of weeks and this movie looked interesting, at least compared to the rest of the choice available that evening, so we watched it.\r\n\r\nIt was a surprisingly entertaining evening movie. It is pretty much a standard Hollywood nonsensical pop-corn movie but it is a well done one. It makes no pretence of being anything else than it is. The story is a fairly predictable action story. Hero gets framed during the introduction scenes. Quick flip to the space prison that is going to serve as the scenery of the bulk of the movie. Dumbass thinks he is more clever than everyone else so he breaks the rules. Goes bad. Prisoners break out. President\u2019s daughter just happens to be there at the same tame. Our hero is sent in to save the day. Action time!\r\n\r\nThere are a few more complications to the story but that is pretty much it. It is a simple and solid story that pretty much holds water. It would have been a fairly standard, even mediocre, movie if it was not for our hero which is doing an admirable job of playing hero and tough guy. The dialog, as nonsensical as it is, definitely lifts the move. The action is fairly good and so are the special effects although it is by no means a movie that is held up by its effects. The main bad guy is a really irritating psychotic son-of-a-bitch. The actor is doing a good job of portraying him but the character itself bugged the hell out of me when watching the movie. He is a bit over the top that has to be said.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the movie was quite entertaining as an evening pop-corn flick and since we picked it more or less by chance and did not know much about it before hand it was indeed a fairly pleasant surprise.","id":"515805c619c295681b1beb1e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/515805c619c295681b1beb1e","movie_id":81796}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I am normally fairly hesitant concerning time-travel movies because it is next to impossible to get them right. They more or less always become very unrealistic and full of paradoxes. I would almost go as far as to say that producers making serious (non-comedy) time travel movies are the ones that are scientifically too stupid to realise that it is just going to be a mess, or they do not really care about the issues hoping that the audience also will not care.\r\n\r\nThis movie is really proof of this. It is full of paradoxes and annoying \u201cbut if this happened now then that couldn\u2019t have happened then and vice versa\u201d. Maybe some people can force themselves overlooking these things but I have some difficulty doing so. I fully agree with the statement that one of the characters in the movie was making: \u201c\"This time travel crap, just fries your brain like an egg\u2026\".\r\n\r\nAnyway, trying to pierce through the cloud of time-travel issues and enjoy the movie, it is not a bad movie. Given that it really had no chance of succeeding in the science area, or have a plot which didn\u2019t defy all logic (time travel you know) it does indeed make a valiant try to entertain. It is not one of Bruce Willies standard all-out action-filled roller-coasters. That is not to say that there is no action but there is also plenty of time for trying to actually tell the story in the movie. The movie is actually quite dark and melancholic. The future seems to be fairly dirty, run down and ridden with criminal organisations.\r\n\r\nAs if time-travel itself wasn\u2019t bad enough the story also involves 10% of the population having developed psychic powers. Most of them good for nothing except cheap show tricks like levitating small objects. Most of them\u2026except our future crime lord which of course is found to have super-psychic powers. Also, of course, the kid had to behave like a spoiled brat with anger problems which was somewhat annoying.\r\n\r\nThe ending, which I will not divulge here of course, was not very surprising and left quite a few open questions. On the whole I would say that the movie was entertaining but it is far from going on my top ten list.","id":"514eafe419c295727a17e39a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/514eafe419c295727a17e39a","movie_id":59967}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Nobody smokes anymore, Snow! \r\n\r\nI was kind of inclined to headline this as being the movie guaranteed to make highbrow film fans froth with incredulity. That anyone could enjoy such a derivative, tongue-in-cheek, low ambition piece of schlock, is surely cause for venomous spleen venting from the serio film brigade. They call them guilty pleasures, but thing is, I just don't feel guilty about having such a wonderfully fun filled great time with the Luc Besson produced Lockout.\r\n\r\nPlot? Well it's the future and basically Guy Pearce (Snow) is wrongly convicted of a crime and sentenced to do stir in stasis until whenever. But up in space at the MS1 prison facility, home to all the maniacs found in \"Demolition Man\", the president's daughter, do-gooder babe Emilie Warnock (Maggie Grace), is suddenly taken captive and it's a big hostage situation. This looks like a mission for a serious hard bastard type! Well \"Snake Plissken\" wasn't available, so they get Snow, who is bulked up, full of wise cracks and has a point to prove. Guess what follows? Yep, complete popcorn frenzy as Pearce and Grace cut a swathe through MS1 and have a date with coolness personified.\r\n\r\nOn the way, via a truly gorgeous sci-fi affected Blu-ray print, we will tick off the homages and influences and compare notes with our viewing partners about how it's a \"Snake Plissken\" movie but with Shane Black type dialogue. While those who are partial to a bit of sci-fi design are well served here. Because even though there might be the worst CGI effects ever during a chase scene (that mercifully only runs for 50 seconds), the space ships, sets and Torsion System sequence, prove that you don't need Michael Bay type bucks to please the eyes. From the quite brilliant and hilarious opening interrogation beat down, to the big reveal and punch line, this Besson produced piece is serving popcorn with a smile to a certain segment in the film watching populace.\r\n\r\nWith bits of the \"Snake Plissken\" movies, \"Fortress\", \"Die Hard\", \"Commando\", \"Demolition Man\", \"Minority Report\", \"Last Boy Scout\" and any other quip laden dude\/wronged man on a mission movie, Lockout clearly lacks originality. But seriously! Was anyone involved playing it as anything other than a sly homage movie? No, they wasn't. Pearce is great fun in the role, but he isn't trying to worry the highbrow crowd's votes for films of the year. Anyone viewing it expecting something cerebral should feel more guilty than those who stand up to say they had a great time watching it.

So it turned out to be full of wasted potential.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"One Mile Away Misses A Trick.\r\n\r\nA frustrating experience all told. One Mile Away takes a lead face member from two of Birmngham's notorious black gangs, and follows their attempts at getting a truce born to stop the senseless maiming and killings that has followed the gang's escalating war. It starts off earnestly and grabs the attention with force, we yearn for Shabba and Flash to succeed, hope springs eternal, could we really see an end to all the death and misery wrung out by denizens of B6 and B21. Yet come the end I found myself at a loss as to how this could win the Michael Powell Award.  \r\n\r\nMy main problem with the film is that the battle for truce vanishes at the midpoint, and it gets to the point where you wonder if there is any point in these young men not killing each other? When the main protagonist proudly tells us that because his gun jammed he couldn't get done for attempted murder of a police man, what are you meant to feel about that?\r\n\r\nThe discussion on the 2011 Mark Duggan riots was utterly bizarre, how can it ever be justified to loot the premises of the innocent? But that's exactly what they condone. The Charlene Ellis and Letisha Shakespeare killings became the nadir of this gang war, but all we get is a small amount of time afforded this critical moment in the troubles. To add insult to injury, we are told that a main boy will only talk on camera if he can expose the injustice of the Ellis\/Shakespeare convictions.\r\n\r\nSo we get one argument against the convictions, which admittedly was a pointed part of the prosecution, and god do we want safe prosecutions always in our societies, but there was a whole case book full of evidence used against those convicted. The film becomes really unbalanced and manipulative, with the director herself being manipulated whilst the protagonists - cum - antagonists, dig bigger holes for themselves from which they sadly can't get out of. Whilst at times it feels like a chance for numerous self promotion of rap records.\r\n\r\nWhat started out as a worthwhile incendiary piece of film, with bold intentions from film makers and participants alike, ends up posing more questions than answers. What started this war? It certainly wasn't just to do with postcode territory, and it is shameful of the film makers to ignore this as a starting point. We don't want people killing each other, no matter what race creed or colour they are, and we certainly don't want youngsters and young men offing each other before they can make something of themselves, but One Mile Away misses a big chance to be viable in today's Britain, and that's a real shame. 5\/10","id":"54d4d6679251417c2300a4b2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54d4d6679251417c2300a4b2","movie_id":117375}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Well, as the blurb says, Lawless is the true (hmmm ?) story about the Bondurant brothers. This is one of the movies that my dear wife picked up. I had no clue concerning this movie until we watched it. It turned out be an enjoyable movie evening. This is a well done movie indeed although I felt like it could have been an even better movie at the end.\r\n\r\nActing, scenery, general story is all quite good. Well the story is okay. It is not exactly ground breaking but rather a standard bootlegging kind of story. The new deputy is a real asshole to the extent of being somewhat unbelievable. Guy Pearce plays the role well though. That goes for the rest of the main cast as well. It is a well-acted movie.\r\n\r\nIt kind of drags on a bit though. The real action where they finally take on the asshole deputy is not until the very end of the movie. Okay, that is perhaps understandable but until then the movie is quite slow. I would not have minded to see both the older Bondurant brothers being a bit more into the action but instead we mostly follow Jack (Shia LaBeouf) on his various more or less silly escapades and romantic adventures which, not very surprisingly, ends up with him leading previously mentioned asshole deputy right to their illegal booze factory\u2026sigh! I am not 100% convinced that you can survive having your throat cut by the way. I think that was rather silly.\r\n\r\nIt is a good movie and of a lot higher quality than most although perhaps not exactly my style of movie and I have to say that I thought the ending, with Forrest blundering into the frozen lake, was rather meh.

{"author":"LastCaress1972","content":"Officers Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Zavala (Michael Pe\u00f1a) are LA beat cops, partnered up a long time. We watch them in action via a number of set pieces, and see that they're cynical enough to interpret the rules as necessary but still by a long, long stretch good and decent cops that will risk their lives in carrying out their duties at a moment's notice. Zavala is already blissfully happily married with a baby on the way, Taylor has just met a sweet Irish gal and over the course of the film we see their relationship blossom and grow. These two men are like the closest of brothers. It's all good to see. One day, their dedication to the job causes them to stumble in over their pay grade into a much larger drug cartel and human trafficking operation than regular beat cops would usually encounter. Homeland Security agents appear, having apparently already been monitoring the situation, and warn our boys that they've bloodied the wrong noses, and they'd better lay low.\r\n\r\nI HATE a dumb actioner, and this ain't that. Well, it DOES contain all of the standard tropes and cliches (buddy cops, stumbling in over their heads into some drug cartel hoo-haa; the bad guys all being relentlessly bad 24\/7, permanently scowling, growling and barking at one another, etc.), but done ever-so-well; reminiscent to me of how [REC] didn't contain anything new or fresh whatsoever, but did all of what it did very well indeed and it came across as fresh as a result.\r\n\r\nIt's shot mostly cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9-style, utilising a plotline in which officer Taylor is shooting a documentary piece for a student course he's taking. However, it switches between between first and third-person narrative a la Modern Family, but when it switches to third-person it retains a very documentary-like feel, so it all feels quite seamless.\r\n\r\nIt wilts a little just past the halfway mark but picks up enormously for the final third. Also, when it's violent (which isn't often), it's unexpectedly VERY violent.\r\n\r\nI'd give it an 8\/10 and recommend that it's worth at least a look.

The story is a great story but not greatly told in this film. That is the \"flawed\" part. The beginning of the movie comes across stiffly including some stiff acting from otherwise excellent actors. The amazing part of this story is that it is true, history that almost nobody - in or out of Mexico knows about.  Some of the cinematography in this film is beautiful.  After watching the movie I went home to read more about this period and found some astonishing facts such as 90,000 people were slaughtered in this very short (and recent) period of time. While the film did not shy away from some graphic violence, I don't think it did a good job of conveying just how dark this period must have been and instead opted for Hollywood style heroes and gunfights.

{"author":"Max Tyrone","content":"I sometimes equate this movie to waking up from a satisfactory sleep with the perfect amount of alcohol in the good ol' intestines, slowly coming to the realization that you have shit to do, responsibilities to attend, new lies to create, new truths to discover. We find Frances in a similar state at the beginning of the film, though she has yet realized the consequences of her actions.\r\n\r\nWhen her best friend, Sophie, decides to move out and pursue other goals, Frances initially ruminates in their apartment alone. Having broken-up with a boyfriend over her refusal to live with him, Frances bounces between living arrangements. For most of this film, all of Frances' decisions seem terminal, as she can never settle in one place - whether it be at Benji and Miles' bachelor pad, France, her parents' house in California, or a dorm at her old university; this coupled with her unfulfilling job as an extra dancer in her company. She soon abandons everything in the interim of Sophie's engagement and move to Japan.\r\n\r\nFor a comedy, the movie has a sadness to it that is inescapable, sadness due to the fact that throughout much of the movie, Frances is alone. The friends she makes come and go, not because she lacks the ability to keep them, but because of the turnstile nature of life. The paths she takes lack a certain introspection and responsibility. Benji's date even points out the superficial economic implications of using a credit card to travel to Paris for the weekend, whereas Frances is more concerned with reading Proust. She ultimately has to face the question of identity in a nomadic lifestyle, and decide between instability and control. It is this viewer's opinion that _Frances Ha_ reaches a conclusion located somewhere in the middle - in that gray area on a drunken night where the room spins around the bed, and the only reprieve is a foot placed on the floor.","id":"58d0631692514159d100032a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58d0631692514159d100032a","movie_id":121986}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"My rating: 4 out of 10 stars\r\n\r\nA young man who survives a disaster at sea is hurtled into an epic journey of adventure and discovery. While cast away, he forms an unexpected connection with another survivor: a fearsome Bengal tiger.\r\n\r\nI did not have huge expectations on this movie since it is not exactly my style of movie but nevertheless I have to say that I was disappointed. The movie is certainly quite beautiful to watch, at least part of it. However it is also a movie with a strong theistic agenda. Even though it is, luckily, not really religious\/political extremism it is thick and intruding nonetheless. I was expecting Pi to actually learn something during the course of his adventure but he does not. He starts the movie gullible and foolish looking for meaning in life (religion) and the movie ends pretty much in the same way with him claiming that he had faith and therefore he survived. Yet none of the decisions he made was based on faith but simply pragmatical decisions of survival. If anything the movie proved that faith or religion had nothing to do with it.\r\n\r\nAs I said the movie was, partly, quite beautiful to watch and this is entirely what rendered it the stars that I gave it. For the rest it was a very boring movie. The only mildly entertaining part was the scenes on the boat with G\u00e9rard Depardieu playing the very unpleasant cook. As beautiful to watch as they were many of the scenes were quite unrealistic though and had an artificial look to them even when, I believe, it was not intended.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"You're a Bad Man!\r\n\r\nThe Cockney Rejects from the East End of London burst onto the scene during the second wave of British Punk. Their angry vocals and spitfire lyrics the perfect bedfellows for a disenchanted 1980s working class Britain. If they are worthy of a 90 minute plus feature length documentary is debatable, given that so many other movers and shakers of the time achieved much more and have equally squalid stories to tell.\r\n\r\nEast End Babylon sadly has many flaws. To pad the doc out to its running time the first half hour is given to a sort of getting to know how rough and tough the East End of London was, a sort of precursor as to why the Rejects were what they were. This is very interesting, but given the lack of Rejects footage from their heyday in the early 1980s that follows for the next hour of film, it comes off as over extended filler. Clearly director and co-writer Richard England has watched Julien Temple's superb The Filth and the Fury and taken notes. Corner cutting is a problem here. Those who know The Rejects story will be well aware of how their song The Greatest Cockney Rip Off was a sarcastic attack on Jimmy Pursey of Sham 69. This isn't mentioned, in fact the boys and Gary Bushell (journo\/manager\/tv guy) give Pursey some good publicity, and rightly so. But if the Rejects clan are now feeling sheepish about this then lets have it! These Punk docs are meant to be stripped down and revealing the truth.\r\n\r\nThen there's the infamous Battle of Birmingham that forms a good portion of the piece. I swear every time I see or read anything about that night at The Cedar Club, the story has new strands. The Rejects boys were blighted by the fact they were tough and fearless, which meant that much like their peers from Sham 69, they had unsavoury elements attached to them. Thus live gigs were a problem, especially outside of The Smoke, The Cedar Club night has been turned into a story of Rorke's Drift proportions. The Rejects boys did indeed battle hard and stand as it were, they had to, they had nowhere else to go, but truth is is that if the dibble hadn't arrived then the headlines in the press the next day could well have been about deaths, as sad and bizarre as that may seem.\r\n\r\nMusically it would have been nice for one of the boys to fess up to lifting Sex Pistol's axe-man Steve Jones' riff from Pretty Vacant for their awesome single, I'm Not a Fool. There's no shame in that, Jones himself lifted Paul Weller's riff from In the City for Holiday's in the Sun. Jonesy really couldn't give a flying fig, you just feel that much of the doc is straining to tell us how street hard the boys were\/are, a bit more focus on the music - some reveals - would have been most welcome. Especially since Stinky and Micky have that splendid cockney wit in delivery. All things considered though, it's great that The Cockney Rejects have made a mark, an awesome Punk band who didn't take any crap from racists, plebeian politicians or otherwise. That there is still a market for them, that their standing in parts of Europe and the West Coast of America, is very high, is testament to their contribution to the essence of Punk Rock.\r\n\r\nThis doc channels much of its energy in the wrong areas, and skirts over key points in favour of machismo over music. A shame, but if this film gets more people to seek out their music then that can only be a good thing. These lairy cockney boys rock. Defo. 7\/10","id":"5464c6e6c3a36804b0001fc1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5464c6e6c3a36804b0001fc1","movie_id":204485}

{"author":"SheBlogger","content":"Tiktik: The Aswang Chronicles (A Filipino Horror Movie) \u2013 From a Commoner\u2019s View\r\n\r\nIt is true what they say that Tiktik is not just your typical action-horror film. Yes, that is very true.  It is action-packed, that I agree. But I don\u2019t think I can categorize it as a horror movie in my book.  The scary factors in horror stories are not present in this film. My rating for Shock and Scare is half a heart. So there, no need to be wary of watching this movie because you have a weak heart.  Tiktik is more of an action-comedy with just a tiny bit element of horror because of the aswangs (human-eating monsters). But for Laughter and Tears, I give it 4 hearts! It was a really fun movie to watch.\r\n\r\nJoey Marquez was his usual tatanga-tanga (funny stupid), but with a big heart, character. I must admit\u2026seeing him again after a very long time of absence in movies, I realized that I kinda missed his antics.  Janice de Belen was also funny as the typical bungangera (nagging) wife and mother. Ramon Bautista, on the other hand, was a nice and fresh addition. Contrary to what I expected, he was not overacting or corny. He delivered a natural and right amount of comic expressions. Lovi Poe also gave what was required from her and did not overdo it. Like what Eugene Domingo calls a \u201cNo Acting Acting\u201d :)   The lines\u2026 the dialogues and their delivery were simply perfect! Even Dingdong Dantes, whom I never really liked, was great at being an ass****. A natural! Oh, I meant that in a good way, okay? Writer-Director of this film, Erik Matti, made the right choices in his personally hand-picked actors to play these roles. \r\n\r\nSo, for Character Performance I give Tiktik 4.5 gems.  Considering that the actors had to act frightened out of their wits by aswangs that they don\u2019t even see. They were all believable. And oh, let\u2019s not forget the aswang characters and their remarkable performances and saliva-dripping appearances. They acted in all seriousness of their monster characters, especially the two patriarchal figures: Mike Gayoso as the avenging father of the mischievous teenage aswangs;  and Roi Vinzons as the powerful head of the Aswang tribe.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to separate ratings for Cinematography and Special FX, since Tiktik was shot entirely in green screen and everything depended on computer graphics animation.  I was really impressed with the opening credits. It\u2019s the first Filipino movie I\u2019ve seen where the creators really put in too much time and effort in the artistry of the opening credits. It was like watching the opening credits of Batman or Spider-man. Well\u2026not really but almost! And that\u2019s saying something, right?\r\n\r\nREAD FULL REVIEW ON: http:\/\/heblogs-sheblogs.com\/2012\/10\/tiktik-the-aswang-chronicles-movie-review\/","id":"5085233819c29547e30003eb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5085233819c29547e30003eb","movie_id":139293}

{"author":"Reno","content":"This little Taiwanese movie was very stylish. The title would definitely seduce and invite those who love romantic-comedies. The same way I managed successfully and more importantly, I liked it very much. Someway the title also reminds me the Korean anime 'Stormy Night'. This was my second movie from the director. A lot different than the first movie, but nothing short in initiating creative ideas to present story in a style.\r\n\r\nIt was a simple love story with an extraordinary exhibition of the film contents. The opening was so fast, you may need some time to get in and pick up the current situation in story narration. It kind of confuses us, especially those who are depending on the subtitle because of the presentation with the stop- motion mode. Soon after you will be well set to enjoy the rest of the voyage.\r\n\r\n> ''Count 1 to 100, if it does not appear, it will never do.''\r\n\r\nI think the guy from 'You are the Apple of my Eye' enthusiastic to find his apple in this movie as well. A lot has improved from the earlier and his performance looks so promising that he can stay longer in this business. Opposite to him the 'One Day' girl did not stay long, sad because it was a lot like a cameo appearance. But the other chick who was the main lead was hypnotized me with her great performance and by her look.\r\n\r\nThere are many things that can be praised, but when it comes to the flaws, not many except the clich\u00e9 at the end. Actually, it was well handled that can please you overall. If you notice, this movie was not widespread and not rated better. I'd say it again this movie is for die-hard romedy fans and probably for lads and lasses. A good entertainer as we ask for and that's enough for a few people like me to have a variety of movies from the different parts of the world.","id":"54208c94c3a3680184000199","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54208c94c3a3680184000199","movie_id":140822}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A serious material in a poor movie!\r\n\r\nI really want to like this movie and rate higher as an honest living person for its contents alone, but as a movie freak it was easy to say the screenplay was a letdown. Not based on the actual incident, but the film depicts how and where these things take place. In fact inspired by the director and producers of this film's own experience during a visit to the Cambodia. This was a movie about human trafficking, in the line of movies like 'Trade' and 'Eden'.\r\n\r\nAn American couple who recently lost their child on a mission in a Southeast Asian city to fight the crime. What they encounter is the crux of the story. Don't anticipate breathtaking stunts and wide human traffic network like the movie 'Taken'. As I expected in this low budget movie, everything was too short including the cast with a simple story. But there is a powerful message, that's the most important and everything else is just a formality for a movie to have a basic thing. Watch it or not its up to you, because in one way worth give a try and in another, it is not.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"5575e8889251413fd2004567","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5575e8889251413fd2004567","movie_id":135595}

In fact the story twists quite early on and has great potential, landing the narrative in a sort of torture porn revenger universe, but the makers then rely far too heavy on this aspect and the dialogue is only matched in banality quotient by the plot holes. \r\n\r\nEven the brutality factor quickly gets boring, it\u2019s like covering for inadequacies elsewhere by thrusting the violence to the front to try and save the movie.

I felt it was surprisingly mediocre and very \u201cHollywood\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe good parts are the flight scenes and the special effects. They are enjoyable to watch and reasonably well done. However, that is pretty much what makes up this movie in terms of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nI would say that a lot of it is not very realistic. The German anti-aircraft guns seems to be next to useless most of the time for instance. Also, there is the scene where a single P51, armed with nothing but machine guns, takes out an armed German warship in two quick runs. That felt quite unrealistic.\r\n\r\nA lot of the film also felt too much like some Hollywood drama. Some of the pilots behave like morons and in real life they would have been shot down rather quickly. The alcohol problems and the romance seems to have been thrown in just to appeal to the American soap-opera viewers. The entire movie is very shallow and if it was not for the budget and special effects it could very well have been a TV-movie.\r\n\r\nMost of this movie I was yawning in my seat and waking up only when the flight action started so that I could watch the special effects.","id":"534a46b30e0a2629dd0004a2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/534a46b30e0a2629dd0004a2","movie_id":72431}

Why would you want to watch any Resident Evil movie come to think about? Good acting\u2026nope. Intelligent and intriguing plot\u2026absolutely not. Zombies\u2026yep. Action\u2026most definitely yes! Anything else\u2026well if you\u2019re member of the younger part of the average male population you probably watch it for Milla Jovovich as well.\r\n\r\nNow that we have established the baseline for the movie, does this movie deliver? The answer to that is, without a doubt, YES! This film delivered exactly what I expected of it. As I mentioned it is the 5th movie in the series and the entire series is sprung from a video game in the first place so it should really be no surprise that the film is one long video game action sequence sporadically interrupted with some dialog. Yet a lot of people seems to expect something else and judges the movie by those expectations.\r\n\r\nI think those really low rating are quite unfair. The movie does indeed deliver what I think you should expect. A lot of the action scenes are marvellous. The slow motion scenes are well done and enjoyable unlike some movies where they are just annoying. The zombies and other monsters are good. And yes, I confess that, although I\u2019m hardly among the younger part f the mail audience anymore I do like watching Milla Jovovich jumping around in the scenes in those ridiculous skin tight suits.\r\n\r\nIf I should complain about anything it would be that I sat through half the movie being annoyed that nobody would get the, painfully obvious, idea to rip that red mind control gizmo off Jill\u2019s chest. When it was finally done in the end it was like \u201cdid you really have to take that long to get that idea into your head you dumb bastards\u201d.\r\n\r\nI cannot really give the movie a top rating since it does lack much of a story after all but I certainly think it is worth 7 out of 10 stars. I enjoyed myself a lot while watching it. The ending is the usual video-game-movie cliff-hanger and I really hope they make another sequel now when Alice got her powers back.

Crime rate is nonexistent in\u00a0Taeter City\u00a0thanks to radio waves named the Zeed System that targets would be criminals and cause them to kill themselves in very nasty ways they then are processed at mega slaughter houses and have their flesh turned into food and blood into energy drinks which are then sold to law abiding citizens in Authority ran McDonald-esq restaurants know as Taeter Burger. Eating and farming animals is totally outlawed punishable by\u2026 Well you get it!\r\n\r\nEverything is going peacefully in\u00a0Taeter City\u00a0until the radio waves have an abstract reaction on one fellow played by Director, FX guy and head of Necrostorm the awesome looking Giulio De Santi, instead of Suicidal he becomes Homicidal, develops super strength and can admit rays from his mouth that turns others into Homicidal\/suicidal Super killers. When a scientist explains this he adds \u201cDon\u2019t ask me why, it\u2019s Fucking nonsense, it\u2019s all Fucking Nonsense\u201d Yes Doc it most certainly is but all the better for it.\r\n\r\nThis film doesn\u2019t really play for laughs it is presented very seriously and is all the more hilarious and fun because of this. This film promises \u201cAn 80\u2019s Movies Vibe, insane technology, Manga style crazy action, Adrenaline, Violence, Blood, Blood and again Blood\u201d and boy it delivers on all those fronts. Delivering some of the most brutal creative Splatter action ever caught on film it has to be seen to be believed these effects are achieved by combining Practical with CGI which works a treat.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I enjoyed this movie as a no-brainer action\/thriller flick. Sure, it has a bunch of illogical and idiotic elements in but I have seen a lot worse. The movie certainly do not deserve the ridiculously low ratings that some people have given it.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps not as good as the first movie, mostly due to the silly bits and pieces, but as a plain vanilla action\/thriller it is certainly passable. I generally do like Liam Neeson. I did like him in the first Taken movie and I do like him in this one. The other actors with the possible exception of his wife and daughter are mostly there to fill up the scenes.\r\n\r\nAfter a semi-dull beginning which is pretty much just setting up a reason for them all being in Istanbul, Bryan and his wife is, surprise, surprise, taken and that is pretty much when the action starts and from there on it is pretty much action all the way.\r\n\r\nAs have been mentioned, there are a lot of stupid things happening in the movie. Dropping grenades in the middle of Istanbul seemingly without anyone really reacting for instance. Bryan\u2019s daughter have failed to take a drivers licence in the states several times but still, when thrown into a car with a manual gear stick, she handles the car like a stunt driver. Then we have a violin player that sits in the same spot all the time? Not to mention crashing into the embassy while being fired upon by the embassy marine guards and then they can just sit there in the wrecked car, in front of the embassy, while Bryan calls for help from some guy playing golf in the states.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the Luc Besson didn\u2019t really put realism very high on his agenda for this movie. But then this wouldn\u2019t be the first time for him. Overlook the silliness and you have a decent enough action\/thriller flick. At least I enjoyed it and I am normally not too forgiving when it comes to stupid and unrealistic stuff in movies.","id":"5161178919c2956a0e0780de","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5161178919c2956a0e0780de","movie_id":82675}
{"author":"LastCaress1972","content":"This is my third pass at writing down my thoughts on The ABCs of Death. The first pass - as soon as I'd seen it - was almost completely negative, which in the light of day probably wasn't fair. The second pass was too positive; it just wasn't true. All I know for sure from both is that I want to rate it 3\/5 AND label it: \"Recommended\". This review is going to be similarly all-over-the-place, which I guess is entirely apt for a film as scattershot as this one.\r\n\r\nEssentially: 25 directors from all corners of the globe (plus one competition winner) were assigned a letter of the alphabet and tasked with making a short film - five minutes or so, give-or-take - relating to the letter of the alphabet to which they'd been assigned and to the subject of death (according to one of the entries - Adam Wingard's Q - they were assigned a budget of $5000 each although how true that is, I don't know). Beyond that, each director has free reign over what form their short takes. And that's it. There's no wraparound tale (V\/H\/S), no arcing narrative running through the stories (Trick 'R Treat), no recurring characters (Pulp Fiction) or motifs (Coffee & Cigarettes).\r\n\r\nIt should go without saying of course that this leads to wildly differing results, not only in terms of content but in terms of success as well. That's true of any anthology piece but it's even more acute here given a) the incredibly short time allotted to each piece and b) the \"A, B, C...\" nature of the film which prevents the film's producers Ant Timpson and Tim League from placing the shorts in an order that might build a momentum, leaving the best 'til last (in fact, the very worst comes last, of which more later). The bad entries - and there are more than enough - are SO bad that it almost derails the entire movie. As I said, last night having just watched it I felt very negatively about the whole experience. However, there ARE some good entries and even a few great ones, and... well, let's just go through them (I'm not going to name them by title since one or two titles - which are only revealed at the end of each short, not at the beginning - represent pretty decent plot reveals in their own right, so to print them here would constitute a spoiler. I'll just refer to them by their letter):\r\n\r\n\"A\", \"B\" & \"C\" - The movie's off to a strong start with three Spanish-language tales from Spain, Argentina and Chile respectively; \"A\" kicking things off in start-as-we-mean-to-go-on gory fashion about a woman attacking her husband, the context around which is not given to us until the very end, \"B\" about a fairy tale that may not be as fictional as the protagonists suppose and \"C\" about a Twilight Zone-style time-travel paradox.\r\n\r\n\"D\" - From Marcel Sarmiento (Deadgirl), this dialogue-free piece about a scuzzy backsreet illegal-gambling fight 'twixt a man and a ferocious Labrador (I know, I know, but trust me) is rightly garnering praise all around the internetz as the best piece of the bunch. That this short is in the same movie as some of the poorer later efforts is an affront to good moviemaking, really. It deserves better. At this stage, The ABCs of Death is absolutely rocking.\r\n\r\n\"E\" - A slightly lighter, Creepshow-style effort here about a guy trying to rid himself of a rather persistent spider. Many of us can relate. Decent entry. We're in really good shape at this point.\r\n\r\n\"F\", \"J\" & \"Z\" - I've lumped these together since they're all from Japanese directors attached to the Sushi Typhoon production company, and if that means anything to you then you'll know what to expect from these entries and whether you're going to love them or absolutely loathe them (there's little middle ground; it's essentially all latex-heavy \"zany\" super-bizarre splatter\/humour. Ever seen any of Peter Jackson's early films? Bad Taste, Brain Dead and the like? That, x 10,000). Personally, I detested them. \"F\", by Noboru Iguchi, a man who used to make adult specialist fetish videos for the Japanese porn market (example titles: Real Beautiful Young Lady Stools: Lolita Lavatory and Beautiful Girl Excretion School, both of which point to some degree towards \"F\"'s subject matter) and about a girl who would rather inhale the... um, gases of her lesbian crush than those of a toxic volcano which has belched poisonous fumes into the air, killing everyone, was so shockingly poor - although my girlfriend laughed out loud at it - that even though it was the first truly weak entry in The ABCs of Death, it soured me and altered my stance on the film for the remaining duration of the movie. \"J\" - about what appears at first to be one man putting another off his stride by pulling funny faces - was easily the best and most restrained of these three, but it was still unimpressive. \"Z\" - by Yoshihiro Nishimura (Tokyo Gore Police), a highly-regarded writer\/director and effects artist in Japan - is arguably the shittest thing I've ever seen. God knows what it's about, it's one of those sorts of films. What I CAN tell you is that there's a naked bitch shooting root vegetables out of her cunny at another naked bitch with a huge inflatable cock (complete with breadknife cock-eye attachment), whilst some guy apeing Peter Sellers' Dr. Strangelove character watches on. With his cock out. I'm making it sound miles better than it is, it's truly dreadful.\r\n\r\n\"G\" - First-person-perspective film about a guy who goes surfing. From Aussie director Andrew Traucki, he correctly guessed that everyone would go over-the-top with their efforts and decided to go the other way. More thoughtful, gore-free, more contemplative. Unfortunately he went TOO far. It feels unfinished, and dull. Possibly the most forgettable entry in the film.\r\n\r\n\"H\" - A bizarre live-action cartoon from Norwegian director Thomas Malling (Norwegian Ninja) featuring a WWII Allied forces bulldog falling for the wily charms of a writhing Nazi pussycat in a burlesque club. Cue eyes out on stalks and tongues rolling out of mouths like carpets in full Looney-Tunes style. Meh.\r\n\r\n\"I\" & \"R\" - I'm lumping these together not because they're connected at all but because, to me, they're both similar inasmuch as they're clearly very well made and photographed, there is clearly talent here, but IMO they both represented wasted opportunities. \"I\", by Mexican Jorge Michel Grau, lacked sufficient context around its central image of a woman tied up inside an empty bath while a possibly apprehensive man injects her with... something. \"R\", from A Serbian Film's Srdjan Spasojevic about some sort of hulking prisoner whose skin when peeled by his captors turns into reels of film (I think) is obviously saying something to me in very blunt subtext, but I guess I'm too stupid to get it.\r\n\r\n\"K\" & \"T\" - Two animated shorts, both toilet-related. \"K\" - a cartoon about a woman trying to flush a sh*t she's just taken - didn't do it for me at all although again, my gf laughed, but \"T\" - a claymation effort and the entry which won it's place on The ABCs of Death via a competition as opposed to being a piece entered by a director who'd been invited to participate - is surprisingly good, concerning a toddler's fears over graduating from the potty to the grown-up bathroom.\r\n\r\n\"L\" - Powerful and disturbing entry from Indonesia, centering around sexual perversion and... um, performance, let's say. Some scenes - thankfully just off-camera - are among the most upsetting of the movie. Well made, glad I saw it, don't imagine I'll watch it again anytime soon.\r\n\r\n\"M\" - Looking around numerous sites, this entry from Ti West (House of the Devil, The Innkeepers, V\/H\/S segment: Second Honeymoon) appears to have polarised people, some suggesting that it's one of the more powerful entries, it sticks with the viewer and it's typical (in the good way) of West's output; basically, nothingshappenningit'sallabitdullandthenBANG! All-of-a-sudden, a kick to the bags right at the end, others deriding it as lazy, and even an insult to the project. I agree with the former argument although I understand the latter, West's entry being easily the shortest of these shorts, and the most uneventful. If they really WERE given five grand each to make these films, Ti West must have trousered most of it. His piece could've been done on a fiver. Still, where some have seen that as an affront, I see it as pretty cool that the director can still pack the same trademark wallop on so very little. You'll note I haven't mentioned what it's about, but it's honestly so short that I can't; to say anything at all is to spoil it. Um, a woman needs to use a plunger. How about that? That's as much as I'm saying.\r\n\r\n\"N\" - A comedy piece centering around a parrot that won't shut up - ever seen that episode of Frasier where Niles' parrot won't shut up? Same shtick here, pretty much - from Thai director Banjong Pisanthanakun (Shutter). Light and undemanding, not a great piece by any means but a welcome bit of relief that for once has managed to BE light without being zany or bizarre.\r\n\r\n\"O\" - I'm going to \"spoil\" this one since it has no discernible plot as such anyway: \"O\" is for \"Orgasm\", and it's a waste of time which most closely resembles one of those pretentious and abstract perfume commercials that clog up the TV around Christmas time. I fully expected someone to growl \"Chanel. Eau de Parfum\" in voiceover at the end. Rubbish.\r\n\r\n\"P\" - Dialogue-free, quick-cut, gritty and well shot piece from British director Simon Rumley (Club le Monde) about a woman doing... well, what she needs to to pay the bills. Ooh, my girlfriend didn't like this one.\r\n\r\n\"Q\" & \"W\" - Two \"meta\" entries, both concerning the tribulations of the directors themselves as they struggle with what to do as the subject of their short film for The ABCs of Death. And they couldn't be more different, Adam Windgard's (You're Next, V\/H\/S segment: Tape 56) \"Q\" being a light, self-deprecating and humourous tale of Adam's attempts to \"actually\" kill an animal on his segment, and Jon Schnepp's (Metalocalypse, from [Adult Swim]) \"W\" being, well, an absolute mess. In fact, sod it, I'm going to spoil this one too; \"W\" is for \"WTF\", and I suspect that's because the director f*cked up his random collage of goofy splatter images so badly that even he couldn't make hide nor hair of it by the end. Coming as close to the end of the film as this does and in tandem with the similarly unwatchable \"Z\", these shorts are what sour the film almost irretrievably, and probably explain why I was so very negative immediately upon having seen it.\r\n\r\n\"S\" - From British director Jake West (Doghouse), what appears to be a purposely retro, washed-out, poorly-acted car chase involving Death himself becomes... something else. I really liked this one, once it had played out. Very good.\r\n\r\n\"U\" - A final-reel fight scene told from the monster's perspective, made by Kill List director Ben Wheatley and reuniting Kill List stars Neil Maskell & Michael Smiley. Nothing wrong with it but I came away disappointed anyway. That was probably down to my expectations for this one though.\r\n\r\n\"V\" - from Canadian writer\/artist Kaare Andrews, and you can tell that this man specialises in superhero comic books. Another mis-step, this one, although this time it's an honest mistaken attempt to make his micro-budget spread over an ambitious futuristic action sequence featuring robots, mutants and Robocop-sized gunplay. At least it was a stab at something substantial, though. Too many of these directors just decided they couldn't tell a tale with the time\/budget restraints, and went bizarre\/abstract instead.\r\n\r\n\"X\" - From French director Xavier Gens (Frontier(s), Hitman), this is a brutal, grisly and memorable piece about an overweight woman, mocked constantly for her weight (or at least, perceiving herself as being mocked; whatever they may think, grown adults aren't generally as in-your-face cruel as this womans tormentors are as she commutes to her apartment), who decides that she really wants to lose weight. Like, NOW.\r\n\r\n\"Y\" - From Jason Eisener (Hobo with a Shotgun, a film I thought was great the first time I saw it, a little tedious the second time and just poor the third time), this really pretty good dialogue-free tale of a creepy school janitor with an unhealthy interest in the young boys within is marred for me by the same purposely retro red\/green saturated lighting and hokey eighties synth soundtrack which served initially as such a successful parody\/homage in Hobo with a Shotgun but which was maybe SO effective that it ended up being hard to tolerate. In this short, these things just detract from what is, as I said, a decent tale.\r\n\r\nPhew! Well, there you have it. A very mixed bag of a movie, and ultimately I think one who's ambition overstretches its limited reach. 26 tales is just TOO much, both for the filmmakers who can't do enough with the time allotted AND the viewers, for whom 26 shorts - some incredibly grisly, some in shockingly poor taste - represents a trial of endurance. Because of these fundamental flaws and because of the numerous meh-to-poor-to-absolute-dogsh*t short films on display here I can't possibly mark The ABCs of Death too highly, but because of the superior, more memorable pieces I nevertheless have to recommend that you see it for yourselves. At the very least, if there's something you don't like there'll be something completely different to look at in a few minutes.","id":"5207b08d760ee36305224e4b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5207b08d760ee36305224e4b","movie_id":87436}
{"author":"narrator56","content":"I really can't imagine how either side of the creationism issue ended up happy with this film. On the scientific side, they must believe that Mr. McElroy was treated with kid gloves. Mostly his beliefs that the world is 6,000 years old and that evolution doesn't exist is presented and allowed to stand or fall on its own merits. (No one asks him, for example, how the two penguins walked thousands of miles in time to jump onto the ark with the dinosaurs and the incestuous handful of humans} Perhaps the earth was not only younger than science believes but smaller also.\r\n\r\nAnd on the Creationists' side, they must have been disappointed that a light would be pointed at their efforts, perhaps making their further editing of history and science more difficult when the textbooks come up for revising again. I thought it was also interesting that the creationists were allowed to import slick outside experts while the science side only had access to Texas experts. That scientist was eloquent and smart, but for the bigger picture presented by the Social Studies issues, the scientist probably wished someone more knowledgeable in history and philosophy could have been present. Not that it matters, as often happens in partisan politics, the game was rigged by the votes anyway. It was ironic that Mr. McElroy stated he was taking a stand against experts because someone had to (he didn't say why someone had to), but then he set himself up as an expert when he taught young schoolchildren how big the ark was and where they put the dinosaurs and dinosaur effluent. (My favorite moment was when he called out \"Were there dinosaurs on the ark?\" and the kids called out \"No!\" So he had some work ahead of him converting them to his narrow world view.\r\n\r\nThe real revelation is one thing political organizers on both sides of every issue will agree on: if you don't think your vote or interest counts for much in a national or statewide election, in a way you are correct. Though in another way, obviously, every vote counts. But as the elections scale down to county or city wide issues, you can make a difference, and letting others do it all can be dangerous and, well-intentioned or otherwise, cause things to be done with a very small percentage of public support or approval. So attend or at least follow your local council meetings. We can all be wrong sometimes, but there aren't many awards given out for ignorance or apathy.\r\n\r\nThis film could have been presented in a hundred different ways from numerous angles, but it is good that at least one version of the story of how history and science in school textbooks can be manipulated or eliminated to support a political viewpoint, any political viewpoint, is out there.","id":"5e89bd45cf1afd00166cc1f1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e89bd45cf1afd00166cc1f1","movie_id":106049}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I just happened to find this movie in the program listings yesterday. Movies based on Edgar Allan Poe can be a bit hit or miss but I like quite a few of his works so I decided to give this one a try. I have to say that it is surprisingly good. The Victorian era setting together with the rather dark plot and atmosphere makes for a very enjoyable old times thriller. The movie is based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe but not in the usual way that one would  think when one says based on. Instead the story in this movie is a new story spun around Edgar Allan Poe as a person where his work is used by the evil mastermind in that the various stories are re-enacted in real life\u2026with deadly results.\r\n\r\nI, for obvious reasons, have no idea how Edgar Allan Poe was as a person and I did not really have any pre-conceived opinions before watching this movie either. I can imagine that he, as a poet and writer of rather grisly stories, might have been a wee bit excentric though so to me John Cusack\u2019s performance as the rather excentric, somewhat alcoholic and sometimes almost insane but still brilliant Edgar Allan Poe was a very good one. Not that the rest of the actors are below par by any means.\r\n\r\nThe story, if you take it apart and remove the parts taken from Poe\u2019s original works, is not really something to jump up and down over. However, put it together with the bits and pieces from Poe, add the characterization of Poe by Cusack, the dark Victorian ambiance and generally well implemented cinematics and you have a movie that is, as I wrote above, surprisingly good.","id":"53f5e899c3a36833fa0038bd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53f5e899c3a36833fa0038bd","movie_id":70436}

It gives the pleasure to enjoy those running and chasing and mistakes, sometimes very edgy. This is the story that happens within the 24 hours of a 19 year old carefree Adam. When takes-up the driving job to a hitman, he goes all sorts of difficulties and overcoming it is the remaining narration.\r\n\r\nRecently, Jack O'Connell is soaring high with the movies like 'Starred Up', '71' and three Academy Award nominee 'Unbroken'. I would say this film is the turning point in his career. In the earlier films he was merely hanging around with his roles, but he showed lots of promise with this one. Now he's the Britain's latest young sensation and Hollywood is showing interest in him. It's just a matter of time to grab his own spot there.\r\n\r\nIt is so sad that from the movie posters to promos are not enthralling and the online ratings for it is too low. But it was twice better than what do you see. Of course it was a slow start, but after the opening few minutes, it was completely a different movie and very entertaining.

Sandler and his writer, David Caspe, blend edgy offensiveness with base juvenile comedy, throwing erection and sperm gags together with incest and statutory rape was always going to be tricky to successfully pull off, even more so when Sandler and co seem to think shouting loud makes scenes more funny. It's just that it never comes off as a funny whole, just a series of mind farts dotted alongside a potentially warm bonding between estranged father and son thread.\r\n\r\nNext to this Little Nicky looks a masterpiece!

{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"So here we have it. The end of a trilogy, the end of an era of the universe of Batman through the eyes of Christopher Nolan. And baby, it goes out with a bang...\r\n\r\nGoing into the theatre tonight I actually wasn't sure what I was up for. I loved Batman Begins, but I didn't actually care that much for The Dark Knight. So the big question was, will TDKR actually be more like the first or the second film? The answer is: neither.\r\n\r\nThis third instalment of the Nolan-franchise carries its weight all on its own merits. Despite the lack of any kind of intro or opening credits, there actually is plenty of build-up (partly thanks to the insane opening scene). The foundation for a proper, action-packed story is laid down perfectly, explaining things just enough whilst keeping the viewer intrigued to find out more. But if you thought that Nolan couldn't surpass his previous work, you will be pleasantly deceived.\r\n\r\nChristian Bale as Batman is terrific. Never before was a superhero so human, so vulnerable. As his mask of intangibility and anonymity slowly starts to crumble, this is a man who questions his reasons to keep being who he is, and he must figure it out before it is too late. Because somebody\u2019s preparing to take him and Gotham down, and he might just be too strong for the Batman...\r\n\r\nThis somebody is a character called Bane. As a character, an actor and a performance it must be incredibly hard to follow Heath Ledger's The Joker, which was easily one of the greatest villains to ever appear on the silver screen. But tonight, Tom Hardy took a swing for the fence... and made it. His performance is thrilling and actually frightening, in the sense that you don't just *know* you're supposed to be afraid of this character, you actually FEEL it. He instils a feeling of horror and discomfort that is not rivalled by many other film villains. What I actually liked about his character the most is the fact that unlike Scarecrow, who grew into being a villain, and the Joker, who was just a raving maniac, Bane was actually (literally) born from evil. Born in hell, as it is said in the film. This is not a man, this is a creature. A living, breathing manifestation of evil that cannot be reasoned or negotiated with. Hardy's performance is masterful. Since his creepy mask is never removed, he, like only a few actors before him, must act without the use of any facial expressions, making his voice is main tool. His manner of speech (and the sound of it through his mask) is enough to send chills down your spine. This is more than just a another villain from a superhero flick, this is a character that just got torpedoed into the top 10 of the greatest antagonists in the history of film. Now I realise that's a bold statement to make, but you just go and watch TDKR and prove me wrong.\r\n\r\nI would say a slight downside to this film is the overflow of characters, both new and old. Aside from the already familiar characters, three new major ones are introduced. And there are also many characters running along in the margin which may seem not important enough to pay attention to, but actually they are so you need to stay focused.\r\n\r\nI understand the character of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Blake, was written in specifically for him because Nolan wanted him in it. And although as a character he works just fine, it does feel like it was at the expense of Gary Oldman. As a cop, Levitt does everything that Oldman's character could've done, but he spends most of his screen time in the hospital, almost like they wanted to get him out of the way, and that's really too bad.\r\n\r\nNow, I was extremely excited to see what Nolan had done with Catwoman, because she is one of my favourite film characters. When I heard that she would be played by Anne Hathaway, I had my doubts. I thought she was just way too sweet to pull this off. But I must say, Ms Hathaway did a pretty good job. She is actually much more sly and devious than I thought she could be. The Nolan brothers, on the other hand, disappointed me here. Catwoman isn't really Catwoman, she's just a sexy girl in a spandex suit who can kick your ass. Her movements aren't even typically cat-like... So that was a bit of a letdown.\r\n\r\nI would also like to make a note on Michael Caine. I think his performance here was so much deeper and more character-driven than the other two films. In fact, there is one scene in particular, where he confesses something to Bruce, that almost moved me to tears. And this is actually TDKR\u2019s greatest strength; unlike the other two films, this one deals much more with actual human emotions, it gives us an insight into what actually drives these characters, both heroes and villains alike. \r\n\r\nAs much as I would love to, the word-limit restricts me from elaborating more on the characters, so I'll just move on to the technical stuff. And in that department, actually pretty much everything was perfect. The pacing was very well balanced, and during those 2 \u00bd hours I didn't get bored once. Great action scenes alternate with more quiet moments, and the special effects are absolutely awesome. Hans Zimmer once again delivered a terrific score and there was some high quality dialogue. Also in store: a couple of great plot twists and two very cool cameos... There are a few plot holes, but everything else easily makes up for it. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend The Dark Knight Rises. It is a worthy conclusion to the trilogy, and it far exceeded my expectations.\r\n_(July 2012)_","id":"58ac509892514158bc0151ca","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ac509892514158bc0151ca","movie_id":49026}

{"author":"Dali Parton","content":"This movie is about women, but as a guy I am going to write about it from from my perspective. If any men had spoken lines, I can't remember them. Men still had a role, but mostly as off-screen foils for the women. Despite all that, this is a movie with a lot more to offer viewers of both sexes than stereotypical chick-flicks like The Notebook or the majority of rom-coms.\r\n\r\nIt is a story about three women in NYC coping with their own personal sets of dysfunction in a variety of tragicomic ways, with emphasis on the comic. The humor is not so over-the-top like Bridesmaids or Bachelorette, but there is plenty of raunch starting off with the opening scene in which one of the women cancels her appointment for a Brazilian wax and makes do with about 5 disposable razors instead.\r\n\r\nThe three main characters have their backstories revealed in a series of quirky events that include jail, subway masturbation, really bad haircuts, plenty of drugs and alcohol, coffee house lesbians, a vibrator used as a lethal weapon and an entire showgirl kick-line falling off the stage because of one act of revenge. It culminates in an estrogen-soaked version of the brawl between buddies trope after which they all raise a glass to various universal ideals with a feminine slant.\r\n\r\nThe movie is much more low budget, low-key, talky and character driven than the blockbuster comedies we've all seen or at least seen marketed. That isn't a bad thing at all, it's got a lot more verite than those and is still a fun little film.\r\n\r\nBest one-liner in the movie: \"Stop fighting, I'm getting carpal tunnel.\"","id":"589c4c03c3a36874ce00364b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/589c4c03c3a36874ce00364b","movie_id":84345}

{"author":"LastCaress1972","content":"The Lords of Salem is the latest film by industrial rocker-turned-auteur Rob Zombie, and I think it's a good'un, although it's already polarizing people.\r\n\r\nSheri Moon Zombie (Rob's wife who features heavily in all of his movies, though this is her first star turn) is Heidi, a recovering addict and local rock DJ in Salem, Massachusetts, site of the infamous witch trials of 1692. She receives a vinyl record in a wooden box from a band apparently called The Lords, who later on also inform the station that they are performing a one-off gig in the town. Upon playing the record at home however, Heidi experiences migraines and hallucinations of a 17th century coven, performing some manner of birthing ritual, apparently attempting to bring Satan himself to mortal life. Her male DJ colleagues simply experience the tune as a weird, rather turgid dirge (although it'll stick with you like a demonic earworm) and play it over the air on their rock show, where it acts as a sort of trance-inducing spell on many of the women listening. From there on in, Heidi's mental state begins to deteriorate and the migraines\/hallucinations increase, not helped by her return to drugs or by her peculiar landlady and her two friends, all of whom seem creepily interested in Heidi and what her \"fate\" might be. Her \"fate\" as it turns out is attending this Lords gig, except that in many ways, it's really HER gig. And what's happening with that supposedly vacant room at the end of the hall? I'll go no further, partly because to do so would be to give too much away, but mostly because to try to explain it would be futile. You need to see it.\r\n\r\nThe Lords of Salem is, for much of its runtime, Rob Zombie's most restrained feature film. It can move pretty slowly most of the way through, although thanks to Mrs. Zombie's best on-screen work to date and some great supporting performances throughout, particularly from Dee Wallace, Judy Geeson and Bruce Davison, those slow moments are largely spent getting to know and like our protagonists (or of course, become ever more unnerved by our antagonists). However, it's the sections where The Lords of Salem lets rip - including a finale that takes an absolute swan-dive off of the cliffs of tangible reality into the seas of utter lunacy - that are dividing opinion. Rather than a balls-to-the-floor gore flick, what we have here is a retro-heavy European art-horror piece, akin to any of Dario Argento's more hallucinatory efforts. The imagery is incredibly striking and bold, and very much as you'd expect from Mr. Zombie, if you're aware of his previous work (House of 1000 Corpses, The Devil's Rejects - neither of which I thought were particularly good, although I may revisit Rejects at some point soon - the 2007 remake of Halloween and its 2009 sequel - both of which I really enjoyed), but because of that retro restraint that same imagery also rides a very fine line between bold and laughable depending I guess on whether you're able to buy into those arthouse horror stylings or you're not, and find yourself pulled out of the movie. The low budget (I've seen figures between $1.5m and $2.5m punted about) isn't an issue until some of the more ambitious special effects present themselves, but if you're not \"feeling it\" at that point, you're not going to. Personally, I like a film that has some scenes that aren't necessarily explained away by a perfunctory, realistic narrative, I like a film - especially a horror - to adopt a retro vibe from time to time, as long as they're done well (which this is), and I love a bit of witchcraftery and devilishness. The Lords of Salem reminded me in many of ways of Ti West's excellent slow-burn retro creeper The House of the Devil, but with added... well, with added Rob Zombieness, I suppose!\r\n\r\nRecommended, although many will find it objectionably bad.","id":"5207b030760ee3630522401d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5207b030760ee3630522401d","movie_id":104755}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"If you ride like lightning, you're going to crash like thunder.\r\n\r\nThe Place Beyond the Pines is directed by Derek Cianfrance and Cianfrance co-writes the screenplay with Ben Coccio and Darius Marder. It stars Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, Eva Mendes, Emory Cohen, Dane Dehaan, Ray Liotta, Ben Mendelsohn and Rose Byrne. Music is by Mike Patton and cinematography by Sean Bobbitt.\r\n\r\nA motorcycle stunt rider finds he has a son he never knew about and turns to robbing banks as a way to provide for both the child and his one time lover. This puts him on collision course with an ambitious rookie cop that has serious life changing consequences for both of them...\r\n\r\nThe Place Beyond the Pines (superb title) is a three parter of a character study that examines the critical decisions we make in life whilst putting different characters along a road of reckoning. The atmosphere of palpable human foibles is quickly established by Cianfrance, the introduction of stunt rider Luke Ganton (Gosling mesmerising) the kick start for what will be a multiple character piece even though the narrative core is purely about Ganton and cop Avery (Cooper) and their impact on each other and those connected to each.\r\n\r\nSuch is a key element of events in the story, it's difficult to say too much because this picture demands that spoilers are not dished out willy nilly. Going in blind without knowledge of the story trajectory is a must to garner maximum rewards. What can be said is that for the final third the pic does lose momentum, there's a big shift of emphasis (though critically connected to all that has gone on previously). It's not a film killer, though, for this remains a damn fine film, one that is packed with utterly gripping sequences, but the ambitiousness shown by Cianfrance is almost the undoing of a fascinatingly engrossing experience.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of choices are profoundly explored here, the multigenerational axis riveting in execution by director and writers alike. It also looks terrific, evocative cinematography from Bobbitt (12 Years a Slave) is in turn boosted by Patton's tonally compliant musical score. Ultimately, to enjoy fully you will have to accept implausible contrivances and that the psychological digging never really achieves all that it should. A bit of better thought for the last third and some trimming of the run time would have helped greatly, but this is still quality film making and recommended to grown up film fans for sure. 8\/10","id":"5c2c82610e0a2655f43a6800","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c2c82610e0a2655f43a6800","movie_id":97367}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> When the wild-child meets the world.\r\n\r\nI have seen a few French animations like 'Eleanor's Secret', 'Zarafa' and others. They were so cute, unlike Hollywood's, these were targeted for the children, but adults can watch them as well. No logic can be expected since it is an animation, it ain't masterpiece either, but a pure fantasy tale and the honest entertainment piece. The plot was loosely based on the French children's book of the same name and a feature film debut for the director. Obviously a low budget film, but nothing short to be a high quality flick.\r\n\r\nThis was not a movie with the beautiful character models like from the Disney fairytales, but they were adorable and enjoyable by the portrayal. That's what I always like in the European animations. Technically sounds good, but the stories are what so special in the French animations. This was about a nameless boy, who lives in the heart of the forest with his father. All his life lived within the circle of a boundary, but what happens once he crosses it is what the story that explores.\r\n\r\nThe boy was the centre of the story, his adventures, discoveries and understanding of the human civilization is the movie. The boy's character was not unusual, he has been just like the other version of Tarzan or Mowgli of the French version, who is a feral and curious about the world. Everything going to change when he meets the other creatures of his own and a girl of his age. The circle of life repeats, to break the curse and brings the curtain to the sweet narration.\r\n\r\n> \"Our forest stands in the middle of the sky.\r\n> And the stars turn around like the beast attached to his stake.\"\r\n\r\nThe end describes the meaning of the title. It was a 90 minute movie, but feels too short. If we talk about the film characters, Jean Reno rendered his voice to one of the main characters. As the characters rough in the looks, the story as well not that pleasant. Of course it is a children's movie, but character behaviours were rough and tough like the father bashing his son, huntings and deaths. Violent, but smooth and clever which are acceptable.\r\n\r\nThe 2D animation has died only a decade ago in the Hollywood, but great to see them still alive in the other part of the world, but facing the recognition problem which might lead to extinction. I have grown watching the cartoons, but now feels like time to say goodbye not too long from here. Now I am monitoring attentively the new products so that I can keep updating in the last hours of this awesome technology. I recommend this film for all ages.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Elementary my dear Edgar.\r\n\r\nThe Raven is directed by James McTeigue and written by Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare. It stars John Cusack, Luke Evans, Alice Eve and Brendan Gleeson. Music is by Lucas Vidal and cinematography by Danny Ruhlmann.\r\n\r\n\"On October 7, 1849, Edgar Allan Poe was found, near death, on a park bench in Baltimore, Maryland. The last days of his life remain a mystery\"\r\n\r\nIt's a real smart idea that the makers have here, putting their own theory forward on what happened in the lead up to Poe's death. Essentially a period whodunit procedural as Poe (Cusack) and Inspector Emmett Fields (Evans) race against time to find the person who is killing in the style of Poe's literary works. Poe's love interest, Emily Hamilton (Eve), is in grave danger, so as to add extra peril and suspense into the clock ticking drama.\r\n\r\nIt's a safe piece of entertainment, one that acquaints the uninitiated with Poe's work and his life struggles away from the writing bureau. The detective angle is fun and the murders grizzly and appropriately Gothic in execution. Unfortunately it rarely convinces as a period piece. The dialogue is often out of sync with the era, Eve is miscast, the score is inappropriate and it always feels like actors playing at period rompery. \r\n\r\nIt's a shame that it is bogged down by such irritants because Teague's direction is stylish, while the art design deserves a round of applause. Cusack is fun to watch, but more at ease playing Sherlock in the second half of the piece than a tortured soul in the first, and Evans is confident in the straight backed gentleman detective stakes. There's a good time to be had here on a surface whodunit follow the clues experience, and Poe fans will delight at catching the many references to his life and spiky works, but it unfortunately misses the mark in too many key areas. 6\/10","id":"5322f5419251411f85004a7f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5322f5419251411f85004a7f","movie_id":70436}

Underneath the gore and fangs and horror is a simple story about humanity and survival.

The actors and filmmakers did a wonderful job of bringing these characters to life and imbuing them with a sense of reality, as opposed to the sometimes stereotypical caricatures that often find their way into these type of films.

{"author":"ltcomdata","content":"Stories about revolution can be quite good.  But stories about why a revolution is needed are invariably great.  The Hunger Games is such a story.\r\n\r\nThe movie (for the most part), closely follows the book, and does a good job of it.  It also sets up the next book\/movie beautifully, even better than the book itself does.\r\n\r\nThe premise, of course, is borrowed from Ancient Rome, when gladiators and\/or criminals an\/or people whom the emperor wanted killed were forced to fight each other to the death in a public arena for the entertainment of the general populace.  And just as decadent as Rome was back then (only rescued from itself by the rise in prominence of The Christian sect), so the \"Capitol\" is now portrayed in the film\/book---and the film portrayed the affluent decadence of the Capitol quite well.\r\n\r\nIn this particular instance the \"tributes\" were chosen at random from among children aged 12 through 18, and it was meant as retribution and reminder of the \"crimes\" the 12 colonies committed by reveling against the authority and rule of the Capitol 74 years ago.  At the public \"reaping\", when a boy and a girl were chosen to become the sacrificial tributes at teach of the 12 colonies, the Decree of Punishment was read and the colonies were reminded that this punishment was established to demonstrate how weak the colonies were in comparison with the Capitol, in that the Capitol could take the most prized possessions of the colonies (namely, their children), and the colonists themselves could do nothing about it.  And to really rub it in, the colonists themselves were forced to watch the tournament proceedings.\r\n\r\nI have to say, the punishment is deviously clever from the point of view of the Capitol.  It certainly keeps the Colonies divided in spirit (they were already segregated physically, with no communication between them allowed by the Capitol), for in cheering for their own children they are therefore cheering for the defeat---and therefore death---of the other colonies' children.  It also keeps colonists divided within each colony, for there can only be one champion, which means that in wishing their children not to be chosen at the reaping, each colonist is thereby wishing that someone else's children be chosen.  Furthermore, in celebrating that their children were not chosen, they are also, incidentally, celebrating that some other person's children will likely die.  And for the families of the chosen children, in supporting their own family member during the tournament, they are incidentally supporting the death of the other family's child.  And it keeps the population of the colonies low, which the Capitol would want to promote (less chance for another insurrection if the population is low): for the youngest are taken, before they are married, and those who survive the yearly reapings will think twice about having children of their own and having them go through this traumatic process year after year during their most vulnerable adolescent years.  And furthermore, the Capitol encourages the colonists' tacit endorsement by rewarding the winner's Colony with extra food that year (hence \"The 'Hunger' Games\").  But it is all manipulation, in the end.\r\n\r\nIn fact, by the end of the Games, right before being killed himself, one of the most avid killers among the children realizes just how much it all is the Capitol's manipulation, how pointless it all is to those who participate, and how, in the end, he didn't really have a chance---that he was destined to die from the beginning---and that killing or being killed is all that not only the Capitol, but also his Colony, want from him.  An eye-opening realization for someone who up to this point had been quite eager to kill his fellow children.\r\n\r\nGiven the vicious circumstances which were thrust upon these children---none of which is their fault---the question naturally arises: how should a child bound under the moral law behave?  Should he try to win, by killing the other children?  Should they try to win at all?  Should they let themselves be killed, in order that another might live?\r\n\r\nOf course, the obvious moral choice would be for none of the children to participate in this horrendous form of reality television: if they do not fight each other the show is not interesting, and eventually it is discontinued.  The children would likely still be executed, along with many of their own family members in reprisal from the Capitol.  If one thinks in terms of consequences only (utilitarianism), then this would be the wrong approach: after all, they would say \"it is better that one person survives than that they---and all their families---die\".  But such thinking is quite repugnant, however logical it is.  Consequentialism is missing a big piece of the moral landscape, namely that we ought not to become evil ourselves in our fight against evil.  Yes, the consequences of \"civil disobedience\" as could morally be practiced in this scenario are more dire in terms of the quantity of damage made.  But they are much more preferable in terms of the quality of damage made.  By fully participating in the carnage (and inflicting some yourself) you become complicit in the very evil which oppresses you.  Similarly, your family, and even your colonies (and all colonies, for that matter) become part of the system, and in some tacit way endorse it---for they all want their children to live, and tacitly support the other colonists' children's death.  Furthermore, what kind of person does one become after killing 23 children by brutal means at a very young age (when the impressions of life still shape us in a powerful manner)?  What kind of society does one help create when one has inwardly become a psychotic monster?  What kind of society abides criminal monsters in its midst?\r\n\r\nBut, some will claim, it is unrealistic to expect each and every child to be morally minded, especially when some children (from two different colonies which are highly favored by the Capitol) actually volunteered for the \"honor\" to represent their colonies at the tournament.  What is the correct moral response when civil disobedience is not an option (no opportunity) and some, if not most of the other children are out to kill you, whether by pleasure or need to survive?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me there are two possible moral responses.  one of them is the route of self-defense, whereby one does not intentionally kill or go out of one's way to engage the enemy, but tries to flee as a first alternative, BUT where one DOES defend oneself against the attacks of others, and inflicts only as much harm as is necessary to stop the aggressor, AND only if absolutely necessary one uses lethal force.  In the end, very likely, the Capitol would force matters to a resolution, either by forcing \"aggressors\" and \"defensors\" into a particular area (very good television), or by artificially creating natural\/artificial disasters which killed whomever they disliked most.  But, again, this would be the Capitol's doing: an evil force acting evilly which one cannot stop.  One would have been preserved from sinking to doing\/becoming evil.\r\n\r\nThe other moral route, the more perfect route, would be the route of Jesus: to willfully become the sacrificial lamb for the sake of spiritual (and therefore) moral change.  The martyrs of the Church have for ages followed this route, to the spiritual benefit of the whole Church, and the cultural benefit of all humanity.  The spiritual benefit is quite and readily seen through the Communion of Saints, whereby these martyr's love renews and creates the Church anew, greatly adding to the spiritual gifts of which the rest of us partake---gifts which slowly transform us for the better, over years and generations.  And it is this transformation which over the centuries affects culture.  Gradually better people live their lives out in gradually better communities.  And Love wins out at the end of time.  After all, very few societies nowadays would consider it acceptable to inflict the tortures which were inflicted to prisoners (especially Christians) in the ancient days of Rome: we are all repulsed by the Capitol's Decree of Punishment.  If we only partook more of those graces which Christ offers through His Church!\r\n\r\nOne particular odd feature of the book (and the film) is the avoidance of any mention of God or religion whatsoever.  Not even empty phrases deriving from religion appear (\"My Gosh\", \"God willing\", Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc.).  Why is that, especially when the subject matter so clearly lends itself to a religious treatment?  Why is that, when the least historically educated among us would have heard the stories of the Christians ushered into the Colosseum to be executed\/sacrificed?  The closest religious reference is when Katniss Everdeen improvises a type of tribute around a fallen friend and ally in the game by creating a bed of flowers for her: the very earliest expressions of the religious impulse, as some Anthropologists would tell us.  Why has the author scrubbed her book from religion at all?  Is she so antagonistic to religion that she will not abide it in her book, even when it seems quite apt?  If so, the bed of flowers tell us that the most primitive of religious impulses remain with her still.  Or is the author trying to appeal to everyone, thus removing religion from the surface of her story so as to not alienate people of different religion than the one she chose to portray, while at the same time infusing her work with religious themes at the substrate level, where they are more powerful?  Or is her point that the despotic Capitol destroyed all hope quite successfully, even the Hope of God?  Given the richness of the religious themes I see in this book\/movie below the surface, I am very much inclined to believe that the last of these options is the correct one.  But I may be seeing what I want to see, simply because I like the story.\r\n\r\nNow, turning to the more artistic features of the movie: The most impressive performance was done by the actor who played President Snow.  His facial expressions were insuperable and spoke tons in the few lines he delivered throughout the film.  His performance was astoundingly good, his face delivering contempt, skepticism, and hatred (sometimes all at once) along with the \"weight of office\" while speaking seemingly innocuous lines, or even while congratulating the winners (there were two winners from District 12, thanks to the cleverness of Katniss Everdeen in turning the television show against its organizers!) of the 74th Hunger Games.  He single-handedly set up the next movie installment.\r\n\r\nBut the casting of Peeta is all wrong.  From the book it is clear that Peeta is not handsome at all, that Peeta is the boring guy who never had a chance when it came to women, and who doesn't have a chance when it comes to Katniss Everdeen who clearly has feelings for another guy.  Which makes it all the more poignant that he is desperately in love with her, and is willing to give up his life for her.  In the movie he is played by a movie-star-handsome actor who clearly would have trouble keeping women away from him, and who would therefore be quite self-centered and clueless, rather than the thoughtful man he is in the book.","id":"5054e12e760ee33ef7001c17","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5054e12e760ee33ef7001c17","movie_id":70160}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The story of two orphan and strongly bonded brothers.**\r\n\r\nI have been set eye on this for some time, but only now I been able to see it. It was not as good as I expected, but an okay film. The story of two brothers who were orphaned at very young age and since then they have never been parted as they promised to their mother. Now grown up to adult, one of them commits an accident and decides to run away with it. When the law makes the progress on the case that leads to them, what's now and how they fight it was focused in the rest.\r\n\r\nVery ordinary screenplay. Feels like a bit realistic, but there's nothing much happening at all. Thanks to those additional animations which actually lifted the film a bit. I loved those sequences over the real film. So this for the first directional film for the Polsky brothers and they were okay. I liked the cast of the brothers. apart from them there's no one that impressive. The romance was very weak, though only the ending was high.\r\n\r\nI don't know the novel, it was based on, but the film lacked some good scenes or the events. Not just one or two, but in many parts the film should have been better. They should have altered the storyline from the original source. Especially the fate of amputated brother was too intentional as story wanted to end other way around. It was all the sudden and ruined the rhythm. The film is not good for everyone's viewing, so I suggest you be a careful if you want to try it.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"585ebe8192514115be011257","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/585ebe8192514115be011257","movie_id":80318}

{"author":"Dsnake1","content":"Thale is an atmospheric horror film from Norway based on the huldra from Norwegian folklore.\r\n\r\nA pair of crime scene cleaners stumbles across a hidden room containing Thale, a huldra who holds the appearance of a woman. The first two-thirds of the movie are the pair unraveling the mystery of who and what Thale is and why she is in this hidden compartment.\r\n\r\nThese two-thirds are fantastic. The world building is fun and pulls from the folklore, and the mystery of it all ramps up and up. We don't know that Thale is there, and once we find that out in a spectacular fashion, we slowly begin to unravel the puzzle of it all. Is Thale an abused little girl? Is she a monster? Is someone looking for her?\r\n\r\nAs this draws out, we begin to find out more and more about the characters. Each of the main three has a story to tell and a backstory worth investigating, but we really only catch glimpses of everyone's story, although we do see significant amounts of Thale's.\r\n\r\nWhile the atmosphere, the world building, and the character building are excellent in the first two-thirds of the movie, this seems to fall off during the climax. It turns out that there are people hunting Thale. They incapacitate the two cleaners using gas while Thale hides back in a bathtub with a gas mask hooked up to air.\r\n\r\nAfter a cut, we find that the two men are outside, tied up and blindfolded. A man moves to dispose of them after giving the standard evil villain monologue but is interrupted by an explosion. The explosion destroyed the building where Thale had been picking off the remaining people hunting her down. After the explosion, a pack of huldra come through and rip the man to shreds, leaving the two cleaners alive.\r\n\r\nThe film ends with all of the problems being solved. Thale is back with the rest of the huldra, and the problems that the two other protagonists were dealing with were magically solved.\r\n\r\nWhile the first two-thirds of the film was full of strong aspects, the last third flipped all of that on its head. The atmosphere shifted from creepy and mysterious to something you'd find in an action movie, and the ending was simply everyone getting what they wanted without a satisfying resolution to the buildup of tension and mystery.\r\n\r\nIs it worth a watch? Sure. Don't expect to be blown away, though. The slow burn of the first forty to fifty minutes is incredibly enjoyable and the last parts of the movie are fine, even if they don't follow the same mold.","id":"5bb701169251410dc601e256","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bb701169251410dc601e256","movie_id":53567}

For me, it was mostly the action since some of these old guys are really\u2026well\u2026getting old. At least Stallone, Dolph and \u201cSchwarzy\u201d starts to get well past the best before date for these type of roles. Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme actually didn\u2019t look that old and Bruce Willis had a role where his age didn\u2019t make him seem too misplaced.\r\n\r\nThis movie is pretty much like the first The Expendables, that is some minimal story to build a whole bunch of action against.

This I do not understand since I thought they were pretty similar and if nothing else, that the previous one was the better of them with a slightly more coherent and plausible plot. For instance, in this movie, old buddies where popping up out of nowhere saving their behinds with some pretty \u201cmagic\u201d display of firepower which felt like the scene was just put in there to get the actor into the movie\u2026which it probably was.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not complaining though.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"The Pigs Have It.\r\n\r\nThe Seasoning House of the title is a Balkans Brothel, it\u2019s 1996 and young girls are being kidnapped during military attacks and sold to the owner of the Seasoning House. One such girl is Angel, a death and mute sufferer who the house owner takes a shine to and uses her as his assistant. When Angel strikes up a friendship with one of the girls, it is the catalyst for violence unbound.\r\n\r\nA thoroughly bleak and distressing viewing experience, but in turn it\u2019s also bold and brilliant film making. Debut director Paul Hyett paints a grim portrait of an all too real problem in certain parts of the world, but thankfully he never once lets the material slip into exploitation territory.\r\n\r\nThe brothel is unsurprisingly an utterly desperate place, rife with squalor and abject misery. The windows are boarded up with crooked pieces of wood, the beds are filthy, the walls stained with years of dirty grime and the after effects of vile human actions. The girls are battered and bruised, chained to the beds and injected with drugs to make them compliant towards anything the human monsters so wish to do to them.\r\n\r\nFor practically 70 minutes we the viewers are holed up in this awful place along with the girls. Daylight is only briefly glimpsed through the window shards, we can smell the fear along with the dankness, and claustrophobia is rife. Angel (a brilliant Rosie Day) is our conduit as Hyett builds relationships between her and the two other main characters. Viktor (Kevin Howarth) the ruler of this vile kingdom, and inmate Vanya (Dominique Provost-Chalkley), the latter of which is deeply touching and superbly crafted by those involved.\r\n\r\nFilm then switches in tone after some truly awful scenes have paved the way for what transpires in the final third of the story. This switch to more conventional horror cinema has proven divisive, but the way Angel moves about the house, how she finds fortitude, is fascinating, and she has well and truly earned our utmost support as she seeks to erase some dastardly evil wrongs from history (headed by a suitably scary Sean Pertwee). This is not a cheap rape revenger movie, it\u2019s a survivalist horror, and some of the horrors inherent in The Seasoning House are tough to stomach, but necessary to balance the art and the reality.

It was a decent road-action movie, awesome characters, stunts, but a bit similar to 'The Boondock Saints'. Also a part of 'Dexter' was in it.\r\n\r\nIt was so fun to watch, about the three men who take up a job to rescue an innocent boy from the drug lord. The trio think the job is done, but the assassins pursued them for the payback. The rest of the film takes place on the road with some great battles and exchange bullets between the gangs.\r\n\r\nIt could be a good flick for a non-action film fans, but if you are an action movie fan then it is a same crap that you might have seen hundreds of times in other flicks. The villains were so weak, but the stunts were not. Especially women assassins were hyped too much and lets us down at the same pace.\r\n\r\nBilly Bob Thornton was in a powerful negative role and he did not appear in any action sequences which is a big disappointment. He just looked like a barking dog, that's all. The reason was, to avoid overlapping with other similar movies. In that case, this film was completely borrowed from different flick and assembled here with a set of new cast and locations. But I enjoyed it, and also not fully satisfied. Very interesting ending, lets wait and see if there is a sequel for it.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd\/10","id":"56619c93925141790a0076ec","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56619c93925141790a0076ec","movie_id":81446}
{"author":"talisencrw","content":"While it's clearly not as superlative as its famous predecessor, it's simply because of both Heath Ledger's outstanding and Oscar-winning performance, and the character of the Joker's etching in our collective unconscious as the greatest comic-book villain ever created (with Lex Luthor a very distant second place). This is still a masterwork, and is an excellent coda to the finest filmic trilogy ever made. As great as Christopher Nolan is as a director, and as fine a film as 'Interstellar' is, I really don't know if he'll ever be able to top his work here, on these three films.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I had not really bothered to put this movie on my to-watch shelf since I felt it was not really my cup of tea but when my wife and oldest son wondered why we did not have it in our collection I thought, well, okay let us get it then. Actually I got the set with the two movies that have been released and yesterday we watched the first one.\r\n\r\nWell, as far as I am concerned, it is not a turkey, it is rather \u201cokayish\u201d but I certainly do not understand all the hype. It is really far from a great movie. But then, I am probably somewhat biased since, as I wrote above, I did not really think this movie was my cup of tea. Anyway, it starts of with a lot of scenes in \u201cwobblycam\u201d. I have not met any person outside of the movie industry and self-proclaimed so-called \u201ccritics\u201d that actually likes it when the camera wobbles around, scenes are blurred and you generally get nauseous by watching. Bad start!\r\n\r\nThe backbone of the story is ludicrous to say the least. Part of the world leaves in luxury when the rest is starving. Been there, seen that. Every year a seemingly random selection of kids, not adults but kids, are selected to fight to the death under some silly pretext of \u201cpreserving the peace\u201d. As I said, ludicrous. The entire air of ludicrousness is enforced by the wacky costumes, makeup and hair styles of the people in the capitol. As I science fiction and fantasy fan I could easily live with this but, sadly, the movie made me only mildly interested in following the characters to the end.\r\n\r\nThe acting in general is adequate but nothing special. Having said that it must be difficult to actually make anything out of some of the silly roles in this movie. I for sure would laugh my head off every time I entered a scene with all of those ludicrous (yes I know I have used that word a lot in this review, live with it) costumes. The main characters act like the children, with absolutely no clue what they are doing, that they indeed are. This is of course entirely in line with the story but still, the main character is spending a lot of the time running away and sitting around looking startled, sorry or depressed when the games start. I have to say that, at times, the movie felt a bit boring. I have liked several movies that are very slow but here it simply did not sit right.\r\n\r\nThe games themselves with those dickheads in control and the changing rules, well they were mostly frustrating.\r\n\r\nThis movie, to me, is a movie for a young adult audience. I have not read the books and I can see how this kind of story would work for a YA book. Personally I was not unhappy having seen the movie and now, having watched the first of the movies I will watch the rest as well but for me it was okay as a two-hour diversion, nothing more.","id":"53fc2f600e0a267a7b009aba","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53fc2f600e0a267a7b009aba","movie_id":70160}

{"author":"tmdb23365124","content":"\u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man\u201d has no reason to exist. Spider-man is a hero everyone knows. He\u00b4s been around for so long everyone is familiar with his origin, comic fan or not. Its basic pop culture. Then you have the Sam Raimi\u00b4s movies. Everyone saw them. They made loads of money and they\u00b4re always on tv. They are entertaining movies. \u201cSpider-Man\u201d gave us a good origin story in 2002. This movie simply wasn't needed. \r\nNow I gave it the benefit of the doubt. There\u00b4s Burton\u00b4s Batman and Nolan\u00b4s. Maybe this was a different Spider-Man. A more \u201cdark\u201d vision perhaps! Maybe the movie spent a few minutes on the origin and then wisely moved on with its story. Maybe... well maybe it wasn't just another rehash. A shameless attempt to remake, or how they say it these days, reboot the same idea with minimal changes except the cast. I was naive.\r\nThe whole movie is about Spider-Man\u00b4s origin. They traded Mary Jane for another love interest and held off on \u201cThe Green Goblin\u201d because that would be too much \u201crubbing it in the face\u201d for the fans, I guess. We get Gwen Stacy and \u201cThe Lizard\u201d. The rest is same old, same old. The same uncle Ben plot, the same scenes about making the suit, learning how to control powers, the search for the criminal Spider-man lets get away with horrific results. Same thing. Except everything is done without a spark of energy or creativity. Raimi\u00b4s movies were energetic, flowing with excitement. They were \u201cnew\u201d. Seeing Spider-Man on the big screen,  webbing all over the city, fighting \u201cThe Green Goblin\u201d, it was amazing. We didn't have \u201cThe Avengers\u201d back there, or \u201cIron Man\u201d. This was like a dream come true for comic fans. \r\n\u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man\u201d smells of old cheese. \r\nI tried to take the movie for what it was but it was impossible. My mind would not let me. I knew what was going to happen next. I knew all the plots! I\u00b4d seen it all before! \r\nBut even ignoring that the movie just does not work. Its slow, turgid with an unlikable Peter Parker and a CGI lizard for a villain. Parker is a whiny, self centered idiot. His relationship with aunt May and uncle Ben is never fully explored and what little there is consists of Parker being a rude jerk for no reason at all. \r\nThe movie has one thing going for it. The cast. Sally Field and Martin Sheen are great with what little material they have. Emma Stone is sexy and sweet which is \u201cher thing\u201d and again she pulls it off brilliantly.  Rhys Ifans is decent as Curt Connors and surprisingly enough I loved Andrew Garfield as Spidey. Yes, seriously! He looks perfect for the part and he did his best with the horrible script. He\u00b4s charismatic and brought his own touch to the role instead of copying Toby Maguire. If the movie is even slightly original its because of him. \r\nSome of the action in the last third of the movie is also spectacular. Spider-man\u00b4s movements when fighting are really well done as is the web-slinging. The action is well directed and exciting and the movie sets up a sequel rather nicely. \r\nBut its asking a lot to go over the material everyone knows for two hours for a few minutes of cool action. The movie plays it so safe it hurts. Its competent but never brilliant. Tedious but far too long with little spots of action but few and far between. \r\nI hope in the sequel this \u201cSpider-Man\u201d can find its own style and its own place. Given space to grow and evolve, on the strength of the character and Garfield\u00b4s acting this could be the weak start to a new amazing super-hero trilogy. \r\nThen again, maybe i\u00b4m just naive.","id":"5192715d19c2950a16225394","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5192715d19c2950a16225394","movie_id":1930}

When you look at some of the films that have been churned out on the various sci-fi and horror channels out their in cable land, then this definitely has more going for it.\r\n\r\nTrue! There's the usual implausibilities and director and writer Darren Lynn Bousman has pacing problems, but there's good thought gone into the screenplay here, Bousman looking to add a little more to his film than merely being a \"monster in the woods\" shocker. There's also decent performances from the cast, which only comes to fruition when things finally go belly up in the last third.\r\n\r\nNot one to recommend with any sort of confidence, especially to the tough horror loving crowd, but if you are after a \"decent\" \"B\" type horror to view while you are pottering about doing stuff in your lounge (or basements), then it proves itself to be more viable than some Syfy channel trash that is churned out at regular intervals. 5.5\/10","id":"53c56a5d0e0a261e08002065","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53c56a5d0e0a261e08002065","movie_id":135368}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"**A long format review from 2012**\r\n\r\nMy new favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe film, undoubtedly! Order goes thusly;\r\n\r\n1. The Avengers\r\n2. Iron Man\r\n3. Thor\r\n4. Captain America\r\n5. Iron Man 2\r\n6. The Incredible Hulk\r\n\r\nI had the privilege of going to Sydney and watching this almost a full three weeks before it\u2019s American release, in a special advance screening for fans and a handful of critics. I drove up and back on a day trip with my mate HRV, spent over $400 between us\u2026 So worth it.\r\n\r\nI think perhaps my expectations of The Avengers were too high. In fact I know they were, even so, I feel that it almost managed to meet them. All but two of the fears I had about this epic were quashed without a doubt. I initially was worried about Mark Ruffalo helming the role of The Hulk\/Bruce Banner after taking over from Edward Norton who was ousted after his first appearance. My complaints were completely unfounded however, as Mark Ruffalo presents us with an at least as good Marvel Hero. \r\n\r\nIn terms of entertainment, The Avengers is one of the greatest feats ever produced. At the screening I went to, I actually missed more than a couple of lines due to the fact that the entire bloody cinema was in hysterics from some classic Joss Whedon (Director - Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Dollhouse) humour. The squabbles between these larger than life characters are not quite up to the peak that Jon Favreau\u2019s Iron Man & Iron Man 2 sit on, but in terms of film in general, they are some of the better interactions I\u2019ve ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe only weak points I really have to whinge about are both quite minor, and perhaps can be rectified in the MCU future. Firstly, Thor\u2019s return to Earth (whilst brilliantly dramatic and pretty) was quite weak in terms of exposition. That said, this isn\u2019t a Thor movie, so we don\u2019t need to know everything that happens to him. Also, in next year\u2019s Thor 2, it is very possible we\u2019ll discover more specific details about the first few scenes of his return. Secondly, Loki\u2019s army also came across to me quite weakly. In case we have any Marvel aficionados in the crowd, I won\u2019t spoil it by telling you who they\u2019re supposed to be, but in general the whole army was essentially a meat shield used to bump out scenes in which The Avengers get to kick ass. A very enjoyable part of the film, but one that doesn\u2019t really drive the story at all.\r\n\r\nI feel the only way I can adequately describe just how much you need to see this movie (in cinemas) is this: For those of you who understand me, you will be know and be aware of just how much I fucking hate the concept of Blu-Ray. I am going to buy a Blu-Ray player, a HD television, and Blu-Ray discs, just so that I will get more special features when The Avengers is released. Never have I even considered doing such a thing before.\r\n\r\nThe Avengers doesn\u2019t get into your mind and rape it in the best way possible like Revolver or Donnie Darko. It doesn\u2019t get into your guts and turn them with nostalgic violence like the brilliance in Doomsday or Outpost. It gets into your heart, and leaves you not just wanting, but needing more.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Two gangs for one big heist.**\r\n\r\nIt looks not bad, but too long. From the director of 'Woochi' and 'Assassination', though it came between them and I'm seeing it now since I liked them both. An international cast film, I mean some well known Korean and Hong Kong actors in this multi-starrer. The story of two thief gangs joins hands to steal a diamond necklace in a casino in Macau. It's a team work, everyone is assigned to do their part, but due to some old incidents, they lose trust on one another. Followed by betrayal, how the heist takes place and what happens to them comes in the final quarter.\r\n\r\nThe actors were good, but their roles were so usual. At least the story looked better, but too much drag in the first half. Once their work begins to take off, the narration with those stunt sequences gets interesting. Even though I felt it should have been better, the screenplay should have kept tight. With so many characters, too many twists. So feels like it all jammed, though none of them were stunning enough, particularly a theme like this needed one that. I have seen a better heist film, I bet did as well, so this film won't surprise, but okay for watching once.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"584466dac3a3683e1600bfb8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/584466dac3a3683e1600bfb8","movie_id":124157}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> What if your plan is a small part of someone's big.\r\n\r\nI wanted this film since it was out, only now I managed to see it. I haven't seen so many Spanish films as I did for French and German. I don't want to get disappointed, so I'm choosy and that is how it got delayed. That is the another reason why you don't see my low rated ('bad' and 'ignore' in my verdict) movie reviews. I don't want to waste my time to review bad films. Better late than never, and now, I don't regret for the wait. Anyway, the film was good, I enjoyed it and I wanted it to be one of my favourite from the year it got released, but a few things stopped me to consider that.\r\n\r\nOkay, first of all, it was a casual start like any thriller flick. Slowly letting us know what it's all about, introducing the characters in order in a simple manner and then intense suspense emerges. The pace picks up when more and more puzzle pieces dropped on-board. By then, as a viewer you would begin to figure it out, applying theories you got. But it's not that easy to crack, because the film is not that stupid to give away any hints. Nowadays a certain section audience is a little extra cautious, especially since 'The Sixth Sense' and 'The Shawshank Redemption'. So this narration carefully maintains the tense parts.\r\n\r\n> \"I close my eyes and you're still with me.\"\r\n\r\nNot until the film reaches the final act, where the twist happens and you will realise that you were nowhere near. Because the first two acts and the final were totally parted in narration except connected with the characters. The entire film revolves around a disappearance of a dead body from a morgue. The husband of the dead woman, a cop and others tries to solve the mystery in an overnight. And a few flashback pieces give us the necessity stories when the ongoing situation getting more tense.\r\n\r\nI thought 'Gone Girl' was inspired by the first half of this film. After a little research I got to know that movie was based on the book of the same name that released around the same date when this film came out. But a very similar one, only the finale diverted to the other path and so the meaning of whole film changed. As a movie fanatic, I had collected some flaws for my review, but the movie took till the final dialogue to keep it that way and then solved it, leaving me empty handed.\r\n\r\nSo there are no second and third thoughts about the end, because that was separated from the rest of the movie and very clear to declare what has to be done. That means you don't have to go looking for defects, other than accepting as it is. The only choice you have to make is to express whether you liked the movie or not. And like I said in the first paragraph I enjoyed the film, but not the favourite one and I believe I explained the reason for that in other paragraphs. I absolutely recommend it for those who are looking for a suspense-thriller.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"56043ecc9251416f0f0033bb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56043ecc9251416f0f0033bb","movie_id":111083}

{"author":"Matt Golden","content":"Over a decade after a little-known director from New Zealand managed to con New Line Cinema into giving him $300 million to make a trilogy based on JRR Tolkien's seminal fantasy (and long considered unfilmable) work The Lord of the Rings, the cinematic landscape for fantasy has changed drastically. Much like Tolkien's tome, the Lord of the Rings films came to utterly define high fantasy in film, with even competing fantasy adaptations like The Chronicles of Narnia and Alice in Wonderland cribbing from Peter Jackon's critically-acclaimed, audience-adored multipart epic. Now Jackson has returned to the land that made him famous for a go-round with Tolkien's earlier work, The Hobbit.\r\n\r\nTolkien's The Hobbit is far more modest in scope than its enormous sequel, and geared for a younger audience. It introduced the world to Bilbo Baggins, a typically quiet hobbit who is coaxed into adventure by the grey wizard Gandalf, enlisted to aid thirteen dwarves in reclaiming their long-lost homeland.\r\n\r\nJackson had the unenviable task of following up on his blockbuster Academy Award-winning masterpiece, and initially passed off the directing responsibilities to fantasy master Guillermo del Toro. Difficulties securing the film rights led to delay after delay, and del Toro finally departed, leaving the original creative team the ability to step back into place and create a follow-up\/lead-in with the same creative staff in front of and behind the camera. Jackson returned as director, co-writing with Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens (though del Toro retains a screenwriting credit), Andrew Lesnie as cinematographer, and Howard Shore as composer, along with all of the other stalwarts of the original trilogy.\r\n\r\nThe lone exception to that is the recasting of Martin Freeman as the titular hobbit, taking over for the aging Ian Holm. Holm appears in the film's framing sequence (a scene that takes place immediately prior to the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring), along with that trilogy's star, Elijah Wood. But this time out, it's Freeman's show, and he's as charming, witty, and engaging as you could imagine. He also makes a perfect Young Ian Holm. The casting is truly inspired. Sir Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf (here playing his more impish grey incarnation, rather than the frankly humorless white version) and the heralded thespian manages to imbue his character with both immense power and gravitas, while still throwing in little flourishes that sell Gandalf as an imperfect man, rather than just an all-knowing power. Rounding out the third of this film's main characters, and an addition to this world, is Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, the leader of the motley crew of dwarves. Armitage likewise manages to imbue Thorin with both rage and honor, and is easily believable as someone who could lead these dwarves into life-threatening battle. The other twelve dwarves are something of a blur, but a few of them manage to make an impression, even with limited screen time. I imagine the two future installments of the series will afford them each the chance to shine.\r\n\r\nWhich brings up the most contentious point of this whole Hobbit affair: the fact that it's a three-part epic. The Hobbit, as written, is a comparatively slim tome of around 300 pages (compare that to The Lord of the Rings' combined 1,600). This installment alone is ten minutes shy of a whopping three hours. And as anyone who's seen The Return of the King can attest, Jackson can get rather indulgent at times (the end[s] of that film). Initially the film was going to be split in twain, then later divvied up into three parts. Tolkien, ever the completist, wrote volumes of backstories for this world, and Jackson decided to pull from them to bulk out these films.\r\n\r\nI've seen a lot of hay being made about the film being bloated and, yes, indulgent. I'm an editor at heart, and am generally hyper-sensitive about cutting down to the bone. But the strangest thing happened on the way to the Lonely Mountain: I found myself simply rolling along with the shaggy-dog pace of the film. It's astonishing in hindsight. The film virtually redefines \"taking the scenic route,\" but the crazy thing is I didn't mind it in the least. I believe it's because of the lowered stakes of The Hobbit. Every single frame of The Lord of the Rings was suffused with overbearing doom; that trilogy's \"save the world\" plot became as heavy a burden to bear as the ring hung around Frodo's neck. But The Hobbit is lighter, freer, funnier, and doesn't have the weight of the world on its shoulders. It's rather the difference between having an appointment you need to get to in heavy traffic and taking a weekend to just drive around, stopping when and where you like. This pace will likely have a dire impact on the film's rewatchability, but sitting in the theater for a midnight showing? Magic.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the film itself seems to have ADD. Its innumerable diversions began to remind me of a live-action Family Guy episode, with character or event mentions that suddenly cause the film to cut away to a dramatization of said. But again, and I can't stress enough how unexpected this was for me, I didn't mind in the least (with one exception: it appears to be an inviolable rule that any scene in Rivendell will stop a film dead in its tracks).\r\n\r\nThe craft of the film manages to best that of its predecessor trilogy: Howard Shore turns in one of his most stirring scores, the production design and art direction are again immersive and beautiful, and Andrew Lesnie continues his unique style of cinematography combining gorgeous shots (wonderful) with frequently blowing out highlights (distracting and ugly).\r\n\r\nOne complaint I do have is Jackon's newfound over-reliance on CGI. Azog the Defiler (a chief antagonist of the film) and the Goblin King (a bit of a lark) are the sorts of character that would have (and should have) been practical effects in the original trilogy. Here they're fully CGI, and their menace is undermined by it. Gollum returns for his most famous scene, and looks wonderful; Andy Serkis' performance and the CGI truly sell this pitiful creature. CGI can be pitiful but not threatening, it appears.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the other two installments of The Hobbit have in store. What I do know is that this return to Middle-earth is off to a great start, and if this is any indication of things to come, I'll most assuredly enjoy the ride.","id":"51ec275919c29551df108d8d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51ec275919c29551df108d8d","movie_id":49051}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is the fourth spider man movie although it is not the fourth sequel but rather one of these reboots which seems to be so popular today. I found the movie to be quite enjoyable but at the same time a bit of a let-down.\r\n\r\nIn some ways it is better than the previous trilogy by Sam Raimi (well it is not very hard to make something that is better than the 2nd installment in that trilogy of course). The film is darker, more serious and Spider Man is not so silly and a total mess-up when out of his costume as the character portrayed by Toby Maquire.\r\n\r\nHowever, this movie has its own faults which makes me have to think hard whether it is really that much of an improvement over the previous movie and this is what makes me feel a bit let-down since I had hope that this reboot would be that \u201creal\u201d Spider Man movie that enabled me to forget about the previous ones.\r\n\r\nA lot of not so interesting scenes are really dragged out and the important stuff is rushed. Peter Parker\u2019s transition to Spider Man after his bitten is over and done with quite quickly. In another scene he spends 5 minutes trying to talk some kid out of a car. He even takes off his mask and gives it to him (what the f\u2026) and in the end just zips him out with a net shot. He could have done that right away and spared us the boring time.\r\n\r\nGenerally I think this movie is indeed a better Spider Man movie than the previous ones though and I quite enjoyed the movie evening yesterday, just not as much as I hoped.","id":"5a71f1cd9251417f1600a830","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a71f1cd9251417f1600a830","movie_id":1930}

But, the disappointment felt at the end is actually proof that you've been entertained (and quite likely pretty well scared) up to that point, and is largely driven by the desire to see more of what had come before. With a more fulfilling ending this'd be a top-notch horror - beating the 'Paranormal' and 'Emily Rose' films at their own game, to a large extent - but the ending, sadly drops it a couple of notches. But only back down to their level, really. Still worth watching, for sure, but a Director's Cut with an extra bit added on to tie it up, would have helped this film's reputation quite a bit.","id":"51c71ff119c29575b00202d7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51c71ff119c29575b00202d7","movie_id":76487}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Batman was one of my childhood heroes from the Comic magazines even though the Swedish plonkers, in their infinite stupidity, had renamed him to something as ridiculous \u201cL\u00e4derlappen\u201d which basically translates into \u201cpatch of leather\u201d.\r\n\r\nThus, when Christopher Nolan brought us Batman Begins and steered away from the ridiculous comic shows that the previous batman movies (except the first one) had turned into I was thrilled. Unfortunately I was equally disappointed with this one.\r\n\r\nI think the title of the movie is quite misleading since Batman isn\u2019t exactly rising at all but rather sinking. If this would have been a movie about some other \u201cguy\u201d it would probably have been excellent but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s about Batman and as such I had expected him to be the hero going around beating up the bad guys.\r\n\r\nInstead the movie starts downright boring with Batman having dug himself down into a swamp of melancholy and closed himself off from the world. When he finally starts to appear again he gets pretty much beaten at every turn not to mention conned out of the Wayne fortune. What the f\u2026 is that? It isn\u2019t until the end that he starts to be the real Batman and even then it\u2019s not very exciting.\r\n\r\nActually Batman, as in Batman and not Wayne, is not really in the movie for a good chunk of the time and the real hero in this movie is really the young cop and he sure isn\u2019t a particularly good substitute for the superhero Batman that I was expecting to watch.\r\n\r\nI was struggling with what to give this movie but in the end, since I probably would have thought it to be a good movie if it had not been labelled as a Batman movie, I gave it 5 out 10 stars. At least the special effects where quite okay.","id":"5a851c500e0a2640110241d9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a851c500e0a2640110241d9","movie_id":49026}
{"author":"Travis Bell","content":"I felt like this was a tremendous end to Nolan's Batman trilogy. The Dark Knight Rises may very well have been the weakest of all 3 films but when you're talking about a scale of this magnitude, it still makes this one of the best movies I've seen in the past few years.\r\n\r\nI expected a little more _Batman_ than we got (especially with a runtime of 2:45) but while the story around the fall of Bruce Wayne and Gotham City was good I didn't find it amazing. This might be in fact, one of my only criticisms\u2014it was a long movie but still, maybe too short for the story I felt was really being told. I feel confident in saying this big of a story could have been split into two movies.\r\n\r\nThe acting, editing, pacing, soundtrack and overall theme were the same 'as-close-to-perfect' as ever with any of Christopher Nolan's other films. Man does this guy know how to make a movie!\r\n\r\nYou don't have to be a Batman fan to enjoy these movies and I hope any of you who feel this way re-consider.

It's not a pleasant film but I can't give it any less than full marks for its bravery, arrogance and honesty when dealing with an uncomfortable aspect of our species. \r\n\r\nJoshua Oppenheimer (dir.) understands the social norms of his subjects' environment and also their own egos and greed, shows us so that we also understand and then uses all he has learned to get them to openly reveal all directly to the audience, pretty much by luring them.  It's obvious that with the backstory and footage used he already had more than enough for a documentary film and it seems as though he thought 'I have a better plan' and then made this film instead, in the ultimate quest for knowledge. Beyond words and essential.\r\n\r\nNote: There is a companion to this called 'The Look of Silence', which is a different type of film altogether and one that sheds much extra light onto the the events of this time and place but from a different perspective and this is also recommended, albeit not as strongly.","id":"58a8cc19c3a3686404002e0f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58a8cc19c3a3686404002e0f","movie_id":123678}

{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"The Hunger Games is a new concept in a long line of post-apocalyptic future fantasies. Where other stories of the same genre often deal with technology and artificial intelligence as the main threat to human existence, Hunger Games actually takes us back to Roman times, with a revitalised version of \"Panem et Circenses\" or \"Bread and Circuses\". Simply put; human devastation as mass entertainment. Welcome to Panem: formally known as The United States of America, where every year, a young man and woman from each of the twelve districts are selected to fight each other to the death, with only one possible survivor. These Games are broadcasted on national television as a means to keep the people happy and submissive.\r\n\r\nConsidering the fact that this film is based on a teen book series (written by Suzanne Collins), I can't help but feel this concept is pretty far out there, and actually it's kind of sick. It's not a pretty idea to think that one day we might live in a world where watching young people, ranging from 12 to 18 years old, brutally murder each other is considered to be a form of mass entertainment. Thankfully, this is 'just' a story, and I must say, a very entertaining one at that (no pun intended).\r\n\r\nThe story revolves around the two youngsters from District 12, where the people are dirt poor and life is utterly desolate. 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen volunteers as 'tribute' to fight in the Hunger Games, after her little sister is initially selected. Her male counterpart is Peeta Mellark, and together they set off to train for and participate in the Games.\r\n\r\nThe character of Katniss is played by Jennifer Lawrence, and she is terrific. Actually, she is my biggest recommendation for watching this film. Before this, I had only seen her in X-Men: First Class and thought she was pretty good, but after seeing The Hunger Games, it's not hard to see why this 21-year-old already has her first Oscar nomination under her belt. She has a very natural quality about her, which makes it very easy to make you empathise with her character. She's not a superficial, happy-go-lucky kind of girl; she's actually very sullen, not even particularly likable. And yet you just love her from the get go. I guess it's charisma, and Jennifer Lawrence definitely has it.\r\n\r\nActually, this film is full of great actors. One of the greatest is definitely Stanley Tucci, who plays his most flamboyant role yet. His character (Caesar Flickerman, the TV-host who emcees the Games) is ridiculously over-the-top, but brilliantly amusing. With blue hair, prosthetic teeth and a big horse's smile which he flashes incessantly, he looks like a PG-13 version of the Joker. And if you're at all familiar with Tucci's work and talent, you know just what I mean when I say he's making this character appear to be oh-so nice, yet subtly sadistic at the same time. He's just great, period. Woody Harrelson also has a pretty interesting role as Haymitch Abernathy, a once-winner of the Hunger Games, who now mentors Katniss and Peeta in their training. He's scruffy and gnarly, basically just typically another weird Woody character, which is always worth the watch. Wes Bentley plays Seneca Crane, a character most notable for his unusual facial hair: he sports a beard Lucifer himself would be proud of. However, the biggest surprise to me was Elizabeth Banks, whom I am well familiar with, but never really cared for because I only know her from superficial, comedic roles. I was pleasantly surprised to see that she can also play challenging roles like this one. She plays Effie Trinket, a bizarre, neo-Renaissance type from the richest District, big wig, crazy make-up and all. She's pretty much the female version of Tucci's character and she was a delight to watch, beautifully grotesque in all her decadence.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it can't all be great. I had three major problems with this film. One: if you haven't read the book, there's a lot that doesn't make sense. They really should have spent a little more time explaining everything, because more than once it simply wasn't clear to me what was going on and why. And that's a risk no filmmaker should take. Two: Peeta's character. It could be just me of course, but he annoyed the crap out of me. He just comes across as such a sissy that it's frustrating to watch. Katniss burns her leg and deals with it. Peeta cuts his leg and stays lying in a cave because he \"can't walk\". And then he lets her take care of him, at the risk of her own life. Give me a break. Three: totally disappointing climax. I was waiting for fireworks, for Katniss having to make brutal decisions, but this never happened. It just kind of faded out.\r\n\r\nAnd this is how you can clearly tell this story has a mainly teenage demographic, and they obviously wanted to keep it PG-13. Because despite the sometimes pretty brutal violence, nasty use of weaponry and tomato ketchup-a-plenty, overall the whole just lacked, well (pardon my French)...balls. You can tell they tried to spike things up a bit here and there, but the film failed to make things truly interesting at moments where it definitely should have been. In my opinion, had they decided to make this rated-R, it would have been infinitely better.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, you can rest assured there is still plenty to enjoy. Visually it is absolutely awesome and simply beautiful. The costumes and make-up are great, as are the CGI effects. The characters (aside from Peeta...) are great, and the whole futuristic 'universe' that is created is pretty inventive.\r\n\r\nThere is actually still a lot more I would like to say, but I've reached my word-limit, so I'll just leave you with this: Thumbs up!\r\n_(April 2012)_","id":"58ac518f92514158df013cca","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ac518f92514158df013cca","movie_id":70160}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"Witchcraft\/Satanism in modern Salem by Rob Zombie\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2012 and written\/directed by Rob Zombie, \"The Lords of Salem\" is a witchcraft\/horror flick starring Sheri Moon Zombie as a DJ in Salem, Massachusetts, who is sent a wooden box containing a mysterious record dubbed \"gift from the Lords.\u201d The creepy music thereof triggers flashbacks of her town's infamous past. Is Heidi going crazy or are the witches taking revenge on Salem?\r\n\r\nThe ambiance, mood, directing, music, locations, sets and cast are all top notch, showing that Zombie has developed into a quality director since his first shot eleven years earlier with \u201cHouse of 1000 Corpses,\u201d which was shot in 2000. This is serious haunting horror as opposed to the campy black comedy of \u201c1000 Corpses\u201d (not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, lol). The movie mixes elements from \"The City of the Dead,\u201d aka \"Horror Hotel\" (1960), \u201cSuspiria\u201d (1977), \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d (1968), \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d (1973) and \u201cTo the Devil a Daughter\u201d (1976). If you like any of these movies, \u201cThe Lords of Salem\u201d is as good or better.\r\n\r\nUsually when you see old hag witches in movies it\u2019s kinda eye-rolling; not so here. Rob gives us the real deal and it\u2019s not pretty, although I admit to busting out laughing every time the witches hailed Satan. Speaking of which, modern Wiccans won\u2019t like how the films mixes Witchcraft with Satanism (the truth hurts). Interestingly, there\u2019s almost as much Christian imagery as there is Satanic.\r\n\r\nOne thing\u2019s for sure, Zombie doesn\u2019t paint witchcraft\/Satanism in a positive light. It\u2019s similar to \u201cThe Witch\u201d (2015) in this respect, where converting to witch-dom meant becoming a baby-slaughtering, blood-bathing, family-destroying, goat-sucking, friggin\u2019 pedophile hag with the illusion of youth. When the Devil eventually appears in \u201cLords,\u201d it\u2019s anything but a positive image.\r\n\r\nThe story seems to perpetuate the myth that those condemned at the Salem Witch Trials in 1692-1693 were burned to death. Actually, 19 people were hung, another slowly crushed to death, and over 150 imprisoned.\r\n\r\nSheri makes for a strong protagonist, but she\u2019s the extant of any eye candy on the female front.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old fashioned.\r\n\r\nThe Avengers (AKA: Avengers Assemble) is written and directed by Joss Whedon, with Zak Penn co-writing the story. It stars Robert Downey Junior, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddlestone, Clark Gregg, Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders and Stellan Skarsgard. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Seamus McGarvey.\r\n\r\nAsgardian outcast Loki (Hiddlestone) has struck a deal with the Chitauri to exchange the Tesseract for an army with which he can attack Earth and thus control it. With the Earth in mortal danger, S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury (Jackson) activates the Avengers Initiative; a collection of super heroes and deadly assassins who, if they can actually come together as one united force, hold the fate of the Earth in their hands.\r\n\r\nI have no real frame of reference with The Avengers comic book world, when I was young I read a bit of Spidey, Batman and was kind of partial to The Fantastic Four, but I really don't remember story lines and gave up reading that sort of stuff once sport and exams came into my life. I love movies and as I enter the later stages of my forties I'm pleased to say I have a wide range of film genre interests. I have very much enjoyed The Avengers solo films so far, with the exception of Iron Man 2 which quite frankly is average at best, but the reality is that if The Avengers failed as a movie, that Whedon got it so wrong, then I wouldn't be foaming at the mouth or proclaiming that the director be stripped naked and whipped around the streets of Hollywood! As it is, with one or two minor irks aside, The Avengers is about as much fun as I have had with a movie in quite a few years.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't know if the makers got the essence right, or if the story is at one in the Marvel Avengers Universe, I just know that it is a right old blast and made a colossal amount of money at the box office, even trumping The Dark Knight Rises in that department. It's a film full of derring-do heroics, ripe witticisms, wonderfully staged action, simmering sexual tensions, ego collisions, charm, heart and splendid human interactions. It looks fabulous on Blu-ray, the art design, the colour photography and Silvestri's score rumbles like thunder and crackles like lightning, just as a super hero movie score should do. The cast performances are hugely enjoyable as they bounce off of one and other, feeding off the respective thespian energy with a knowing of the right tone to make this colourful comic book world be all that it can be. While Whedon, with a weight of expectation akin to Atlas holding the World on his shoulders, comes through with flying colours with astute pacing and an impressive marshaling of an acting army.\r\n\r\nFlaws? Jackson's Nick Fury could have done with more screen time and Cobie Smulders is sadly short changed as well. The Chitauri are only really a threat because of their sheer numbers, not because of any great alien design, and, well, The Hulk CGI hasn't really advanced much from the 2008 version, but really these are small itches rather than big ones. Is The Avengers the best film of 2012? It will be seen as such for many fans of the source(s) who have waited with baited breath for this coming together of their heroes, and that notion really shouldn't irk the more highbrow film fans out there. Me? No it isn't the best film of 2012, but as I found my self perched on the edge of my seat as the finale unfurls in a wave of explosive heroic energy, and I caressed my ribs from laughing out loud, I knew then that undoubtedly The Avengers is the most fun film of 2012. 9\/10","id":"5d46cf540f2fbd7864efbe30","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d46cf540f2fbd7864efbe30","movie_id":24428}
{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"The Lorax thneedn\u2019t have shoved its colourful environmentalist message so brutally. Well, the live-action \u2018Cat in the Hat\u2019 adaptation was a *cough* massive success *cough* so it was only a matter of years before another Dr Seuss family-friendly book would have its zany vivid world transferred onto the medium of film. Then comes the introductory title screen. A despicable minion pops up next to the bold cancerous studio name \u201cIllumination\u201d, and instantly all hope was diminished.\r\n\r\nAside from their initial franchise, they seem to be unable to create animated flicks without treating the audience like simplistic Neanderthals, and The Lorax takes the biscuit. Patience was running thin just from the introductory musical number alone. A young boy journeys outside the walled plastic city of Thneedville to find a living tree so that he can impress a girl, but soon relives a tale that would change his way of life.\r\n\r\nThis is a mess. Perhaps unadaptable due to Seuss\u2019 imaginative wordplay that inspiringly illustrates a creative warning against corporate greed and destructive deforestation. Illumination on the other hand, whilst consistently producing colourful and vibrant animations, shoved the morality down the throats of its audience. Within two minutes, the civilians are singing about their perfect plastic bubble and capitalistic functionality. The main character, not the titular creature, has yet to be seen. A Kim Jong-Un lookalike imprisoning his people in a miniature North Korean world fuelled by propaganda. Taylor Swift refusing to sing any of the forgettable songs. And an underdeveloped insight into consumerism by showing one advertisement for canned air.\r\n\r\nThen the narrative shifts to flashback mode when \u201cThe Once-ler\u201d retells his past mistakes. That being the termination of candy floss trees to manufacture his new invention. High-pitched carps, who clearly watched \u2018Alvin and the Chipmunks\u2019, irritate with forced pop culture humour. Cuddly cubs scratching their hairy walnuts on display and devouring slabs of butter. Finally, the spirit of the trees gracefully descends from the clouds by awkwardly hoisting his orange derri\u00e8re in your face. The Lorax.\r\n\r\nDanny \u201cRule Number 95 Kid, Concentrate!\u201d DeVito. A legend if I\u2019m being honest, but terribly mismatched with the moustached beast. In fact, all of the voice acting was generic and forgettable, never truly matching the wide mouths of its unmemorable characters. The, what is essentially two narrative strands, inadvertently produced an underdeveloped arc that had sole intentions on pushing its well-intentioned morals instead of genuine character development and emotionality.\r\n\r\nIllumination aren\u2019t known for their subtle storytelling, and it\u2019s evident in this adaptation. Aside from \u2018Hop\u2019 (which we shan\u2019t talk about ever again...), this is by far their weakest mess. Understandably I\u2019m not the target demographic, but children will only be hypnotised by the entrancing colours. I guarantee they shan\u2019t remember it after a few days.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Webb's Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does what ever a Spider can.\r\n\r\nThe Amazing Spider-Man is directed by Marc Webb and collectively written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves. It stars Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Martin Sheen and Sally Field. Music is by James Horner and cinematography by John Schwartzman. \r\n\r\nPeter Parker (Garfield) was orphaned as a boy when his parents were killed in a plane crash, raised by his Uncle Ben (Sheen) and Aunt May (Field), he is a clever lad but something of an outcast at high school. While investigating the disappearance of his parents and sporting a crush on class mate Gwen Stacy (Stone), Peter's life is tipped upside down when he is bitten by a radioactive spider that gives him abnormal powers. \r\n\r\nWhile the Spider-Man franchise doesn't (thankfully) come packaged with the kind of bizarre mania that comes with Batman, the acolytes are a tough bunch to figure out. Sam Raimi's trilogy garnered close towards $2.5 billion worldwide, yet now, with this reboot (actually it's a reimaging) trundled off of the Sony production line, there are plenty of \"fans\" coming forward to say they never rated Raimi's films! Magurie was this, Dunst was that, Raimi missed the beat of the comic version of Spidey and etc and etc. Well I'm sorry, but I just don't remember any fall out apart from the near unanimously agreed upon over stuffing of Raimi's part 3. Perhaps I just didn't go on the right Spider-Man forums? But even then it's hard to argue with a box office take of $2.5 billion, those figures have to be made up of a good proportion of Spidey fans, surely? You would reasonably think. \r\n\r\nI mention it because The Amazing Spider-Man has met with reviews from each end of the scale. Those at the high end who support the \"reimaging\" seem to focus on it being close to the real Spidey universe they wanted, with great casting, better effects work and a origin story of worth. At the other end is the arguments that \"reimaging\" a film that is only ten years old is daft, especially since it actually doesn't bring the promised new direction or origin story of worth. In fact it just juggles bits of the Raimi trilogy and plays it out with other Spider-Man characters instead. While Garfield is hardly an improvement since he's way too old for high school as well! The truth is that Webb's movie falls somewhere in between both sides of the argument, and that's not just me being Switzerland and staying neutral! \r\n\r\nNegatively it plays out as a compromised production and not the film that the makers initially set out to make, there are too many dangling threads and haphazard edits that leave narrative gaps. An Important character disappears off the radar, other characters are given limited time to breathe, and crucial plot points are arrived at with stupendous leaps of logic. A coda spliced into the end credits tries to entice us for the sequel, suggesting that the quick wipe over the origin \"origin\" story was deliberate, it's unlikely, and feels like an afterthought. For a film that purports to be putting its own stamp on the Spidey universe, it quite often makes you think of Raimi's films anyway. It may be The Lizard instead of Green Goblin and Gwen instead of MJ, but the emotional and psychological beats are still the same. Reboot? My arse. Oh and Horner, who I'm normally a fan of, has turned in a score that lacks vim and vigour, it aspires to be full of swirling superhero fervour to raise the goose flesh on your arms, but instead it's just goose, and not a decently cooked one at that. \r\n\r\nHowever, on the positive side of things, low expectation really helped me to enjoy the film, and I even watched it a second time to check over some initial reactions I had. There is still a lot to enjoy here. Acting is of a high standard (Ifans' performance as Curt Connors gets better on repeat viewings), with good chemistry generated between Stone and Garfield, the effects work is (obviously) better ten years on; something which gives us a better-more acrobatic-moving Spider-Man, while the whole make-up of Parker as a geek who becomes cocky, even arrogant, really adds a kick to the first half of the movie's coming-of-age narrative bent. It's also good that with a running time of over two hours the makers have the time to expand Peter as a character, making the audience wait with expectation of his life changing date with the spider. As for the villain, it's true enough to say that The Lizard is hardly an inspiring choice, but it does fit in with the whole origin story plan that Webb and his team want to tell. Though it should be noted that those seeking wall to wall fights between Spidey and The Liz are going to go a little hungry. \r\n\r\nIt's big on human story and not the lazy cash in movie it could have been, and undeniably it's fun, but the holes, dangling threads and logic leaps stop it breaking out to achieve its intentions. Looking forward to the sequel, mind 7\/10","id":"5d12a5550e0a267dceca3083","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d12a5550e0a267dceca3083","movie_id":1930}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I quite liked the 1990 version of Total Recall with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Thus I was somewhat concerned whether or not I would like this one since it would be impossible for me to watch it without comparing it to \u201cthe original\u201d.\r\n\r\nWell, luckily, I did like it. I think the 1990 version is still my favourite but I did indeed like this one as well. It is said that this movie follows the original story better than the 1990 version. I wouldn\u2019t know since I have not read it. Both are good stories with the same central idea although I have to say that the 1990 version of the story felt a wee bit more \u201cgrand\u201d than this one.\r\n\r\nThis movie is, of course, more modern in that the special effects are more up to 2012 standards. Having said that I think the funny idea of going through earth\u2019s core in a tunnel through the planet is way more far-fetched than actually going to Mars and, although the gravity reversal was a good idea in itself, the instant on\/off effect was just ridiculous. Obviously no scientific experts where hired for this movie.\r\n\r\nThe 1990 version had a lot of action in it and this one doesn\u2019t disappoint in that area. Actually, the entire film is pretty much one long action chase and a pretty well done at that. One gripe I have though is that I felt that Quaid was a bit on the wimpy side. But then, that probably comes from comparing with the Schwarzenegger \u201coriginal\u201d.\r\n\r\nSo the bottom line is that I quite liked it, It\u2019s a good solid action movie, but it didn\u2019t de-throne the 1990 version.","id":"5a63bef6c3a3687f7d016d0e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a63bef6c3a3687f7d016d0e","movie_id":64635}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Reimaging suffers a Schizoid Embolism.\r\n\r\nThis reboot of the Paul Verhoeven\/Arnold Schwarzenegger 1990 monster hit finds Colin Farrell as factory worker Douglas Quaid who, in search of meaning in his life and maybe an answer to his weird dreams, visits Rekall, a company who implant fantastical memories to order. When something strange shows up during the initial procedure, Quaid finds that nothing in his life is at all what he thought.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of very good craft here, there really is, that is on proviso you are happy to indulge in stylised effects over character substance. It's also a cold hard fact that fans of the original Philip K. Dick story, and fans of the Verhoeven bonkers adaptation, are very unlikely to embrace such a candy shop approach to what was once an inventive premise.\r\n\r\nJessica Biel and Kate Beckinsale file in for the two lead female roles, which on facial likeness is a smart bit of casting, while on a butt point of view they have two of the best in the business. Farrell is competently gruff rough and tough, but again can you avert the thought process away from Schwarzenegger cutting a swathe through a futuristic world? A big problem is that as much as Beckinsale is lovely and feisty, the decision by her husband, director Len Wiseman, to make her part a complete film filler, grates on the nerves with its obvious stench of nepotiz. \r\n\r\nStill, if you are looking for a sci-fi picture awash with outrageous excitement, bangs and crashes galore and a sexy cast? Then this will certainly give you cause to chomp down with glee on your popcorn. There's homage nods to the Arnie movie, which are gratefully received, the pace never sags and the art design for this futuristic world is grade \"A\" in quality. As remakes go it's OK and far from being a stinker, you can have fun here, but it can't deliver enough quality to those fans mentioned earlier, and they are right to have such high standards. 6\/10","id":"534963680e0a2640bf000121","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/534963680e0a2640bf000121","movie_id":64635}

{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"Ever since I saw the first photographs of Snow White and the Huntsman surface on IMDb about a year ago, I've been extremely excited to see this film. And over the past few weeks, that excitement only built op more and more to the point where almost no film can meet such high expectations. See, I have always loved the fairy tale of Snow White and the evil queen, but never before had anyone attempted to make it into what I believe it was always meant to be: a Gothic tale of fantasy and horror, rather than a sweet night time story. And now, with a much promising trailer, it appeared that Rupert Sanders had fulfilled my wish. And even though he has claimed quite some artistic license story wise, the end very much justifies the means. Snow White and the Huntsman is a film worth watching.\r\n\r\nLiterally everything I ever imagined about this classic story is there. The Dark Forest is actually Dark. It's creepy and spooky in the best kind of nightmarish way. Funnily enough, throughout the film there were some analogies with the classic Disney film. For instance, in the Dark Forest, the tree branches move autonomously towards whoever dare enter their territory, grasping around like freakish clawing fingers. The mushrooms spew poisonous fumes when you touch them. And the hills literally have eyes... The Evil Queen's castle is every goth kids' dream house. And the dwarfs are rugged, mean little men. Graphically, there's simply nothing not to love.\r\n\r\nHowever, without the key elements perfectly worked out, the pretty pictures alone wouldn't have made this film work. Let me start with the leading lady. I don't know why Kristen Stewart is getting so much hate, honestly. Not only is she a very talented young actress, she is the perfect Snow White. I can't imagine anyone doing a better job with this than her. She doesn't just have the right look (pretty face, pale skin and raven dark hair), she also has the right attitude to play Snow White the way her character was written: smart, daring and independent. This is no damsel in distress, this is a girl ready to kick some ass and get revenge. She just needs a little help from her friends. First and foremost friend on the list is Eric, the Huntsman. He is initially hired (or rather, commanded) by the Evil Queen, to hunt down Snow White. However, when he finds out that he has been deceived, he turns on the Queen and decides to help her instead. This character is played by Chris Hemsworth, and he is perfectly cast. He is all the Huntsman needs to be; rugged but charming, complete with a husky Scottish twang. Lastly, there is Snow White's childhood friend William, played by Sam Claflin, who sets out on his own personal mission to help her.\r\n\r\nOf course, the tale of Snow White would not have been complete without the notorious 7 (or 8, in this case) dwarfs. It seems the casting director pulled open a can of Britain's finest for this occasion. Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane, Eddie Marsan, Ray Winstone, just to name a few. These characters are a delight to watch and also bring some much needed comic relief to the story, without actually turning it into a comedy (which is a good thing).\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the Evil Queen, Ravenna, played by Charlize Theron. Ms Theron is a great actress, and I was really looking forward to her playing this purely evil character. And as such, the Queen was everything I had hoped for; a heartless, sadistic beauty who relies on dark magic to remain forever young and beautiful, sacrificing whosoever crosses her path for this purpose. Though strangely, viewed solely as a performance, I caught Charlize doing something I had never expected from her: she overacted. Personally I feel that her performance would have actually been much more intense had she decided not to spend half her screen time screaming at the top of her lungs, but rather just some of it, carefully dosed. However, Ms Theron has garnered a more than sufficient amount of brownie points in my book, so I'll just chalk it up to excitement. It's obvious she had a lot of fun playing this character, so she's easily forgiven. Besides, physically she fit the role perfectly and I still really enjoyed watching her.\r\n\r\nVisually, Snow White and the Huntsman is truly stunning. The CGI is top-notch, especially the Mirror is quite awesome. It transforms into a human-shaped mass of liquid gold in order to speak, and it's one of the best visual surprises in the film. The Dark Forest is the closest thing I've ever experienced to an acid trip, and all the fantasy creatures are really cool (my favourite was the angry forest troll!).\r\n\r\nI don't need to tell you about the story, we all know how it goes (although I've never seen Snow White in a harness before...), so there's no really big surprise anywhere, and of course you get the happy ending (trust me, that's not a spoiler). Still, it's the way this story is told here, that makes it a very exciting ride. There's only one point of critique I have, and that's the pacing. They really could have kicked it up a notch here and there.\r\n\r\nI think, in the end, Snow White and the Huntsman actually did live up to my expectations, and that's quite an accomplishment, considering how high they were. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I highly recommend it if you're in the mood for Snow White: The Gothic Version. Beautiful, awesome, cool!\r\n_(June 2012)_","id":"58ac4e9292514158bc0150a8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ac4e9292514158bc0150a8","movie_id":58595}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is not the fairy tale from Walt Disney that we have become used to but a rather more mature dark and sinister movie. I have to say that I enjoyed this movie.\r\n\r\nDespite that a lot of the world is much darker and filled of despair in this movie the photography is nice and the film is beautiful to watch. The film focuses a lot more on the huntsman than previous Snow White movies that I have seen and I think this is also the first one that I have seen where snow white mounts up in full battle armor. I think it worked quite well.\r\n\r\nThere is quite a few special effects in the movie but not enough to overdo it and they are reasonably well done as far as I am concerned. As I mentioned earlier the plot is somewhat different although it follows the general lines of the original story. It is still a fairly simple adventure\/action plot but it holds together well enough.\r\n\r\nThe dwarfs are present of course and, although the film takes much more serious take to the Snow White story, they still give you a laugh or two. There are a couple of scenes which more or less seemed to be fillers with not that much to add to the story but they did not really disturb the flow of the movie either.\r\n\r\nWhen the credits started to roll I was quite satisfied with my movie evening.","id":"508ce3d019c29569c9001e9f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/508ce3d019c29569c9001e9f","movie_id":58595}

There was a time when Disney was the only reliable source for such colourful frolics. Now we are blessed with a whole raft of film makers creating their own animated films born out by their personal visions. One of the benefits of this \"branching out\" has been the rise in the animated horror comedy, right up there with the best of them in recent times is ParaNorman.\r\n\r\nNorman Babcock is considered to be the weird kid in town, you see he claims to see ghosts. Little do the residents of this New England haven know it, but they will soon need Norman to break a centuries old witches curse or they are all doomed!\r\n\r\nPicture unfolds in a delightfully quirky nature, with the makers showing great love and respect to both the genres it appertains to. As with the best animated films, ParaNorman manages to be an all encompassing family friendly production. The chilly thrills are the right side of child friendly, the animation craft superb, while the humour is smart and the Gothic atmosphere surrounding the tale is pitch perfect. It all builds nicely to a bona fide thrilling finale, where the visual spectacle sits comfortably with the emotional beats of the film. Lovely, intelligent and spooky into the bargain. 8\/10","id":"535b95c00e0a264fe500151a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/535b95c00e0a264fe500151a","movie_id":77174}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Bughuul the Bastard!\r\n\r\nAfter moving himself and his family into a new house that was the scene of a horrendous crime, true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) finds a box of 8mm \"snuff\" films that suggest the murder he is currently researching is the work of a serial killer whose career dates some way back still further...\r\n\r\nIt is becoming the un-reviewable genre, horror that is, there are just too many splinters of horror to choose from and so many people to cater for. There are many who stand up and proudly proclaim that they will watch any horror film and view it on its own terms, yet in this new millennium age that doesn't appear to be the case. I know I'm at fault, I hate torture porn and excessive grue type films, they just bore me, so can I review Hostel 9, Saw 27 and Wrong Turn 12 fairly? No, I don't think I can. I mean the human body can only be sliced up in so many different ways, right? Right? Vice Versa, can someone who loves Argento, Roth and the like, review fairly a boo-jump ghost story that caters for those who want to wet themselves when something jumps out of a cupboard? I really don't think so, but I digress...\r\n\r\nSinister is a wonderfully creepy movie that deals firmly in the realm of demons who come into the real world to cause unmitigating terror and heartbreak. It has no \"axe\" to grind with the blood thirsty who want to see arteries sliced and diced, it just wants to put a protagonist front and centre as he gets in way above his head, have his family come under serious threat; especially the child (oh my, the children...), and throw in the odd \"boo-jump\" moment to keep the pant wetters happy. The video footage used to show us the previous crimes unnerves greatly and there's a strong mystery element to keep the intrigue level high, whilst the ending doesn't cop out in the slightest. Hawke is excellent, perfectly portraying a man horrified yet submerged by the need to unravel the story, but his turn is sadly balanced by Juliet Rylance as the wife who seems unable to generate believable emotion.\r\n\r\nThis film really isn't for any horror fan who isn't into the \"demon in the real world\" type horror; like Insidious for example. While those who like this splinter of horror and still decry it brings nothing new to the table, I'll ask again, well what would you like to see brought to the table then? I love this sub-genre of horror, and I feel Sinister is one of the best films of its type in recent years. Its reputation amongst like minded adults is well founded...just don't watch the trailer first, mind! 8\/10","id":"561de70bc3a3686cd60011d8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/561de70bc3a3686cd60011d8","movie_id":82507}

We thought Tiktik, which is a Filipino horror movie, was already showing.  Apparently, it is not scheduled until next week.  Then we saw Sinister\u2019s poster, which said, \u201cfrom the producer of Paranormal and Insidious\u201d.  We have seen both movies and we both didn\u2019t like Paranormal but both enjoyed Insidious. So we said, okay\u2026let\u2019s watch this instead.\r\n\r\nDidn\u2019t know anything about this movie Sinister so as we walked inside the empty movie house, I wondered which one is it going to be like. Is it going to be a homemade movie about paranormal activities with three different endings? Oh please\u2026I fervently hope not! I crossed my fingers because I noticed there were rolls of super 8 films on the poster. Or is it going to be about demons capturing souls and possessing the physical body with a non-happy ending? Or is it going to be a totally different story?  I hoped it would be.\r\n\r\nWe were the first two of the five people who came to watch this movie.  The others were a group of three teenage girls, who surprisingly didn\u2019t scream or shout at all, throughout the screening.  What a joy to be watching in silence and absolute peace!\r\n\r\nOkay, on to the movie review\u2026\r\n\r\nThe movie opens with a scene shot like a home video, so I go like, uh-oh\u2026 But don\u2019t be disheartened. It\u2019s nothing like Paranormal and deeper into the story, you\u2019d see that it is more like Insidious. That much I would tell you.\r\n\r\nThe story is about a real crime stories writer, played by Ethan Hawke (the only actor I know in the movie), who moved his entire family to a house where a family was hung to death in the backyard tree and their little girl still missing.  In the course of his research and with the help of rolls of seemingly innocent and happy family home videos that mysteriously appeared in the attic, he discovers more brutal murders of different families in different houses. So there\u2019s the question\u2026 Are these murders in any way related, considering there\u2019s always a little child missing?\r\n\r\nI must say that I find the premise of the story original. Well, at least for me. So I give it 4.5 gems for Story and Originality...\r\n\r\nContinue reading on: http:\/\/heblogs-sheblogs.com\/2012\/10\/sinister-movie-review\/","id":"507ece33760ee360a20003bf","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/507ece33760ee360a20003bf","movie_id":82507}

{"author":"tmdb39513728","content":"**Dolly Mopping**\r\n(29 January 2013) \r\n\r\nJennifer Lawrence is one magnificent slut. Her performance in _Silver Linings_ is a tour de force. She nails it. Not since Jennifer Jason Lee in _Last Exit to Brooklyn_ has a trashy trollop been played so convincingly. She easily deserves to win the Oscar for best actress and for any other category the film might win since she is the reason it's in the running at all. It's not easy being a slut. And harder still garnering sympathy for one. We can never be certain if her salacious wonts are biological or self-imposed. The grand old whore is a whole lot more desirable. She is typically forced into a her predicament for money or by male coercion. She's portrayed as a victim and tattooed with a heart of gold. But the nymphomaniac is a sadder sort. She's not as fetching or sentimental. Why should we care about her? It's clear that she either can't get enough carnal pleasure for herself or desperately seeks endless attention from men. Pathetic, is it not? But Lawrence absorbs the role and literally runs with it. Perhaps even re-writing the Dolly-Mop playbook. This movie will be required viewing for budding psychologists. And while Bradley Cooper does an impressive job bouncing the the bi-polar ball, we know he's acting. Fine work Mr. Cooper, no one else could have done it better, maybe. But down the street a few blocks, we entirely lose ourselves in Ms Lawrence. She deftly out-performs them all. Daniel Day Lincoln has to be relieved that there is a gender divide in the acting awards categories. Lawrence is so adept at playing the unapologetic slut that we suspect she's not acting. That she's spilling her guts. Revealing all the sores and warts of her true self. And this is what makes her so great in the movie.","id":"54d9099dc3a3687ab5000074","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54d9099dc3a3687ab5000074","movie_id":82693}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"The joke is firmly on us.\r\n\r\nI myself like a lot of cinematic offerings that require the brain to be left at the door. There's something very calming about being able to sit back and drive oneself into a movie with absolutely no worries about themes, agendas, politico posturing and etc. What shouldn't be tolerated is when film makers ask you to not only leave your brain at the door, but to also dribble with it and slam dunk it into the nearest garbage can.\r\n\r\nAlexandre Aja's 2010 redux of Piranha was a whole bunch of fun, even away from the 3D, in 2D form it had a devilish glint in its eye, but this on the other hand is an embarrassment to all involved. Who doesn't love the female form? Whatever your sexual proclivities et al, you would have to be dead to not appreciate the splendour of Eve's offspring. But when it's your main selling point, when you are only trying to please a very small movie watching demographic, then you got problems.\r\n\r\nJohn Gulager (director in the broadest context of the word) wants to craft a Porky's for this latest hairy palmed generation, whilst he even thinks a touch of Grindhouse might curry favour with the mall rats and skaters. Everything about this picture stinks, the acting, the hopeless attempts at suspense, badly timed jokes, poor stereotyping, laughable effects work, and on it goes. Standing up and saying it's meant to be tacky, corny and tongue in cheek just doesn't cut the mustard here, bad film making is just that, especially when it's done purely to make money.\r\n\r\nRight, I'm off to dive into a tank full of piranha fish, because that will surely be better than having to ever sit through this movie again. 1\/10","id":"537b7d510e0a26397b000104","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/537b7d510e0a26397b000104","movie_id":71668}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Piggy in the middle of film makers trying to make a living.\r\n\r\nPiggy is written and directed by Kieron Hawkes. It stars Martin Compston, Josh Herdman, Neil Maskell, Louise Dylan and Paul Anderson. Music is by Bill Ryder-Jones and cinematography by James Friend \r\n\r\nWhen his brother is killed by thugs, Joe (Compston) is persuaded to mete out vengeance by his brother's friend, Piggy (Anderson).\r\n\r\nPiggy, not exactly a great title really, is a good film, it really is. That is if one can skip back nearly 20 years and embrace the idea at its core all over again. We see it a lot these days, good films from the independent side of cinema shot down in flames by critics, both professional and amateur, because there is no originality on show. And even when a new twist is added to a staple genre, it stands no chance of gaining a weighty amount of critical support.\r\n\r\nPiggy is far from flawless, I would be surprised if writer and director Kieron Hawkes was on record as saying that is the case. It's a film that will always suffer by comparison to a couple of huge critical darling movies that came out of America and the UK previously. I will not mention them, because that pretty much spoils the core of Piggy, something so many amateur reviewers and message board posters fail to grasp. But I grumpily digress...\r\n\r\nPiggy is a violent picture, much like its lead protagonist in fact, but in amongst the blood and bone crunching, there's smart narrative splinters about alienation, fear of society, fear of violence and yes! Fear of finding the dark half of yourself taking over. So nothing new there of course, especially in British cinema during the gritty realism wave that has become something of a forte in my lifetime. But they are there and shows the film to have more to offer than merely being yet another London based stabathon.\r\n\r\nCast are good, with Compston once again proving to be a very under rated actor capable of really tuning into the art of under playing a role with confusion and sincerity of conflicting emotions. Anderson is scary as the title character, if a touch too cartoonish, while Maskell shows no signs of wanting to break free of the hard-man typecasting that now defines his career. Friend's cinematography is sometimes guilty of being too murky, and the \"metallic\" colour lenses favoured on occasions are a mistake since it's not a sci-fi or neo-noir movie.\r\n\r\nYet for all its inherent flaws and rawness, and the fact it owes its very being to other more lauded productions, Piggy should not be discounted as being a viable British slice of grit. The blood hounds are catered for, and those with a bent for the tints of emotionally damaged characters should definitely consider viewing this. It deserves better than its current internet rating and Kieron Hawkes, clearly a work in progress, might just be someone for British film fans to keep an eye on. 7\/10","id":"5327710bc3a368315e0010a5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5327710bc3a368315e0010a5","movie_id":96631}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"The Rumble Robbery.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt George's Day is directed by Frankie Harper, he also co-writes the screenplay with Urs Buehler and stars with Craig Fairbrass, Vincent Regan, Charles Dance, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran, Keeley Hazell, Jamie Foreman and Sean Pertwee. Music is by Tim Attack and cinematography is by Mike Southon.\r\n\r\nFrankie Harper, one of the most liked and recognisable faces from the slew of British gangster and football hooligan films, turns his hand to try and make his own mark in what is becoming a bulging genre of Brit film. The kicker here is that he blends the two popular lad staples together by having a plot involving gangsters using a football rumble as cover for a robbery. In Berlin, Germany, no less and St George's Day as well! Cor blimey!\r\n\r\nPlot is kind of incidental, which is just as well since it's not exactly a brains trust script. Film is filled out with the requisite amount of shouting, swearing, fighting, shooting, thieving, jingoism, sloganeering and lairy witticisms. Harper has surrounded himself with pals, clearly offering up reassuring presences to the budding director, while it's fun for fans of this splinter of Brit cinema to play spot the face. It's all very blokey and enjoyable enough for the undemanding, but the good idea on the page is not born out as the narrative often gasps for fresh air, the attempts at complexity ending up mundane.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography is a highlight, with the number of Euro locations used giving good visual tonics. Cast perform adequately as per the material, though Moran, Fletcher, Dance and Pertwee are under used and therefore wasted. There's enough in here to suggest Harper could offer something of value as a director, but maybe a little less crass for crass sake should be jettisoned in favour of some intelligence in the writing. Dexter Fletcher's debut outing as a director, Wild Bill, is a good marker, Frankie would do well to follow his mate's lead. 6\/10","id":"5322a8869251411f7a0043b0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5322a8869251411f7a0043b0","movie_id":131737}
{"author":"Sukhwinder Singh","content":"**Quick Review**\r\n\r\nStudent Of The Year aka SOTY had a pretty good expectations, considering its youngistan theme, makers and star cast of the film, and not to forget the appealing storyline of it. However it had indeed satisfied the expectations, and further more had hit the right chord to their target audience. On the other hand, the movie was compared with many other movies which had similar kind of themes (college campus), but SOTY is an altogether a complete film with different storyline, and thus provides you a totally fresh and entertaining product.\r\n\r\n**Story**\r\n\r\nIt is the story about three friends - Abhimanyu Singh, Rohan Nanda and Shanaya Singhania - and their group of buddies. Rohan Nanda aka Ro (Varun Dhawan) is a rich son of a well-known business tycoon Nanda (Ram Kapoor), and rules the St. Teresa's High School (Dehradun) with his style, attitude and riches. He is quite flirty among other girls, but has a beautiful and gorgeous girlfriend, Shanaya (Alia Bhatt). Also though Ro was a rich son of an entrepreneur, but he had a soft heart for everyone. Shanaya is a rich modern girl, who thinks herself as a fashion designer, and rules the college with her charm, beauty, and sex-appeal. Now the entry of Abhimanyu aka Abhi, he hails from a small town and aspires to become a big person one fine day. Abhi rules the college with his style, attitude and a perfect victory in everything. This irks Ro, and the two often clashes with each other. However because of his soft heart, both of them became friends and then best friends.\r\n\r\nThe turning point comes when an unexpected love triangle happens between Ro, Abhi and Shanaya, which is further followed by the 'Student Of The Year' competition in St. Teresa's High School. How these three people copes up with their complicated relationship, and eventually who wins the coveted trophy of Student Of The Year, forms the crux of the story.\r\n\r\n**Final Verdict**\r\n\r\nIt's a new age mixture of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander, with a complete different and engaging storyline. On the whole, Karan Johar's 'Student Of The Year' is a perfect film for all the youngistan, a perfect film for entertainment, and a perfect film to watch it again and again.

I was not even aware that it was a cgi-animated feature when I clicked on the buy button.\r\n\r\nI found the film surprisingly good. Sure, it is a fairly simple story appealing to fans of Starship Troopers and action\/Sci-Fi fans in general but it surprised me in a positive way. My expectations was not the highest, especially not with the disasters that have been released as follow ups to the first Starship Troopers movie.\r\n\r\nThe CGI is quite good, there\u2019s plenty of action and, although the story has more of a comic magazine depth to it, it holds together. There is a few of the usual silly, illogical, things in the plot which makes you squirm a bit in your seat but nothing too disastrous.\r\n\r\nIf I should complain about something it would be that the sound, at least on my Blu-ray disk, was somewhat weak.

The problem with it was the slow start and slow middle part, but the final act was so good. When I was watching it, I did not think I would rate it decently. I changed my mind after seeing the final few minutes and how it all ended.\r\n\r\nThe film focused on a middle class family man who is working in a supermarket chain. But this is particularly about him and his boss. After he declined the top position in the office to lead a stress free normal life, his new boss who gets close to him for his good character. That complicates him, between office and family. When a big opportunity knocks, followed by a roadblock, what happened after that was covered in the remaining narration.\r\n\r\nBasically, the whole film was concentrated between two plus one character and occasionally supporting cast. As the poster hint, it's not Parker Posey's film, she was only part of it and a famous name among the cast. Though, actors like Amt Schumer and others are in small roles. So the performances were good, with the decent storyline. This is not a famous film, I don't think many had seen it or heard of it. It was more like a television film, the quality wise, especially for the holiday season.

{"author":"Matt Golden","content":"Good evening. Our film tonight is about a man obsessed with murder. It is a tale of violence, of lies and deceit, of envy and greed. It is, naturally, a love story.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1960, the film Psycho burst onto theatre screens, beginning one of the greatest decades of change in American cinema with shrieking violins and a blood-curdling scream. The man behind the movie, director extraordinaire Alfred Hitchcock, was as much a public figure as his leading ladies and men. He managed to thrust the unsuspecting (and unprepared) public into violence and perversion that was (at the time) beyond the pale, unlike anything they'd ever seen before in a film. And they came out loving it. Wanting more. So who was the man who pulled it off? What secrets lay inside the unique mind of one of the greatest directors of all time?\r\n\r\n\"Let's get the director of Anvil! The Story of Anvil to answer that question!\" said...someone, apparently.\r\n\r\nThat's not a knock, mind. Director Sacha Gervasi acquits himself well in this behind-the-scenes story of the making of one of the greatest films of all time. The thing is...it's not, really. Hitchcock might more accurately be titled Hitchcocks, pluralizing the name for the inclusion of one Alma Reville, Hitchcock's wife and creative partner. With the making of Psycho a backdrop, Gervasi chronicles the painful, often tumultuous, but ultimately rewarding relationship between the two British emigrants. Hitchcock was a notoriously difficult chap with which to work, his sheer talent manifesting itself in exacting, often confusingly obtuse direction of his creative staff. Alma's talent matched the great director's, and she was his lifelong editor, script doctor, confidante, and advisor.\r\n\r\nHere, the lead roles are played by Sir Anthony Hopkins and Dame Helen Mirren, with the cast of Psycho filled out by Scarlett Johansson (leading lady Janet Leigh), James D'Arcy (mama's boy Anthony Perkins), and Jessica Biel (spurned starlet Vera Miles). The actors all apply themselves whole-heartedly, particularly two: Johansson gives a fantastic performance capturing Janet Leigh's class, warmth, and intelligence, while the other supporting standout, James D'Arcy, perfectly embodies the bundle of nervous energy that was Anthony Perkins. Danny Huston, as a screenwriter and potential wooer of the neglected Alma, turns in the film's only bad performance; he seems to be trying to play to the cheap seats, as though he just wandered in from a film actually made in 1960. It's a performance that clashes mightily with the naturalistic acting on display everywhere else in the film, and doesn't work at all.\r\n\r\nBut this is Hopkins' and Mirren's show, and they make their roles sing, obviously enjoying playing two of England's favored children. Hopkins is slathered with gobs of makeup and rolls of fat to approximate Hitchcock's unique physique, and while his voice is different, his mimicry of Hitch's signature elocution (combined with the way he embodies the movement of a large man) make him a dead ringer, superficially. But it's his performance as a man, not a historical figure, that sells it. His Hitchcock retains the original's mordant humor and droll aloofness, but infuses a real human being who could easily be mistaken for a character with genuine pathos and fragility. Mirren seems to relish her role as the wind beneath Hitchcock's wings, exuding strength from her eyes as she steels up for any fight that comes, be it from meddling executives or her husband. Their electric interactions are the pulse that keeps Hitchcock alive and vibrant.\r\n\r\nThe film itself is largely well-crafted, though the subplot with Whitfield Cook (Houston) attempting to court Alma doesn't seem necessary or even handled very well. There's also an oddity to scenes where Hitchcock is haunted by Ed Gein (Michael Wincott), the murderer used by Robert Bloch as inspiration for the original novel Psycho, but this worked as a strange sort of dramatization of the creative process; anyone who's lived with a work in their head knows that the characters in it are rarely silent.\r\n\r\nThat's largely indicative of this confection of a film as a whole: it's messy and a little odd, but immensely enjoyable. It trundles along at its own pace, in a structured-but-not-really sort of way. Many of the technicals are handsomely mounted (particularly the cinematography by The Social Network's Jeff Cronenweth, and the art and set direction), though it's not flawless. The editing in particular is weak, and when you're making a film about two of the greatest frame-cutters of all time, you'd be best served to bring your A game. But by the time the credits roll, you'll be glad to have spent time with these folks.","id":"51ec272219c29551d90f39a2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51ec272219c29551d90f39a2","movie_id":112336}

{"author":"PaulSD49","content":"**Low Budget but High Comedy**\r\n\r\nSorry, I suck at titles, lol. Full disclosure, I've been a fan of the AS:VS series since I first saw the 1st film at a film fest in Chicago. Really blew me away with the story, the characters, and ESPECIALLY the ending, but don't worry, no spoilers here.\r\n\r\nI recently found them again on Amazon Prime along with the sequel film and thought I'd show my support for the films on here because not a lot of people know about them.\r\n\r\nFor me, the best way to describe the AS:VS films are a mix between the TV show Deadliest Catch and John Carpenter's Vampires. It's set in a world where there are vampires, but the vamps aren't super-powered, or taking over the world, their a menace. And instead of dealing with them yourself, you call a company like the AS:VS company.\r\n\r\nAnd the characters that work at the AS:VS company are what make the story great! They're not ex-Swat officer, Marines, or Green Berets, they're the bottom of the barrel and really the only people willing to deal with the vampires and the results are pure comedy gold!\r\n\r\nI could honestly go on about the films and the characters for a while, but you should check them out yourself.

{"author":"ScottRuth","content":"Deer Crossing is the second feature length film from filmmaker Christian Jude Grillo and Potent Media (fka Potent Pictures). Grillo wrote and directed the film. He even did the film's editing (along with his new wife Camerla Hayslett-Grillo) and he composed the original score.\r\n\r\nEarly on in the film, the female lead Maggie (played by Laura Lynn Cottrel), driving with her young son, hits a deer head on. I envy that deer. I do. He wasn't put in the unenviable position of having to write this review.\r\n\r\nLet's start with a brief synopsis of the story. As mentioned above, Maggie Chancelor and her 6 year old son Cole have a car-on-deer collision and disappear, leaving Maggie's husband, Dr. Michael Chancelor (played by Warren Hemenway), left to wonder what had become of his wife and child. Years pass and Dr. Chancelor gets a phone call from someone claiming to be his son. After receiving the mysterious call, he contacts Derrick Stanswood (played by Christopher Mann), the cop who had previously investigated the disappearance of Maggie and Cole. Stanswood has just retired but after a life changing event, he finds himself back on the case, but this time in a private dick sort of role. Stanswood travels to a small PA town where he runs into opposition from the local justice merchant, a smarmy Sheriff by the name of Lock (played by Doug Bradley). The investigation leads Derrick to meet, and question, a variety of shady characters including local farmer Lucas Walton and his son Paul as well as other lowlife local yokels. Cole Chancelor, now 14 years old, finally turns up with one hell of a tale to tell. A tale that involves abduction, corruption, rape, incest and even murder!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this film is a very flawed one, and I honestly had a hard time trying to think of one positive thing I can say about it, aside from a few shining performances by actors\/actresses in an otherwise lackluster production. The acting of some of the film's stars is absolutely atrocious. Even Doug Bradley, the original Pinhead of Hellraiser fame, is really bad here, but then again when an English actor is charged with playing a Pennsylvania hick sheriff, what more could I, or anyone else for that matter, have expected? I dig Bradley but he's not the kind of actor known for being able to adopt region-specific dialects for each role he's cast in. He does seem to try to cover his natural accent but he's not very good at it. It reminded me of Cary Elwes' poor American accent, only not quite as good. Poor casting, but then again no one forced Bradley to accept the role.\r\n\r\nCarmela \"Roxsy Tyler\" Hayslett, who plays Olivia Brice, a specialist brought in to question Cole (Apparently she's an expert in dealing with traumatized youths) comes off like a hammy 10 year old pretending to act because her Daddy turned the camcorder on her. This was a surprise, and a disappointment, as her work in Potent's previous film, Booley, was that of a seasoned professional. Again, it's not all her fault. Actors cannot overact if the director doesn't allow it. Yell cut. Talk to your actor\/actress, tell them what they are doing wrong and what they are doing right, tell them exactly how you want the scene played out, and then call for action once again! Unfortunately, the dialogue given to her caused some of the overacting. A professional who specializes in dealing with kids who have been through traumatic events would never scream at a child with whom she was dealing, nor would she try to pull the \"tough cop\" act on said kid. It wasn't believable. One piece of advice I'd like to give to Carmela (who is a friend of mine, or was a friend before this review anyway) is this: that no matter what role you're paying, be sure to deliver your lines in a fashion similar to how you'd actually speak during your daily life, away from the camera. The same sort of advice could be given to Christian Grillo. When writing dialogue,  sound it out. If it doesn't sound natural when you vocalize it, then don't ask your actors to speak it because it won't sound natural when they recite the lines either.\r\n\r\nContinuing on a discussion of the film's performances, let's move on to Ernie Hudson. You'll surely remember Ernie from such roles as Winston Zeddemore in the Ghostbusters films, Sgt. Albecht in The Crow, Sgt. O'Malley in Airheads and Warden Leo Glynn in HBO's hit series OZ. Hudson plays Captain Bailey in Deer Crossing. Ernie's a fantastic actor and he plays this role pretty much the same way he plays most of his roles, with nothing but passion and professionalism. Sadly he wasn't given much to work with as his role is a minimal one. Had this character been left out of the script, it wouldn't have been noticeable. His lines could have been given to any one of the other random police officers without it having any impact on the story.\r\n\r\nChristopher Mann's performance is decent although I've seen much better from him. He just didn't seem \"inspired\" at all. He felt flat to me. Having seen him in Booley, Jersey Justice and Law & Order, I know that the man is a fantastic actor but his work in Deer Crossing seemed as though he was unmotivated. He seemed bored.\r\n\r\nNow for the truly positive performance notes:\r\n\r\nLaura Lynn Cottrell - Laura does a great job as Maggie. She plays the role as if she (Maggie) is midway between still wanting to fight against those who have held her captive and someone with the beginning stages of Stolkholm syndrome.\r\n\r\nKJ Linhein - Mr. Linhein plays crazed farmer Lucas Walton. Although his performance is a little bit over the top during some scenes, he's a joy to watch here. Well, I say \"joy\" if you're like me and can appreciate the fine performance of psychotic character. Again the downside to the Walton character is the sometimes over-the-top dialogue.\r\n\r\nTom Detirk - Detrik, who played the lead role in Potent's debut film Booley, plays a pimp\/hustler\/lowlife\/thug named Randy (or Dick, depending on which character is addressing him in the film) and is a breath of fresh, comedic air into this otherwise stale film. His character brings much needed comic relief to the film. Detrik is a likable guy no matter what role he's playing.\r\n\r\nKevin Fennell - Kevin, who plays Cole at age 14, does a wonderful job with what he is given. He may not have much, if any, acting experience but he's shown here that he has a lot of potential as an actor. I hope to see more from young Kevin in the future.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'd like to mention the small part of Muzzy, one of Walton's bizarro redneck buddies, played by Christopher Inlow. Inlow, who is most well known as horror host character Slo Frank (Winner of D'Ment'D Cinema's first ever fan's choice award for Best Horror Host in 2011), does a phenomenal job as Muzzy. If you've ever known a complete and total redneck hick, Muzzy would surely remind you of him. Like Fennell, Inlow has a bright future ahead of him as an actor.\r\n\r\nWith discussion of the performances behind us, let's move on to some of the technical portions of the production. Right now I'll state that I'm not the type of reviewer who picks apart technical aspects of a movie, aspects that I have no experience with therefor I am honestly not in any position to be overly critical of, unlike many, if not most, reviewers. That being said, I do have a few other critiques, sticking to the areas that I do feel qualified to comment on...\r\n\r\nThe score - The score is out of place in most scenes and is so loud in some that it drowns out much the dialogue. A score should reflect the emotion of the scene and what's going on during said scene. That doesn't happen much here. More often than not the music chosen for the film's scenes does not fit the mood of the scene, therefor making it (the music) stand out like a sore thumb.\r\n\r\nThe camera work - It's bad! The film's DP failed miserably, especially during any scene shot outside under the sun's natural light. (Many of these scenes are shot with the sun facing the camera so the shadows blacken out the subjects' faces.) Since there is no DP listed in the credits on IMDB I'm not sure to whom to bestow the (dis)honor of this casualty.\r\n\r\nOne other mistake that I believe was made with Deer Crossing came from the trailer. I know many horror fans were looking forward to Deer Crossing because they believed that it was going to contain intense scenes of violence. Scenes that fans have come to expect from the genre because of movies such as the Hostel series, The Human Centipede and Martyrs. Intense violence and scenes of torture are present in most of the more popular genre films of the last few years. Many potential viewers of this film expect to see such scenes of torture here since it's implied in the film's trailer. Those sort of scenes are basically non-existent in this film. Allow me to elaborate. Although there are scenes of torture and brutality in Deer Crossing, they are tame when compared to similar scenes in many of today's genre films. Is it the fault of the filmmaker when the audience's expectations are not met? Sometimes yes and sometimes no. When it's implied, in any manner, in the trailer, then it's at least the fault of the editor of the trailer. It's safe to assume that the filmmaker here edited his own trailer, and if that is indeed the case, then the answer to the question of, \"is it his fault that the audience's expectations were not met?\",  is a resounding YES!\r\n\r\nGrillo's film Booley is wonderful. It's well shot, the acting is top notch and I honestly cannot remember having one complaint about that film. I am the only reviewer quoted on the film's DVD cover as a matter of fact. So, where did he go wrong with Deer Crossing? I honestly wish I knew for sure. How does a filmmaker go from a piece that is practically flawless to one so flawed? I'd be arrogant if I were to try to suggest the possible scenarios that may have caused this so I think I'll not do that. That's a question that only Christian Grillo could answer.\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that I've lost all faith in Christian as a filmmaker? Absolutely not! Every filmmaker makes a bad one here and there. For example, Ang Lee is a phenomenal director. The Ice Storm, Brokeback Mountain and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon are all great films but Ang also did Hulk in 2003 and we all know how awful that mess was. Then there's Tim Burton. Batman, Beetlejuice, Ed Wood, the list of great Burton films goes on and on but even Tim has made a stinker occasionally, with Planet Of The Apes and The Corpse Bride being examples of his poor efforts. Even Francis Ford Coppola has shown that he is not flawless as a filmmaker. All one needs to do to know this for certain is to watch out The Godfather III!\r\n\r\nNo I have no given up on Grillo. No, I am not stating that he's a bad director nor am I saying that he's a bad writer. All this review is stating is that I did not care for this one film. I found too many flaws in both the writing and directing to honestly give Deer Crossing a good review but I do look forward to Christian Grillo and Potent Media's next cinematic venture.\r\n\r\nI consider Christian Grillo a friend and I cannot begin to describe to you how difficult it was for me to write this review. I do value his friendship but I must also protect my own integrity. After all, if I lie and tell you that a film is good, simply because it was the work of a personal friend of mine, when it's anything but good, would you, the reader of my reviews, ever trust me again once you've seen the film in question and know that I lied my ass off about it? Not very likely. I need to be honest in my reviews. If that costs me friendships, so be it but if that were to happen, that's something that belongs placed firmly on the shoulders of that former friend, and not on my own. I hope that has not happened here.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I have always stated, don't just take my word for it. See this, and any other, movie for yourself. Just because I didn't like it, that doesn't mean you won't. The best person to help you form an opinion of a film is YOU!","id":"50af9c6c760ee32b850018e9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/50af9c6c760ee32b850018e9","movie_id":134885}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Like an angel come down from the storm.\r\n\r\nDeadfall is directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky and written by Zach Dean. It stars Eric Bana, Olivia Wilde, Charlie Hunnam, Kate Mara, Treat Williams, Kris Kristofferson and Sissy Spacek. Music is by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Shane Hurlbut.\r\n\r\nSiblings Addison (Bana) and Liza (Wilde) are fleeing a casino heist that\u2019s gone badly wrong. Deciding to split up, they arrange to meet up at a later point and go their separate ways. Liza hooks up with ex-convict Jay (Hunnam) while Addison has a date with an abusive father. All while the police, led by a father and daughter pairing who have their own family issues, close in on them along with a blizzard.\r\n\r\nRuzowitzky\u2019s snowy neo-noir may not have the most brainiest of plots, but it makes up for that elsewhere with genuine thrills, spills and wintry chills. Shane Hurlbut photographs it in steely cold metallic blues, piercing whites and bloody reds, then laying an ethereal sheen over the night time sequences. This is perfect tonal accompaniment to the characterisations fronting the story, Addison and Liza have definite incestuous leanings, with the former capable of brutal violence when required. Jay, out of prison, is a big disappointment to his father (Kristofferson), but more pressing concerns are a deadly confrontation he is forced into, and that he\u2019s falling for Liza, who appears to be damaged goods and whose motives are unclear.\r\n\r\nOn the supposed good side of the snowy fence is Hannah (Mara) and Becker (Williams), daughter and father cops, she strives to make her daddy proud, he resents her for not being a son, even chastising her with cold venom in front of other officers. It\u2019s a whirlpool of troubled characters battling it out in the snowy wilds of North America. Ruzowitzky inserts some quality action sequences as the protagonists\/antagonists snake towards their date with destiny, which arrives in a classy film noir trope way at Jay\u2019s parents house. The air is pungent with fatalism and the link of all characters having kin problems gives the narrative some bite. Very well performed by the cast, this is comfortably recommended to neo-noir lovers. 7.5\/10","id":"53519a2ac3a3681d87001ac3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53519a2ac3a3681d87001ac3","movie_id":97614}
{"author":"Gimly","content":"The following is a long-form review that I originally wrote in 2012.\r\n\r\nThe film in all was a relatively decent venture. Perhaps Pixar's well deserved success is its pitfall here. Though highly enjoyable, Brave was simply not up to the standard brought forth by the likes of the Toy Story trilogy, Up or Monsters Inc. ?This movie falls more into the category of \"Entertaining, acceptable, cute\" instead of the higher echelons some of the studio's past work has earned it.\r\n\r\nBrave attempts to take the \"Disney Princess\" line away from its predecessors in which princesses are only good for getting themselves into trouble so that men can rescue them (ie. Snow White, Belle, etc.) or in the case of the Little Mermaid in which she is willing to almost literally walk on broken glass for a man simply because he's pretty. And for this, we thank Brave. All that said and done however, there was one rather unfortunate side-effect of all this. I at first simply felt it was my warped interpretation, but every person whom I've spoken to drew the same conclusion, so perhaps not... Now, I'm sure it wasn't intentional, but, I must say, the main character Merida... Seemed to... Have a thing for her mum. Just saying, honestly, that's how the piece feels as it plays out.\r\n\r\nOn a less incestuous note though, stand up comic\/actor Billy Connolly as Meridia's father King Fergus is simply brilliant, and probably the highest point of the whole film. Though the animation didn't exactly make leaps and bounds forward in comparison to anything else that's come out in the past couple of years, it was still most certainly impressive.\r\n\r\nMaybe if I had been part of Brave's target audience I could have appreciated the movie more. It was most certainly good, but I wasn't really ?blown away? by any aspect of the film whatsoever. It managed to scrape a slight \"above average\" but I really would have liked something more than I got, especially seeing as movies on the big screen tend to impress me more readily.\r\nBrave's biggest problem is that it is, in essence, forgettable. Though an entertaining 93 minutes to be sure, I can't imagine myself hankering for a re-watch any time soon.\r\n\r\n62%\r\n\r\n-Gimly","id":"5e0833329bcd0f001712d50c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e0833329bcd0f001712d50c","movie_id":62177}
{"author":"Travis Bell","content":"I enjoyed Brave but it wasn't without a few flaws.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I never felt like there was much meat to the story. It was enjoyable sure, and had some good morals and family values but I never felt like I was invested in the main characters. Stuff just seemed to happen.\r\n\r\nSecondly, and this isn't as much the movies fault as perhaps the marketing that surrounded it, but it was actually a very different movie than I thought it was going to be. I discovered that it's hard to break those pre-conceptions as I kept thinking the story was going somewhere else than it did.\r\n\r\nBrave was at its best when it made me laugh which  unfortunately, was just too seldom. For example, the entire scene where the 3 clans try to fight for M\u00e9rida's hand was way too short!\r\n\r\nThe voice cast was very good though. Kelly Macdonald in particular, was perfect as M\u00e9rida.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Brave was good but not great. It just seems to lack the \"magic\" I expect from Pixar.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Broken: Past Particle Of Break.\r\n\r\nBroken is directed by Rufus Norris and adapted to screenplay by Mark O'Rowe from Daniel Clay's novel. It stars Tim Roth, Eloise Laurence, Robert Emms, Rory Kinnear, Faye Daveney and Cillian Murphy. Music is by Electric Wave Bureau and cinematography by Rob Hardy. \r\n\r\nTheatre and Opera director Rufus Norris turns his hand to feature film, choosing for his debut a cunning slice of British miserabilism and knowing humour. Story is based in North London and primarily centres on a young girl affectionately known as Skunk! She witnesses a sickening act of violence in the cul de sac where she lives, from here the lives of the residents unfold in a number of identifiable ways. \r\n\r\nThematically there's much going on, such observations on life's dilemmas from both a child and parenting point of view are superbly played out by the cast. It would have been easy for the makers to lean too heavy on the melodrama, or perform as if it's a headline torn straight from one of Britain's sensationalistic tabloids, but it's played with earthy realism, helped no end by the fulcrum setting of a residential cul de sac that on the surface looks normal, so therefore believable. But of course what lies behind a neighbour's door is rarely all glint and gold.\r\n\r\nThe concurrent theme of violence, illness, heartbreak, grief, so basically life's strifes, gnaws away at the senses, but this is delicately balanced with much love and charm also on show, be it devotion to one's children, or the innocence of youth - puppy love\/whimsy\/ignorance\/inquisitive leanings et al - this picture jabs at the heart in more ways than one. Norris and his team also have a nifty style of filming and scoring, very much putting us in the various frames of this story. \r\n\r\nIt all builds to what in truth is a very crammed last quarter of film, because if ever there was a case for a much longer running time then this is a classic example. But it's just a niggle, and not enough to derail what is a moving, funny and crafty slice of Britannia. Yes! Even if the daring ending has proved divisive. 9\/10","id":"587a638b9251413eec004a73","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/587a638b9251413eec004a73","movie_id":109584}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**After life, before death, there's a medium!**\r\n\r\nI happy that B movies exist. Because mainstream filmmaker won't do this kind of simple experiment. Actually there's nothing new in this film, the same old storyline. There are hundreds of similar films, even you can compare to the recent 'If I Stay', but the thing is it was differently told tale. The director's first feature film, and actors are not the popular ones, but with a decent story, everything looks so fine. The graphics for this kind of budget, not really bad. They even had a decent CGI character. Actually, most of the film takes place in the dark time, so they had all the advantage, hence the production was very neat.\r\n\r\nKind of a limited cast film, but very occasionally a few characters, including small background crowd appeared. When the twist comes in the final act, you will realise it is the same old crap, but well maintained suspense in the initial parts. Those content balance and good development is what worked in favour of the film. So the overall film was very entertaining, because I was not expecting any big from it after learning how it was received. Not for everyone, but I also suggest don't believe in those negative remarks on this. It's definitely worth a watch, even if you are not going to rate it low. So I hope you make a good decision.\r\n\r\n_6.5\/10_","id":"57f4142b9251417fd4001a44","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57f4142b9251417fd4001a44","movie_id":118612}
{"author":"LastCaress1972","content":"One of the many, many cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, \"found footage\" horrors out there, and one which regrettably has ambition that outstretches its reach. Most obviously calling to mind the well-executed Norwegian hit Trolljegeren (Troll Hunter), The Lost Coast Tapes centers around a small-time television presenter's attempt to kick-start his stalled career with a documentary about the legendary Sasquatch, having come into contact with a portentous and theatrical mountain-dweller claiming to be able to provide - for a considerable sum of money - incontrovertible proof of the existence of the cryptozoological primates that perpetuate the \"Bigfoot\" myth in the Californian hills. Obviously our man doesn't believe a word of it but he thinks that the mountain man's elaborate hoax combined with his own dry disassembly of same will add up to TV gold. He brings with him into the hills his buddy cameraman, his mysticism-loving producer ex-girlfriend and a new-to-the-team sound man, so nerdy it's farcical. Needless to say, things go very wrong for all concerned.\r\n\r\nI think it's a neat little idea, but low-budget found-footage movies need to balance quite a few spinning plates in order to be a good film: The protagonists need to be both real and likeable (or at least sympathetic), the camerawork needs to be shaky enough to give it that raw feel but also clear enough to give the audience the required degrees of tension\/terror, and the budget for the film and the central conceit need to marry up; that is to say that if your film is about trolls and you plan to show those trolls, your budget needs to adequately cover that, but if your budget is non-existent then perhaps your film should be about something considerably more insubstantial like, say, the spirit of a witch haunting the woods of Maryland. The Lost Coast Tapes unfortunately fails on all of these counts. The actors, without exception, come across as trying too hard to \"act\". They're possibly sticking too stolidly to a script that reads too melodramatically. Whilst the three surrounding crew members are stereotypical and unsympathetic fodder, the main protagonist (Drew Rausch, Battleship) is one of the most unlikeable leads I've seen in recent memory. I wanted him dead by the end of the first scene. The Sasquatch-baiting mountain dweller is played by a guy (Frank Ashmore) desperately wishing he was Brian Cox but coming across like Tom Baker in Blackadder II. The shaky-cam was so all over the place and lingering for far too long on nothing in particular so often that I found myself getting angry at the film. This of course is usually done to cover a deficit in the available effects, but here it covers for both that AND the fact that next-to-nothing is actually happening. When something DOES happen, some daft face-cam conceit means that we see our protagonists in close-up head shot reacting to what's about to attack them in laughably inept fashion (\"Aah! No, no... aagh!\"). To cap everything, this film with a budget that can't adequately even display the Sasquatches that the film is supposed to be about, has the audacity later on to suggest that the film's about other things, undefined horrors much worse than Sasquatches, things represented here by some floodlights being shone into the windows. Again, nothing wrong with the idea, but they've gone from an idea that was in the end too big for the film to handle, to an even bigger idea. D'oh!\r\n\r\nSo, anything to like? Well, I like the Sasquatch concept, I like found footage movies despite their rabid overuse at this point, and anything involving being lost in the woods - however poorly executed - is inherently scary. But this film doesn't do enough with any of that, I'm afraid.\r\n\r\nFantastic poster, though.","id":"5207b1b3760ee3630522887f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5207b1b3760ee3630522887f","movie_id":129418}
{"author":"CRCulver","content":"This is a 2012 documentary about the eponymous 1970s pop-rock band from Memphis that saw few sales in spite of enormous critical acclaim, but went on to become a cult phenomenon and inspire some great bands in the decades that followed. The documentary was made without the participation of Big Star's surly frontman Alex Chilton (and it was completed following Chilton's untimely death), but it does feature interviews with bassist Andy Hummel, drummer Jody Stephens, and the musicians brought on when Chilton announced a new Big Star in the 1990s. Furthermore, producer John Fry appears throughout the documentary and appears to have had a bigger role in the Big Star story than many listeners might have imagined.\r\n\r\nThe film begins with the Memphis context of the late 1960s\/early 1970s. Chilton, who had already had a chart hit with the band The Box Top and toured the country, comes home and starts a new band with Chris Bell. The process of recording Big Star's first album \"#1 Record\" is explained in some depth, from how the band used the available studio resources to where the iconic cover art came from.\r\n\r\nWe learn how Bell splits after the first album, has a nervous breakdown and flirts with evangelical Christianity, tries to make it as a musician in England and cuts the legendary single \"You and Your Sister\/I am the Cosmos\", and finally dies in 1978 of a car crash at only 27 years old. There are poignant interviews with Bell\u2019s older brother and sister-in-law, but part of Bell's angst was his homosexuality, and everyone is uncomfortable even approaching this subject.\r\n\r\nThe documentary continues through the recording of Big Star's second (\"Radio City\") and third (\"Third\/Sister Lovers\") records, followed by the ultimate breakdown of relations between Jody Stephens and Alex Chilton and the end of Big Star. There's some brief coverage of Chilton's solo career through the 1980s and the reformed Big Star in the 1990s and early millennium. There are some brief comments from later, perhaps more famous musicians that express an eternal debt to Big Star, like Teenage Fanclub and Mike Mills of R.E.M.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those documentaries that, to a degree, expects viewers to already know quite a bit about the band in question, making it somewhat frustrating for those who know Big Star's name and legacy but not so much the band's career and arc. It is mentioned that #1 Record sold poorly through label problems, but it's as if the viewer is already supposed to know that it was poorly distributed. It is mentioned briefly that Chris Bell died in a car crash, but with little detail. And there are some aspects of the production that seem mystery. For example, why does Jody Stephens have such a bad attitude throughout his interviews?\r\n\r\nStill, I enjoyed <i>Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me<\/i> overall. So many rock documentaries interview people who exploded into stardom, moved to la-la-land like California and seem to live on another planet compared to non-celebrities. Here, on the other hand, it's amazing just what ordinary southern Americans these people are, who clearly have some good memories of their youth but never really went for celebrity culture. They could be one's neighbours or the people you pass in the supermarket. That's not to say that they aren't interesting, as they include some quirky characters like the affably campy John King and producer Jim Dickinson's elderly but eternally young widow.","id":"5b8c2ccc9251415197035e5c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b8c2ccc9251415197035e5c","movie_id":193346}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is one of the best movies I have watched in a long time. It is a pure Tarantino blast. The somewhat unexpected and quite hilarious start of the movie catches your attention from the start and from then on it is 3 hours (almost) of pure enjoyment. \n\nThe main actors are playing their roles very well. The Dr. King Schultz character (Christop Walz) is incredibly funny without being ridiculous, Jamie Foxx is excellent as Django and Leonardo DiCaprio is doing his role well as a plantation owner and slave trader. None of the rest of the crew stood out as particularly bad. Well with the possible exception of Tarantino himself then when he made his usual in-movie appearance a\u2019 la Hitchcock. Not that he was particularly bad but he is no actor either.\n\nThe movie starts of by Dr. Schulz liberating Django and proceeding to a small town showing Django what he is in the business of doing. Those first minutes of the movie are somewhat unexpected and very funny to watch. After that the movie gets more serious as Django gets to learn to be a bounty hunter and finally gets on with his quest to rescue his \u201cDamsel in distress\u201d. It still has quite a bit of \u201cTarantino humour\u201d sprinkled around in it though.\n\nDuring the movie we are treated to a long series of stereotypical people with, let us say, an \u201cattitude\u201d towards African people. It is tempting to say \u201cnigger haters\u201d but that would not be true since a lot of these people did not exactly hate them. They just did not consider African people to be people but more than live stock for them to use as they wished. Unlike a lot of movies portraying these events this one never comes across as boringly finger pointing or overly morally lecturing. Nor does it in any way support or glorify the way things were at this time. It is a movie made to entertain set in a period where bad shit happened and using it for the story. Nothing more and nothing less.\n\nAs usual with a Tarantino movie there are some violent parts, some more violent parts and some bloody violent parts in it. The ending fights are a glorious show of destruction and blood splatter. I am sure some people are complaining about the \u201cunnecessary violence\u201d. I am not one of those people. Without these parts it would not be a real Tarantino movie. As always it is made with the usual exaggeration that Tarantino is so good and which reminds you that it is \u201conly a movie\u201d.\nThis is one of the few movies that I have given 10 out of 10 stars in a very long time. I enjoyed it immensely.","id":"5ad7255c9251413b2b00d193","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ad7255c9251413b2b00d193","movie_id":68718}

{"author":"LastCaress1972","content":"America, mid-nineteenth century, just prior to the Civil War. Winter. Two horsebacked slave-traders are leading half-a-dozen manacled negro slaves through a large, unspecified section of Texas. As they move one night through a wood, they cross paths with an affable, charming German fellow identified by the hokey model tooth affixed atop his carriage by a spring as a travelling dentist. He greets the traders cordially but he's struggling to be understood; not because English is his second language (although he deferentially concedes as much when instructed - more than once - to \"Speak English!\") but because his vocabulary is far wider than that of the simpler men here before him. It's not a chance passing, either; this German fellow, who identifies himself as Dr. King Schultz (played by Christoph Waltz with the same smiling, deadly menace that earned him an Oscar statue for his part as Col. Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds) is looking for these traders. More specifically, their inventory of negro slaves. Even more specifically, one of those slaves in particular. Django (Jamie Foxx, Collateral, Ray). Attempting to buy Django, Schultz is met with short, suspicious shrift and ordered at gunpoint to be on his way. Within a second, one trader lies dead and the other lies incapacitated underneath the bulk of his dead horse. Schultz unchains Django, instructs Django to take the dead fellow's horse and coat, and pays the remaining trader for all that he's taken. He then tosses the manacle key to the other slaves and posits two choices to them, as he sees it: Carry their injured master thirty-plus miles to the nearest town for medical assistance, or unchain themselves, blow the injured slave-trader's head off with the gun Shultz has left them, bury the corpses and use the Pole Star to run for the Northern states, where slavery had been abolished, and for more than fifty years in some areas. Funnily enough, they take up the latter option.\r\n\r\nSo begins Django Unchained, an oater set in the slave states of the Deep South and the latest rollercoaster by Gen-X movieland wunderkind Quentin Tarantino. Always clearly a man heavily informed by the grindhouse subgenre of the Spaghetti Western, he's finally made one himself, and if Quentin's your thing it's a blast, though I doubt it'll convert many Tarantino sceptics; in fact it'll almost certainly reinforce those things that people dislike about him, about which more later.\r\n\r\nIt transpires that Dr. Schultz ISN'T a dentist (\"I haven't practised dentistry in five years,\" he confides to Django over a beer) but a bounty hunter, and a lethal one at that. He's chasing down the Brittles, a murderous gang of brothers currently plying their trades as plantation overseers. He doesn't know what they look like but he knows they were recently employed at the Carrucan plantation, which is why he was searching for Django - a slave recently sold by that very plantation - in the first place; Django can point them out for him. Schultz is no fan of the South's backwards-thinking propensity for slavery though, and he offers Django a deal: help Schultz find and kill the Brittle Brothers, Schultz will treat Django like a free man, pay him $75 (a decent little wedge in 1858) and rubber-stamp his freedom. Along the way, he'll also teach Django a thing or two about the art of gunfighting and about the macabre trade of bounty-hunting (both in which Django proves to be a natural). On the trail of the Brittles, Schultz wonders aloud as to Django's plans once this endeavour is over and he's free. Well, as it happens, Django is a married man and his intention, once free, is to find his wife and buy her freedom. They'd tried to run from the Carrucan plantation together but they'd been caught, branded (both Django and his wife - played with all of her nerves exposed by Kerry Washington - sport R-For-Runaway scars on their cheeks) and sold on, separately. So he doesn't know where she is but that's what he's going to try to do. Schultz, feeling responsible for Django as the man granting him his freedom, proposes a further deal: If this Brittle bounty goes well, he'll honour Django's freedom but if Django stays with him through the winter as partners, taking on bounties and earning money, he'll help Django locate his wife.\r\n\r\nWhat we have here is a large sequence of set-pieces - some funny, some tense, some action-packed - stretched across very-nearly three hours (though, like most QT films, it moves like a bullet train and those three hours just fly) strung together by a fairly simple revenge\/rescue tale set against a geographically sprawling backdrop; a reasonably similar template to many of Quentin's movies and an almost identical template to that of previous outing Inglourious Basterds, to which Django Unchained could almost be considered a companion piece despite the wildly different global and historical settings. Like Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained is quite a bit longer than the story need be, and like Inglourious Basterds that is because each scene is treated by Tarantino as a mini movie, a contained set-piece all of its own. Every scene is fleshed out and deepened for either heightened comic or dramatic effect by lengthened sequences of characters going about the mundane or by characters delivering enormous monologues - rambling shaggy-dog stories, usually - to one another, for context. Not every scene is entirely necessary, either. I wouldn't call that a flaw though, I'd call it a trait typical of Quentin Tarantino; whether it's a flaw or an outright treat depends entirely on whether that's an element of Tarantino's writing that the viewer appreciates. Personally, I love Tarantino's writer's voice and I could watch these scenes for hours (indeed, I watched Django Unchained three times over the course of yesterday), but I can fully undersand what those lamenting the decent 90-minute film that's lost somewhere within the sojourns and speeches of Django Unchained are saying.\r\n\r\nPerformances throughout are utterly mesmerising, from stars Foxx and Waltz but also - in fact, maybe more so - from principle antagonists Leonardo DiCaprio as \"Monsieur\" Calvin Candie, the horrifying owner of the \"Candyland\" plantation currently holding the ownership deeds on Django's wife, and Samuel L. Jackson in an if-anything even more monstrous role as Stephen, Candie's elderly head house slave, a man who has utterly abndoned the culture and torment of his people in return for a few material trappings as the slave-in-chief. Playing to superb comedic effect is Don Johnson as Big Daddy, a strutting, peacock-like Tennessee dandy and owner of the plantation currently employing the Brittle Brothers, and delightful in cameo roles are (among many others) James Remar (The Warriors, Dexter), Jonah Hill (Superbad, The Watch), John Jarratt (Wolf Creek, Rogue) and Michael Parks (Red State, Kill Bill). Quentin himself makes a cameo as usual and, as usual, he's not as charming as he probably thinks he is, but he's also not as bad as many think he is, either. There's even a quick cameo (raising an involuntary cheer from me!) by Franco Nero, the original Django from the magnificent 1966 film of the same name by Sergio Corbucci (that's not the only nod back to the first Django movie; the opening credits to Django Unchained are presented in exactly the same way as the original, and the theme song to Quentin's film comes directly from the Corbucci film too).\r\n\r\nDjango Unchained is likely to come under fire on a couple of counts; possibly for it's incredible levels of bloodshed (one particular gunfight is the most blood-splattered scene I've seen in a movie since those elevator doors opened in The Shining), and much more probably for the liberal use of what guilty white folks like to refer to as \"The 'N'-word\", uttered literally hundreds of times from first scene to last. However, neither criticism is warranted in my humble opinion. The bloodshed is of the overexaggerated cartoon quality. Heads, arteries and extremities explode upon bullet impact like detonated watermelons to a gloopy, \"BLAAAPP!\" sound effect, the blood itself translucent, syrupy and intentionally unrealistic. And if a tale is set against the backdrop of slavery in the 19th century deep South, you're going to hear the word \"Nigger\" in that tale. Often. Be assured though that just as Inglourious Basterds was a revenge fantasy of the downtrodden Jewish war refugees over the stupidly evil Nazi Germans, this is a tale of empowerment of the enslaved black man over his sadistic, pig-ignorant white overseers.\r\n\r\nIf you like Tarantino, you'll probably like Django Unchained. If you like Westerns (and the blood-drenched Spaghetti Westerns of the late sixties in particular), you'll probably like Django Unchained. If, like me, you're an admirer of both Tarantino AND westerns, this is a no-brainer. Get and see it, it's a blast.\r\n\r\nI'd like to have seen him pull a Gatling gun out of a coffin, though.","id":"5207b0bb760ee36305225258","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5207b0bb760ee36305225258","movie_id":68718}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"When Django is unchained (pronounced JANG-oh, not Duh-JANG-oh)\r\n\r\nReleased in 2012 and directed & written by Quentin Tarantino, \"Django Unchained\" stars Christoph Waltz as an ex-dentist who befriends an ex-slave, Django (Jamie Foxx) in West Texas a couple of years before the Civil War; they team-up as bounty hunters once they realize how good they jell. The second half focuses on their attempt to infiltrate a Mississippi plantation owned by pompous Southerner \"Monsieur\" Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) in order to rescue Django's wife (Kerry Washington). Samuel L. Jackson plays Candie's overly loyal house slave.\r\n\r\nThis is an excellent American Western with Spaghetti Western elements featuring Tarantino's typical artistic flourishes. It takes place in the West AND in the South, which is reminiscent of the underrated \"Nevada Smith\" (1966), one of my favorite Westerns. Waltz is magnetic as the nonchalant protagonist and he & Foxx have good chemistry. There's a nice mix of interesting dialogues, amusing moments and over-the-top action. Unfortunately, but to be expected, Tarantino goes overboard with the 'n' word and the blood-letting, the latter to the point of cartoonish-ness. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, this is an original Western that is vibrant with creativity, including stunning locations, cinematography and a great amalgamated soundtrack\/score, which includes cuts by Ennio Morricone, like the excellent \"Hornets' Nest,\" the imaginative \"The Braying Mule\" and the moving \"Ancora Qui.\" It's all-around superior to \"The Hateful Eight\" (2015) because it's not limited by a one-room whodunit plot (although \"Hateful\" has its unique points of interest).\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 165 minutes and was shot in Jackson Hole, Wyoming; Evergreen Plantation & New Orleans, Louisiana; and several locations in California (Lone Pine, Alabama Hills, Semi Valley, Melody Ranch, Santa Clarita, Independence & Los Angeles). The cast includes numerous peripheral notables, e.g. Ato Essandohs, Don Stroud, James Remar, Bruce Dern, Ato Essandoh, Franco Nero, Don Johnson, Amber Tamblyn and several others.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A","id":"5b72389dc3a3681899183b04","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b72389dc3a3681899183b04","movie_id":68718}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I have always liked Mel Gibson and I really do not care how drunk or politically incorrect he might be. I still like to see him in movies and this is a surprisingly good movie. The movie had a proper theatrical premier in most countries except USA where it went straight to VOD which I find a bit surprising. It is a lot better movie than much of the stuff that are shown in theaters. I suspect the politically correct hypocrites had something to do with that.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I found this movie surprisingly good. Mel Gibson fit the role very well and made a quite good performance. The settings with the bizarre prison which looked like a cross between Alcatraz and Freetown Christiania in Copenhagen was quite cool. It was the kind of setting that I would not have been surprised to find in a Tarantino-movie. I also liked the cynical and somewhat ironical voice-over by Gibson.\r\n\r\nThe story was okay. Perhaps not the most believable one but good enough for this kind of action movie. Speaking of action, there were indeed some decent action in the movie but it is not like the movie is overloaded with it. It is nicely spread out and once the action starts it is pretty good. It is also true that some scenes are a wee bit gruesome but I am not sure that I agree with the R-rating. Most of the time that rating felt a bit over the top. Still, I rather have a R-rated movie with cuts than a PG-13 with lots of silly cuts in it.\r\n\r\nThere were some silly bits of course, like how easy Mel could evade the prison and make a \u201cbusiness-trip\u201d to the states when he finally felt like it and the entire business of performing transplantation surgery in a filthy prison. Mel might have found that \u201cput it back\u201d statement funny when he wrote it but it came out rather silly to me.\r\n\r\nBottom line is that this was a quite enjoyable movie. A perfect after-work movie when you feel like parking your brain somewhere in the garage with your car and just sit down and watch something requiring a minimum of concentration.","id":"53bd2b6c0e0a261576001735","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bd2b6c0e0a261576001735","movie_id":80389}
{"author":"truthandbeauty","content":"Plot: it's not so much about plot, as it is about mood... and the passing of a day in the life of 3 lost souls...\r\n\r\nReview:\r\nI found it quite a powerful statement- kind of a slow moving portrait of a dark mood, a lingering dissection of feelings of weakness and powerlessness-- it was hypnotic and flawed and a completely unique piece of cinema...kind of a character study of a hangover in a way, both the real kind and the spiritual kind...\r\n\r\n\u2028\u2028It is also exciting and refreshing to me to see such a huge movie star like Keanu Reeves play such a vulnerable role in such a small risky piece of art-- \r\n\r\nas I looked at some the other reviews for generation Um... it occurred to me that many of the \"critics\" seemed to be criticizing the movie for not being what they wanted it to be instead of looking at it for what it is, a somewhat personal interpretation of a particularly difficult \"mood\" that maybe doesn't make you feel good, but definitely makes you feel strongly--- the entire film seems to me to be, as the title suggests, a cinematic representation of \"an audible pause\" and also an experiment in stripping context out of the storytelling process and letting the slow reveal of character truly rule the experience of watching a film--filmmaker Mark L Mann certainly captured something very unique in this film - and it seems to me that this sort of project should be encouraged rather than condemned by these so-called \"critics\" who put themselves out as \"authorities\" on the world of cinema. \u2028\u2028\r\n\r\nI think it's only fair to suggest checking out the many thoughtful REVIEWS by ACTUAL VIEWERS on IMDB and iTunes-\u2028so that it can be known that these Critics' unpleasant attitude toward this film might not include everyone...\u2028\u2028and people can be encouraged to not miss out on experiencing this film for themselves.\u2028\r\n\r\nIMDB USER REVIEWS\r\n\r\nDon't force it, 11 May 2013\u2028\u2028from United Kingdom \r\n9\/10 Stars \r\nI'm not sure what the expectations were with this film, but I've been surprised by some of the reviews. Within the first few minutes of the movie starting, I felt a familiarity with all the characters. I can't say I particularly liked them, but I recognised the three disaffected lonely people finding some kind of solace in each other's marginal and dysfunctional lives. As someone else mentions, the film reads like a documentary: the dialogue feels very improvised and the film is not so much a plot-driven story, but rather a slowly unfolding short-lens view of three emotionally immobile people finding some kind of connection together over the course of a single night. Laconic, thoughtful and locked in a state of stasis, Keanu eats up the character of John, an inarticulate downtown 40-something whose job is chauffeuring two drugged-up young escorts, Violet (Bojana Novakovic) and Mia (Adelaide Clemens) around town. The pace remains even throughout, seducing you into feeling you're watching a one shot movie, as the night brings ever-increasing and intimate interaction with each character's search for an emotional cleanse. Noisy though the growing pains are, this they receive, however transient.\r\n\r\nA Day in the Life, 10 May 2013\u2028 from United States \r\n9\/10 Stars\r\n\r\nInitially after watching I was confused as I could not understand what was happening to the characters in the movie. Once I finished the movie, it began to make sense. I was surprised. This is not a movie that one understands initially after viewing. It is like peeling an onion. After watching the movie twice, I have learned a bit more about the what the symbolism means. Each member of this pseudo family reveals a little bit more about themselves, which takes time to develop. The director and the actors are patient as the undertones of the movie are revealed one by one. It is through this patience that one learns of the real issues that face each member of this cast.\r\n\r\nInspired by Uninspired Characters, 9 May 2013\u2028 \r\n7\/10 Stars \r\n*** This review may contain spoilers *** \r\nThe film captured my attention, not with action or adventure as one might expect of a film starring Keanu Reeves (although there was an adventurous moment or two that kept me on edge for resolution), but with its ability to draw out emotion and deeper \"meaning of life\" type thoughts from the viewer through character development. It was also a clever concept; it was a documentary-style film -- taking the viewer through a day in the life of someone who, in turn, is capturing a day in the life two others -- camera on camera action. It is not a familiar or usual \"day in a life\" for the majority of population, but many of the thoughts and feelings expressed by the characters are familiar or at least have been at some point or another in our lives. \u2028\u2028The film's viewers discover the lead characters' inner thoughts through conversational dialog and even question-answer dialog as the documenter (20-30-something male) is filming the two documentees (20-30-something females), delving deeper and deeper into the girls minds, and thus, the story became more and more interesting. Furthermore, the documenter was seemingly finding inspiration in his efforts to learn more about the girls' thoughts and possibly even learning more about himself. What was more captivating was during the many moments of silence, no dialog, the characters' expressions and actions revealed even more about their thoughts and feelings. I started to develop a connection with the characters, even though my life is not at all like any of theirs. This film is complexity masked in simplicity \u2013 it is easy to follow but has complex themes and feelings \u2013 thus making it hard to stop watching. \u2028\u2028Throughout the movie, I developed various feelings for the lead characters, leading lives that I could not and wish not imagine for myself, but knowing that there are people out there in such environments and predicaments as the settings in this film. I found myself wanting to know more and more about the characters. My feelings for them were first of disgust due to lack of empathy for their plight. Then, as the film went on, learning more about the lead characters' inner thoughts and emotions as well as lack of emotion, my feelings morphed into that of hopelessness and sorrow for them, developing a genuine caring for them. Out of my feelings of hopelessness and sorrow came hope -- hope that the characters will find their way out of their loneliness and discontentment, thinking that the three of them were drawn together by their shared sorrowful feelings and longing for something different, something more, and it's the three of them that will pull each other out of their plight by inspecting each other more closely \"under a camera\" -- discovering each other and in effect, discovering themselves.\u2028\u2028The three lead characters are related on more and several levels than just friends (with possible benefits). In watching the film, one learns that there are layers of meaning and purpose in friendship and ideas on how to discover them, which I believe we all can find inspiration in and benefit from in our lives. \u2028\u2028I did indeed find this film somewhat inspirational even though it was not a hopeful resolve. And say kudos to the actors and director for portraying uncomfortable-to-watch characters in an uncomfortable setting, and furthermore, for transforming the \"uncomfortable\" into feelings for them and maybe even thoughts we don't usually think in our own lives that may make us think more.\r\n\r\nSome of those who wander ARE lost., 27 August 2012\u2028\u2028 from The Hague, Netherlands \r\n7\/10 Stars \r\nLow user ratings are to be expected when the names of Keanu and Bojana fuel edge-of-your-seat anticipation. This however documents (partly videotaped by Keanu's character) a 24 hour stretch in the lives of three people who are beyond clueless, they don't even care if there is such a thing as clue, purpose or direction in life. They don't even bother to define the relationships amongst the 3 of them. They don't even care to find words to describe their feelings and their lack of any accomplishment gives new meaning to the word void. I do believe this to be a socially relevant document of the lives of some of the 20- or 30-something generation who are one level below the entitled ones. It's there, it's real, no comedy nor drama, but it did powerfully communicate awareness to me as a viewer.\r\n\r\nbreathtakingly authentic, 8 January 2013\u2028\u2028from Germany, Berlin \r\n10\/10 Stars \r\n*** This review may contain spoilers *** \r\nI try not to make this a spoiler, but I have to say that they might as well have called it a documentary...though the actors are mere placeholders for a phenomenon i guess. I have travelled a great deal around this world and had nights like the one shown in this movie quite many everywhere i went, though most of the people involved were not sexworkers. Uncountable conversations with glasses of whine, mostly without cameras though ;-),with people like me, randomly ending up in the same space for a limited period of time, living in the \"grey zone\"- a.k.a life. This film is a mere description of how blurry time, space and relation to what is perceived as reality and the suffering within it becomes sometimes, when you are stuck between awareness and maturity. My compliments to the director, the girls and Mr. Reeves. Somebody seems to have understood something. And its funny too!!! \r\n\u2028 \r\nEdgy NYC indie flick, 27 December 2012\u2028\u2028 from United States \r\n10\/10 Stars \r\n*** This review may contain spoilers *** \r\nI can believe that this movie wont be released at your local multiplex but it is an interesting account of 24 hours in the life of sex workers in NYC. Not an X rated movie by any stretch but more of a personal exploration of people that wind up in this situation and how their day goes. There are some edgy scenes of a sexual nature and when that includes one with Keanu Reeves that is a real attention getter. He is so achingly damaged and sweet in this role. Through his curiosity, and his sincerity, and his stolen movie camera, he is able to reveal some of himself and be a real friend for the 2 young women sex workers, without judging them. Not a feel good film. More about gritty pathos on the seamy side of NYC. I dug it.\r\n\r\nThe movie is not just for fun, 2 May 2013\u2028\u2028from Saint Petersburg, Russia \r\n9\/10 Stars \r\nThis movie shows the life that you don't want to know about. There is no desire to know it or to remember anything that happens in this life. Even though sometimes many of us feel the same way as the main characters do, regardless of what we are. We are ready to judge people, not many of us try to understand the deep reasons of their behavior. If we draw an analogy with The Matrix, John's destiny is a story of a lonely person who didn't know he was the one. Nobody believes in him, and he stops to believe in himself. But he starts revealing after realizing how much the two girls need him, even though these two are condemned by the society. Watching the movie was hard for me. I had a feeling that I'm watching a documentary. It confirms actors and director's high level of professionalism.\r\n\r\n\"Generation Um\u2026\" is a very subtle and clever movie with fine actor's work., 2 May 2013\u2028\u2028 from Russia \r\n10\/10 Stars \r\n*** This review may contain spoilers *** \r\n\"Generation Um\u2026\" is a very subtle and clever movie with fine actor's work. All characters of this story are very important even if they are absent in the shot (John's mother for example). Each role has certain semantic meaning. So what this movie is about? According to official short reviews it is about \"three adults during a single day in New York City, one filled with sex, drugs, and indecision\". But this is only the tip of the iceberg. The thoughtful viewer who isn't interested in action only, but in psychological and philosophical dramas also, will dig deeper. And after that it becomes obvious that the movie is kind of a very frank and shrill confession. Why the characters of the movie come to such point in their lives? The reasons are deep mental wounds, childhood complexes and bad experiences. And life apathy and inner uncertainty as a result of it . It leads to the point when the adult person drives himself or herself into a corner and immures all exits, destroying thereby all their life. The movie is about the importance of understanding yourself, throwing the past mistakes' weight off the shoulders, and forgiving people that caused those painful scars on your heart. The most important is to forgive and just love yourself at least a little, and try to spread the wings as a new nation and start over with a clean slate. It is still very important to understand that it's possible to start a new life at any age. That's why the main characters are in different age categories (around 20, 30 and 40 years old). As it is written in medical literature, \"the forming of the positive motivation can increase probability of the patient's recovery\". We can see their recovery even though it's painful and uncertain. Keanu Reeves notes in the interviews that the ending of the movie gives hope for the future.\r\n\r\nWhat is the movie about?, 2 May 2013\u2028\u2028from Ukraine \r\n8\/10 Stars \r\nWhat is the movie about? It's about loneliness in a crowd, probably. About pain. About hope. About proximity. The movie is about just one day, and about the whole life. It's as little as very much at the same time. The movie starts and ends same \u2014 the three friends come home from work. But the things that occurred during the day changing their attitude to themselves and to their own lives. They learn to trust. John has the rare talent to ask short questions and to listen carefully. It turns out to be very important, when you just listen and don't teach, don't advise, don't bring something up. John starts video taping as entertainment and ends up as a confession. And confession always clears the soul. Mark Mann shot a very intimate movie, and brought the viewer completely into the world where Mia, Violet and John live. This world isn't joyful and it isn't sad. It's real. The movie is for those who appreciate sincerity on the screen and who aren't afraid to pass others pain through themselves. It's for those who try to understand people living behind the standard morals. The favorite dialog in the movie is: - Just don't hate me because I'm beautiful. - I don't hate you. I'm just confused. Favorite shot: is the park water fountain.\r\n\r\nA Good Art House Film, 28 April 2013\u2028\u2028from United States \r\n8\/10 Stars \r\n*** This review may contain spoilers *** \r\nI decided to write a small review on this movie that I was able to watch recently. \"Generation Um\" is an art house film. I think that is one of the reasons why people gave it such a low rating. I mean it's interesting how someone would expect the movie to be one thing and then get something different from what they expected. This is art house, people, that is why certain camera moves were used, or certain views, or certain cuts. Art house films usually look like some guy next door filmed it and then montaged it in his garage. But it does not mean the story doesn't have a logic or purpose. I personally liked to look at these three people doing their things and see by their action what they are thinking. I mean, I just find it interesting to look at things as they are without having a simple direction that tells me \"here's what's going on and here's what she is feeling\", you know. Like when Mia goes for a walk and buys the flowers. Isn't it an example of what she feels after going out last night and dealing with all those men who just wanted to use her? She didn't need the flowers, she just wanted to make herself feel better because the guy at the store was so nice to her. But to see that you have to look carefully while watching. Or the scene with Violet and John when they hug each other. That was brilliant. How somebody would give it a 3 or 1? Did you see her face when they were standing between walls looking at each other? It's like she is literally begging for help. Her eyes and just the whole expression tells you \"Please do something!\". Oh, that was brilliant. And John, you can see he is ready to do anything for her right now but he is just standing there and staring at his shoes. I mean, these people just don't used to it. They used to yell at each other, not hug each other. So they finally hug. And you don't need any background music or special camera moves to show you how emotional this moment is. And there is a lot of moments like this. Seeing how they live these 24 hours can give you an information about how they probably lived before, why they got themselves into this and what hopes they have for the future.\r\n\r\nDo we feel differently?, 3 May 2013\u2028\u2028 from Russia \r\n9\/10 Stars \r\n*** This review may contain spoilers *** \r\nAfter watching the film I was thinking for a long time about this story, or should I say preview of the story, its background, it did not leave me indifferent. The characters fell deep into my heart and took their places there. I think I'm going to carry them with me everywhere as my life goes. Were we really so far? Here is Mia, who is building an emotional wall around the experiences of her childhood, and here is Violet, who is feeling the need for the warmth and intimacy of another person, all at the time when she dared to be herself, and have stepped through the fear that John will not understand and alienate. And here is John, who was looking at the world, the lives of other people from the outside. This hug wasn't easy for him, maybe for the first time in his life someone needed him so desperately. Did I ever have to worry about such things myself? No, my life is far from life of these people. But does it make us feel different from one another? While all three of them grow roots, I close my eyes and I see Mia buying daisies. Funny, I love daisies. It seems like this flower is all open for everyone to see, but it definitely is something mysterious about it. Surprisingly, John sees the water just the way I see it. To me it's something always changing but staying same at the same time. I guess that's it for right now. Let's see what else the movie characters show me...\r\n\r\nIt's complicated, 10 April 2013\u2028\u2028from Vienna, Austria \r\n7\/10 Stars \r\nI really didn't want to watch this movie. The low rating is an absolute no go. But thanks to some user comments i saw a potential.\u2028\u2028I'm happy that i took the chance. It's a movie about life in a certain age - my age. Maybe thats the the reason i liked the movie. It was true. I had a good feeling watching it. I didn't always like the way the camera was moving, but in the end it gave the movie an innocent touch.\u2028\u2028This movie takes you into the life of some people you get to know just a little bit. it's like going to a party and listening to other peoples conversations without yourself interrupting. It's a pure view of the world in the eyes of John, Mia and Violet. It's so pure you see their skin 'unphotoshopped' and thats refreshing.\u2028\u2028I often feel being betrayed or lied about how things look like, how people look like or how locations, bars, streets look like. All the lights, all the make up, all the color boosts... sometimes its just too much.\u2028\u2028To view a movie about kind of a real life story - it's a nice idea to do that with real faces, real streets, real situations. And with that comes no explosion, no special close up event, no beautiful candle light sex scene... etc..\u2028\u2028That said, this movie is definitively underrated. If you like Lost in Translation or Vicky Christina Barcelona - you may like this movie too. Just don't expect beautiful colors, perfect romance or a Hollywood type movie in general.\r\n\r\nGood movie. Not one of Keanu's cineplex-type efforts., 8 February 2013\u2028\u2028 from Australia \r\n8\/10 Stars \r\n*** This review may contain spoilers *** \r\nI had mixed expectations going in to this film. On the one hand, there was the generally poor showing on IMDb (low rating, several dismissals as boring\/uneventful), the relatively bland poster (which conveys little except that the film features three beautiful people) and a pretty uninspired title. But on the other hand, I enjoyed 'Henry's Crime' and '...Pippa Lee' a lot, and so the idea of another non-action-based Keanu film seemed like a reasonable prospect. In the end, I was very glad a took a punt. I liked this film a lot.\u2028\u2028'Generation Um...' relies very much on character, dialogue and story, rather than action or suspense. Anyone going in looking for a Keanu cineplex-type effort will certainly be surprised - and probably disappointed. The pace is very deliberate - but it's all relevant, and it all contributes to the film's effectiveness. If a film is to convey the sense of a lifestyle convincingly, it has to follow its subjects through the dull, solitary periods as well as the lively ones. This film does just that and as a result provided a comprehensive picture of the three main characters. You are left with a strong sense of how each of the three got to where they are, how they feel about where they are and how their lives might play out from this point.\u2028\u2028The relatively simple story unfolds in just the right way. The significance of the opening scene, and the way each of the three characters spends the following day is only revealed toward the end. The way these things were revealed was great - suddenly, each character's behaviour throughout the rest of the film (even the vacuousness of the first few scenes, which was pretty hard to take the first time through) made good sense. Then the film ends more or less where it started - and you're left with the feeling that these people are doomed to carry on behaving the same way day after day until age, physical decay or poverty pushes them in an even less appealing direction.\u2028\u2028All in all, a very satisfying film. I recommend it highly.\r\n\r\nGeneration Um, 3 May 2013\u2028from Kazakhstan \r\n9\/10 Stars \r\nWe often want to see emotional positivity, superficial pleasure, sometimes deceptive impressing movies only. But life is more cruel, more actual, and more real at the same time. In the movie \"Generation Um\" I see unattractive kind of life, but suddenly I understand that even in the heavy moments of this people should keep hope and remain human. This movie is a narration about hope which helps us to live and go further. The film shocked me, because obviously lonely heroes and it is so close to all of us, but the hope and love of life in the last scene of the film talks about the need to believe in a better and humane in all situations.\r\n\r\nThis film had to be made., 3 May 2013\u2028\u2028from Russia \r\n10\/10 Stars \r\n*** This review may contain spoilers *** \r\nI am afraid I'll start saying in a roundabout way to reveal my thoughts about the film... A person is moving through the life blindly by touch. We always try to create comfort around ourselves, more often we do it unconsciously and instinctively. If we like something we want it to stay with us, if something irritates and makes us angry \u2013 we try to distance from it or leave it. Sometimes we feel by touch, sometimes - by heart. The older we are, the more comfortable place we get. Even a looser has an old beloved sofa which he enjoys sleeping on after a hard day; he's got a couple of good friends with whom he would have a drink or two. So, we have intimate friends and family, our fixed ways and favorite food, our homes developed to our tastes; someone is lucky to have a favorite job. We know well what type of people we'd better avoid or never go to bed with. Thus, we create our own world in which we feel ourselves relatively comfortable, someone feels more comfortable and someone less. But it is a trap to the soul. We are too busy with our everyday life, just with the things around us. We can't reach to a point where we could see eternal depth of the universe, we can't even feel the height of the place where we are standing. The holy mysteries of life pass by. But when a person starts asking questions, searches someone's heart, tries to understand people from inside, they can save themselves from the consuming emptiness and avoid the feeling of useless life and going nowhere. The search is the only way to be saved. This is my perception of the world which I saw in the film all in details. That is why the film is a true shock to me. \"Generation Um\" is like a cake layered with signs and symbols, questions and answers. The film has many points, the most ironical one I would put like this: no matter how long you will search in your heart (conversations between friends throughout the film), but you might be f***ed up by your life one day anyway (the girls at the hotel). Even though the things are this way, there is always a place for happy moments (the scene in the credits). But this harsh generalization isn't correct for that film, because every episode of it, even a small one, has a high concentration of meaningfulness and it generates multitude microcosms. This film had to be made. It is a guide for those who lost the point and depth of their lives, stepped on the way of search. \"Generation Um\" says to them that they are not alone.\r\n\r\nloved it, loved it, loved it., 22 April 2013\u2028 from Romania \r\n9\/10 Stars \r\nan almost unexpected surprise in today's world focused only on feel-good movies. a multi-layered little gem. a story about loneliness, disappointment, pain, despair, and ways to cope with all that. a story about human connection and lack thereof. a story about games of power, seduction and domination. a meditation on how people behave in front and behind a camera. And the camera becomes a fourth character; a silent witness that's central to the plot; a fourth player that changes the rules of the game. it's a story about finding hope - or not. no,it's not everyone's cup of tea. yes, it will make most viewers uncomfortable. but those who have patience with this movie will be rewarded with a story that sticks with them for days. it's haunting. as long as such movies can still be made, there's still hope. it means the moviemakingmagic is still alive. \r\n\u2028 \r\nUm...Well I liked it, 29 April 2013\u2028from United States \r\n7\/10 Stars \r\n*** This review may contain spoilers *** \r\ndespite the negative reviews this movie has been getting on here. I actually like this movie and just wasn't all that bored with it. In fact I found this movie to be random but still got my attention and interest. It's basically about 3 people's typical mundane life in New York City. And although for the most part the movie appear to be mundane, the realism and certain aspects of this movie makes things interesting. Watching this movie was sort of like watching the days and the life of Keanu Reeves if he didn't become a actor. In fact this is one of those movies for a actor or actress where no acting is required. It just seemed like for the most part Keanu Reeves was just being himself. Except a much more dyslexic version of himself and probably much more quieter. In fact he sort of reminded me of \"Napoleon Dynamite\" in this film. And he has 2 annoying slutty girls that has daddy issues tagging along with him and they basically share everything with each other. In fact Keanu's character is sort of a pimp in this movie, just not one of those really bossy ones. And the girls are the one's that boss him around. Anyways Keanu's character John in this just does some random stuff in this movie like eating a cupcake and stealing a camera and such. Than goes around filming random stuff but these traits brings out his character. Not a lot and he has a mysterious vibe thing going on because he doesn't really talk much or about himself. But than again that is basically Keanu Reeves himself. Anyways the most interesting part about this movie is when Keanu starts interviewing the two girls he is with. And when it comes to these two slutty junkie and smug girls. One of them is this extrovert and the other sort of introvert. And when it came to the actresses one of them reminded me of Carla Gugino and the other Michelle Williams. And share some real, raw and interesting inner thoughts. One of it is how one of the girls share her thoughts about how \"men are after power, while girls are after love\". As opinionated as the sharing of thoughts between the characters maybe it was still interesting and intriguing. This is one of those raw movies where realistic acting is involved and seems like the actors and actresses are basically doing ad-lib. And just seem like real everyday people in NYC and how they act amongst each other. I can see why some audiences would not like this film but I liked it for what it is. It's about the mundane and sort of average life of a New York City guy and girls connecting with one another while showing a bit of each others inner thoughts and scars. It's not one of the best movies I seen of this type but it's a well made one.\u2028\r\n\r\niTunes User Reviews\r\n\r\nUm\u2026haunting \r\n5\/5 stars \r\nby 11milez \u2013 April 28, 2013 \r\nFew films lately have hung on to me so tightly the next day as this one did. It slowly oozes in, and left me with a haunting feeling, a feeling of a past life I no longer wanted to live. Made me want to move forward and really do something and not sit and stew about all that is wrong, unfair. This a truly unique movie. One not all will appreciate. It taps into the blandness we all feel when feeling hopeless, in life, in our jobs, not striving for something more. We can sit around, do nothing and talk about it or we can take action. Mann captures wonderfully realistic mundane moments that we've all experienced in one way or another before, but no one has been brave enough to make a movie about them\u2013\u2013until now. Those days we take for granted, and overwhelm the majority of our lives, until we can't take it anymore and make a positive change.\r\n\r\nWHOA \r\n5\/5 stars \r\nby ljasdf12213sadf \u2013 May 4, 2013 \r\nWhat is friends? That's really the central thesis of this tale about three lost souls swimming in a fishbowl year after year. Alas, this movie could also be about the inner workings of a call girl organization and their meandering, hopeless pawns in the game of sexual chess. Or it could be about petty theft. Either way, this movie is outstanding in its achievement in the field of excellence because the viewer chooses what they can get out of the movie rather than the director feeding you a linear, mindless story. If you have a limited imagination, you will have a narrow scope as to what you can decipher from this movie. That being said, a lego block is merely a piece of plastic to someone who cannot see what will become of it. So, what is friends? A good movie.","id":"51bef09c19c2955261105f33","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51bef09c19c2955261105f33","movie_id":124972}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"grave doubts about the operation themselves.\r\n\r\nThis is a good movie although the context of the movie is a rather sad one. It is definitely not my favorite genre but my wife wanted to watch it and it had received generally favorable ratings so I added it to my collection.\r\n\r\nThe historical accuracy of this movie has been questioned. I honestly do not remember any details of the events of this sad episode in Middle East history so I cannot really judge this. As far as I know the general plot is consistent with reality and in this movie it is good enough for me. I fear that, if they would have made it 100% historically accurate, the movie would have turned into a rather boring documentary instead of a fairly enjoyable drama movie.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly enough the movie was quite funny at times. The dialogue between the movie-people when they were setting up the fake movie was sometimes quite hilarious. Some parts of the movie was rather tragic of course, like the Iranian mob taking over the embassy and the crazed idiots at the bazar.\r\n\r\nOther parts where a bit silly. Why did the Iranian security have to break down their own doors at the airport instead of just calling the tower and stop the plane for instance? And the cars chasing the plane was just rubbish. The plane would have gone much faster than the cars could go long before they caught up with the plane. Also the fact that the cars basically had to panic-break in order not to hit the barrier at the end of the runway meant the plane almost ran into the barrier which, given that it made a normal take-off, is just nonsense.\r\n\r\nIn general it is a good movie although it is not really my type of movie and the movie\u2019s context, the take-over by the Iranian extremists, is a rather sad one.","id":"5b0ed6d59251412727000803","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b0ed6d59251412727000803","movie_id":68734}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Arthur Newman's obviously trying to be a new man!**\r\n\r\nI like this kind of films to watch occasionally. I am not talking about the story, but the type of comedy. Like two unusual characters go on a ride and each one set to rediscover themselves. This one was a bit more than that. It tells the story of a divorced man who is not happy with his life, so decides to fake his death and take up a new identity to live somewhere else. Then he meets a woman who is throwing up her life for nothing. Now these two join hands for an unexpected adventure to an unknown destination. Well, they head towards with an intention, but without the plan to accomplish in a way. Very fun, but not like loudly laughable or even with a little smile. You will get that while you watch it.\r\n\r\nBoth the British actors played the American role, but still with the British accent. They were good, I liked their combo, as well as the characters. The film was enjoyable, but something says it's not all well. It's not the production or the screenplay, or even the directional inexperience. It could be the thematic which was like from pre 60s or 70s. I bet you will remember the title 'Sullivan's Travels' and other similar. Basically, it is not comparable with others, but feels familiar with how everything was developed. So it is not for everyone, but some people might think it is very good. I stand in-between, but I don't know you are one of those, so why not try it and decide yourself.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"597e0cc99251415d7801afea","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/597e0cc99251415d7801afea","movie_id":127374}
{"author":"mitchell188","content":"by Stefan S\r\n\r\nThis month alone sees two first time feature filmmakers tackle genre films that haven't been done before in Singapore's short filmography, and the results are as expected, drastically different given the level of experience going into production, and how indie filmmakers pale in comparison to a proper studio backed and funded product, complete with support from the Singapore Film Commission. Gary Ow's clueless zombie-comedy film Hsien of the Dead became an insult to the genre, while Ng Say Yong's inspirational dog drama My Dog Dou Dou attempted to take on the formula that's been perfected by the industries in Japan and the USA, that it was a film just waiting to be made, once the right dog can be found. I guess this is it.\r\n\r\nHowever, My Dog Dou Dou suffered a little from what I call the unfortunate plot elements that have been synonymous with local films of late - gambling, gangs and plenty of family bickering. Outside of the horror and\/or comedy genre, it's quite tough for a film to peel away from the temptation to add these into the narrative, and this film is no exception, especially when it's thought to be safer to stick to norms and formula, than to try something bolder. \r\n\r\nThere's a need to make the dog special? Well, let's have it predict 4D numbers naturally. Need a family squabble? Make a family member a gambling addict, and for the mom to walk out because of condition. Need to induce some tear jerking moments? Well, let's put in a kid, and have him bond with the titular dog, with the inevitable to happen to wrench at the hearts. No less than three script writers got involved to craft the storyline, and one can probably ask for a little more variation and freshness put into the tale, rather than for one of the writers to sneak in a 2359 inside joke. And for a dog movie, the dog's really quite peripheral, which is a pity.\r\n\r\nThat said, My Dog Dou Dou can still lift its head high up amongst its peers, since it contained a well thought through story despite the genre cliches it can't rid itself of, or worst, relied on the antics of the dog to carry it through. The main characters are Ming (Jason Wong), a single parent forced to bring up his kid Xing (Ivan Lo, last seen in Jack Neo's We Not Naughty and continues his good performance here), because his wife left no thanks to his gambling habit. That vice is still not kicked, and father and son spend occasional days on the run from loan sharks. Serendipity strikes when the runaway Dou Dou (Flapper the dog) gets rescued by Xing, and despite his dad's disdain for canines, brings him home, and through a series of oh-so-cute-inducing scenes, finally gets to keep his current best friend.\r\n\r\nNot before long, it's soon discovered that Dou Dou can predict 4D lottery numbers, and Ming gets on the act to coax the dog for more, becoming the family's golden goose, much to the unhappiness of Xing to support his father's vice. Then there's Ming's long time acquaintance Ginny (Malaysian actress Cathryn Lee) the reporter who provides an unauthorized expose on the fantastical abilities of the dog, leading to the primary loan shark of the movie (played by television actor Zhu Houren) wanting the dog for his own money making needs. There's a little twist in the tale that you can see coming that provides that emotional sucker punch for the finale, but otherwise the narrative is peppered by perfunctory supporting characters with the likes of Henry Thia as Dou Dou's original owner, Liu Ling Ling as Ming's car workshop employer, and Yvonne Lim, who plays Xing's mom, with the story shifting toward family reconciliation, thanks in part to how everyone had been affected positively by the dog.\r\n\r\nAnd the story did show flashes of brilliance, especially when, again, for a local film, it becomes almost a necessity to have subtle subtexts criticizing the social landscape. There's foreign talent\/workers in the country engaged in vice activities (with some attempt at comedy here), under the payroll of rich locals no less whom the law cannot touch, a commentary on big brother's compulsory savings schemes and preachy talk about productivity and bonus, the shift to the service industry, and the vacuousness of reporters in state run print media where broadsheets are actually as good as their tabloid counterparts in thrashy news coverage. Or how about the mentioning of floating corpses that have been the talk of the town of late? These hot topic issues date the film to this era, and one surely didn't expect them to creep into a family film.\r\n\r\nIt's understood that for a family friendly film, the villains can't pose any clear and present danger that's really threatening, and censorship worries see how certain scenes have to be reined in. It could have offered a more sinister villain, since it there was potential in Zhu Horen's character to be a little bit more menacing, and even bordering on the psychotic. And Karma, while obvious as closure for the villain, could have been better developed and pronounced, rather than to have it end too abruptly, since by then, audiences would have been worked up.\r\n\r\nBut as mentioned, it's kid friendly, so as long as good things happen to good folks, we can't really show much of the just desserts that the villains are deserving of. My Dog Dou Dou has elements that makes it a safe family movie, even if it's cliched with its sub plots and television melodrama, but at least it didn't botch it up.\r\n\r\nSource page:\r\nhttp:\/\/anutshellreview.blogspot.com\/2012\/09\/my-dog-dou-dou-wo-de-gou-dou-dou.html","id":"5413aa92c3a3687dbe000770","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5413aa92c3a3687dbe000770","movie_id":292330}
{"author":"Diana Stevenson","content":"The fifth and final film of the Cinequest Film Festival was AGNUS DEI back at the Camera 12. Based on a true story, the film takes place during the Kosovo war. Peter (Astrit Alihajdaraj) is a teacher, loves his mom very much, despises his drunken lush of a father, and refuses to fight in the war. However, he's forced to join against his will, and soon becomes one of the finest and respected soldiers ever. But the slaughtering of the innocent civilians has worn him down, and he risks his life saving an Albanian girl named Maria (the beautiful Dafina Berisha). They travel back to Peter's mom's house, only to discover a terrible family secret that will destroy Peter's entire world.\r\nSo this was based on a true story?! Unbelievable as it may sound, but it is indeed all true. Director Agim Sopi wrote the screenplay after reading a article in the paper about a man who discovered a secret family lie that unfortunately killed him. Sopi's directing is brilliant, capturing the ugliness of war and the lost of one man's ability to cope with what he has done.Astrit Alihajdaraj was Peter, no question about it. When I was watching the film, all I saw was Peter, not an actor. Dafina Berisha (with her mouth dropping beauty) was amazing in the film, propelling Peter to finally do the right thing.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is an okay (barely) popcorn flick. The basic concept is a good one for this kind of movie. At least I like that type of plot. The initial part must have been done in hundreds of movies. Our hero goes away to war, Vietnam in this case, and when he comes home his girlfriend have a husband and kids.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the movie revolves around Frank being a bad ass that clobbers most of the undesirable elements that crosses his path. Naturally a new lady turns up in the neighbourhood to add some romance to the movie. Of course this new lady have an abusive punk for husband so\u2026clobbertime.\r\n\r\nThe main plot element is the fact that Frank\u2019s best friend is murdered and the police are slow to do something about it. So Frank goes about doing a bit of investigating himself. Of course most of the investigation ends up one way or another in some\u2026clobbertime.\r\n\r\nNot very surprising Frank does indeed find the bad guy at the end and in true American (Hollywood) manner a crocked mayor turn up under one of the rocks that gets overturned. Finding the bad guy do, surprise, surprise end up in some more\u2026clobbertime.\r\n\r\nThat is pretty much the movie. A rather long knucklefeast loosely tied together with a passable (barely) script. Frank\u2019s \u201cinvestigation\u201d is more poking around and either instigating or simply ending up in various brawls. If your popcorn munching should be loud enough to disturb the dialogue, well it is not a big deal really. You\u2019re not missing much.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the movie it becomes exceptionally silly and unintelligent. Bleeding, visibly pissed off black guy walks up to bus and demands to be let in and the bus driver just opens the door. Yeah right.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I have to say that I enjoyed this movie. The visual effects are great, the alien designs are interesting and there\u2019s lots of explosive hardware flying around. Although not exactly a very logical\/practical design I did like the cool rolling \u201cballs\u201d of destruction that the aliens where using. Seeing the \u201cMighty Mo\u201d in action was of course an additional plus. It\u2019s really a shame that these magnificent floating fortresses have become obsolete.\n\nHowever, the enjoyment brought by this movie was almost purely one of visual effects. Well, I generally like Liam Neeson as well but not much else in this movie was of any higher standards. The story is the usual Hollywood stuff. The holes in the logic are big enough to drive, well, a battleship through. For instance, the aliens can come from far away, navigate between the stars, but they cannot avoid accidentally colliding with a satellite in earth orbit? Come on.\n \nIt unfortunately becomes even worse when they decide to fire up the Missouri. I could live with the fact that there\u2019s no way that a handful of veterans could have gotten that ship into running state. I could even live with the fact that the film ignores that it would take days to fire the ship up from cold storage even under optimal circumstances and with a full crew. But what really got me pissed off is when they drop the anchor to make a \u201chand break turn\u201d and turn the ship around on a dime actually sliding the ship on the water. What the fuck !!!\n\nHow utterly ignorant, dumb, stupid can you become as a Hollywood producer\/scriptwriter\/director? I\u2019m actually being kind to these morons now because if the people that wrote that scene is not total idiots then they are assuming that the audience are such idiots which would be even worse.\n\nThat part alone dropped it two stars for me. I still gave it 6 out of 10 because I enjoyed the visual effects and the sea battles so much.","id":"5a397ec20e0a264cd02060ec","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a397ec20e0a264cd02060ec","movie_id":44833}

Action and suspense is never far away, and neither is blood!

It feels like an extended toy advertisement, the acting is sub-standard and the editing - appropriately enough for the film's setting - is akin to a bout of sea sickness.

{"author":"SheBlogger","content":"The film opens in a province setting, where our protagonist, Ruben (played by Dennis Trillo), and his family live.  He was a carpenter of the local government, but was laid off and replaced in his post because he didn\u2019t support the current mayor in the past election.  He has a wife and a kid. They are living with his father-in-law, who was a tenant farmer on a piece of land.  The land was promised to be given to them but the owner died and his daughter did not honor the agreement.  Add to their poverty-stricken situation the incessant pillaging of their \u201ckamalig\u201d (granary or barn) by rebels. Anyway, that\u2019s the scenario in Quezon province that Ruben left, when he went with his Uncle Manuel to work at the President\u2019s mansion in Quezon City.  Need I say that the president who owned the mansion was the late President Manuel Luis Quezon?\r\n\r\nHe arrived in Manila and saw a worse situation than the one he left back home when he visited his cousin at a squatter\u2019s area. When he finally came to the mansion, he was awed by the enormity of the house. A striking contrast to the shack of his cousin, where he had just been and slept taking turns because there was not enough space. In the President\u2019s mansion, Ruben tries to learn more about the president and the Philippine history.  In the course of his readings, he began to idolize the president and tried to copy him. President Manuel Quezon became his inspiration. He believed that they had a lot of things in common, both coming from a poor family, being sickly as a child, having to walk long distances just to go to school and not speaking or understanding English until they were already adults. Ruben believed that like President Quezon he could also succeed in life and rise up from poverty.\r\n\r\nOkay\u2026I think I should stop telling the story here, before I bore you.

{"author":"Kenneth Axel Carlsson","content":"Alright, plot-wise, I might just have to throw in the towel on this one. It is about... people, married, unmarried, love and desire. A lot of characters running in and out of eachothers lives. Since this is based on a famous novel (I think), there must be a lot of summaries out there that can help you along much better than I could.\r\n\r\nQuite frankly, I was... confused. The whole movie is sort of based at a theater (more or less), where the scenes change constantly. It can be quite spectacular, I must admit, but also... confusing. As a period piece, this movie has paid attention to the details, and everything looks soo good. I can definitely appreciate this, but it seems that all attention has been placed here, on the form.\r\n\r\nThe acting, and actors, fit well here... on the stage. They all act as if they were on a stage, which is fitting. In fact, to be honest, I would have much preferred to see this as a live performance on stage, than here. The story simply drowns in all these costumes and colours, fake trains and stages.\r\n\r\n_Last words... a good story is more important than anything else. A good story doesn't have to be complicated (just take a look at a movie such as Locke, which is centered around many of the same themes as this). A good story was not important to these people, they just wanted to play around with fancy costumes, beautiful sets and actors who exaggerate.

{"author":"LastCaress1972","content":"Awkward loner Andrew (Dane DeHaan, soon to appear as Harry Osborn in The Amazing Spider-Man 2) is invited by his more affable cousin Matt (Alex Russell, Bait, Carrie) to go to a party, to help cheer him up. Andrew has problems at home; his mother is dying of cancer, the cost of her medication has become prohibitive, and his dad is an abusive drunk. Andrew brings with him the bulky old video camera he's been using of late to document... I dunno, the misery of his life I suppose. Anyway, once at the party Matt, mildly embarrassed by his cousin following him around with a camera, peels off away from Andrew to hang with some of the cooler kids, including the impossibly popular but genuinely decent Steve (Michael B. Jordan, The Wire, Friday Night Lights). The camera causes further problems for Andrew and he's unceremoniously ejected from the party. He's found outside by the aforementioned Steve, and invited to come with him and Matt to check out a weird hole in the ground in the woods nearby (elements of the party had spilled outside into the darkness, as these things do from time to time). Andrew, Matt and Steve venture down this hole, which turns out to be more of a tunnel, leading to... what is that? A space rock of some sort? Something mineral, and glowing, and a bit scary. Upon exiting the hole, the trio find that they possess mild levels of telekinesis, the ability to move objects with their minds. They also find that with practice, they can strengthen that ability. They soon graduate from levitating Lego bricks to flying through the air. Andrew proves to be particularly adept with this new \"talent\", and that proves to be problematic, because where Matt and Steve are content to limit their telekinetic use to mild pranks and perhaps flying somewhere interesting on holiday, Andrew's home life, general isolation and subsequent mood swings as a result of each cause him to want to embrace his power - and for him, it's grown into a potentially deadly power, now - in altogether different ways indeed.\r\n\r\nWith Chronicle, writer Max Landis (son of John \"An American Werewolf in London\" Landis) and director Josh Trank have taken some fairly tired areas (cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, superhero origin tales) and made something decent and fresh with them, for comparatively little money (budget was $12m apparently, looks like five times that). It's not a perfect film - the first-person narrative's need to justify its camera angles leads to one or two bum notes despite the fairly ingenious device of having Andrew telekinetically \"float\" the camera around behind him; some of Andrew's worst rages during the second act - including one with devastating consequences - seem badly disproportionate to the infraction, disconnecting us from the character (though perhaps that's the idea); and the abusive father (Michael Kelly, Dawn of the Dead, Did You Hear About the Morgans?) seems unrealistically so. But these are things I thought about after having seen the movie. The movie's tone and pace, and the performances of the three newly-empowered young men particularly, carry the movie very well right to the brisk 78th minute end (minus the credits).\r\n\r\nRecommended.","id":"5207b007760ee36308235111","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5207b007760ee36308235111","movie_id":76726}

Ady An (loved her ever since Autumn's Concerto) in fairly-romantic movie with Jackie Chan's son. Man, what a disappointment. The story was so unoriginal. Just like romance genre, action has it's own set of cliche settings and this movie covered most of them. This movie tried to be funny, but I barely laughed. The humor was almost forceful.\r\n\r\nComing to acting. Ady An did a great job. She (along with a few other actors) did a decent job. Unfortunately the movie wasn't centered around her.

{"author":"talisencrw","content":"I really enjoyed this Cronenberg film. Though my favourite films of his\r\nare the incredible ones he did in my teens, during the 80's\r\n('Videodrome', 'The Dead Zone' and 'The Fly' are nothing short of\r\noutstanding, and works that no one else could have come up with), he's\r\nreally been thinking outside of the box for the past decade (even for a\r\nconsistently interesting creature such as he), and it's only been\r\nrecently, with both Sarah Polley and Denis Villeneuve emerging as vital\r\ndirectors, that his ranking as the greatest Canadian director ever has\r\neven had suitable competition for comparison.\r\n\r\nI remembered when this came out, and I believe a critic from 'The Globe\r\nand Mail' interviewed Cronenberg at its opening at Cannes, and he was\r\nalmost apologetic about using Pattinson. It sounded like he didn't want\r\nto have to direct him. He made the excuse that he couldn't get funding\r\nfor his projects from North America anymore, which is a dirty rotten\r\nshame, and had to go to Europe and Asia any time he wanted to make a\r\nfilm in order to have it bankrolled, and the Japanese insisted on star\r\npower to put moviegoers in the seats, and said there'd only be\r\nfinancial backing if Cronenberg directed Pattinson. This was my first\r\nexperience watching the actor's work, and he did a fine job, no\r\nproblem. The supporting cast was strong, with many of my favourite\r\ncharacter actors of late, such as Paul Giamatti and Jay Baruchel. The\r\nscript, co-written by Cronenberg, was a strong statement about just how\r\nout of touch the very rich are with the other 99% of us. I docked my\r\nmark by 1\/10 because I was pissed off that Cronenberg degraded one of\r\nthe finest actresses of our lifetime, Juliette Binoche here. I can't\r\neven talk about it. It was as difficult for me to tolerate as Spike Lee\r\nhaving Christopher Plummer call Jodie Foster something awful in the\r\notherwise excellent 'Inside Man'. Lee's off my Christmas card list for\r\nsure this year, but Cronenberg being a fellow Canadian (I bet you\r\nthought I was going to say white, hahaha), I'll be less angry. But he\r\nbetter look over his shoulder if he tries something like THAT again. I\r\nwas THAT close to crossing HIM off my Christmas card list too...\r\n\r\nI also remember from the time the film came out, an article and rating\r\non the film (I think it was 'The Globe and Mail' as well, and by the\r\nsame critic who had earlier interviewed him), saying that when he\r\nwatched it, he watched a few teenage girls leaving the theatre (most\r\nprobably because Pattinson was in it), saying it was the worst movie\r\nthey had ever seen. That's the only evidence you need that this is a\r\nfine movie, well worth your time.","id":"572a724c9251417e58000048","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/572a724c9251417e58000048","movie_id":49014}
{"author":"LastCaress1972","content":"Andy and Terry Macguire (Harry Treadaway, Fish Tank & Rasmus Hardiker, Saxondale) are two cockney orphan tearaways. They're a little bit wooah, a little bit wheeey. But like all cockney orphan tearaways who are a little bit wooah, a little bit wheeey, they've got an 'eart o' gold, and they want to save their grandad's (Alan \"Brick-Top\" Ford, stealing the film) retirement home from imminent closure. How? By nicking a van that barely works, assembling a team made up of themselves, their sexy cousin (Michelle Ryan, EastEnders) and a pair of associates: the dimwitted Tuppence (Jack Doolan, The Green Green Grass) and the psychotic Mental Mickey (Ashley \"Bashy\" Thomas, apparently something of a name in the UK \"Grime\" scene which spawned Tinie Tempah, Tinchy Stryder and the like), and robbing a bank dressed as the construction workers presently digging up a large swathe of neighbouring Docklands area. It's here with a couple of the Docklands workers that the film begins, as they inadvertantly discover a sealed tomb in amongst the East-end mud. Sensing literal buried treasure, they venture in and are immediately set upon by a centuries-old dessicated member of the undead. So it begins, and so it escalates (a little too quickly, if I'm honest; one minute there are no zombies. A scene or two later, East London is a cordoned-off zombie zone, despite the film's constant allusions to how slow the zombies are), until before long the retirement home - choc-full of funny characters and a stand-out scene featuring Richard Briers in the slowest chase scene you'll ever see - is under heavy seige and our inept bank-robbers, who WERE under heavy seige at the bank from the cops, find their path cleared. Well, inasmuch as everyone in the street is now either dead or UNdead. With a couple of hostages from the botched bank job in tow, our crew of idiots have to make it to their warehouse rendevous and then decide whether to go and help grandad.\r\n\r\nThis is a very undemanding romp. \"If Ealing Comedies did Zombie Flicks...\", you could say. Most obvious comparisons I guess would be with 2004's Shaun of the Dead, and it's definitely in that ballpark (if not truthfully as smart). Shortcomings? Hm, well the glamour provided by Ms. Ryan seems totally superfluous, and the zombies whilst played seriously aren't quite played seriously enough, a result of which is that there is almost no sense of peril whatsoever; I know it's a comedy, but it's still a fairly gory zombie film too, and I think the filmmakers lose sight of that once or twice too often for my personal tastes. Still, I'm nitpicking. Ashley Thomas and Rasmus Hardiker are very good, and Alan Ford is superb, as entertaining in this as he was in Snatch, and we even find out whether or not West Ham and Millwall fans can learn to get along once they're undead. It's an easy and fun way to blow off 80 brisk minutes. What else d'you want, eh? You fahking cahnt!

{"author":"Reno","content":"> An impressive title for a thriller, and, well, that's it!\r\n\r\nWell, I neither read the book, nor saw the old film. But I find this theme is very interesting and at the end of the watch I kind of disappointed. Of course it is a low budget film, which involves little kids in a bad light, but that does not mean they should completely censor the violence. I'm disappointed with those serious avoidance which very essential for a film like this. I agree the children performing such act should not be shown, but the theme was promised something and delivered nothing. On that perspective anyone would be frustrated if they came here to see a good thriller.\r\n\r\nSo you can call it a horror-thriller for the families, that's how it looks. It is the story of an American couple with the seven months pregnant visits a tourist island destination in Mexico and soon finds the town is deserted. While looking for other souls, they are targeted by those who were the reason for the scenario of the island. Then begins the run and chasing game, and how it all ends revealed with a tiny twist.\r\n\r\nAs I feared the film failed to impress me, but there might be a few who would enjoy it better than me. So all I'm saying is just skip it if you're seeking 'Hatchet' kind of film, this is no way near to that. For a 30-35 years ago film, it might have worked better, but this is an outdated story to take place in the present world. The theme was fantastic, but I just wanted a different story and upgraded with the new stuffs. Though I must appreciate the director who has done multiple task for this film to happen. Finally, I want to clear that it is not a bad film of the year or decade or ever, but just too soft for its genre, that's all.\r\n\r\n5\/10","id":"57b4ff509251410a71002799","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57b4ff509251410a71002799","movie_id":127884}

{"author":"EdgarLindqvist","content":"This extraordinary film is based upon four years of painstaking research, and literally thousands of government documents. It is a film, which will certainly have long term implications for the state of Australia.\r\n\r\n'Expendable', produced under conditions of strict secrecy in the US, demonstrates a lengthy series of corrupt and criminal acts by Australian politicians, sanctioned collectively by an Australian government. These involve not only activities at ministerial level, but central roles for Australian Federal Police (AFP) officers, and a number of prominent corporations.\r\n\r\nDemonstrate is the operative word, because these are not allegations. Every abuse of power covered in the film is supported by documented proof, usually in the form of cables and correspondence between government ministers. These were pre-published on the Expendable website for public scrutiny.\r\n\r\nFurther, collectively, the movie and supporting dossiers are currently being collated for submission to the United Nations, and the International Criminal Court in The Hague.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE \r\nThe 'Expendable' film documents the case of Schapelle Corby, a young Australian woman, who was sentenced to 20 years in an Indonesian prison in 2005, when 4.2kg of marijuana was found in her bag as she collected it on arrival in Bali.\r\n\r\nThe movie tracks the Australian government's response, which included the willful withholding of vital primary evidence. This included the information that 5kg had been added to the weight of her bags after check-in, and that the offending bag was the only one not screened at Sydney airport, which she passed through on route.\r\n\r\nThe need to hide the systemic scale of post 9-11 corruption at Australian airports, including within the AFP, and the strategic policy of the appeasement of Indonesia, frame these, and a whole series of other acts of hostility against her.\r\n\r\nThe steps taken to cover this policy, post her trial, are equally appalling. The film shows, supported by indisputable government records, how public opinion was managed, how Schapelle Corby was deprived of funds for an extraordinary appeal, how the AFP's role was hidden, how known abuses of her human rights were ignored, and how a range of other hostile activities were initiated.\r\n\r\nFrom the blurb issued with the film itself: \"It presents, and demonstrates, the crushing, premeditated, and often brutal acts which a western government is prepared to inflict upon a helpless citizen in pursuit of political expediency.\"\r\n\r\nTHE Australian MEDIA The lack of plurality of ownership of the Australian media is a point made early in the film segment covering the state-owned Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The implications of this resonate to this day.\r\n\r\nIn Australia, dead men cannot sue, a device which, since the death of Schapelle Corby's father, has been ruthlessly exploited by unethical publishers, to spin and re-spin wholly disproved smears. The 'Expendable' producers present several concise 'insider' interviews, which dramatically expose the shady world which operates under the banner of journalism.\r\n\r\nPresenting such objectionable material is by no means limited to the ABC, with the press organs of Fairfax Media, for example, also being prominent.\r\n\r\nIt is within this climate that, since the Expendable Project began publishing government cables in September 2011, not a single column inch of coverage has been forthcoming in the Australian mainstream media.\r\n\r\nIncredibly, authentic correspondence proving gross misconduct and a series of corrupt acts by an Australian government, has been blanked completely,whilst fabricated paid-for smears against a dead man have continued unabated.\r\n\r\nThe release of the film itself met a similar fate, as will the involvement of the ICC, the UN, and other international agencies.\r\n\r\nSCHAPELLE CORBY \r\nSchapelle Corby herself, enduring her ninth year in an Indonesian prison cell, is now mentally ill. At the end of last year, she attempted suicide, via a huge overdose of the drugs she is prescribed for her psychosis.\r\n\r\nEven this, however, has proved to be insufficient for her government to negotiate her release, or for the Indonesians to demonstrate even a hint of mercy or compassion. It appears that, as the film states, \"she is dying a slow torturous death, in squalor, devoid of human rights, and abandoned by her government.\"\r\n\r\nEXPENDABLE THE MOVIE \r\nThis film is a wake up call for any traveller, any individual who places trust in political leaders or governments, and any humanitarian who believes that human decency will always prevail.\r\n\r\nIt creates a new perspective of the nation state of Australia, and presents a stark warning of the dangers of an overly cozy press caucus.\r\n\r\nIt is a film you will not forget.","id":"5079dc58760ee30585001a8d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5079dc58760ee30585001a8d","movie_id":137811}

{"author":"Kenneth Axel Carlsson","content":"A man shoots six people in a park, seemingly at random. The evidence is obvious and the police catch him short after. When asked about the murders, all he says (or rather writes) is \"Get Jack Reacher\". They do, and while Jack thinks he is only here to bury him (whatever that actually means), he soon finds out that the rabbit hole goes a bit further than he originally thought. Now Jack is looking to put together the pieces of a much larger puzzle.\r\n\r\nThis movie has the ring of a simple action movie with a small twist. The twist, actually, is quite obvious if you think about what is happening in the beginning of the movie.\r\n\r\nI remember seeing the trailer a long time ago, and it painted a picture of a comedy, but this movie is not that. It might have one or two funny fight scenes (and dialogue with Robert Duvall), but it is actually quite dark. This is kinda what saved the movie a bit for me, having judged it beforehand.\r\n\r\nTom Cruise is... Tom Cruise. At least in the way that we have seen him protrayed in the most recent years. The silent, cool guy who knows how to handle the problems, and who seems to always be one step ahead of everyone. I am not a big fan of this guy, and therefore, ultimately, not a big fan of Jack Reacher, however, it is slightly better than I thought it would be. And Werner Herzog has a nice little cameo, that movie aficionados will surely enjoy, being the great director that he is.\r\n\r\n_Last words... if you like Tom Cruise, go for it. If you like a nice organized action movie, much like the many Bourne movies... go for it. If you want more than superficial characters and a very straightforward plot, this is not the movie for you._","id":"549de27292514131320065ea","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/549de27292514131320065ea","movie_id":75780}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"You think I'm a hero? I am not a hero. And if you're smart, that scares you. Because I have nothing to lose.\r\n\r\nIt got off on the wrong foot, fans of the Lee Child novels were up in arms about the casting of Tom Cruise in the title role. He didn't fit the profile it was said, scorn was poured on the film, quite often by people who hadn't even seen it! So how refreshing to find that since I personally have no affinity to the Child books, and having never read anything by the author, I found a wonderfully old fashioned thriller.\r\n\r\nReacher the character is a damn fine creation, an ex military bad ass who doesn't get found unless he wants to get found. He gets involved with jobs that need solving, utilising his special skills to close out the mysteries. Here he pitches up along side defence attorney Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike) when an ex army sniper apparently at random kills five people and then mentions Reacher's name during interrogation. Cue twists and turns, rocks upturned for covert clues and a shady road to be trawled to get to the crux of the matter.\r\n\r\nCruise as Reacher is superb, where under the astute directing and writing of Christopher McQuarrie we are left in no doubt this is a cool no nonsense hard man, loved by the ladies and feared by not just the crims, but also the law authorities. None of which is overkilled, it's subtle in execution, McQuarrie doesn't need to turn his film into a blitzkrieg of CGI blunderbuss multiplex pandering. Action is smartly staged, the violence brutal without being course, while the story is delightful in how it gleefully wrong foots the viewers in plot dynamics and sly humour.\r\n\r\nThe deal is closed out via the sterling supporting turns to Cruise, with Pike, Robert Duvall, Werner Herzog and Jai Courtney adding considerably to this splendid Cruise and McQuarrie broth. In spite of divisive reviews and reports, Jack Reacher in filmic form has risen above that to become a success.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"The Replicants.\r\n\r\nOK! From the off I have to say I'm hardly the right person to take as gospel as regards a review for yet another home invasion movie. I have grown increasingly jaded with this sub-genre of horror, it seems that every year a handful of these type of movies get trundled out and suckers like me keep watching in the hope of finding a gem amongst the rough rocks.\r\n\r\nIn Their Skin isn't a gem, in fact it's not exactly a must see frightener, but it at least tries to add something to an already stagnated sub-genre of film. Namely an identity theft angle that veers away from the usual \"oh they are just psychos or hoodies\" line of thinking.\r\n\r\nThere is a raft of reviewers out there in internet land drawing comparisons to this being a Funny Games knock off. Now regardless of how I personally feel about Hanneke's work, is that what people are doing now? Fans of his film(s) expecting a Selma Blair, Joshua Close, Rachel Miner and James D'Arcy starring movie to take home invasion horror to a new level? When it's directed by an unknown? Really? \r\n\r\nFor an hour writer and directer Jeremy Power Regimbal favours the slow burn approach, and it works because the cast are very committed, and in the case of adult villains D'Arcy and Miner there's some bona fide creepiness about their respective mannerisms. It's only when things shift away from rumbling unease into psycho\/sexual territory that the fledgling director loses control and sinks to formula conventions to get his shock and awe.\r\n\r\nNot a must see, but in the context of boorish fodder like The Strangers, or higher budgeted fluff like The Purge, then this is well worth a look by those not expecting a whole new dimension of home invasion horror. It does have merits that doesn't waste your time, and beside which, James D'Arcy in this looks uncannily like Norman Bates, so that has to warrant a look! 6\/10","id":"53c57267c3a368249400193d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53c57267c3a368249400193d","movie_id":117978}
{"author":"n3pal","content":"Easily one of the worst documentaries I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nA good documentary plunges deeply into it's topic to arrive at a well supported conclusion. In Organic We Trust is a rambling disorganized fiasco. It makes no effort to prove any of the assertions it makes. Instead, it drifts aimlessly from opinion of opinion. The scientist should explain why pesticides are harmful to children, not the farmhand. If growing organically is good for the soil, describe how. If pesticides are bad for us, describe how they harm us. If corporations are consolidating the farm industry, describe some examples and then give us personal stories of how local farmers have been harmed.\r\n\r\nThe people on the street, the experts, and Kip Pastor all are unclear on the benefits of organic foods. Terms such as \"nutrient rich\" and \"good for the environment\" and \"safer\". In fact, no supporting evidence is made to confirm any of these assertions. Do organic foods have a higher concentration of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals? This would have been an excellent time for a slick animated graph. Do organic foods preserve the soil. Another opportunity for evidence. Perhaps Kip Pastor just expects us to accept the experts opinions because of their titles and offices? Or perhaps it was just Kip's intellectual laziness.\r\n\r\nWatching Kip's vacant eyes stare blankly over the fields of organic barley, made me ponder how much organic celery would sufficiently raise his IQ to make a decent documentary.","id":"5154606c760ee3188c017f32","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5154606c760ee3188c017f32","movie_id":99331}

The film would have been entertaining if there was something more like action. There is overdose of romantic and dramatic scenes which draws us towards tedium.\r\n\r\n The songs are good, but Due to their poor placement ,they do not look entertaining at all. Performances have been the worst on the part of each and every actor. The action scenes are just OK, but that is not enough. Something is missing.\r\n\r\nBesides, the film also falls flat in terms of a crisp editing. But I am sure that if the editors had used their scissors in the film, 90% of the film would have gone out.\r\n\r\n On the whole, Ek Tha tiger fails as a film.It is a big,big,big disappointment.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"We sat down and watched this movie on Blu-ray yesterday evening to nicely end our little excursion day. This is a good film but it could have been (much) better.\r\n\r\nThe film itself and its special effects are quite good. I would say that the special effects are very good. The airships are very cool looking. The design nicely captures the retro atmosphere of the book without looking silly. I think they made the green men too slim though. I have always pictured them as way more bulky and monstrous. I like Woola\u2019s appearance although him moving around at \u201csupersonic\u201d speeds is a bit over the top.\r\n\r\nHowever, why is it that every film-company\/producer\/director\/whatever now thinks that he can take an old classic, slam on the name in the title, and then do what the hell he likes with the material? This film has borrowed the basic idea and the names from Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter book but almost nothing else. At most 10% of the story of the books is in the movie. The rest is pure invention and it does not improve the story. As a matter of fact it turns what was a good story into a standard unintelligent Hollywood faire. Been there, seen that, done that.\r\n\r\nThe examples are plentiful, the white apes the size of dinosaurs, the city of Zodanga moves around (what the f\u2026), most of the plot as I said before is invented, the Therns have a completely different role etc. etc.\r\n\r\nI especially dislike how they have made John Carter, the honorable gentleman from Virginia, into a fairly plain American guy who at first refuses to do the \u201cright\u201d thing. And what about these bloody wife and child flashbacks? That\u2019s just disturbing.\r\n\r\nNone of this improves the movie. It got 6 stars, it could have gotten 9 or 10 if it had followed the books properly. It is Disney\u2019s own fault that this movie was a disappointment at the box office, they screwed with classical material\u2026again.","id":"5a650b850e0a2619fe02e6f0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a650b850e0a2619fe02e6f0","movie_id":49529}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is a difficult movie to rate, at least for me. It certainly had its funny, even hilarious, moments but at the same time it was incredibly stupid and silly at times.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the Nazi\u2019s having fled to the moon and built a secret moon-base there was a rather original I think. On could of course wonder why, if they had that technological advantage already 1945, everything is still looking like 1945 now, why they did not have computers, even why they lost the war in the first place? But let us not get picky now\u2026it is a comedy movie after all.\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few funny moments. Most of them involving their stupor when seeing a black American astronaut and their subsequent dealing with him. Unfortunately there are also quite a few incredibly stupid and silly moments. Their depiction of the American present, her PR-people and most things revolving around here was not really very funny, just stupid. I do not mind a movie that makes fun of the American president but in this movie it was not very intelligently done, just silly. Also, using a Sarah Palin look-alike was just cheap not to mention that such a joke is lost only a few years later when no one has a clue who Sarah Palin was.\r\n\r\nThe special effects where quite cool, at least when considering that it was \u201conly\u201d a comedy movie after all and even more so considering the movies minimal budget. The Nazi\u2019s steampunk-like contraptions where rather fun to watch. \r\n\r\nIn all I would say that the movie managed to place itself in the enjoyable range, barely, but I cannot bring myself to give it a more than fairly average rating.","id":"5128750619c2951d6308dfec","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5128750619c2951d6308dfec","movie_id":10679}

{"author":"LastCaress1972","content":"\"At the end of The Shining, he's reduced to a screaming ape, just like in the beginning of 2001 there are screaming apes.\" - John Fell Ryan\r\n\r\nAstonishingly, the above statement, as bizarre, irrelevant and as bereft of any further analysis as it is (and I haven't taken it out of context; there really IS no further analysis or conclusion mined from that sentence), is possibly the sanest, most rational sentence uttered in Room 237, a documentary film by Rodney Asher lending a platform to some of the whackier interpretations of Stanley Kubrick's terrifying but relatively straightforward adaptation of Stephen King's classic novel, The Shining.\r\n\r\nEssentially: The visuals of Room 237 are made up mostly of excerpts from The Shining (but also from other movies, mostly from Stanley Kubrick's or Jack Nicholson's catalogues), either slowed down, sped up, repeated, screen-split, run backwards, overlayed upon itself or augmented with arrows, directional bars or other highlighting\/orientation tools in order to assist the points being made at the time on the audio by any one of five contributors, all of whom appear via voiceover only.\r\n\r\nBill Blakemore - a hugely-respected news reporter - is first off of the high board with his assertion that the movie is allegorical of the white man's slaughter of the Native Americans. Because of the hoary old trope that The Overlook of the movie was built on an old Indian burial ground, you see. And that there are pictures of Native Americans or examples of Native American art and culture all over the hotel. The concept that the hotel happens to have a Native American theme, hence the paraphernalia, seems to have passed him by. What HASN'T passed him by is the tin of baking powder in the dry goods storeroom illustrating an American Indian Chief, the appearance of which signifies a \"good\" thing or a \"bad\" thing depending on how front-facing the label is in any given scene, or the fact that the elevator doors are shut when the blood pours out of the lift shaft, which is a clear allegory to how white men can't\/won't \"open up\" (Eh? Eh? See what he's done there? Eh?) to the slaughter of the tribes. That axe? Why, that was the axe that the Europeans used to cut a swathe through the Americas, of course! Mind you, our next man up - Geoffrey Cocks, an author specializing in Nazi Germany and of cinematic allegory to the Holocaust; have a guess where HE'S going with his theories - sees the axe scene, in conjunction with Nicholson's line \"Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in. [Silence and a pause] Not by the hair of your chiny-chin-chins? Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in\" as a clear nod not simply to the well-known fairy tale, no, but to Disney's racially unsound 1933 short \"The Three Little Pigs\" and the wolf's \"Jew\" disguise at the pig's door. He adds to his broth Jack Torrance's typewriter (German manufacturer) and frequent uses of the number 42 throughout the movie (2x3x7=42, Danny wears a shirt emblazoned with the number 42, etc.). \"When you put a German typewriter with the number 42,\" states Cocks, \"You get The Holocaust.\" Germany, 1942, you see. Okay.\r\n\r\nJuli Kearns and the aforementioned John Fell Ryan - he of the tenuous \"ape\" comparison above - had the more vague theories: Kearns seemed obsessed with mapping out The Overlook, which only really served to highlight some errors in continuity which were no doubt committed for the sake of the shot Stanley wanted, and not factoring in some madwoman dissecting the film frame-by-frame thirty years later. She also had some half-cocked theories on symmetry, and minotaurs. Fell Ryan didn't appear to even have as much as Kearns - he was mainly presenting an absolutely bonkers theory on behalf of another oddball who declined to be in the film; something about how the film needs to be watched both forwards AND backwards at once, with the \"backwards\" version overlayed on top of the regular film. But besides highlighting a few similarities in other Kubrick films (at a bloody stretch) and saying that \"it's interesting\" quite a lot, his ideas didn't seem to really go anywhere. Perversely, this lack of true mentalism inadvertandtly made him the most sensible fellow in the picture.\r\n\r\nBest of the lot though is Jay Weidner (described on his own website as \"an authority on the hermetic and alchemical traditions\"). The Shining is to him no less than an implicit confession by Stanley Kubrick, that he staged the moon landings on behalf of NASA. 237 - the titular room number, changed in the movie from 217 in the book - was the number of the soundstage on which the landings were recorded, of course. It's also 237,000 miles to the moon as well, apparently. The speech by Jack to Wendy, on the stairs (\"Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?!\" etc.) was Kubrick talking to his wife, about his NASA gig. The barely-seen Summer caretaker Bill Watson (in a couple of scenes near the very beginning)? He's a representation of the CIA, keeping silent tabs on the President, represented by Ullman the manager in his unconvincing wig (of course, to Bill Blakemore, Watson is the manifestation of the Native American cowed into submission by the white man. Pick your poison, everybody! We've got all flavours!).\r\n\r\nHaven't these people considered that maybe they've just pulled the film so finely to pieces that they've seen behind the curtain, and found every continuity error in the movie? Well, no. Fanning the nutty flames alongside their utter adoration of Kubrick's filmmaking is the perception Kubrick had garnered for himself as someone who did not make mistakes, ever. So, to these people, there ARE no continuity errors or filmic shortcuts; if they've seen it, Stanley MEANT for them to see it. Because of the secret message he was conveying. That chair that was in shot and now isn't, well that's because of [INSERT LOONY THEORY HERE]. Definitely not an honest-to-goodness gaffe, oh no.\r\n\r\nSo, is the film any good? Oh, it's entertaining, certainly, in a \"WTF?!?\" way. It's utter bunkum of course from start to finish, but the filmmaker knows that. He doesn't seem in it to poke fun though (his accompanying visuals almost uniformly assist the theories, only dipping into sly, gently humourous subversion occasionally), he just clearly loves to hear an extreme take on familiar source material. We all love a good conspiracy, don't we? And some of us love an absolutely hair-brained one, too.\r\n\r\n8\/10, recommended for anyone who enjoyed Trekkies, or Superheroes.

{"author":"Matt Golden","content":"The Sandman. The Easter Bunny. The Tooth Fairy. Santa Claus. You know their names. But did you know that they were secretly the guardians of childhood, brought together by the Man in the Moon as a sort of folkloric Avengers? Well, now you do.\r\n\r\nThey don't seem to have a lot to do however (aside from their respective day jobs, of course), until their long-vanquished nemesis The Bogeyman returns to threaten the world. To shore up their ranks, the Moon summons forth another figure of legend: the plucky winter sprite Jack Frost. Jack and the Bogeyman share a common problem: they're not believed in anymore, and have faded from public view. But Bogey has found a way to regain his power, and this spells doom for the other Guardians (and, presumably, childhood innocence).\r\n\r\nIt's a decidedly high-concept start, as most CGI fare tends to be, based on an in-progress series of books by writer and filmmaker William Joyce (who wrote and directed the utterly charming, Academy Award-winning short animation The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore, which I can't recommend highly enough; bring tissues). There's some mucking-about with the established tropes: each of the Guardians have different names (North, Bunnymund, Toothiana, Sanderson Mansnoozie, Pitch Black), and visits to each of their strongholds reveal Yetis do the day-to-day work at the North Pole (elves are instead well-meaning but useless idiots) and Easter eggs are grown like flowers, among other revelations. I'm sure you can discern how everything turns out in the end. Surprises aren't legion in films of this type; like any fairy tale, it's all in the telling.\r\n\r\nThere are a few issues with the film, and they're mostly structural: normally I'm not one to carp about world-building (and this is clearly a film with eyes set on a sequel), but the first half seemed to drag on a bit too long for me. These are archetypal characters; one of the reasons they're used is so that we get the idea at the merest glance. The second is that the villain of the piece, Pitch, feels like a missed opportunity. He's a mite over-exposed and a bit too solid. This is, after all, the Bogeyman. Employing a bit more of the Jaws principle and amping up the menace and threat that he poses may have instilled more fear in the youngest audience members, but how many of us were forever traumatized by the flying monkeys of Oz, or Willy Wonka's psychedelic tunnel ride? Kids today have it easy.\r\n\r\nQuibbles with the building blocks aside, the execution of what's there is sterling. Character designs are unique and witty, from the Australian warrior rabbit (Hugh Jackman) to the silent, squishy Sandman to the tattooed, inexplicably Russian Father Christmas. Jack Frost, whose design seems informed by the classic Rankin & Bass stop-motion film, is well-voiced by latter-day Star Trek captain Chris Pine, and Alec Baldwin brings his gravelly voice to bear with a hearty bombast on the sword-wielding Cyrillic Santa. Jude Law is seductively mischievous with his turn as Pitch, and Isla Fisher is a bundle of nervous energy as the flighty, OCD Tooth Fairy.\r\n\r\nThe film itself is gorgeous, with cinematographer extraordinaire Roger Deakins serving as visual consultant (other animated films for which he's performed this role are Rango, How to Train Your Dragon, and Wall-E; I think that's enough to say if you're making an animated film, bring him on). I can't speak for the depth of the 3D-ification, but rather than suffer through a dim, dull image, you'd be better served to witness the full, gorgeous colors of each of the Guardians' realms.\r\n\r\nGuardians is a cut above most animated fare, but with a bit more tweaking (and perhaps more involvement from executive producers Joyce and Guillermo del Toro, each of whom have immaculate fairy-tale credentials), it could have been a classic. The film we have, though, is an enjoyable ride, even if it doesn't have the staying power of its legendary characters.","id":"51ec278019c295369f3aff74","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51ec278019c295369f3aff74","movie_id":81188}
{"author":"Michael","content":"Gerade in der Originalfassung ist \u201eTed\u201c ein anarchischer Spa\u00df. Seth MacFarlane, der neben seiner Regiearbeit auch noch Ted spricht, hat ihr einen Film erschaffen, in dem kein Blatt vor den Mund genommen wird und vor allem davon lebt, dass Ted einfach in jeder Szene auf die eine oder andere Art daneben benimmt. Immer einen fiesen Spruch auf den Lippen sprudeln die Beleidigungen und unangebrachten S\u00e4tze nur so aus Ted heraus und wenn man bei menschlichen Protagonisten schnell das Gef\u00fchl hat, dass dieses Verhalten zu viel des Guten ist, kommt dies bei Ted nicht vor. Dies mag daran liegen, dass Ted eben ein Teddyb\u00e4r ist und man so ein Verhalten von einem Kuscheltier eben nicht erwartet.\r\n\r\nErstaunlich ist auch, wie gut Mark Wahlberg (Shooter, Vier Br\u00fcder) im Zusammenspiel mit dem chaotischen Teddyb\u00e4ren funktioniert. Wahlberg hat sich in den letzten Jahren ja eher in Actionfilmen und ernsteren Produktionen positioniert, zeigt aber in \u201eTed\u201c, dass er den \u201eOver the top\u201c-Humor genau beherrscht wie das Actionfach.\r\n\r\nUnd auch Mila Kunis (Black Swan, Ausgequetscht) darf man nicht vergessen. Kunis hat sich ja schon mehrfach in Kom\u00f6dien ausgetobt und beweist in \u201eTed\u201c, dass sich auch in derberen Vertretern des Genres eine gute Figur macht.\r\n\r\n\u201eTed\u201c bietet aber nicht nur derben Humor, sondern mindestens eine Szene, die in die Filmgeschichte eingehen wird, den Donnersong. Wenn John und Ted bei Gewitter im Bett liegen und ihr Lied singen und dabei das Unwetter wild beschimpfen, dann bleibt auch bei den Zuschauern kein Auge trocken, die ansonsten wenig mit dem Film anfangen k\u00f6nnen.\r\n\r\nInsgesamt gesehen ist \u201eTed\u201c allerdings kein Meisterwerk. In erster Linie nutzt Seth MacFarlane seine Erfahrung die er mit der TV-Serie \u201eFamily Guy\u201c gesammelt hat und mixt den derben Humor der Serie mit neuen Figuren. Klar, mit dem gesellschaftsuntauglichen Ted pr\u00e4sentiert er dabei eine Figur, die man so auf der Leinwand noch nicht gesehen hat, er erfindet sich allerdings mit dem Film nicht neu, sondern erschlie\u00dft mit \u201eTed\u201c nur eine neue Zielgruppe, n\u00e4mlich die Kom\u00f6dienfans, die MacFarlane noch nicht von \u201eFamily Guy\u201c kenne, aber derbe Kom\u00f6die wie z.B. \u201eHangover\u201c m\u00f6gen.

This movie SCREAMS \"Here's a great idea, but we just didn't know what to do with it.\" Whether it was because of lack of imagination or too many tokes on the community bong, nobody will ever know.\r\n\r\nHaving a movie about a real-live Teddy Bear existing in the every day life of a 30-something underachiever sounds like a winning formula. However after the first few moments, the movie stalls, the dialog gets stale quickly and the majority of the story revolves around Ted getting high and\/or trying to bang shallow, attractive women (even though Hasbro didn't include on him full, working equipment) while the main character tries to balance his 4-year ongoing relationship with a woman completely out of his league and his life-long Thunder Buddy (Ted).\r\n\r\nLewd, crude and rude, Ted does little to entertain beyond the limited soph-moronic humor. Unless you are a rabid fan of Family Guy or the 80s Flash Gordon, live in or around the Boston area or think it's funny to hear the F-word every other second, this one won't be for you.","id":"5d44e3d50f2fbd7673ed0466","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d44e3d50f2fbd7673ed0466","movie_id":72105}
{"author":"rjeev","content":"I decided to watch Kunal Kohli's Teri Meri Kahani before the other releases even though I didn't really like his previous 2 releases because I thought that it would be a light hearted romantic comedy and it was actually that. It starts off in 1960 when Govind who's going to Mumbai to try out his luck as a musician bumps into Urvashi, an already established heroin in the film industry. The 2012 one comes in next; there's another bump and that is followed by the 1910 story; another bump of course. At the end of each the lovers are temporarily distanced from each other and towards the end of the movie the 3 stories run parallel to each other as everyone meets everyone and love ensues. Simple. But then again there's nothing much we can do about the endings. They have to meet. What we can do is make the journey interesting, which is where the movie does just about okay. I found the 1960 story the best. It had almost everything in place but the other two weren't up to the mark. If one had good dialogues it didn't have good music; if one had good music it had a boring storyline. And most definitely both had bad screenplays. Shahid Kapur looks handsome and gives an earnest performance in all 3 characters and its because of him that I want the movie to succeed.Priyanka Chopra looks really hot but again hams when she has to play the romantic parts.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Anti Social Behaviour Order.\r\n\r\nSplendid slice of British Rock Rock Rockery. Vinyl is based about a Rock \"N\" Roll Swindle perpetrated by Mike Peters and his band The Alarm in 2004. With the record companies only interested in imaged driven bands with which to cash in the coin, Peters recorded a single and got some pretty youngsters to pretend it was their song. The record company bought it wholesale, with Peters and chums chuckling away until the reveal caused much mirth in the industry. So a sort of Milli Vanilli meets Blue meets The Sex Pistols!\r\n\r\nFilm is based in Wales and features Phil Daniels, Keith Allen, Perry Benson and Christopher Roy Turner as the middle aged punkers who meet up at a friends funeral. Their band The Weapons of Happiness is a long distant memory, gone are the days when they opened for U2 and toured with The Buzzcocks. Hooking up for drinks after the service, the men, in spite of having different ideals in life, get drunk and lay down a jam session, that amazingly in the morning sounds rather ace. But with the record company only interested in image based bands like The Jammie Dodgers and Bling Bling, Weapons of Happiness can't catch a break, that is until lead singer Johnny Jones (Daniels) hits on novel idea...\r\n\r\nThe whole film pulses with a sense of fun and vibrancy, the cast having a great old time of it acting up as a rock band past their prime but still carrying around a torch for the glory days. Their hangs ups and past differences are still there, and much of the comedy is derived from these scenarios. Once the youngsters arrive to be the fake face of the band, fronted by a superb Jamie Blackley, the age divide also provides scope for humour that is utilised fully. A running thread of Johnny and his frustrated partner (Julia Ford) trying to start a family, also provides mirth, while there's one or two surprises in the story as well.\r\n\r\nIt's no rocket science movie, it's very lighthearted and directed breezily by Sara Sugarman. However, the caustic asides inherent within the narrative (prejudices of the music industry\/hanging on to the past being good or bad?) do strike the right chords. The soundtrack is kicking, the \"band's\" song \"Free Rock and Roll\" beautifully catchy, the comic performances mightily strong, and the serious undertones never cloy the frivolity. From a Ramones\/Buzzcocks\/The Saints inspired hit single, to Daniels' ass!

{"author":"Matt Golden","content":"It\u2019s simultaneously a blessing and a curse that I often wind up seeing films post-theatrical release. Even though I don\u2019t intentionally seek out spoilers (OK, I do, but I\u2019m getting better about it), I do still read reviews of films. The best reviews convey two things: 1) what the author thought of the film in question, and 2) enough information to give the reader an informed opinion as to whether or not said reader will enjoy the film, regardless of the author\u2019s response.\r\n\r\nThose reviews, coupled with the near-unanimous praise the film has received from all quarters caused me to believe that I would fall in love with this film, becoming swept up in its high-tension, immaculately-crafted story of the hunt for, and eventual assassination of, master terrorist Osama bin Laden.\r\n\r\nI was so very, very wrong.\r\n\r\nIt starts well enough: under a black screen, a restrained opening plays audio (I do not know if it was real or dramatized) of phone calls placed on September 11, 2001 as the terrorist attacks that brought down the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were occurring. The film then introduces us to Maya (Jessica Chastain), one of many CIA workers tasked with finding the man responsible for those terrorist attacks. We follow Maya over the next twelve years, seeing small glimpses of her as she grows from determined but unsure interrogator to a woman whose sole reason in life is the location and capture of Osama bin Laden.\r\n\r\nThe film was in production for a long time, and the ending had to be hastily rewritten to account for the real-life assault on the bin Laden compound, which resulted in his death. What a boon this became for the film (to say nothing of the country as a whole), as the thirty-minute compound assault that serves as the film\u2019s final act is a breathtaking, tour-de-force whirlwind, following Seal Team Six into the dark den of the most notorious terrorist in American history and emerging victorious.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the two hours preceding that astonishing climax is unforgivably dull, lacking almost completely in character development and good writing, and structured with the worst possible way in which to tell this epic and (potentially) fascinating story.\r\n\r\nChastain, one of the best actresses of her generation, vacillates between being utterly terrific (attempting to convince her superiors of her lead, her final scene) and sadly miscast. Chastain is an actress of uncommon grace and beauty, and trying to put her in the role of an embittered federal agent simply doesn\u2019t work. The rest of the cast is serviceable, but the script (more on that in a moment) simply gives them nothing to do. At least the SEALs fare slightly better, with Joel Edgerton and Chris Pratt (from TV\u2019s 'Parks & Recreation') crafting positive impressions from their slivers of dialogue.\r\n\r\nOh, that script. Written by journalist Mark Boal (Oscar-winning screenwriter of Bigelow\u2019s 'The Hurt Locker'), it is a cacophony of crap. The dialogue is inane (\u201cBin Laden is there. And you\u2019re going to kill him for me.\u201d), the characters are flat, lifeless, and uninteresting, and most unforgivably, it takes what should have been a massively satisfying story (the hard-won retribution visited upon the monster that killed 3,000 innocent Americans), and trivialized it to nothing than the personal investment of a single person spurred by the death of a couple of coworkers during the twelve-year-long search. I understand that the search for bin Laden was over a decade of boredom and legwork, punctuated only by intermittent threats (most of which felt cooked up specifically for the film, despite those setpieces paling to what I can only imagine the real scenarios must have been like). But Bigelow\u2019s insistence on conveying that to the viewers by boring them to tears as well is not an effective recipe for drama.\r\n\r\nIn a way, it\u2019s the inverse of Steven Spielberg\u2019s 'Saving Private Ryan'. 'Ryan' is a not a good film (the screenplay is utter dreck), but the skill, inventiveness, and sheer directorial talent on display in that phenomenal opening sequence catapult it to being on the greatest scenes in cinema history. Here, Bigelow stages her own version at the end of her film, and the results are equally gripping and visceral. On the basis of that one scene alone, Bigelow (much like Spielberg) deserved inclusion in the Academy\u2019s nominees for Best Director. Outside of that, however, I find the critical acclaim of the film to be completely mystifying. The movie as a whole is rotten to its poorly-written core, a waste of money, and a diminishment of one of the best real-life stories of modern times. If you can, pop in for the last reel, but spend the other two hours watching something better.","id":"51ec270219c295369f3aec4c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51ec270219c295369f3aec4c","movie_id":97630}

Even the title design gives the same impression, more like a fairytale. But shockingly, this film was very different. This is about the gamers, the people who are crazy about video games. It was like a comic con, the film characters decide to create a utopia for the gamer with their favourite gaming characters. So they gather outskirt of the town and when everything was going well, they bump into a series of trouble, especially the founder of it. Coming out of it is the rest of the film to reveal.\r\n\r\nIt is not my favourite, but one of the best B movies I have seen and a bit refreshing. My appreciation is according to how they managed to give this product with the limited financial support. The quality of the film was so good. The performances were well recognisable. Since it was a comedy, sometimes the flaws are gone unnoticed. Not a bad attempt for the first time direction. Though the story was easy, predictable, but still enjoyable.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This movie was not really what I expected or at least not what I hoped it would be. Sure it is a decent enough action flick if you watch it as a stand-alone movie but it is also really different from the other Universal Soldier movies and I cannot say that I really liked the different track this movie took.\r\n\r\nThe good part is that there is no lack of action and it is indeed both brutal and quite gory action. Those parts of the movie are quite good and are what keeps me from giving the movie a real trash rating. However, the pace of the movie also drops into really slow scenes quite frequently. This could have been effective if there would have been some form of coherent plot to follow but there really isn\u2019t. A lot of things just happen and the lead character goes to various places, does things, without any obvious reason or explanation.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the plot, on some movie sites you can read a synopsis like this one:\r\n\r\n\"In a world without government, the surviving Unisols maintain order and choose the strongest of their ranks to rule, testing them in life-or-death combat.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this synopsis has also ended up on the French Amazon site where I bought the Blu-ray and it is total bullshit. It is not a world without government or any other doomsday world like what the French cover tries to imply. There is also not really any \u201ctesting\u201d going on but more a spontaneous brawl ending up in a \u201cunfortunate casualty'\u201d among the rather emotionless uni-sols. This blatantly false advertising really annoys me.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that did not sit very well with me is that both Dolph Lundgren and Jean-Claude Van Damme is not really main characters but rather obscure ones that kind of hide in the shadows until a show-down fight at the end. Not only that but Jean-Claude is more or less portrayed as a bad-guy throughout the movie. Not only as a bad-guy from the governments point of view but also from the viewers. It is kind of shown at the end that he is not but still\u2026the entire movie is very dark and without hope.\r\n\r\nAs I said, the action scenes are really the only thing that saved this movie from a real trash rating. If you have not seen any of the other Universal Soldier movies previously you might give this one a higher rating though.","id":"5115fff0760ee3294638e2a9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5115fff0760ee3294638e2a9","movie_id":122857}

Mat Whitecross (Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll) taps into the era of Baggy Manchester, of a Northern Britain dominated by pills, thrills and romantic bellyaches. To many of a certain age The Stone Roses were \"their\" Beatles, a power pop foursome that rocked it big time, their influence on the British music industry is still being felt today.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Creeper Compendium.\r\n\r\nThe horror anthology has a chequered history, some are bad but saved by one great segment, others boast a couple of genuine creepers but are undone by one instalment so bad it tarnishes the film forever. And on it goes. V\/H\/S brings the format into the new age by unfolding its tales by wrapping around the latest craze of found footage.\r\n\r\nSix indie directors have produced a picture that was well received at Sundance but has proved to be most divisive with critics and horror fans on internet forums. This will come as no surprise to anyone who knows their horror anthology onions. The usual problems are evident here, a couple of great stories are surrounded by mediocre ones, but at least there is something for everyone, with most bases covered, but that in itself is a problem, all horror fans have preferences, it's a big ask to expect a fan of stalk and slash to love a story about a winged harpy!\r\n\r\nThen there is the issue of the found footage format, here recorded on actual VHS. Not everyone is a fan (myself for instance), and much of V\/H\/S is dizzying and often hard to follow, especially as regards the Tape 56\/frame narrative story that cloaks the other five stories as a bunch of no-mark young crims burgle a grotty house and sift through the tapes. It's a format loved by many for its supposed realism factors, I don't get that myself, but for those people this really is up their trees!\r\n\r\nAmateur Night (David Bruckner) and The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger (Joe Swanberg) are the standouts. The former is a cautionary tale of frat boys out for sex who get more than they bargained for when they take home the mysterious Lily, the latter an eerie tale unfolded via Skype communication as Emily appears to be a victim of a haunting whilst chatting to her doctor boyfriend.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you ask another fan of the film what stories they feel standout, you may just get two different answers. So as with any other anthology horror, you roll the dice and take your chance, just don't expect genius in every story, for that is purely folly of expectation. 7\/10","id":"5636cfe0c3a3681b6101ccac","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5636cfe0c3a3681b6101ccac","movie_id":84348}
{"author":"LastCaress1972","content":"V\/H\/S, 9\/10. Gory, fun and inventive - if flawed - portmanteau horror pic shot in the cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 (Cloverfield, [REC], The Blair Witch Project) style.\r\n\r\nLike all anthology pieces, some ideas work better than others but V\/H\/S is packed with good stuff, containing as it does six \"stories\" (including the wraparound segment that tenuously links them all), each directed by a different up-and-coming bright young thing in horror movies. The wraparound story is by far the worst, and bizarrely it wraps up second-to-last, but still: a bunch of petty-criminal ****ers, presently making small-but-quick bucks from a streaming porn site by attacking innocent women in the street and exposing their breasts for the camera (charming) are hired by a \"fan\" of the site to carry out a reasonably simple task: break into a house, sneak in, steal a specific VHS videotape (apparently they'll know it when they see it, though this is far from the case), and get out of there. What they find is a largely empty house save for a cellar area chock-full of tapes and one room containing an expired tenant sat in front of a bank of old TVs and video players. They randomly play through a few of the many tapes in order to try and ascertain what they're supposed to be nicking, and that's where the five anthology tales come in; they're what these bellends see on the videotapes.\r\n\r\nThe stories, then (I'll buzz through these, they're only twenty minutes or so long each, so too much info will be to give the story up):\r\n\r\n1. Amateur Night - A trio of lads go out on the razzle armed with some cool camera-glasses, so one of the guys can happily film their evening's debauchery without anyone being any the wiser; superb if you're planning to get a couple of lasses back to your motel room for some gangbang action and film the results. They... well, they probably pick the wrong gal to bring back. I liked this one, despite my nagging fear (placed by this segment in tandem with the wraparound skit and even borne out further - though to a lesser degree - by the other segments) that there might be a nasty undercurrent of misogyny running through the movie. I guess though the simple truth is that when you put a bunch of young male twats in charge of filming ****, they end up venturing up the \"amateur porn\" route sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\n2. Second Honeymoon - Directed by slow-burn specialist Ti West (The Innkeepers, the superb House of the Devil), and this one's typical of his canon. Nothing really happens beyond getting to know - and like - the nice couple doing the usual touristy thing around Arizona\/Nevada. Then a girl knocks at their motel room door. Gore-free - almost incident-free - until the very end, this one was nonetheless one of the most effective segments.\r\n\r\n3. Tuesday the 17th - In which four kids go into the woods. Where some murders happened once. Ahem. The segment initially most calling to mind The Blair Witch Project being as it is both found-footage style AND set in the woods, this was for me the least affecting of the \"watched videotape\" tales, not through a lack of ideas (well, let me clarify: it DOESN'T make a whole lot of sense, but I don't mind that at all in short-story form) but because the actors in this segment were the most \"actorly\", the least honest and realistic. IMO. That said, it moved along at a real lick, it's as gory as **** and the antagonist's \"appearances\" on the videotape are pretty cool.\r\n\r\n4. The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger - Chronicling a sequence of Skype chats (hang on: this tale is being watched on a musty old VHS tape; who's converting their Skype chats to VHS? Ah well, no matter I suppose) between a guy working away and his girl, who is becoming convinced that she's either going crazy, or the house is haunted. Her arm's hurting her, as well... Yeah, this was a pretty good one. Not much in the jump stakes but it had a nice Tales of the Unexpected vibe going on, which is always welcome in these sorts of films.\r\n\r\n5. 10\/31\/98 - Oh-so-simple tale, in which a bunch of guys - and in a refreshing change from the wraparound segment and Amateur Night, NOT a bunch of unlikeable dickheads - are on their way to a Halloween party, and go to the wrong house. Like, REALLY the wrong house. This may well be the best segment of the lot. Certainly the most cool-effects-laden. It was a great way to close out the movie.\r\n\r\nFlaws - well, there's that aforementioned misogynistic streak running through the movie (most specifically the first 40 minutes or so). Also, although great ideas and buckets of grue abound and it was a blast to watch at the time, I'm afraid that lasting, visceral scares are thin on the ground, although I attribute that more to the nature of portmanteau films not having long enough per segment to develop real empathy or tension. But the worst flaw, by the proverbial \"country mile\", is that of all of the \"shaky-cam\" films I've ever seen, V\/H\/S is far and away the worst, most vomit-inducing exponent of that trait. Cloverfield didn't really pretend very well to be all that \"amateur\", [REC] elegantly addressed the problem by having their in-film cameraman be a professional television cameraman, with professional kit, and the Paranormal Activity franchise managed to sidestep the problem with the utility of tripods and fixed camera positions. So the worst I'd seen before this was probably The Blair Witch Project, way back when. But the cameras in V\/H\/S have been painstakingly made to look as amateur as possible, sadly to its detriment on several occasions. I found myself craning, squinting and frowning to see what the **** was happening a few times when I should have been freaking out at the events unfolding on-screen (somewhere).\r\n\r\nStill, despite that: What V\/H\/S gets right, it gets VERY right (and it does so very often). If you likes your horrors, you need to give this one at least a look. Recommended.","id":"5207b3c0760ee362ff25291e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5207b3c0760ee362ff25291e","movie_id":84348}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Me and my oldest son have been doing a bit of pseudo binge watching of James Bond. Every weekend we have been watching two of the movies starting with Dr. No quite a few weekends ago. Last weekend we arrived at the Daniel Craig ones. I had actually not watched those ones before. I have to, grudgingly (I am a Sean Connery fan), admit that the first two we watched were not at all bad.\r\n\r\nHowever, today we watched Skyfall. What the f\u2026? This is not a James Bond movie! If it had been just some other movie I would probably have thought it would not be a too bad one. However, it pretends to be a James Bond movie and as such it is utter crap. It is a bloody Hollywood drama written by someone with a total lack of respect for the Franchise, not to mention the old Bond fans.\r\n\r\nJames Bond should be out hunting international villains. Villains with a good chunk of bad guy charisma I might add. What we got however was some loathsome prick having a grudge because M didn\u2019t come to his rescue when he fucked up.\r\n\r\nThe British Secret service should also be just that, a powerful organisation protecting Britain (and the rest of the civilized world) from communists, terrorists, criminal superorganisations like Spectre or whatever.  Having scenes with M more or less on trial and having to defend herself in front of a bunch of clueless political asshats is just crap and it is definitely not the kind of crap that should be in a James Bond movie.\r\n\r\nThe whole movie is just full of sensationalist shit, politically correct crap, killing of popular characters, sentimental bullshit and other nonsens of the kind you would expect in a bloody Hollywood soap opera. And what about the new Q? A boring brat with a over-inflated ego. Not fun at all.\r\n\r\nEven the special effects are debatable. For example, if you make a subway train crash by blowing a hole in it\u2019s path then for Christ sake put some crash test dummies or something in it to at least make some pretense of it not being an empty mock-up!\r\n\r\nThis is undoubtedly the worst Bond movie ever. My disappointment with this movie cannot be overstated.","id":"5aaf94ca92514116ae036a85","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5aaf94ca92514116ae036a85","movie_id":37724}
{"author":"Travis Bell","content":"Skyfall was a solid movie in its own right but as a Bond movie, it was one of my all time favourites. Unlike Quantum of Solace, I felt like they actually took the time to tell this story and the pay off was worth it.\r\n\r\nSomething I found interesting is the idea about Bond getting old and how the job of an MI6 agent is not something you can do forever. It makes me wonder if they might explore some of these themes in the next movie.\r\n\r\nIt's true that the last 1\/3 of Skyfall didn't feel like a Bond movie at all and I think that's why I loved it. The Daniel Craig Bond movies have always taken a different look at James Bond and Skyfall was no exception.\r\n\r\nLike I said, great movie. Execution on all accounts were solid like you'd expect. I hope Mendes gets a chance to do the next film.","id":"50bf768719c2950644000e62","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/50bf768719c2950644000e62","movie_id":37724}
{"author":"Kenneth Axel Carlsson","content":"Bond (Daniel Craig) is on another (important) mission somewhere in the big world, this time on the heels of someone who has stolen a hard drive with all the names of the British agents who work for MI6. On the mission, Mr. Bond is shot by one of his own (an agent named Eve, played by Naomie Harris) and presumed dead. However, Bond is not dead, and when he resurfaces, he jumps right into the game in the pursuit of an old agent called Silva (Javier Bardem), an old favorite of M (Judi Dench).\r\n\r\nWhile Bond is out in the world, M discovers that someone, presumably Silva, has hacked their computers and threats to expose the true names of the British agents. However, it is also clear that the enemy has other plans, plans of terrorism. Bond is now in a race against time before more agents are revealed, or worse yet, before M is killed by their mysterious enemy. Fortunately, everything works out perfectly for 007, who finds the mysterious Silva with little effort.\r\n\r\nOK, admittedly, this was a very short summary of the plot in Skyfall, but in all honesty, there isn't a big plot in this movie. I could have given some spoilers about the ending, and maybe added a bit about Mallory (Ralph fiennes), but really, this is an extremely simple plot. Not at all worthy of a big iconic character like James Bond.\r\n\r\nIt is classic 007, with everything thats part of such an adventure, like product placement (not a favorite of mine, in fact I get rather annoyed when its as obvious as the watch in the opening of the movie), car chases (in this case, more like a motorcycle chase across the roofs of some unknown city), beautiful women (which are exactly as shallow and pointless as you would expect), and lastly a total lack of emotions and realism.\r\n\r\nI am not a big Bond fan, and haven't seen all of the movies in the series, so I am probably not the right person to review this movie. I do not understand what it is that draws people into the cinema time after time, to watch yet another Bond movie\u2026 when they can watch something original with a real plot and real characters. Perhaps these people like the shallow characters, who care little for the safety of the innocent people in the world, yes, I said it. Look carefully in the opening sequence, how the female agent cares little for the people on the bridge, as she shoots after the enemy. Later in that scene, she finds it really hard to shoot the enemy, because what if she hit Bond instead. I may be wrong in this assumption, but isn't MI6 here to protect the innocent people? Perhaps these people like the almost infinite number of one-liners that made my ears bleed at one point. Why are we treated this way? Do the people who makes these movies really think we are so stupid?\r\n\r\nBefore I actually say something nice about Skyfall, because I can do that, I just want to give a small piece of advice to future Bond villains, because who are we kidding, there will be more Bond movies in the future\u2026 my advice is this: Always remember to close the door behind you, whether its an actual door, or maybe a manhole (cover). If you don't do this, Bond will surely find you. But of course, perhaps you are dying to have him on your tail, in which case, you are doing it exactly right!\r\n\r\nOK, something positive. Skyfall is a beautiful movie, in a very obvious (and superficial) way. The colors are just stunning, especially when we follow Bond swimming through the night of Shanghai, high above the streets. There is no denying the imagery and action of the movie, in every possible way, this is some of the best the world has to offer. I'd also like to give a shout out to Albert Finney, whose character (Kincade) raises the quality of the movie, and actually give it some human emotion.\r\n\r\nThe very last thing I want to say is this\u2026 why hire Sam Mendes for this movie? Why hire him when he is not allowed to use the powers that God have given him? Where are the human emotions, where are the dark humor, where are the personal stories that capture our hearts as much as our minds? If you want to watch a real Sam Mendes movie, I suggest the following American Beauty, Jarhead and even, Revolutionary Road.\r\n\r\n_Last words... only watch this movie if you have nothing to do\u2026 at all\u2026 and if you are a hardcore fan of 007 and feel forced to watch every movie in the franchise. This movie reminds me why I only rarely watch big Hollywood blockbusters._","id":"54a0afed925141313200b7a5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54a0afed925141313200b7a5","movie_id":37724}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"How safe do you feel?\r\n\r\nBond 23 and 007 has to literally come back from the dead when a stolen hard-drive makes M (Dench) look bad at a time when a face from her past comes homing into blood thirsty view. \r\n\r\nThere is one sure fire fact in cinema that nobody can dispute, that of there never ever being a James Bond film that all Bondphiles will agree on. From each corner of the spectrum will come arguments that said Bond film is not gritty enough, not fun enough, not enough sex, not enough action, not enough fantastical stunts and etc etc etc. Well that's fine of course, we all have our peccadilloes we prefer in our Bond movies, but we do live in different times now, the world has changed, and so has Bond. You may not get the ultimate Bond you want, but this is a 21st Century Bond and a new era of 007 is upon us, something which makes Skyfall even the more bolder and braver because it marks the 50th anniversary by blending the old with the new and mostly achieving brilliant results. \r\n\r\nSkyfall allows us to bathe in nostalgia whilst also forcing us to re- evaluate just where we are at in terms of our beloved super secret agent. One of the great things about this Bond is that there is a bubbling under current of time's importance delicately perched on each side of James Bond's shoulders. Is he (and M etc) outdated? Or is the future still in need of such operatives\/organisations? Director Mendes and his team don't take any of the easy options that were clearly available to them to answer the question, they instead build a film around Bond and M as characters, embrace the traditions of the series and hit us hard in head and heart. \r\n\r\nThe plot of Skyfall as written is simple, absolutely nailed on it is straight and true to Hollywood conventions, but what fills out the simple plot is a series of Bondian delights, thrills spills and emotionally splintered kills. The stunning pre-credits sequence sees Bond traverse the rooftops of Istanbul on a motorcycle and then fight on top of a speeding train. Only to then find himself expendable. Which leads to Daniel Kleinman's title credits sequence that is filled with ominous portents of death and blood, in turn backed by the wonderfully Bondian of old title song warbled by Adele. It's clear at this point that this Bond movie is nodding to traditional values whilst promising to deliver some emotional pain. And so it proves. \r\n\r\nA washed up Bond enters the fray, and he convinces, he's dishevelled, unshaven and unfit, but he's still a tough bastard who can drink hard and stare a scorpion down. He'll be back soon, we know this, and he will be in wonderful physical shape, and loyal to his surrogate mother for sure. Ah, but there's the adversary on the scene now, a villain to finally give Craig's Bond something to fret about. It's Javier Bardem's (perfect) Silva, a cyber terrorist with a shock of blonde hair, a nasty dental trick and a devilish sexiness that unnerves during an interrogation scene; to which Bond cheekily opens up some wink wink possibilities. There is other sexual tension in the film as well, not just a steamy shower scene, but the ongoing banter with Naomie Harris' (excellent) Eve that positively fizzes with smirking innuendo. \r\n\r\nBut ultimately this comes down to the love between a man and a woman, the kind that is so different to the type that has so often underpinned a Bond movie. Bond will kill or be killed for M, and how marvellous to see a director really able to give Judi Dench the direction she so deserves, and Bond, in Craig's magnetic and gritty hands, responds in kind to deliver a last half hour as good as any in the 50 years of Bond on film. As we know, all turf is Bond's turf, but this time it really is HIS turf, and as a little back story comes seeping out, Bond gets to exorcise some demons whilst kicking considerable ass. Get ready Bondphiles, this has the emotional wallop only seen in the best Bond movies of old. \r\n\r\nAll the Bondian trappings are still here, exotic locales, gorgeous women, speeding vehicles, fights, stupendous stunts, bizarre lairs and balls out machismo. It's also funny! I myself commented when reviewing Quantum of Solace that it was pretty ace as an action film, but for many it's not Bondian enough, and the truth of the matter is Bond still needs to have a degree of fun, no matter how grim and gritty the story line is. Thankfully Skyfall is often a blast, with Craig (surely convincing even the most stubborn of dissenters how good a Bond he is) having the confidence and skill to lace his Bond's macho broody instinct with a desert dry wit and shrug of the shoulders nonchalance. Other side of the camera the tech credits are high, with Deakins proving to be one of the aces in the pack. His capturing of vistas, be it a neon city scape or a mountainous valley, are eye delights, his colour tones are beautiful, I promise you, nobody these days does golden browns like Deakins. \r\n\r\nIt's not the masterpiece that I or gazillions of others hoped for, and it does have flaws (new Q a bit too geeky safe, finale lacks a substantial battle with the villain) and it remains simple in plot, but it's Bond's birthday and the birthday boy has been done proud by the makers. It's a new era Bond for sure, but that most definitely isn't a bad thing, it knows its past and it now knows its future, and without doubt we all still know the name. 9\/10","id":"58a8ef0cc3a368641c004d04","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58a8ef0cc3a368641c004d04","movie_id":37724}
{"author":"raistlin3","content":"Much has been said\/written\/vented about the banning of Travis Matthews' I Want Your Love at this year's Melbourne Queer Film Festival. Many have stressed their disagreement with the Classification Board's claim that the six minutes of sex in Matthews' film did not advance the plot and I'd agree - the sex was nothing if not character driven. What is interesting is just how unerotic realistically depicted sex actually is. Not that it is unattractive; Matthews' film is actually incredibly beautiful in the way that it films the guys getting down and dirty, but it so tied up in the participants, in the case of I Want Your Love two (or three) guys, that it is the facial expressions, the laughs and the unsure expressions that become far more interesting than the mechanics of the bits going up and down, or in and out, or gushing forth.\r\n\r\nAnd it is the lead up to the actual act, the will-he-won't-he moments that really provide the tension in these scenes.\r\n\r\nAll it takes is one section of Marco Berger and Marcelo M\u00f3naco's Sexual Tension: Volatile to prove that. The anthology film, with six sections alternately directed by Berger and M\u00f3naco, traces the outline of sex but never actually breaks through. It is a very cheeky 85 minutes of teasing but it is also a lot of fun. Each segment takes a potential man on man liaison as a starting point and works it up to the point that it is just about to follow through, then moves on.\r\n\r\nBerger, who's previous films Plan B and Ausente have both traded heavily on sexual tension, gets the pick of the bunch, titled \"El Primo\". Ausente's predatory star, Javier De Pietro, appears as a young house guest who is taken with his mate's gawky cousin, who tends to lay around the house in his undergarments, which unsurprisingly gets our young hero into a lather. Berger uses his camera and his actors perfectly to capture a familiar scenario: the slippery slope from \"how can I sneak a perve\" via \"how can I sneak more than a perve\" to \"damn, I missed my only opportunity\". It works so well because it taps into countless times when you've been in the self same situation.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for most of the remaining segments. There is always that hint of familiarity tied in that heightens the experience. The best of the rest follows a young guy at a tattoo parlour who gets wrapped up in the tattooist, who doesn't know he exists; from there it is straight guys teaching each other how to better serve their girlfriends, sponge baths, hotel staff with no sense of personal space and personal trainers.\r\n\r\nSexual Tension: Volatile is a lot of fun. There is never a dull moment (thanks to the titular sexual tension) but after the first two segments the quality does drop off considerably. Going by the film's Spanish title, Tensi\u00f3n sexual, Volumen 1: Vol\u00e1til, there is more to come. I'm not going to complain, I'm well up for it.","id":"525a9d6419c2953b390c55eb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/525a9d6419c2953b390c55eb","movie_id":177656}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Three different generations and their romances.**\r\n\r\nThis is my latest Thai film and it's an anthology. It was released quite a while back, but I'm only watching it now. Directed by three different filmmakers for three different segments. One of the them was from 'Fan Chan', also known as 'My Girl'. It was not the best Thai film I've seen, yet not much disappointed with the overall film. The reason was the anthology. When the multiple stories compressed in one film, it always depends on each segment. You might like one or two, if not all or the whole film. But the bad luck is if you do not enjoy any of it. Then it will be a shoddy work than a normal concept film in the similar state.\r\n\r\nSo, you must know what the title means before jump into to watch it. 'Seven Something' is like for every seven years, love changes. That's what the tagline says. Means you know, the romance at the beginning and the same romance a few years later are not going to be the same for some people in most of the scenarios. Getting used to it is one of the ways to make it work, but what if the kind of romance you have fallen in for, is excessive at some point later in your life. That's the story of the first segment, which is named '14'.\r\n\r\nIt revolves around a teenage romance. As in the todays world, there's no life without social media. How those platforms became the youngsters daily life routine was told in here. From all, 'YouTube viral' concept was the majorly focused on it. People do videos for many purposes, including profession, talent exhibit, but for some it is just for fun. This was really needed for the at present internet culture the youngsters adopted. So I felt it was a very good message, awareness part of all three stories. The slight let down was, that I am not familiar with the Thai internet culture which differs from nation to nation. Though the fame getting out of them are same everywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n> \u275dI'm just one person. Without me, you'll be fine. You have 10,000 people who love you out there.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe second segment was about the film actors and their torn romance. It was named '21\/28'. After the good start, I anticipated it to be another fine tale, but it was not. I did not like it. It has been just a decent one. It all revolves during the time between the film called 'Sea You' and its sequel 'Sea You Again'. The whole nation knows their breakup, because of their fight in public stages. The attempt was made by them to patch, but does it work or not is the remaining is to reveal.\r\n\r\nToo sentimental, but not to be felt kind it belongs. Everything was on the screen, between the two characters, though failed to touch its viewers with its softness. If you are familiar with Thai films and its culture, that might help you to enjoy it better. I don't know. There are other actors those I've seen in other Thai films can be seen in the guest appearances. Especially the final credits have a music track where they all come to dance with a lip sync. What disappointed me the most was to learn this tale was from the 'My Girl' famed director.\r\n\r\nThe third and final segment was about a middle aged TV journalist and her romance with a younger man. This part was known as '42.195'. She has a reason for her depression in life. Then one day, she accidentally meets a marathon runner which going to change her life forever. But it's not easy in the circumstance of life she's in. Their little friendship, how it develops to an unexpected level of bond is what covered in the rest of the section. And again, I liked this segment. Very meaningful and realistic. The best performances by the pair of the entire film. I think you have to be an adult like the late 20s or more to enjoy it better.\r\n\r\nThe three tales are connected as they all set in the same timeline and the universe. Each one is to entertain different generation audiences. So when you watch it, you would know which is yours. Nearly 40-45 minutes for each segment. And the overall runtime was a bit excessive which could unfavours for some viewers. As well as the paces differs in all the three. Should have been improved the screenplay in a few parts, particularly the middle tale. Otherwise, it is not a bad film, but when it comes to suggesting others, I'm not sure to thumb up. It is a less known film, and like I had a mixed feeling, it might work for you as well, or even better, maybe not.

{"author":"walypala","content":"Much has been said\/written\/vented about the banning of Travis Matthews' <i>I Want Your Love<\/i> at this year's Melbourne Queer Film Festival. Many have stressed their disagreement with the Classification Board's claim that the six minutes of sex in Matthews' film did not advance the plot and I'd agree - the sex was nothing if not character driven. What is interesting is just how unerotic realistically depicted sex actually is. Not that it is unattractive; Matthews' film is actually incredibly beautiful in the way that it films the guys getting down and dirty, but it so tied up in the participants, in the case of <i>I Want Your Love<\/i>&nbsp;two (or three) guys, that it is the facial expressions, the laughs and the unsure expressions that become far more interesting than the mechanics of the bits going up and down, or in and out, or gushing forth.\r\n\r\nAnd it is the lead up to the actual act, the will-he-won't-he moments that really provide the tension in these scenes.\r\n\r\nAll it takes is one section of&nbsp;Marco Berger and Marcelo M\u00f3naco's <i>Sexual Tension: Volatile<\/i>&nbsp;to prove that. The anthology film, with six sections alternately directed by Berger and M\u00f3naco, traces the outline of sex but never actually breaks through. It is a very cheeky 85 minutes of cock teasing but it is also a lot of fun. Each segment takes a potential man on man liaison as a starting point and works it up to the point that it is just about to blow, then moves on.\r\n\r\nBerger, who's previous films <i>Plan B<\/i> and <i>Ausente <\/i>have both traded heavily on sexual tension, gets the pick of the bunch, titled \"El Primo\". <i>Ausente<\/i>'s predatory star,&nbsp;Javier De Pietro, appears as a young house guest who is taken with his mate's gawky cousin, who tends to lay around the house in his undergarments, which unsurprisingly gets our young hero into a lather. Berger uses his camera and his actors perfectly to capture a familiar scenario: the slippery slope from \"how can I sneak a perve\" via \"how can I sneak more than a perve\" to \"damn, I missed my only opportunity\". It works so well because it taps into countless times when you've been in the self same situation.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for most of the remaining segments. There is always that hint of familiarity tied in that heightens the experience. The best of the rest follows a young guy at a tattoo parlour who gets wrapped up in the tattooist, who doesn't know he exists; from there it is straight guys teaching each other how to better serve their girlfriends, sponge baths, hotel staff&nbsp;with no sense of personal space and personal trainers.\r\n\r\n<i>Sexual Tension: Volatile<\/i>&nbsp;is a lot of fun.&nbsp;There is never a dull moment (thanks to the titular sexual tension) but after the first two segments the quality does drop off considerably. Going by the film's Spanish title, <i>Tensi\u00f3n sexual, Volumen 1: Vol\u00e1til<\/i>, there is more to come. I'm not going to complain, I'm well up for it.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\">\u2605\u2605\u2605<\/span>\r\n\r\n<i>Sexual Tension: Volatile<\/i>&nbsp;screened as part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mqff.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\">Melbourne Queer Film Festival 2013<\/a>.<\/div>","id":"51480d6f760ee37250135a56","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51480d6f760ee37250135a56","movie_id":177656}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"**The following is a long form review that I originally wrote in 2012.**\r\n\r\nThe movie is incredibly convoluted, so it's hard to know what to say that definitely won't end up being a spoiler, so maybe it would be better if I just stuck to talking about the actors, as it's a crazy bunch of them for McDonagh to bring together.\r\n\r\nDon't believe the trailer, and certainly don't believe the posters. _Seven Psychopaths_ has nothing to do with either of them.\r\n\r\nOlga Kurylenko (_Max Payne, Quantum of Solace_) is shamefully under-used, but at least Martin McDonagh acknowledges that his film's female characters are not a focus point, and their weakness is his own failing (in a rather surreal way). I've adored her ever since I first saw her in _Hitman_, and was absolutely blown away by her _Centurion_ performance. Though she does practically nothing here, it's always fantastic to see her get more work (particularly in such a great film).\r\n\r\nWoody Harrelson (_Natural Born Killers_, _Defendor_) has also been one I've kept my eye on for some time now. He's a believable psychopath, a strong actor, a funny dude and he has great presence. I've yet to be annoyed by him. Ever.\r\n\r\nSam Rockwell (_Choke, Iron Man 2_) has only recently gained my appreciation, but fuck is he great. I'd seen him and loved him in so many things before, but I never drew the connection. Now in _Seven Psychopaths_, I feel he has his strongest role to date, moreover, he is certainly the greatest character of the film.\r\n\r\nAbbie Cornish (_Limitless, Sucker Punch_) is Australian. I'm Australian. So there's that... No, she's great, I just never really locked her in as a favourite like I do with so many others. Again, in _Seven Psychopaths_, that's not fault of her own. The script allows little room for women, which is unfortunate, but well handled. She gets much more screen time that Olga Kurylenko, but it would still have been good to get more of her.\r\n\r\nChristopher Walken (_Pulp Fiction, Sleepy Hollow_) is the sort of guy that I'd watch a movie just 'cause he's in it, and I don't even know why.\r\n\r\nCollin Farrell (_In Bruges, Fright Night_) meshes with me spectacularly poorly. It's hardly like I hate the guy or anything. He's a perfectly adequate actor with a great accent, I guess I just never got the hype. He manages to be the star of _Seven Psychopaths_, but have the show stolen out from under him by pretty much everyone else on screen.\r\n\r\nIt's rare that I give a film a rating of 80% or more, so if that means anything to you at all, then I implore thee, go watch _Seven Psychopaths_, it's well worth the price.\r\n\r\n84%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_","id":"5bb853570e0a2634ef0060b1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bb853570e0a2634ef0060b1","movie_id":86838}
{"author":"Sachio Saibara","content":"The opening sequence of 'Akashathinte Niram' has an old man (Nedumudi Venu) asking a young boy (Govardhan) what the color of the sky is. Blue, replies the small chap. The man suggests that the sky sports hues and shades that the mind would love to see. Quite an anticipatory bail for a film that is to follow for a couple of hours, that prompts the viewer to draw up assumptions and arrive at conclusions of their own.\r\n\r\nDr. Biju's new film follows a pickpocket (Indrajith) who lands up on an island inhabited by three individuals - an old man, a young boy and a deaf and dumb girl (Amala Paul). Not being able to sail back to the main land, the small time thief gives vent to his frustration by breaking things until eventually he learns a few lessons in life.\r\n\r\nAnd by few, I mean a very few, that arrive at the fag end of the film. But by then, anyone who has been eying the proceedings attentively could have guessed where it's all headed. But for the first one and a half hours, the film resembles a ship that is lost in the blue sea that you get to see in abundance, sailing this way and that until the shore comes into view.\r\n\r\nThere have been similar attempts perhaps in world cinema, but what would set apart 'Akashathinte Niram' from a classic like 'Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter' is that the emotional density that makes the latter film a delightful watch is missing in the former. While every movement and every moment of silence holds tremendous implication in the Kim Ki Duk film, the extended periods of stillness in 'Akashathinte Niram' add up to the tedium.\r\n\r\nThe emptiness that spreads out into the sea that lies all around starts eating its way into the characters that inhabit the island in no time. You realize that that there is something mysterious about them, but the hollowness that make up their very being cannot be missed.\r\n\r\nThe hush and the calm that pervades three fourth of the film give way to some verbal clamor at the climax. Its as if there is a point to be made, and there is no way in which they want the message to go unnoticed. Statements on service and humanity are made, but these are things that we have heard aplenty before. The only difference is that they have been set on an island this time around.\r\n\r\nSolid performances from the lead actors (which include a surprise cameo by Prithviraj) do try to drop in the anchor to this ship that has gone adrift in the ocean. M J Radhakrishnan's beautiful frames and a resplendent background score by Isaac Thomas Kottukapally serve as life savers as well.\r\n\r\n'Akashathinte Niram' thus ends up a visually spectacular film that lacks something very vital - life! And there are too many voids lying all around it that thwart its attempts to come across as a believable experience.","id":"50609bea760ee30a490009ba","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/50609bea760ee30a490009ba","movie_id":134296}

{"author":"Kenneth Axel Carlsson","content":"Grabbers is a story set on Erin Island, near a little coastal community of good people; fishermen, workers, drunkards and policemen. One day, something enters earth's atmosphere. It (whatever it is) is clearly at home in the ocean, but also crave something else: blood... human blood. So what is more appropriate than for this... thing, to seek out the closest human community and start to cause trouble?\r\n\r\nNo more plot for you, except to say that this comedy\/horror movie also contains a classic lovestory and a lot of ale! A lot of ale might be an understatement actually.\r\n\r\nYes, I said \/horror, but really, there is nothing to be scared about here. This movie follows the tradition of Shaun of the Dead and The World's End, which means a few laughs, a few bad effects and some highly enjoyable characters. It is not a movie that will change anyone's lives, but within its genre, it is not so bad afterall.\r\n\r\nThis movie makes a wise decision in not overdoing the monsters. They keep it simple, which means that the effects doesn't stand out that much. Believeable? Not really, but in a comedy of this sort, they don't have to be, they just need to be well-made, and they certainly are that.\r\n\r\n_Last words... if you enjoy the flicks made by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, you'll love this. The story is simple, the effects more so, but that is exactly what makes it work.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"It's on safe ground. This manger isn't wobbling.\r\n\r\nAfter the pleasing (justified) reaction to 2009s Nativity!, it's not unsurprising to find that two further films would follow it, starting with this, the first of the sequels. Formula remains the same as the first film, here we have David Tennant (great coup by writer and director Debbie Isitt to get him in a dual role) as an harangued teacher out on the road in charge of kiddies as they head towards the National 'Song for Christmas' Competition. Along side him, pulling the the emotional and cunning mental strings, is man-child Mr. Poppy (Marc Wooton once again on film stealing form), enter mirth, poignancy and a raft of engaging kiddies guaranteed to warm the cockles during Yuletide.\r\n\r\nThis is undeniably Isitt and her team treading on safe ground, which is both a blessing and a curse. For although the finale here - as regards the competition - has a different twist to the first film, it still feels like a redux of that picture - this is because it is. There's also a problem in that the last third is crammed packed with the competition song entries, not to say the songs and routines aren't great (Isitt and editor Nicky Ager co-writing), they are, and it's a nice cross reference of different styles of music. It's just that there comes a point when it veers close to being filler to pad the pic out to over 100 minutes of film, where much of the comedic human drama gets lost in the mix.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's still a warm film, and a real foot tapper that's nice to get involved with at Christmas time. 6\/10","id":"5867e820c3a3680f4e000724","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5867e820c3a3680f4e000724","movie_id":139380}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I was somewhat prepared to be disappointed by this movie due to its rather bizarre title and story but to my enjoyment I wasn\u2019t. I found it to be a quite enjoyable movie. \r\n\r\nThe story is somewhat bizarre indeed, but then what would you expect when Tim Burton has stuck his fingers into the production? The blurb about the film is also not exactly correct. The 16th president doesn\u2019t discover that vampires are planning to take over the United States. It\u2019s more on the line that he enters politics and actually becomes the 16th President because of the vampires. The story also manages to, more or less, blame the slave trade on the vampires. After all, slaves would make a nice food source for plantation-owning vampires wouldn\u2019t it? As I said, the story is indeed somewhat bizarre. \r\n\r\nThe film as a whole is quite enjoyable though. Well, I guess you have to like vampire\/action movies in order to find it enjoyable but then, why else would you want to see this movie in the first place? There\u2019s enough action to keep the film going most of the time. If anything, maybe the training parts were a bit rushed and too short. The action is quite well done, reasonably blood-splattering, and fun to watch. \r\n\r\nThe axe-swinging Abraham Lincoln is a cool twist instead of the usual wooden stake, cross swinging or dart throwing vampire hunters that we\u2019re used to see. He must be bloody, as in unnaturally, strong to be able swing around that axe the way he does but what the heck, it\u2019s a vampire movie after all, so one should perhaps not nit-pick on such things. \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a scene near the end of the film where a train is about to crash down into a ravine since the bridge, that the vampires have set on fire, is about to collapse. That\u2019s scene was a bit silly and overly unrealistic. There\u2019s also a fairly big whoops in the make-up department where Abraham and his friend Joshua clearly has aged a lot towards the end of the movie, which you would expect, but his wife and his friend Will seems not to have aged at all. How that managed to slip through is somewhat unbelievable.","id":"59425a5ec3a3686c40009ca6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59425a5ec3a3686c40009ca6","movie_id":72331}

Risking over-contrivance at times, the whole is nonetheless crowd-pleasing stuff that stands to do particularly well at gay fests, where it should pick up steam toward healthy offshore home-format and possible limited theatrical sales.**\r\n\r\nStarting things off a little too on-the-nose, the pic's protag (Cem Akkanat) introduces himself via voiceover: \"I'm Ibrahim, I'm Turkish. I'm Bram, I'm Belgian. I am a Muslim \u2026 and I'm gay.\" Fortunately, things get less glib fast as we learn more about his world. He's smitten with blond, blue-eyed Kevin (Simon Van Buyten), who works at a cafe run by his open-minded mother, Marina (Karlijn Sileghem). Though normally a slick pickup artist, Bram (who deals cocaine as a sideline to his job with an upscale caterer) is unsure of Kevin's sexual leanings.\r\n\r\nAt home, however, Bram is Ibrahim, exemplary eldest son to emigre parents (Ergun Simsek, Tanja Cnaepkens) proud to have resisted liberal Western ways more firmly than many back home in Turkey. The thorn in their side is Ibrahim's younger sib, Furkan (Lukas De Wolf), an angry teen who's turning into a little thug, skipping school and committing robberies with equally rudderless pals. Wise to his brother's hidden life, Furkan outs Ibrahim to take the heat off himself, but the family simply doesn't believe him.\r\n\r\nThat leaves Bram free to invite Kevin along when he goes to Turkey -- a trip intended to confirm his arranged-marriage plans with educated cousin Elif (Gamze Tazim), though that becomes a mere obligatory aside to the two men's joyful consummation of mutual attraction. Their cavorting doesn't go unnoticed, or unphotographed, by a hotel porter (Hakan Gurkan) whom not-so-chaste Elif has been fooling around with. Presented with evidence, she proves too hellbent on moving West to be swayed from Plan A. But those photos will wreak havoc yet.\r\n\r\nMix of comedy, romance, intrigue and religious\/cultural tensions is smoothly handled for the most part, even if the pic's increasing seriousness feels a little lopsided, particularly when a late instance of turnabout violence prompts all-around reconciliations a mite too conveniently. Nonetheless, \"Mixed Kebab\" enjoyably balances numerous themes and plot strands with brisk skill, presenting the gay relationship in an upfront manner without ever turning into a solely niche-aud-focused item. Ensemble cast, location choices, and tech\/design contributions are all lively and spot-on.","id":"50547d4919c2955c2d001c42","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/50547d4919c2955c2d001c42","movie_id":132561}

{"author":"darrenhamilton14","content":"Let's leave it all at the door here. I loved Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, and Batman. Hated Batman Returns, Alice in Wonderland, and Willy Wonka. Could care less about Nightmare before Christmas and Sweeney Todd. Okay, so I'm not a Tim Burton hater. I'm not a huge Tim Burton fan. I think in this situation, I'm as close as you get to the average movie goer. No agenda, no attachments. That being said, this film is terrible. Burton spent so much effort and time worrying about making this film Gothic and off pace, stuffing his favorite actors into the film even though half of their parts were pointless, he forgot he was making a film. It's a simple and fun idea but it feels like ego and \"showiness\" kept them from making the plot even make sense. We get it Tim! You are weird! Don't ruin a good performance by Depp and a fun idea for a film because you have to live up to your own Gothic standards. Grow up. So much talent is wasted on these films having the same look, cast, and feel to them. Take that talent and make something fresh! Stretch yourself just a tad out of that Hot Topic comfort zone will ya? This movie was long, boring, and ruined. All of the funny scenes were in the trailer. By the way.... wasn't this supposed to be the 70's? Other than a shot or two of trees and a hippie van it was just like the set of Sweeney Todd. The whole film felt like London in the 40's.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I generally like Tim Burton as well as  Johnny Depp. This movie was no exception. It is a dark (of course with Tim Burton) comedy with some hint of action\/thriller in it. I would not really characterize it as a horror movie even though there are a vampire as well as a witch and a werewolf in it. Of course there is the romance stuff but I personally feel that is really more of a background or justification to the plot than anything else.\n\nThis is not a magnificent movie but it\u2019s a good movie. I have never seen the original series so I am not biased by that. It seems that many people that considers this to be a bad movie refers to the original show. I have read several of the critical reviews and I do not agree with most of them.\n\nI found this movie to be a nice, moderately paced, comedy in a vampire\/gothic setting. The mood and the wackiness were fairly typical for a Tim Burton production. Johnny Depp was pretty much as can be expected which is a good thing if you like Johnny Depp. \nThe return of Barnabas to his, now rather dysfunctional, family is rather funny. The ease with how Barnabas was duped and trapped again in the second half of the film was a bit annoying but then, he had been asleep for a few centuries.\n\nThe entire family quite enjoyed this movie.","id":"5a92f36fc3a36824fd0238c6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a92f36fc3a36824fd0238c6","movie_id":62213}

Michelle Pfeiffer plays the Collins matriarch, Helena Bonham Carter the in-house shrink, Eva Green a conniving witch, Bella Heathcote the reincarnation of Barnabas\u2019 long-lost love and Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz a 15 year-old punk.\r\n\r\nDirected by Tim Burton, \u201cDark Shadows\u201d (2012) isn\u2019t far removed in tone from his \u201cSleepy Hollow\u201d (1999), which also featured Depp as the protagonist, although I suppose \u201cShadows\u201d throws in a little more humor. I\u2019ve never seen the TV soap opera Dark Shadows or the subsequent two movies, so I can\u2019t compare this movie to them. All I know is that I liked this rendition quite a bit, just as I liked the inexplicably reviled \u201cThe Lone Ranger\u201d (2013).\r\n\r\nThe October\/November ambiance (i.e. Halloween-season) is to die for and Depp as Barnabas Collins maintains your interest throughout. He\u2019s obviously a fish-out-of-water in 1972, but acclimates pretty quickly. Eva Green is perfect as the ee-vil witch and Carter is enjoyable as usual. I don\u2019t get the hubbub over Moretz, but she\u2019s a\u2019right (and holds a surprise for the last act). Alice Cooper is featured in a glorified cameo.

Urbanized types usually refer to them as \u201crednecks.\u201d While some of them may be \u201cwhite trash,\u201d most of them are not. They\u2019re independent of the government, hardworking and respectful citizens, not to mention rooted in Christian morality, although not necessarily Christians. The film respects the intelligence of the viewer, leaving it to him\/her to read between the lines. It\u2019s similar to \u201cJoe,\u201d which was released a year later, but not as abrasively pessimistic and is overall better. In tone, it\u2019s akin to \u201cUndertow\u201d (2004) and \u201cSnow Angels\u201d (2007). If you appreciate those flicks, you\u2019ll like \u201cMud.\u201d \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of gems to mine: Ellis (Tye Sheridan) mirrors Mud as an adolescent. Will he make the same mistakes that brought Mud to his current state? The movie\u2019s basically a rumination on the potential in both masculinity and femininity for good or bad, but the focus is more on the toxicity of some women, which is refreshing, as Hollywood tends to paint men as evil incarnate or thoroughly inept while women are usually sterling examples of eminent nobility (Why Sure!). The film also reveals the idealization of love and how \u201clove is blind.\u201d Just because you truly love someone in a romantic sense doesn\u2019t mean s\/he is good for you and that you should develop & maintain a relationship. \r\n\r\nI was never a fan of Witherspoon, but didn\u2019t dislike her either. In any case, she\u2019s quite good as the seemingly innocent-yet-toxic love interest. Bonnie Sturdivant is excellent as her teenage counterpart, May Pearl; they should\u2019ve done more with her.             \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hour 10 minutes and was shot in Arkansas (Crocketts Bluff, Eudora, Dumas and Stuttgart).

That only lasted so long before I thought, \u201cthe Director AND Editor both should never work in film again.  At the end of the movie I laughed comically loud at the fact that all of those roles were the same man.  \r\n\r\nThe story is one draft away from a really solid script.  There are some overwritten writerly moments that I took me out of the film.  This tends to happen in most indie films because of filmmakers trying to be hip.  Those moments were minimal enough that I could look past it and watch the film comfortably.\r\n\r\nThe performances, sans one detail, are all very credible and deserve credit.  Mary Kate Wiles and Nora Kirkpatrick do an excellent job.  Whit Hertford does a good job as well, but the director should have reigned in the twitchy\/blinky actor thing.

{"author":"Gimly","content":"I really was quite a fan of Dredd, I thought the actors, post-staff, director, writers and cinematographer all did an outstanding job. However, there is one man in the crew who makes the rest look bad.\r\nBy comparison.\r\nBecause Paul Leonard-Morgan's soundtrack is by leaps and bounds the standout piece of what was already a decent film by its own right. His work on Dredd is praise enough (he also did spectacular thing's for Limitless in 2011).\r\nI never got into the deeper Judge Dredd universe (ie. 2000 AD comics) and almost all of my knowledge comes from cursory internet searches, and that \"Dredd VS Death\" video game. But from what I can gather, Dredd is a more honest depiction of the source material than the Stallone-led Judge Dredd of '95.\r\nSo the music is outstanding, the Slow-Mo scenes are innovative and spectacularly produced and the specialised ammunition are astounding to watch. These are the three best parts of the film, in descending order, which to be fair, means that the gimmicks of Dredd are its most impressive feature. It's story is not broad (More of a \"day in the life\" than \"save the human race\" deal) and its characters are not greatly explored (though certainly not shallow), and it's mostly held together by these aforementioned \"gimmicks\", but more power to them! Better to have a solid baseline interconnected with deeply original fascination, than to have a boring rehashed piece of crap baseline, loosely stapled together with some poor excuse for dumping the same cliche $100,000 CGI explosions we've already seen four hundred times this quarter.\r\nSurprisingly, New Zealender Karl Urban (Star Trek, Star Trek: Into Darkness, LotR trilogy) makes for a better Dredd than I'd anticipated. Having a psychic was something I was initially sceptical of, too, however Olivia Thrilby (Juno, The Darkest Hour) put my concerns to rest after a long enough period to buy her role (about 25 minutes). And Lena Headey (Sarah Connor Chronicles, The Purge, Game of Thrones) I've liked since she played Queen Gorgo from 300 nearly a decade ago, so she\"s always a safe bet in my books, particularly in the role of relentless druglord Ma-Ma, she really is at home playing ruthless women of power, isn't she?\r\nThat all said, Dredd is not the best film I've ever seen. It's not even the best action-focused science-fiction film released in 2012 I've ever seen. But it takes risks, and that's nothing to be scoffed at. We need more Dredd's in our film industries, something to break up the monotony of most of Hollywood. Something that doesn't need to go big, or tick x amount of acceptability boxes, it's satisfied just being good.\r\n 77%\r\n\r\n-Gimly","id":"5aaf58d80e0a2665f501f68e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5aaf58d80e0a2665f501f68e","movie_id":49049}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Incendiary!\r\n\r\nDredd is directed by Pete Travis and written by Alex Garland. It stars Karl Urban, Olivia Thirlby, Lena Headey and Wood Harris. Music is by Paul Leonard-Morgan and cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle.\r\n\r\nReview for 2D Version Only.\r\n\r\nSylvester Stallone' 1995 attempt at bringing Judge Dredd to the big screen was met with a critical mauling, both professionally and by serious fans of the 2000AD comic books from whence the character came. On its own terms it's a fun popcorn piece, but one that totally missed the fascist grime of the source. Here however, under the guidance of Travis and Garland, Dredd gets the picture the fans and the character deserves.\r\n\r\nPlot is simple, we are in a dystopian future in a place known as Mega-City One. The only law and order are the Judges who are able to act as judge, jury and executioner. One such feared judge is Judge Dredd (Urban) and when he and his partner in training, Anderson (Thirlby), answer a call to a triple homicide at the multi storey slum tenement known as Peach Trees, they are locked in by crime boss Ma-Ma (Headey) and forced to defend themselves against practically everyone who resides there.\r\n\r\nThis is stripped down to the essence of what makes Judge Dredd such a beloved character in comic book lore. There's no need for backstories, love interests or comedy side-kicks, this is bad ass characters from either side of the law going at it full throttle. The action is unrelenting and explosive in its construction, bloody and brutal into the bargain as well.\r\n\r\nDredd the character is rightly kept to a basic level, he's a hard dude in a suit and helmet, with an arsenal of weapons upon his person and he delivers short sharp shock pieces of dialogue with gruff assertiveness. Anderson is a mutant of sorts, she can read minds, which superbly adds spice to this fight for survival narrative. Ma-Ma is a damaged villain, disgustingly menacing without histrionics, it's her calmness that's so terrifying.\r\n\r\nAt the core of the criminal activities fronted by Ma-Ma is a new drug called Slo-Mo, a drug that reduces the brain's perception to 1% of speed. This allows the makers to bring some dazzling effects into play whilst setting up some blood letting scenarios. The production design is top draw, where Mega-City One has a perfect totalitarianism sheen to it, which in turn is boosted by Dod Mantle's excellent colour lenses.\r\n\r\nWith Urban perfectly cast and his two lady co-stars also firing, Dredd is a thrilling action sci-fi movie. It doesn't push new boundaries and raise the bar per se, but it keeps the fires well and truly burning in the genre whilst appeasing the fans wholesale. 8\/10","id":"5c24666192514167fbc64fed","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c24666192514167fbc64fed","movie_id":49049}
{"author":"LastCaress1972","content":"About a million years ago (1980-85ish), when I was a boy, I bought a comic each and every week called 2000AD. And I loved it. I mean, properly LOVED it. The flagship strip in this publication was (and all these years later, remains) Judge Dredd. The titular lead character (his name, a play on that of novelty UK ska\/reggae artist Judge Dread - who himself lifted the moniker from a Prince Buster tune - although there any similarity ends, absolutely) was a \"Judge\", a one-tier law enforcement agent with the authority to arrest, charge, try and sentence perpetrators of crime on the spot (including issuing the death sentence, a sentence dealt out frequently), operating in the early 22nd century in Mega City One, a post-apocalyptic overpopulated dystopian conurbation stretching from Boston to Washington DC. A grim, violent piece, it nevertheless managed to mine some gallows humour from the ultra-right wing dispensing of justice, especially as doled out by our perpetually helmeted Dirty Harry-style anti-hero (of course, Harry Callaghan was constantly railing against the system. Not so Joe Dredd; he WAS the f*cking system).\r\n\r\nThere were many different colourful characters within the pages of 2000AD but Dredd was by far the favourite (generally speaking; My personal favourite was Strontium Dog, followed closely by Nemesis the Warlock and The A.B.C. Warriors) and was always the one most ripe for a possible movie adaptation somewhere down the line. And so it was that in 1994 promising British director Danny Cannon was attached to direct Judge Dredd - the next Sylvester Stallone movie. D'Oh! Anyway, the movie was released in 1995 and it was pretty-much a travesty, top-to-bottom. Cannon, it appeared, was simply hired to be Stallone's bitch, and despite the thing looking the part (the art department deserve some props for that film, you know) Stallone seemed determined to kick any in-place mythology straight in the bin if he didn't fancy it (Dredd never takes his helmet off, because the law is faceless, or something; Stallone takes his helmet off. Judges don't have relations with one another; Dredd develops a love interest with comic strip regular Judge Hershey. Thuggish recurring anti-hero Fergee is reduced to comic relief, major MAJOR Dredd arch-enemies The Angel Gang are reduced to one-scene throwaways and a robot looking A LOT like Hammerstein from The A.B.C. Warriors is introduced for no good reason whatsoever).\r\n\r\nAnd that, it seemed, was that. Nice one, Sly.\r\n\r\nUntil now. Finally, almost two decades of time and blockbuster, money-spinning superhero comic adaptations at the cinemas seems to have washed much of the foul stench of Sylvesters \"oeuf de poo-poo\" away, and for the final flush, here at last is the reboot: Dredd, starring Karl Urban (The Bourne Supremacy, Doom) and directed by Pete Travis (Vantage Point, Endgame) with a budget half that of its turkey-basted predecessor (more like a quarter when adjusting for inflation). So, what's it like? Well, if you're a fan of the source material you're going to have to throw out all of your notions of what Dredd and his Mega City environment should look like. Although neither nailed it aesthetically, the Cannon\/Stallone movie looks the part more than this one. Until someone wants to commit Avatar-sized monies to the project, I don't know if anyone will ever truly nail it. No, this one is a rough and dirty thing, reminiscent of the sort of nasty, faceless sh*tholes you'll find in the Death Wish franchise of movies. Still, beauty's only skin-deep, they say, and what's important is that this movie captures the eighties vision of dystopian future in exactly the manner that Judge Dredd the comic strip did all those years ago. It \"feels\" like Judge Dredd, in a way that the Stallone movie never did, despite oh-so-many more bells and whistles.\r\n\r\nThe plot? The plot is simplicity itself. Dredd is assigned to accompany and evaluate new recruit Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), a mutant who failed the Judge's aptitude test by a hair's breadth but who possesses a remarkable psychic ability to read peoples' minds, which the Justice Department obviously would want to exploit, IF Dredd decides that she can cut it as a Judge. Out they go to investigate a triple gangland-style execution in the Peach Trees city block, one of the thousands of futuristic high-rises that can hold 70,000 inhabitants, many of whom never have to leave the block in their entire lives. This particular block is ruled over by drug boss Ma-Ma (Lena Headey, 300), who ordered the executions. In an early exchange, Dredd & Anderson capture one of Ma-Ma's goons, and Anderson ascertains via her psychic skills that this particular goon was among those directly responsible for the executions. They decide to take him back to the Hall of Justice for questioning so's they can get the goods on head honcho Ma-Ma and her drug-traffiking industry but before they can do so, Ma-Ma seizes control of the security department of the block, locks the entire place down trapping the judges inside, and tells everybody inside to either help her kill the judges or get the f*ck out of her way; anyone helping the judges can expect to be killed too. So, Dredd and Anderson can either hide out until backup arrives, try to break out of the block somehow, or go up the building and after Ma-Ma, to kill her before she kills them. Which of those options do you suppose our man is going to go for?\r\n\r\nIn many ways, this film could've been called \"Anderson\" rather than \"Dredd\" (though obviously that wouldn't have been as marketable) since it's Anderson - played to just the right tone by Olivia Thirlby - who grows throughout this movie. And that's as it should be with Dredd: he DOESN'T change, he DOESN'T grow. He is a rock, a constant. Karl Urban - a childhood fan of Dredd himself - understands this and plays him to perfection (WITHOUT removing his helmet once; again, as it should be. Poxy Stallone). He's Robocop, without the warmth. For me though, the standout is Lena Headey. I wasn't enamoured at all with the idea of a \"new\" character as the main antagonist, and some whore-turned-druglord just smelled like that first \"market\" scene in Hannibal to me. But she's brilliant, really vicious. And the drug that Ma-Ma is pushing - Slo-Mo, which causes users to experience time at a tiny fraction of its real speed - allows us to view things through the eyes of the users, which in turn allows for some excellent slow-motion ballets of gruesome violence. And whilst the gore stays just-about on the cartoonish edge of things, this IS a very, VERY gruesome movie. About as gory as I've ever seen outside of the horror genre. But it moves at a real lick, it never lets up and it's all done and dusted inside the 90-minute mark. Lovely.\r\n\r\nAs of this writing, Dredd hasn't made its money back at the cinemas; a shame for a film that has had largely positive reviews and word-of-mouth. Still, it'll definitely go into the black when the DVD\/blu-rays are released in the next couple of weeks, and that'll hopefully trigger a sequel or even the trilogy that writer Alex Garland wants to make. According to him, Dredd III - if it gets that far - will feature the Dark Judges. And that thought makes me quiver with excitement, like a boy reading his first copy of 2000AD, a million years ago.","id":"5207b0e0760ee362ff24c0b1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5207b0e0760ee362ff24c0b1","movie_id":49049}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I think this adaptation of the Judge Dredd comics books are a much more how most people probably would expect that a Judge Dredd movie should be, especially compared to the rather disappointing 1995 version. That of course means that the movie is quite violent. Anyone who has ever read the comics should not be surprised about the fact that this movie is mostly about taking out the bad guys, and if you cannot take out the bad guys using violence then just use more violence.\r\n\r\nExcept for a few gripes that I will come to I quite liked this movie. The plot is a fairly simple one but it is also a plot that I would not have been surprised to find in one of the 2000 AD comics. It is a quite suitable plot for a Judge Dredd movie. The plot centres around the drug \u201cSlo-Mo\u201d which slows down your perception of time. This of course gave the director carte blanche to use extreme slow motion effects which could have been quite annoying if overdone. I think it is used quite well in this movie though. I especially liked the effects on the people standing behind the door that Dredd blew in at the beginning of the movie.\r\n\r\nJudge Dredd himself is well played by Karl Urban and, thankfully, he does not remove the helmet in this movie. I\u2019m sure it was done to satisfy Stallone\u2019s ego in the 1995 movie and it was one of the things that ruined it. Judge Dredd is not supposed to remove his helmet, period. \u201cMa-Ma\u201d is also a quite okay bad guy for this movie. Sufficiently psychopathic yet intelligent and rational enough to make a believable, at least as believable as a Judge Dredd villain can be, adversary to Dredd.\r\n\r\nI have a few gripes about the movie though. My main gripe is that it is not the ultra-modern city from the comics, at least from the comics that I have read since I have not read them all. It is more of a bunch of mega-scrapers spread out among the city slum that is left from today and still looks very non-futuristic. The initial chase scene is done using an old Volkswagen van for Christ sake. I really did not like that and, as far as I am concerned, it lost a star for that. If I remember the comics correctly MegaCity One was built more or less on top of the old ruins.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that I did not like was the crooked judges. Ii is possible that they used the concept of a bad judge in some of the comics, I do not remember, but I still did not like it. The judges are supposed to be above \u201cordinary people\u201d. I am sure that they could have come up with some other plot element than that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the bottom line is that I quite enjoyed the movie. The fact that the DTS-HD Master Audio sound on my Blu-ray copy was excellent did add to the enjoyment of course. The surround and LFE effects was quite powerful yet balanced so they did not cause my somewhat weak subwoofer to go into resonance.

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"Micro-budget, half-baked monster twaddle  \r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2012 and written\/directed by Jason Horton, \"Monsters in the Woods\" is a micro-budget flick (costing a mere $30,000) about \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 monsters in the woods of Southern California that an indie film crew experience while shooting a B-horror flick.\r\n\r\nI like the diverse ethnic cast, which is refreshing, but the shaky, sometimes unfocused, cam gets tedious after a while. There are a few good-looking women. I also like the monsters, which are half-spider\/half-human and impressively diabolic all things considered (it\u2019s eventually explained WHY they\u2019re so diabolic-looking). The first act is quite amusing as it parodies the trials & tribulations of a B-horror shoot in the sticks.  \r\n\r\nNear the end of the first act, however, one of the main protagonists abruptly buys the farm and the reaction of the cast & crew is unconvincing but, then, I guess it\u2019s supposed to be a joke anyway. The second act introduces two curious characters with head-scratching dialogue but, thankfully, the cool monsters are also introduced. Unfortunately, the proceedings and characters are dull and confusing as written and executed. Things finally perk up in the last act with revelations about what's really going on, but it can't save the flick from being what it is: half-baked. \r\n\r\nThere's enough good here for a quality monster-in-the-woods horror movie, but Jason Horton needed to take the time to work the kinks out in the story\/script, specifically in the second and final acts. George Romero did this with his original \"Night of the Living Dead\" (1968) and it remains a selling masterpiece to this day. The lesson? Don't rush off into the woods to shoot a horror flick with cast & crew, low-budget or not, UNTIL you have a well-written, comprehensible story with interesting characters. Otherwise you're just wasting your time and the time of anyone who might view your work. \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 84 minutes and was shot in Fawnskin, San Bernardino National Forest (exteriors) and Malibu, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C-\/D+","id":"5b42462f9251414f66013ede","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b42462f9251414f66013ede","movie_id":93513}

So we headed to the mall soon as the clock struck six.\r\n\r\nAs I have mentioned in my blog entry \u201cSheBlogger as a Reviewer of the Macabre\u201d (would be good to read that first before reading this review), I\u2019m always in the lookout for horror movies.  I especially watch out for Filipino horror movies because I\u2019m hoping for some improvements (and I have seen a few already) in this genre.  So when I first saw this movie on Facebook, I thought to myself, \u201cWow! Another promising horror movie, not long after The Healing\u201d.  Its Facebook page did not say much about the movie so I did not what exactly it is all about. I guess it\u2019s a marketing strategy to surround it with mystery.  Even the poster didn\u2019t reveal much, but did suggest a lot of things to the imagination.\r\n\r\nI will not go into details of the story because I don\u2019t want to spoil it for those who haven\u2019t seen it yet.  And the power of the movie is in the intricacy of the story.  I don\u2019t do to others what I don\u2019t want others do unto me.  I hate it when people purposely tell me the story of a movie I\u2019m planning to see.

{"author":"Reb_Brown","content":"I'm about as jaded of a Seagal fan as any. Everything he made up until **ON DEADLY GROUND** constitute a bevy of action classics and even that movie was at least hilariously bad. Unfortunately, most of his work since has been utterly lackluster and meaninglessly repetitive once he fell off a cliff into straight-to-DVD movie purgatory. A couple of them have been a little more ambitious, say **MERCENARY FOR JUSTICE** for instance where they coughed up enough money to spring for some tank battles, but unfortunately the extra cash couldn't salvage an otherwise dismal and predictable B-movie with cookie-cutter story and atrocious acting.  \r\n\r\nThese films have gotten comical piling up with snappy covers of a heavily photoshopped Seagal holding a gun, but with nothing inside but boredom, tedium, and incompetence the likes of which would cause even Ted V. Mikels to blush. After getting screwed on enough of these, I've given up. And I can't be the only one. Who watches these anymore anyway? Who, after decades of this, still falls for this cynical gimmickry? Enough, apparently to give this man a continuing career.\r\n\r\nHowever when I first heard the plot summary for this movie, I have to admit I was at least a little excited. Made in the wake of **THE EXPENDABLES**, it looked like there was some effort made to get the testosterone going in Seagal's career again, and maybe even a little nostalgia to his **UNDER SIEGE** days. This time we have terrorists (led by Michael Pare) taking over a prison and they let the prisoners out. Seagal must battle both the prisoners AND the terrorists in order the restore order. Sounds good right? How could they find a way to mess this one up?\r\n\r\nWell the catch is, this movie comes out of Canada which is like a factory for soulless straight-to-video action movies, and it feels very much like a product with so many corners cut that it's barely a movie. They didn't spring for any more than 4 actors to play prisoners, writing in some throwaway line that the prison is being closed down or something. LAME! Where was Seagal fighting his way through a crowded mess room? Budget-wise, the script must have been the cheapest part, but they didn't even put effort into that. Where was something interesting done with the concept? Why are we watching some team of young nobodies do all the dirty work while Seagal wanders around doing very little to affect the rest of the plot?\r\n\r\nIt's feeling like **HALF PAST DEAD** was closer to my expectations than what I got from this movie, and that's not a good thing.\r\n\r\nSeagal wears so much ridiculous body armor that he looks like a shambling tortoise and none of his fights exhibit a shred of realism or suspense. I have to give the crew credit though for not dubbing Seagal (leaving him to mumble in some bizarre semi-Cajun accent) and he doesn't look too obviously doubled for the most part. Michael Pare and Steve Austin were apparently great sports about the whole thing and put some physical and emotional effort into their performances. Also, we do get a little bit of a decent gunfight between Seagal and Pare near the end and some O.K. fisticuffs between a few of the side characters. It's just too little too late though and not really what we paid to see. \r\n\r\nStill I have to say it's better than 90% of the stuff he's done since **MACHETE**. I just wish this movie wasn't so deadeningly dull. If you are still curious, beware the droning canned musical score, which does not let up even for a minute over the course of the film, draining it of any potential excitement it could have had otherwise!","id":"5b3aa20ac3a36846b800fda5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b3aa20ac3a36846b800fda5","movie_id":118683}
{"author":"Dan_Tebasco","content":"**_Dude where's my script?_**\r\n\r\nIs probably something that mr. Larry Clark asked his assistant when he was on set to start film this, and seemingly they never found it and had to make up something on the spot.\r\n\r\n'Bully (2001)' was a great movie, directed by him but after that he hasn't done anything remotely as good... 'Wassup Rockers (2005)' despite poor acting was still decent because it had at least somewhat of a plot where as this does not and seem to aimlessly just go to events that lead to teenagers getting naked.\r\n\r\nNow granted, I don't believe Larry Clark has done a movie where teenagers don't get naked but really with this one I seriously started to wonder if he did this film for the sole reason of getting off on the nude teens with multiple crotch-shots (male and female)...\r\n\r\nIt sure couldn't be because he thought he had a good story to tell.\r\n\r\nOne of the characters says 'if people f'd more there would be no war. Less killing, less rape, you know what I mean?'. The character has some similarities to Larry Clark (it's an artist who likes to paint guys genitals, much like Clark himself is an artist who likes to film them) so that seems like a way for Clark to justify his fascination with teenagers sex lives, and possibly a (poor) attempt at giving some depth into a hollow movie.\r\n\r\nA sequel is listed for being in the making for next year, I don't see how they expect to make any money off of that, but maybe Clark doesn't care and he just want to film some more naked teenagers.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when he was seen as a talented director who was slightly perverted, but it's quickly turning to him being seen as a perverted director who's slightly talented instead.\r\n\r\nI think he need to do a full 360 if he want to turn that around, maybe make a movie about adults instead or if the teenage thing have to continue let them keep their clothes on and focus on a good story instead, and maybe a cast that have acting experience.","id":"5a561ceac3a3685ec70226da","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a561ceac3a3685ec70226da","movie_id":137174}

{"author":"Sachio Saibara","content":"What should have made 'Mallu Singh' interesting is a firm, appealing story, because this is the film that has the perfect backdrop already. Set in the rural locales of Punjab where there is a whole lot of mirth going on under the blazing sun; where nature stands one with man, 'Mallu Singh' lacks this one thing that it needed most!\r\n\r\nNo doubt there is a tale to tell, but it goes thus. Ani (Kunchacko Boban) goes to Punjab in search of a long lost brother Hari (Unni Mukundan) only to discover that the man has transformed into Hareender Singh. Confused beyond his wits, Ani determines to find out if Hareender is indeed Hari in disguise\r\nMallu Singh, as one of the characters in the film rightly points out is Hitler Madhavankutty reincarnate, and would make mincemeat of anyone who dares look at his four sisters (played by Aparna Nair, Meera Nandan, Rupa Manjari and Shawlin).\r\n\r\nThere is a moral lesson that the film upholds; that having a hoard of enterprising young actors aboard will not save a film. The narrative is bound to be equally if not more important, and when a film falls shorts on that very vital feature, the results are bound to be dismal.\r\n\r\nUsually the USP of all of Vyshakh's films is that they keep you entertained with harmless gags, even as the plot is not one to be boasted of. Unfortunately 'Mallu Singh' is infinitely low in the jokes department as well, and there are very few instances in it that would genuinely bring out a smile.\r\n\r\nThe story build up in a predictable manner leads to a conventional climax with no surprises in store. Eventually it all comes down to a stage when you realize that 'Mallu Singh' makes no special efforts to put across to the audience an inventive tale.\r\n\r\nUnni Mukundan, who has earlier been seen in promising roles, does get launched as a real hero in 'Mallu Singh' but the kicks that he gets to deliver are a bit too inflated. He's definitely good, but the action sequences of the film stand out as the worst part and with each sturdy blow that Mallu Singh delivers the overall impact of the film is further weakened.\r\n\r\nShaji's frames are the best thing about the film, and perhaps it would be right to say that it's an achievement that he has succeeded to make you keep your gaze fixed on the screen despite the very mundane affairs that occur there. M Jayachandran's musical score is definitively impressive as well.\r\n\r\n'Mallu Singh' disappoints you on multiple levels; regarding the story, the script and above everything else in its failure to proffer its talented lead actor a challenging role that could have made a whole lot of a difference","id":"5060a80619c2955917001732","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5060a80619c2955917001732","movie_id":134303}

Entering into it oblivious to any sort of bias or guideline, this Maniac proves to be a nifty shocker, one that is not without style even as it puts churnings in your stomach.\r\n\r\nIt's the stylings that I imagine have upset a lot of horror fans, the first person approach and avant-garde sheens strip the pic of genuine suspense. Yet it's a brave film in that respect, as is the casting of Elijah Wood as the titular maniac.\r\n\r\nStory is hardly original, boy had major mommy issues to deal with and has grown up disturbed.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> How one sad event that changed many peoples' lives.\r\n\r\nOriginally it was known as 'Lumpy', but this new title seems much better. Even though this title name is somewhat misleading regarding the film subject. I saw it a couple of years delayed, because I was not interested after knowing the title thinking it might be some kind of a silly B comedy. Surprisingly, this was one of the best films of the 2013 I've seen. This is not a comedy alone as it was classified, but a beautiful semi-emotional drama just like the film 'The Guilt Trip'.\r\n\r\nThe cast was so good, I loved everyone's performances. But in the opening, it looked like a mindless comedy with dumb characters. Only while the film progress, it slowly developed many awesome plots and I was totally impressed with it, especially for the way it ended. Yep, it concluded on a high note compared to the ordinary initiation. I think credit should go the writer-come-director, as well as the actors.\r\n\r\nIt was a two layered narration that sets in two different cities where one of it was a flashback, but both of them meets during the middle. So what comes later was the best segment. The second half is what made this film a better product. This is not an extraordinary film, but for a small project and its not so popular cast, it really excelled my expectation.\r\n\r\nWell maintained suspense, and I don't think anybody could guess them out that easily. Till the final scene, it'll keep you alive, especially if you like melodrama you'll surely enjoy it better than others. Lately Justin Long has been doing some of the interesting small-scale films and this is one of them that you should try it if you're a film fanatic without barriers in viewing any category films.\r\n\r\n7.5\/10","id":"577aab0792514155f4001d9f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/577aab0792514155f4001d9f","movie_id":138222}
{"author":"CRCulver","content":"This is a 2012 documentary of Ginger Baker by Jay Bulger, a journalist who wrote a Rolling Stone article of the legendary English rock drummer and later was able to interview him at length on his South African estate. Centered around Baker's recollections, the documentary proceeds through his life chronologically. We start his discovery of jazz records as a child, his early career as a musician and then the acclaimed groups of the 1960s that cemented his reputation (Cream, Blind Faith and Ginger Baker's Air Force). Much time is spent on his time in Nigeria in the early 1970s, when he played with Fela Kuti and ran a state-of-the-art recording studio in Lagos.\r\n\r\nThe documentary pretty much declares the mid-1970s on as the downhill period of Ginger Baker's life. From then on, tax problems, failed marriages and being deported overshadow what little musical productivity he had left. Even before then, he is painted as a fantastic drummer but a very flawed human being. Some of the rock musicians here (Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce, Neil Peart, Stewart Copeland, Steve Winwood and many others) praise his technical skills, but there's just as much complaint that he is impossible to work with. Interviews with his ex-wives, sister and son depict a man who was always prepared to unroot himself and abandon his loved ones. The greatest example of Ginger Baker's unlikeability is the opening scene of the documentary: when Jay Bulger tells him that he now intends to go off and interview others for their side of the story, Baker strikes him in the face with his cane.\r\n\r\nThis is generally a well-rounded documentary that covers all the bases. In spite of the filmmaker's wish to exaggerate the poignant nature of Baker's career arc, the drummer himself admirably refuses to go along. However, I had a few minor complaints while watching the documentary. One is that Jay Bulger is a young American man of the \"bro\" type, which sorely jives with the Britain-Nigeria axis that is the foundation of Baker's career. Happily, he stays out of the way for the most part. Some of the animations that were made just for the documentary are silly, and there is such an abundance of archival footage that there was arguably no need for something extra.","id":"5b8ac262925141518701c2ce","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b8ac262925141518701c2ce","movie_id":97610}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Between faith and winning a heart back.\r\n\r\nThis is my second Romanian movie in 3 weeks to review in WCA. And both of them were the Oscars sent movie that never made into the final stage. My Romanian movie count is not exceeded to double digit, but I think now I started to like them and hoping to watch many more in the days to come. This movie was less expected by me, well, I was delaying it for some times, eventually finished it with highly satisfied.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of the Golden Globe Nominee movie '4 Months, 3 Weeks & 2 Days' brings the story of two young women who were once abused when in orphanage that led them to bond closely before going their separate ways after leaving the place. One of them returns from working in Germany to win another's heart back who has now found a place in a convent. How the things work out between them, with their new life and the past attachment that affect not only them but entire convent.\r\n\r\nIf 'Ida' made into the Oscars, I don't know why this one failed to make. Both of them were kind of similar, about the characters who were caught between the faith and emotion. One's true commitment to the faith is tested with the unexpected encounter with the desires. Is the religion too innocence in the modern world? While the human civilisation shifting its phase to the next stage, the 2000 years old belief is struggling to pull together. In that platform this movie was narrated a wonderful story.\r\n\r\n> \"Continuity is essential in our spiritual realm.\r\n> You can't stop for a break when you feel like it.\"\r\n\r\nThe tale was quite clearly displayed when one has to choose between two, even knowing what the reality is, but fixed with their devoted mind on one. Maybe like coming from the orphanage, knowing all the struggles about life, this is the way they pledged to help the society. In the perspective of hardcore believers, the movie might be a little hurtful, but nothing serious offensive. It was just a movie, and sometimes it was a dark comedy that was not intended, but anyway I had a few good laughs.\r\n\r\nI am really happy for the movie, I won't consider it an outcry about religious cruelty. Unlike hospitals that legally runs performances, while a monastery like this raises a few questions within its practice that performed against someone's will. After all it was inspired by the real even that took place in the 2005 and mostly factual than fiction.\r\n\r\nThis was set in the present time, but most of the movie shot in a convent just outskirt of a city, so gives the feel of the 60s, 70s or earlier to that. Because their lifestyle that disconnects from the rest of the world, including their financial struggle. An ideal location for the story and its title. Shot in two different seasons similar to change in the phase and pace of the tale to the intensified conclusion. I loved everyone's performance. Definitely it is not in the line of 'Spotlight', but you can't ignore where the movie is pointing out on what went wrong. In my opinion, it is a must see and surely suggest it for all, well, mostly adults for its sensitiveness.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"56e6fd0ec3a3685a9600b04b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56e6fd0ec3a3685a9600b04b","movie_id":103740}
{"author":"Reno","content":"Nowadays its a customary to take the acclaimed short movies to stretch for the feature films by the incoming directors. All they need is a good producer and the distributors, the actors can be managed with the new faces. Yep, this movie was inspired by the short film of the same name like 'Short Term 12', 'District 9' et cetera. Most importantly, these films met a great success because of the beautiful story, characters and narration.\r\n\r\nThis movie was directed by the Iraq born filmmaker who is now residing in Sweden. Most of the recent movies, in fact, all of them outlines Iraq as a war field. But this film was such a poetic, shot in the real locations, brings a calm and beautiful 90s Iraq on the screen that you have probably never seen in a decade. The main two characters were inspired by the director and his elder brother, when they were kids and lived in the Kurdish part of Iraq. But the story was marginally fictional except the dreams of the children from the third world.\r\n\r\nI must agree, this movie practically describes how the influence of American products, films and culture affects the young kids from a country like Iraq. Their over obsession leads to dream bigger without knowing that's impossible to make it true. If you are a non-American you would have had such obsession in your childhood on soft drinks like Cola, Pepsi, or fast foods like from KFC, McDonald, or TV cartoons and Marvel Comic books et cetera. So, in some way, somewhat it's a tiny part of your story as well.\r\n\r\n> \"If a family is united, they will be strong.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no exact one word translation for 'Bekas'. It means 'homeless orphans' according to the director's explanation during an interview at one of the film festivals. This movie is all about two young Kurdish boys, Dana and Zana, and Superman, Michael Jackson and Coca Cola. If we talk about the story, it's when 'Slumdog Millionaire' meets 'In This World'. The movie begins similar fashion to SDM where kids are playing football and after that go straight to their business, instead school. In fact many scenes resemble above two films I mentioned and also other films. When the brothers get separates, that kind of reminded me 'The Gods Must Be Crazy 2'. Thus the screenplay originality lacks, other than that it is nothing less than to consider a wonderful film.\r\n\r\nThere are some scenes that make you go edge of your seat. Grabs our attention, creating tensions and thrills in the scenes like check-post and landmines. Emotions did not strike well because it's seemed more like a dark comedy. A bit commercialised than being realistic. The music was so good, awesome blend to portray the adventures, along with the two great performances, ignited the movie to emerge as a pleasant family entertainer. There might be millions of reasons to blame this movie because of similarity with other films and other stuffs, but overall I felt happy. Criticisers still going to criticize it, despite those flaws definitely worth to check it out.","id":"55510c4cc3a368436d000f80","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55510c4cc3a368436d000f80","movie_id":224746}

{"author":"kineticandroid","content":"I came to this because of the Coen brothers credit. It's an anomaly in their filmography \u2014 one of only two feature-length films they wrote but didn't direct, and the first since 1985. Sure, the poster makes the film look a lot less art-house-ready than the last film of theirs I saw, but I've enjoyed a Coen brothers farce before. Maybe the reason it hasn't made it stateside is because it's a misunderstood oddball. Turns out, no, it's pretty easy to understand. It's a cheaply-felt farce, replete with broad stereotypes sporting funny-sounding accents and the usual game of misunderstandings, several of which looking like they could quickly end if only certain characters decided to use peripheral vision. You wonder how different this film would have looked if the Coen's script hadn't reportedly been reworked or if they directed it instead. I did enjoy the idea that our conman hero initially paints his mark as a cartoonish and sour individual. But when we meet him in a more objective gaze, he seems much more rational, though clearly impatient with his employee. There's an intriguing antihero-versus-antihero story in that. I wish the film had further explored that idea.","id":"53a4ddfa0e0a2614420005d3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53a4ddfa0e0a2614420005d3","movie_id":97434}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Dreadful.\r\n\r\nTis one of the toughest things in film making to tackle, that of the western\/horror hybrid. Here things are further complicated by some sort of attempt to add Gothic leanings and fantastical surrealism. Sadly nothing in the whole film works, it's a collage of botched ideas performed poorly by cast and technical crew alike.\r\n\r\nPlot, the attempt at one as such, pitches Wesley Snipes' dreadlocks spirit walker type on a revenge mission to eradicate the undead - who once as humans raped his loved one. Lots of strands are dangled within, flashbacks upon flashbacks, time shifts and characterisation distortions, all set to a parched wild west backdrop. \r\n\r\nThere's plenty of blood dripped onto the corn but the corn is still corny, while the whole thing is a misogynists wet dream. Production design is decent, with the slaughterhouse sequences - and the costume design - better than average, and Snipes remains cool even if he surely knows he's in a very poor movie.\r\n\r\nBut ultimately this is very much one to avoid. 2\/10","id":"591f0822c3a36878fe030d7b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/591f0822c3a36878fe030d7b","movie_id":46429}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"These kids aren't the problem to Belfast, they are the solution.\r\n\r\n\"When punk rock ruled over Ulster, nobody ever had more excitement and fun. Between the bombings and shootings, the religious hatred and the settling of old scores, punk gave everybody a chance to LIVE for one glorious moment.\" \r\n\r\nUncle Joe Strummer. \r\n\r\nPunk Rock and Punk Rockers have always been misunderstood. Back during the original wave that began in 1976 it was thought punks wanted to kill the queen and burn down your villages, so even though some ill informed (re: ill educated) principals courted controversy, the spirit of punk rock, its ideals and reasons for being, got lost in the mix of the media frenzies and drug deaths et al. Many films and documentaries have been made over the years, some worthwhile, others not so, but all in an effort to either correct the misconceptions of punk rock, or invite interest into a genre of music that made waves that are still being felt today. Good Vibrations the movie is the embodiment of what it was really all about. \r\n\r\nThe story concerns how Terri Hooley (played by a superb Richard Dormer) believed that music could make a difference, and this even as a soul destroying Civil War raged out on the streets of Belfast. He opened a record shop and formed his own independent record label (the Good Vibrations of the title), and then one day he stumbled on a movement, punk kids who just didn't care about sectarianism, race, creed or colour, they united as one with a love of music, of music with attitude and no hidden agendas. It ticked every box of Hooley's world, forcing him to beg the question of where have these boys been all his life? \r\n\r\nI would like to report a Civil War outside! \r\n\r\nThe 1970s backdrop of the Northern Ireland \"Troubles\" strikes all the right emotional chords, but the makers are never heavy handed, it's never over-killed. The key here is portraying a movement - and an individual - that refused to be cowed by the bombs and the bullets. In fact during one quite brilliant scene ignorance proves to be bliss. From personal experience I can say that as a British guy living in England I was vehemently told back in the late 1970s to not even think about buying a 7\" single by one of the 'Oirish punk rebel rousers. I'm still flipping that same middle finger I flipped back then, today!\r\n\r\nTeenage dreams so hard to beat. \r\n\r\nThankfully the film doesn't spend most of its time on what music fans know as the key Irish bands of the era. The Undertones were indebted to Hooley as much as they were the legendary (and much missed) John Peel, but this picture barely features The Undertones, or Stiff Little Fingers as it happens. The former are key, and provide some of Hooley's most memorable moments, in fact it's the crux of the genius and otherwise (family changes) of Hooley the man and the \"businessman\". Yet it's the lesser known bands of the time that come to the front and tell the story alongside Hooley, which even though this is a biography of sorts, is a wonderful touch and dare I say it? Very punk rock. It's as he says, they are all a part of Good Vibrations. \r\n\r\nI saw the light. \r\n\r\nWhat of Hooley the man, how he is portrayed here? Pic makes the effort to show he was hardly an ideal husband type, where the love of his life, Ruth (the lovely Jodie Whittaker making an under written character boom) is playing second fiddle to his musical passion. His relationship with his parents is only pinched, though just enough to make a point, while some of his dealings with the warring factions in his community come off as a bit fanciful. But these are forgivable sidesteps, for this is about the music lover and the movement he fought tooth and nail to get heard. \r\n\r\nIt was never about money, punks wanted it, needed it even, but the true spirit of punk shines bright in Good Vibrations, both musically and as a human interest story, making it essential viewing for anyone interested in the original wave of Punk Rock. 10\/10","id":"550f41e5c3a368488600af7c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/550f41e5c3a368488600af7c","movie_id":130593}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Kidnap Thriller 101.\r\n\r\nSarcastic Spoilers Within Review.\r\n\r\nOff the bat lets say it, Gone is not a very bad movie, it has the requisite mystery elements, Amanda Seyfried makes for an engaging lead as the once kidnapped girl who nobody seems to believe, the cinematography (Michael Grady) is high quality and there's some decent moments of chills along the way. Unfortunately the film just exists as a case of unadventurous screenplay writing.\r\n\r\nGone is written by Allison Burnett, who writes it like some homework assignment set by a bored lecturer at a film studies class. Everything about it is rank and file what you have seen a million times before in this type of genre offering. A bunch of characters file in for cameos under the guise of red herrings, while our spunky heroine single handedly out-foxes the whole of the Portland police force, while naturally evading capture at every juncture.\r\n\r\nEveryone but Seyfried's character are just on the periphery of things, where the likes of Wes Bentley and Jennifer Carpenter stand around hoping for the script to give them something worthwhile to do. In fact Carpenter's character is a set up for a late plot development, only for it to be the last we see of her, which is just bizarre in hindsight. Then the \"big\" finale arrives and the serial killer\/kidnapper arrives and gets afforded the same \"none\" time as everyone else.\r\n\r\nNothing remotely original here, sadly. It serves decent enough as a time filler, but once the hopelessly weak finale plays its hand, you may come away asking yourself this question, why do films like this continually get green lit by studios when they have nothing more to offer other than putting another title on a budding actor's CV? 5\/10","id":"536f25bac3a3687e6c001403","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/536f25bac3a3687e6c001403","movie_id":79548}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The way I wanted like the old days, great!\r\n\r\nAn Irish vampire movie, thus back to where the vampires were originated. There are no good vampire movies these days, all those are teen target products which are simply a fantasy flick. In the old days, its horror and terrifying ugly giant beasts, the werewolves were, but in the todays movies they are adorable giant wolves. It's either vampire movie or werewolf, the result is same. 'Twilight' or 'Vampire Academy' and others, just not my type, though watch them for entertainment and to keep up-to-date.\r\n\r\nThe reason I watched it is for Saoirse Ronan, because I like her. But Gemma Arterton has been so good like always. To me this is what called a vampire movie. Of course, themes should vary from a movie to another, that does not mean one can completely abandon the basic theory. Neo-gothic is one of that, the present filmmakers forgets, because that kind of set-up gives Dracula effect. This film has been just like everything I wanted, so I enjoyed every bit.\r\n\r\nIt is always great to see a movie that portrays the world over the span of 100 or more years. As usual survival and hiding the identity is the main intention for the concept. But from who (other than humans) and why is the suspense that reveals formally at the right time. If you like 'We're the Nights', then this is the right one to pick. But not great as 'Interview with the Vampire' was, in fact, it was directed by the same director.\r\n\r\n7.5\/10","id":"55a957fac3a36847760023a5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55a957fac3a36847760023a5","movie_id":102780}
