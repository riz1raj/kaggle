{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_A disgusting, morally reprehensible work of insane genius_**\r\n\r\n>_LSD or mainly alcohol can bring you back to a more reptilian way of thinking, you are not human anymore. It is all about survival, about reproducing the species, about sex and domination. The moment we start losing control of the logical brain we go to a psychotic way of thinking._\r\n\r\n- Gaspar No\u00e9; \"Gaspar No\u00e9 on why his orgiastic Cannes sensation Climax should be shown to kids: 'It's very educational'\" (Kaleem Aftab); _The Telegraph_ (May 15, 2018)\r\n\r\n_Climax_, the latest film from Argentinian-French provocateur Gaspar No\u00e9, is a disturbing, depraved, disgusting, and debauched piece of absolute insane genius that I thoroughly adored from beginning to end, and which I never, ever, want to see again.\r\n\r\n_Lord of the Flies_ (1954) by way of Heronimus Bosch or Zdzis\u0142aw Beksi\u0144ski, _Climax_ is what you might get if you mashed-up Pier Paolo Pasolini's _Sal\u00f2 o le 120 giornate di Sodoma_ (1975), Darren Aronofsky's _mother!_ (2017), and Anne Fletcher's _Step Up_ (2006); a dance movie that morphs into a horror film, which then attempts to show the audience a literal hell on Earth. In this sense, it's a perfect fit for No\u00e9's oeuvre, focusing as it does on physical disintegration, psychological collapse, and what could be termed \"scorched psyche(s)\". However, considering he is such an infamous figure in world cinema, and considering how honed his overriding thematic preoccupations are, it's strange when you consider that in a career spanning twenty years, No\u00e9 has directed only four features prior to _Climax_; _Seul contre tous_ (1998), _Irr\u00e9versible_ (2002), _Enter the Void_ (2009), and _Love_ (2015). If you've seen any of them, you'll know that his reputation for excess and pushing both his characters and his audiences to the extreme is well earned, and with _Climax_, he takes that audience and those characters further than ever before. Granted, there's nothing here to rival Le Boucher's sickening attack on his pregnant wife from _Seul contre tous_, or the near-unwatchable rape or fire extinguisher scenes from _Irr\u00e9versible_. However, whereas those films feature sudden moments of barbaric violence punctuating (relatively) quotidian narratives, in _Climax_, the oppressive feeling of dread is unrelenting, affording the audience not even a moment to drop their guard, as not only is there a possibility that something horrific might be around the corner, chances are something definitely is; once everything kicks off, there is simply no reprieve. So even though the acts of violence are not, in themselves, as extreme as some of those in No\u00e9's back-catalogue, the cumulative effect is far worse. Obviously, this makes the film something of an endurance test, even at only 96 minutes, but this is precisely the point \u2013 No\u00e9 _wants_ the audience to be utterly exhausted by the end, and he employs numerous confrontational and disorientating techniques to achieve such. Disney this most definitely is not.\r\n\r\nSet in the winter of 1996, and allegedly based on a real incident in France that year, the film focuses on a dance troupe putting the finishing touches to a performance before embarking on a national tour, to be followed by a series of dates in the US. Apart from the opening shot, and a couple of quick shots towards the end, the entire film is set in the rehearsal space; an isolated and unoccupied hall. Upon finishing rehearsals, the troupe starts to party, with most pairing off to discuss who they've slept with, who they want to sleep with, and who they've unsuccessfully attempted to sleep with, as well as all manner of sexual, drug-related, and hedonistic topics (the conversation about the logistics of anal sex is particularly funny). Although we primarily follow Selva (Sofia Boutella), the group's choreographer, several of the others receive a decent amount of characterisation; the troupe's manager Emmanuelle (Claude Gajan Maull) who has brought her son, Tito (Vince Galliot Cumant), along to rehearsals; Selva's best friend, Lou (Souheila Yacoub), who is hiding a secret from the troupe; self-styled ladies' man and \"_walking invitation to an STD_\" David (Romain Guillermic), who is desperate to sleep with Selva; Daddy (Kiddy Smile), the troupe's DJ; unhappy lesbian couple Psyche (Thea Carla Sch\u00f8tt) and Ivana (Sharleen Temple); and Gazelle (Giselle Palmer), of whom her brother, Taylor (Taylor Kastle), seems a little overprotective. As the night wears on, it becomes apparent that one of their members has spiked the sangria with powerful LSD. Briefly remaining lucid enough to begin pointing fingers at one another, they round on the one person who wasn't drinking, Omar (Adrien Sissoko), and throw him out into the snow. However, shortly thereafter, the drug kicks in, and each of the troupe descends into their own personal Hades of paranoia, aggression, and\/or uninhibited sexuality.\r\n\r\nIn lieu of any kind of title card or opening credits, _Climax_ begins with an abstract and non-descript shot of pure white. So visually indeterminate is the image (it could literally be anything) that at the screening I attended, most people (myself included) didn't even realise the film had begun. Scored to the disconcerting and otherworldly sounds of Gary Numan's \"Trois Gymnopedies (First Movement)\" (1980), it is only as a girl staggers into shot from the top of the frame that it becomes apparent we are looking directly downwards onto a snowfield. The girl, dressed in a black dress, is in great distress, leaving a trail of blood in her wake. After a moment, she collapses onto the snow, her body convulsing, unable to go any further. The camera then revolves upwards along the vertical-axis through 360\u00b0, a shot anyone familiar with No\u00e9's work will immediately recognise. Revealing the bare branches of a few nearby threadbare trees, the movement immediately establishes that we are in an isolated location in the dead of winter. By the time the frame returns to its starting position, the girl's struggles have fashioned a hideously disproportioned and asymmetrical red-tinted snow angel. She struggles for another moment, and then she is still. Theoretically, this could be the clich\u00e9d opening scene to any generic slasher movie (the innocent and already injured victim desperately trying to get away from the killer, but too exhausted to continue). However, the striking imagistic composition, the economy with which the shot conveys so much information, and the unusual musical choice, all serve to betray the fact that this is not the work of an anonymous journeyman for hire, but is instead the meticulously composed opening salvo of an auteur who knows precisely what he's doing.\r\n\r\nA moment after the girl falls still, the film surprised me for the first (and certainly not the last) time, as the entire closing credits roll (upwards, obviously), right to the copyright information. Initially, I didn't fully understand the point of this. Obviously, the opening shot is, chronologically speaking, pretty late in the narrative, so I was thinking it was just No\u00e9 being cute, alerting us to the fact that we'd just seen the closing scene. However, it was only when the film ended that I realised the absolute genius of this aesthetic decision; with no closing credits at the end, the audience is allowed no transition from the film to reality, the buffer that we all take for granted is absent, and the effect is startlingly disorientating. As the film ended, the lights immediately popped on, with no music to play us out, no darkened theatre to recompose ourselves, we're just suddenly back in the garish real world, afforded no opportunity to decompress. Indeed, to enhance the sense of discombobulation for which No\u00e9 is obviously striving, the last 15 minutes or so of the film are literally upside-down, with the silhouetted dancers looking like bats hanging from the ceiling (this effect is even extended to an intertitle, which every single person in the theatre tilted their head to try to read). The audience is thus placed in the same position as the characters \u2013 the absence of closing credits, and the inverted image create a sense of confusion and discomfort, just as the film is depicting the surviving dancers coming out of their drug-induced mania and back to the real world. As he attempts to do throughout the film, No\u00e9 places the audience directly into the psychological reality of the characters. This is extraordinarily proficient filmmaking of the highest calibre.\r\n\r\nAfter the opening scene, the film then cuts to a TV screen showing the dancers' audition interviews. Surrounding the TV are books and films which announce some of _Climax_'s influences, and speak to its genesis. The films include Luis Bu\u00f1uel's free-associative surrealist masterpiece, _Un Chien Andalou_ (1929); Kenneth Anger's surrealist occult film dealing with the Thelema religion, _The Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome_ (1954), which, importantly for Climax, features footage from the hell sequence in Francesco Bertolini, Adolfo Padovan, and Giuseppe De Liguoro's _L'inferno_, a 1911 adaption of the _Inferno_ book from Dante Alighieri's _Divina Commedia_; Masaki Kobatashi's dark samurai film, _Harakiri_ (1962); Dario Argento's dance-hall-based horror film, _Suspiria_ (1977); Lucio Fulci's voodoo\/zombie film _Zombi 2_ (1979); Andrzej \u017bu\u0142awski's domestic drama-cum-horror film, _Possession_ (1981); and Rainer Werner Fassbinder's serial killer\/LGBT film, _Querelle_ (1982). The books include Franz Kafka's 1915 novella, _Die Verwandlung_, in which a man mysteriously begins to change into an insect; Georges Bataille's 1928 novella _L'histoire de l'oeil_, which charts the increasingly extreme sexual perversions of a young couple; and Pierre Petit's 1992 biography of the homosexual and transvestite painter and photographer Pierre Molinier, _Molinier, une vie d'enfer_. This in-your-face intertextuality at the outset of the film very much sets up the tone of the work to come, alerting the audience as to the style and intentions of the filmmakers. Aside from that, the interviews also do a terrific job of establishing yourself the differing characters, as do the dialogue scenes after the rehearsal but before the LSD has kicked in.\r\n\r\nThe next scene is the much-talked-about dance number, which is easily the best dance sequence I've ever seen on film. Scored to remixed versions of Cerrone's \"Supernature\" (1977), Patrick Hernandez's \"Born to be Alive\" (1978), and M|A|R|R|S's \"Pump Up the Volume\", the scene is simply breath-taking. Shot in a continuous 20 minute take, the dancers move at extraordinary speeds, with no single position held for more than a second or two. I know very little about dance, so I'm unable to really articulate just how extraordinary and original the scene is. I'm also not even sure as to the style of dancing. Krumping? Waacking? Voguing? An amalgamation of all three? The single-take grants the scene a sense of real-time immediacy and in-camera verisimilitude which one can usually only acquire from a live performance \u2013 this isn't something constructed by an editor from a series of individual takes, this is something literally happening before our eyes, no cheating, no effects, simply a group of insanely talented and utterly mesmerising performers. Put it this way, the dancing is so impressive, if I hadn't known it was being performed by professional dancers, I would be convinced some of it was CGI. Indeed, although it's shot in one take, the camera is anything but stationary, moving back and forth, and oftentimes directly above the dancers. In this sense, the viewer is not only watching the dance, they are, in effect, participants. Speaking to _The Telegraph_, No\u00e9 states,\r\n\r\n> _I wanted the camera to feel like another dancer. We saw the joy of the dancers moving and I wanted to replicate that with the camera moves._\r\n\r\nAgain, he is working to transpose the audience into the world of the film \u2013 he doesn't simply show us a dance sequence, he tries to include us in it.\r\n\r\nThus ends the first section of the film. The second, and much shorter, section is the dancers engaged in conversation with one another (and, in contrast to the first section, is made up of a multitude of edits eschewing any sense of match-cutting). The third, and longest, section sees Selva realise the sangria is spiked, the troupe attempt to find out who did it, and the chaos that ensues when the drugs take hold. These three sections (dance, conversations, and drugs) roughly correspond to the three books of the _Divina Commedia_ - _Paradiso_, _Purgatorio_, and _Inferno_. However, in the poem, the order is _Inferno_, _Purgatorio_, and _Paradiso_, charting the ascension of the soul from the Inferno of Hades to the Paradiso of spiritual unification with God and Christ in heaven. In the film, the movement is in the opposite direction, as the Paradiso of the harmonious and unified perfection in the dance sequence gives way to the calm Purgatorio after the consumption of the LSD, but before it has taken over their reason. Finally, they descend to the Inferno \u2013 the dance-hall becomes a deadly battleground, a hell on Earth, bathed in deep reds and greens, as the entire troupe are overtaken by psychic torment, manifested as physical destruction, with the body itself both the implement of ruination and the primary victim.\r\n\r\nIn charting this allegorical journey, one of the most immediately interesting things is the obvious visual contrast to the dance sequence. Whilst the dance sees the group acting in unison, all of a single mind, the third section of the film shows them fragmented and in disarray, each individual driving towards their own purpose, whether it be paranoia, hedonism, or what they believe they need to do to survive. The harmony of the troupe has given way to the horror of individualised disintegration and psychological collapse. This reminded me a little of the fall of Lear, sinking from grandiose threats such as \"_Come not between the dragon and his wrath_\" (I.i.130) and \"_The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft_\" (I.i.152), to his pathetic \"_I am a man more sinned against than sinning_\" (III.ii.49) and \"_I am a very foolish, fond old man_\" (IV.vii.60) - in the context of the film, the fall from the height of the dance to the bestial nature of the third section is no less epic.\r\n\r\nSomething that bridges the two sections, however, is the music, which literally never stops once the film begins. Consisting of a mixture of '80s and '90s electronica and anachronistic early 21st century techno, as the film progresses, and in keeping with the descent into hell, the softer sounds of the dance sequence give way to more intense pieces such as Suburban Knights' \"The Worlds\" (1990), Dopplereffekt's \"Superior Race\" (1995), and Aphex Twin's \"Windowlicker\" (1999), whilst the film closes, bizarrely, with a remix of The Rolling Stones' \"Angie\" (1973).\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most noticeable similarity between the dance sequence and the third section of the film is that both are shot in single-takes. The drug sequence lasts 42 minutes, and is presented as one continuous shot of the world collapsing in front of the characters' eyes - although in reality, it is several long takes where the edits have been disguised, \u00e0 la _Birdman: or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)_. Following first one character before trading off to someone with whom they have interacted, director of photography Beno\u00eet Debie's (_The Runaways_; _Spring Breakers_; _Lost River_) camera moves almost ballet-like throughout the space, sweeping in and around the characters as they fall apart. The lack of any editing, as with the dance sequence, enhances the immediacy of the image, heightening the sense of paranoia from which the entire group are now suffering, and leaving the audience as exposed as the characters themselves.\r\n\r\nAs the rehearsal space turns into a nightmarish landscape comparable with Hans Memling's, \"The Last Judgement\" (1467-1471), Pieter Bruegel the Elder's \"The Triumph of Death\" (c.1562) and \"Dull Gret\" (1593), Peter Paul Rubens's \"Massacre of the Innocents\" (1636-1638), or Francisco Goya's \"Saturn Devouring His Son\" (1819-1823), the film treats us to a girl's head being set on fire, a pregnant girl being kicked repeatedly in the stomach, a girl slashing her own arm and face, a contortionist contorting to the point where he literally splinters his own bones, a child locked in a room full of cockroaches, a man scratching his chest to the point that it turns into four red bloody streaks, public urination, lesbian rape, incest, and suicide. The troupe descend into a kind of deeply twisted and barbaric gang-mentality, what we might expect if _Lord of the Flies_ had been written by the Marquis de Sade, urging one another on to acts of unimaginable and ever-increasing violence and degradation. As the veneer of civilisation is stripped away, the characters devolve before our eyes; some become concerned only with sex, others with violence, whilst a small few try to help their fellow sufferers, although even they ultimately give in to their basest instincts. Indeed, No\u00e9 tells _The Telegraph_,\r\n\r\n> _it's like the start of 2001, we see the apes and then they evolve into humans, and in the case of my film it is like the humans go back to being apes. Humans are going back to their original forces [\u2026] LSD or mainly alcohol can bring you back to a more reptilian way of thinking, you are not human anymore. It is all about survival, about reproducing species, about sex and domination. The moment we start losing control of the logical brain we go to a psychotic way of thinking._\r\n\r\nBut what is it all about? Is there any kind of theme underpinning the whole thing, in the same way that _Sal\u00f2_ isn't really about forcing young girls to eat faeces or cutting off boy's tongues, it is actually about (amongst other things) political corruption, the abuse of power, fascism, and economic inequality. It would certainly be easy to dismiss _Climax_ as thematically empty, arguing that the brilliant camerawork and pumping soundtrack serve only to cover up the vapidity at its core, to argue that the depravity and excess is not in the service of any grand universal point or allegorical thinking, but simply to show attractive young people tearing one another apart. Even if one buys into No\u00e9's devolution argument, the idea that the film presents \"man as beast\", it still doesn't offer thematic relevance. So, in a nutshell, is _Climax_ shocking for the sake of being shocking?\r\n\r\nNot exactly.\r\n\r\nYes, this is exhibitionist cinema through and through, the type of film that dares you to look at it intently until you can't look anymore, as if the filmmaker is standing behind you saying, \"I knew you'd look away.\" But there is definitely more to it than that. For example, there is some kind of political point buried beneath the carnage and broken bodies; the dance sequence takes place in front of a massive French flag, whilst the credits declare, \"_A French Film. And proud of it_.\" Perhaps related to this, the troupe is made up of a cross-section of Europeans \u2013 gay, straight, men, women, transsexual, black, white, eastern, western. In the explosion of excess hedonism and hysterical mayhem, does this cross-section of ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations come to represent European multiculturalism tearing itself apart? Is No\u00e9 saying that if France continues to accommodate such a diversity of disparate cultures, chaos will ensue? Possibly. In this sense, the early parts of the film would represent the liberal ideal of perfect multicultural harmony, whilst the later section is a conservative's wet dream, showing what could happen in such a melting pot. The dance sequence thus represents a politically harmonious multicultural society composed of a barrage of norms and peoples, all working together for the greater good. In relation to this, perhaps tellingly, Omar, the person who is initially blamed for spiking the sangria, is Muslim (which is how everyone immediately knows he wasn't drinking). Is this merely a plot point, or is it part of the larger allegorical canvas?\r\n\r\nTo flip this argument, is No\u00e9 saying that in such a multicultural _milieu_, with fear of Islam at a high, it's very easy to blame everything on the Islamic \"Other\". Additionally, No\u00e9 depicts that dance scene with such reverence and awe that this kind of social critique, barely straddling the line between patriotism and xenophobia, doesn't seem to sit especially comfortably. Not to mention that No\u00e9 himself is an immigrant \u2013 he was born in Argentina, moving to France when he was 13. Maybe he's simply criticising the hedonistic youth of today, and their love of excess. However, whilst the political allegory might be reading too much into the film, suggesting the whole thing is simply so No\u00e9 can proclaim \"kids today\" is reducing it all to a far too simplistic degree. He is no Pier Paolo Pasolini, but neither is he a curmudgeonly old man!\r\n\r\nThe fact is, I don't have a clue what _Climax_ is about. Nor do I care. Nor is it important. I would argue instead that if you spend the duration of the film trying to figure out what it's all about, then you have missed what it's all about. You can only see the film for the first time once, and it's better to let it carry you into the nether-regions rather than trying to analyse it. With that in mind, I take it for what it appears on the surface; an incredibly technically proficient depiction of a contemporary Inferno, as aesthetically impressive as it is morally questionable, as enthralling as it is disturbing, and as evocative as it is shocking, a film of unparalleled barbarism, that also stands as one of the most extraordinary cinematic achievements in recent years.\r\n\r\nIt's a work of genius. Twisted, sick, deraved genius, but genius nonetheless. It disturbed me like no film in at least a decade, and I couldn't get it out of my head for days afterwards. I absolutely loved every single crazy minute of it. And I don't ever wish to see it again. For No\u00e9, I can think of no higher compliment.","id":"5ceef7fa0e0a2615b5cb7355","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ceef7fa0e0a2615b5cb7355","movie_id":507076}

Bands who can legitimately say \"_it's all about the music_\" and actually back that claim up are automatically head and shoulders above their less authentic rivals, who may sing a good game, but who live a very different life. Think of how fake and preening Guns N' Roses made the glam metal bands of the 80s look. Think of how ludicrous and pampered Nirvana made Guns N' Roses look only a few years later. Think of how the lives led by members of The Doors and Sex Pistols were arguably even more extreme and rebellious than anything found in their songs. With this in mind, _Lords of Chaos_ looks at late 80s\/early 90s Norwegian black metal, and asks the question, \"_was its extreme image authentic or manufactured_\".\r\n\r\nAdapted from Michael Moynihan and Didrik S\u00f8derlind's 1998 book _Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground_, written for the screen by Dennis Magnusson and Jonas \u00c5kerlund, and directed by \u00c5kerlund (_Spun_; _Polar_), the film tells the story of the black metal scene from the perspective of Mayhem co-founder \u00d8ystein \"Euronymous\" Aarseth. Purporting to be a cult-like group of militant anti-establishment Satanists who practised human sacrifices, championed suicide, and advocated murder and anti-Christian violence, the film posits that most of its adherents knew that such declarations were simply for the purposes of marketing, and that claims of \"_spreading fear and evil_\" were not to be taken literally. _Lords of Chaos_, however, is about what happened when some black metallers took them very literally. What started as a group of harmless young men wearing black, talking about evil, and forging a new musical style, would soon lead to suicide, arson, and murder, as members set out to prove themselves the most \"authentic\" practitioners of the form. Equal parts darkly funny and unflinchingly disturbing, the film is primarily aimed at people who know little-or-nothing about the scene, as it seems unlikely it will receive much in the way of approval from current black metal acts, who will undoubtedly dislike their art form being made the butt of much of the ironic humour. \u00c5kerlund never takes the scene as seriously as it takes itself, and, depending on your perspective, that's either the film's greatest strength or its most egregious failing.\r\n\r\nOslo, 1987. It has been three years since seventeen-year-old guitarist \u00d8ystein \"Euronymous\" Aarseth (an excellent Rory Culkin) established his band, Mayhem. Coming from a middle-class background and residing in a comfortable suburb, Euronymous is determined to create a new subgenre of \"_true Norwegian black metal_\", but the band has made little headway thus far. Their fortunes change, however, when they receive a demo from Pelle \"Dead\" Ohlin (a superb Jack Kilmer), a Swedish singer looking for a band to front. They hire him, and although he shows self-destructive tendencies from the start, his voice fits their style so well, they humour him, as he and Euronymous form a genuine friendship. As time passes, however, Dead's behaviour becomes more erratic - cutting himself at gigs and spraying blood into the crowd, sniffing from a bag containing a dead bird before performances, wandering naked through the forest surrounding the house in Kr\u00e5kstad the band use to rehearse, throwing pigs' heads at members of the audience he deems to be insufficiently authentic. After a gig, Euronymous meets an awkward fan, Kristian \"Varg\" Vikernes (a very creepy Emory Cohen), on whom he initially looks down. Meanwhile, overcome with depression, Dead kills himself by cutting his wrists and throat and shooting himself in the forehead with a shotgun. Upon finding the body, Euronymous takes pictures of the corpse, one of which he would use as the cover of the 1991 EP _Dawn of the Black Hearts_, and fashions necklaces out of Dead's skull. Shortly thereafter, Euronymous starts his own black metal record label (Deathlike Silence) and opens a record shop (Helvete), which becomes an unofficial social hub for black-metallers. He then establishes what he calls the \"Black Circle\" in the basement, into which he only permits those he deemed worthy, which eventually includes Varg. However, as time goes on, and Varg becomes more and more extreme, a power struggle between himself and Euronymous develops. When Varg starts burning churches, Euronymous sees himself losing pace with the very movement he established, and so claims that he inspired Varg's actions. Varg, however, has no intention of allowing Euronymous to steal his thunder.\r\n\r\nAn extreme offshoot of thrash metal and death metal, black metal was generally derided by the mainstream and criticised for its misogyny, racism, homophobia, and glamorisation of suicide. It was also seen as both anti-semitic and anti-Christian, and a number of practitioners have been accused of neo-Nazism and hate speech. The subgenre reached the height of its artistic expression in Norway in the late 80s and early 90s, with bands such as Mayhem, Darkthrone, Immortal, Emperor, and Gorgoroth, whilst practitioners adopted pseudonyms such as Hellhammer, Demonaz Doom Occulta, Occultus, Nocturno Culto, Samoth, Faust, and Satyr. Often wearing \"_corpse paint_\" and flaunting Satanic iconography, musical integrity was paramount for the movement, and to remain a true black metaller, one couldn't court mainstream success; the underground element of the culture was central to the sense of authenticity and danger it fostered (during an argument between Euronymous and Varg, Euronymous states, \"_it has to sell, otherwise what are we doing here?_\", an attitude utterly alien to Varg). \u00c5kerlund, who has directed music videos for everybody from The Prodigy (\"Smack My Bitch Up\") to Madonna (\"Ray of Light\") to Rammstein (\"Mein Land\") to Beyonc\u00e9 (\"Hold Up\"), was himself briefly a part of the scene, and a founding member of Bathory. Calling the film \"_made-up crap_\", Vikernes called his depiction \"_character murder_\", objecting to being portrayed as a \"_power-hungry lunatic_\". He was especially aghast at being played by \"_a fat Jewish actor_\".\r\n\r\nOne of the film's most salient aspects is that black metal wasn't simply a genre of music; it was a way of life, an outlet for the anti-establishment views of people who aimed much of their vitriol at Christianity, in the same way punk subculture targeted the conservativism of politicians such as Maggie Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. However, \u00c5kerlund isn't especially interested in valorising the movement. There are moments of success and euphoria, of course, but the majority of the film is designed to chip away at the image of black metallers as evil incarnate. In this sense, the story is primarily about image and marketing. Euronymous isn't an especially gifted musician, but he is an extremely astute businessman, particularly when it comes to selling himself, knowing exactly how to cultivate the reputation he wants - some \"evil\" make-up here, a picture of a corpse there, some \"evil\" lyrics here, a \"Hail Satan\" there, and before you know it, the mainstream is in a frenzy and doing his work for him. Proto-outrage culture, if you will. Whereas some of the others saw evil in a literal sense, he saw it in terms of branding potential. Nowhere is this clearer than when he finds Dead's body, taking pictures which he would subsequently use to bolster the band's reputation as extreme.\r\n\r\nIt's in relation to this aspect of black metal, the manufactured nature of their evil, that much of the film's ironic humour is to be found. Euronymous and Dead's answering machine message is a growled, \"_we can't come to the phone right now because we're too busy sacrificing children_\". Describing their style, Euronymous proudly declares, \"_when people hear our music, we want them to commit suicide._\" Later on, he admits, \"_all this evil and dark crap was supposed to be fun._\" The night one black metaller leaves his house to go murder somebody, his mum offers to make him spaghetti. One member of Mayhem is shown riding a pushbike. Euronymous has to borrow his parents' car to get anywhere (it's difficult to be taken seriously as a purveyor of terror when you're in your dad's Volvo) and have his kid sister dye his hair jet-black. An impassioned speech about the nature of black metal is interrupted by someone being told their kebab is ready. Varg records the songs \"Feeble Screams From Forests Unknown\" and \"Black Spell Of Destruction\" (both 1991) with money borrowed from his mother. Euronymous complains of Christianity, \"_they're oppressing us with their kindness and their goodness_\". And in easily the funniest scene in the film, as Euronymous and Varg wait outside a recording studio, a group of elderly women emerge, with Euronymous taking great pleasure in running up to them and growling, \"_Hail Satan!_\" whilst waving the sign of the horns in their faces. This ironic tone is introduced in the opening moments - the first thing we see is a Norwegian flag, followed by stock footage of the halling and Olav V, whilst Euronymous says in voiceover,\r\n\r\n>_Norway, 1987. A very wealthy and religious country far up in the northern hemisphere. Look how much fun we have on the streets of Oslo on a normal day. And that's our king with his cool top hat. My home country; grey, boring, seal clubbing, and a very high suicide rate._\r\n\r\nWhere the film treats its subjects more seriously is in relation to things such as Dead's self-harming and depression, which ultimately result in his suicide, and the casual misogyny of virtually every member of the movement (it's telling that the first time we see Varg exert any kind of authority, it's in a scene where he forcefully tells (fictional) groupie Ann-Marit (Sky Ferreira) to take off her clothes for him and (an immediately uncomfortable) Euronymous). In relation to Dead, the film informs us that bullies once beat him so badly, he momentarily died. Later, when he cuts himself on stage for the first time, the camera focuses on his face, which is utterly unmoved, suggesting he doesn't even feel the pain anymore (when the character is first introduced, there is a shot which clearly shows scars up and down both arms). As he sprays blood on the crowd, the camera pans over to Euronymous, whose face betrays a mixture of horror and jealousy - he knows, even at this early stage, that he could never be that extreme.\r\n\r\nFrom an aesthetic point of view, two nightmare scenes are especially well edited by Rickard Krantz, whilst P\u00e4r M. Ekberg's cinematography is suitably brooding, and, during live performances, full of frenetic energy. In terms of violence, the film features two murders and one suicide. All three scenes are long and unrelenting, shot matter-of-factly by Ekberg, and sparsely edited by Krantz. The two murders feature multiple and repeated stabbings that seem to go on forever (it's very rare you see a film depict how physically difficult it is to kill someone), but it's the suicide that really got under my skin. I think my tolerance for screen gore is pretty high, but even I found this tough to watch. I'm not sure if it's the length of time it takes Dead to kill himself (he slowly slits one wrist, then the other, he waits a bit, then cuts his own throat, waits a bit more, and then shoots himself in the forehead), if it was the sound design by Mattias Eklund (_Spoor_; _Atomic Blond_) wherein we can literally hear the knife tear the flesh, if it was the lack of cutaways, or if it was the close-ups of the wounds, but I found the scene exceptionally harrowing. Brilliantly done, but harrowing none-the-less.\r\n\r\nAnother aesthetic element worth mentioning is one that will probably prove controversial - the actors all speak in English with their own accents, not a ridiculous cod-English with Scandinavian inflexions. Think Sean Connery in John McTiernan's _The Hunt for Red October_ (1990), Kevin Costner in Kevin Reynolds's _Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves_ (1991), or Tom Cruise in Bryan Singer's _Valkyrie_ (2008). Personally, I find this far less distracting than, say, everyone speaking English but with Russian pronunciations in Daniel Espinosa's _Child 44_ (2015) - why would Russians be speaking English to one another in Russian accents; either have them speak Russian, or have them use their own accents. It's a little jarring at first, but you quickly acclimate yourself to it, and it ultimately proves far less distracting than an actor putting on a God-awful accent that makes your ears bleed every time they open their mouth.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, some will definitely take issue with how ironically the film approaches the material. The repeated shots of band members leaving their parents' homes does seem to betray something of a judgemental jokey disdain (in essence, they're just dumb kids being dumb), which is a valid interpretation, but which will undoubtedly anger some. Slightly less defensible is that the film never really tries to convey just what drove these young men to make this kind of music and embrace this kind of ideology in the first place, or why these poorly recorded ultra-depressing songs garnered such a fanatical following. Why does Ann-Marit, for example, want to hang out with Mayhem so much? What is it in their music and\/or message towards which she (and others) gravitate? Why was black metal so magnetic in general? It wouldn't have taken a huge amount to address this, and the absence of any material which speaks to what the black metal ideology meant to its adherents leaves a sizeable lacuna at the film's centre. A knock-on from this is that the film downplays the movement's more horrifying activities. The fact that \u00c5kerlund argues they were just dumb kids who let things get out of hand serves to deny them agency in relation to their more heinous crimes; it provides an excuse that isn't justified, and which undercuts the severity of what some of them did. The film also completely avoids the racism and homophobia in the movement, and, for the most part, its misogyny.\r\n\r\nIn one respect, _Lords of Chaos_ is an act of de-mythologizing; it attempts to show that this frightening group of cannibalistic, vampiric, Satan-worshipping church burners and murderers were really just a collection of middle-class kids with a serious case of _ennui_. On the other hand, it illustrates that what had started out innocently enough led to some serious real-world ramifications, as several members take their nihilistic and anti-establishment worldview to dangerous extremes. Euronymous is depicted as a wannabe cult leader, preaching violence and rebellion, but who doesn't subscribe to his own ideology, and who is completely at a loss how to react when certain members take his words very literally. _Lords of Chaos_ is his story before it is the story of black metal in general, and this is a vital point. Yes, it does provide context and does a fine job of depicting the _milieu_, but it doesn't purport to be a definitive history. Unafraid to show that the movement was built on a flimsy and ill-defined foundation of paganism, Satanism, and Nazism, \u00c5kerlund suggests much of the underpinning ideology is convoluted nonsense. For adherents, this will probably prove offensive. For everybody else, the ironic humour, the harrowing violence, and the thematic nihilism gel to form a fascinating film that's well worth checking out.","id":"5d57404b4bc38b3503270c39","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d57404b4bc38b3503270c39","movie_id":426249}

By way of comparison, think of _Terrence Malick_'s _To the Wonder_ (2012), _Knight of Cups_ (2015), and _Song to Song_ (2017), in which he all-but-abandons plot and character arcs in deference to emotional beats, esoteric voiceover, and metaphysical tone; think of David Lynch's _Mulholland Drive_ (2001), _Inland Empire_ (2006) and _Twin Peaks: The Return_ (2017), his most sustained expressions of cinematic surrealism and fractured identity since _Eraserhead_ (1977); or, in a very different sense, think of Michael Mann's _Miami Vice_ (2006), with its jargon-heavy dialogue and thematic focus on obsessive (male) professionalism, coupled with Mann's continued experimentation with digital photography and expressive _mise en sc\u00e8ne_. One thing these films all have in common is that they unapologetically establish very early on they are playing by their own rules, and if you don't buy in pretty quickly, you won't buy in at all.\r\n\r\nSo too _Loro_; this is Sorrentino at his most Sorrentino-like. Very much a thematic companion piece to _Il divo_ (2008), his examination of seven-time Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, whilst stylistically similar to the Oscar-winning masterpiece _La grande bellezza_ (2013), _Loro_ is more interested in extravagant hedonism and Dionysian excess than the former and more bitingly satirical than the latter. Visually stunning, with a towering central performance from Toni Servillo (working with Sorrentino for the sixth time), some will criticise the film as all style, no substance; some will decry the lack of a strong forward-moving plot; some will take issue with the fact that Sorrentino seems reluctant to condemn Berlusconi outright; some will argue that in attempting to satirise the commodification of the female body, Sorrentino simply reproduces such commodification, as well as legitimising the concomitant male gaze; some will find it too glossy and unrealistic; some will find it vulgar; some will find it sordid; some will regard the aping of Fellini as too on the nose. And there's validity in each position, to one degree or another. In other words, it's very, very Sorrentino!\r\n\r\nWritten with his regular writing partner Umberto Contarello, _Loro_ tells the \"partly fictionalised\" story of Silvio Berlusconi (Servillo) from just after the April 2006 general election (which saw _L'Unione_, the centre-left coalition led by Romano Prodi, narrowly defeat _Casa delle Libert\u00e0_, the centre-right coalition led by Berlusconi) and concluding with the April 2009 L'Aquila earthquake and Berlusconi's return to power. As the film begins, we're introduced to Sergio Morra (Riccardo Scamarcio), a pimp from Taranto. Hoping to ingratiate himself with Berlusconi, Morra heads to Sardinia, and rents a villa bordering Berlusconi's summer residence. Populating it with his escorts, who he encourages to party as much and as publicly as possible, he sits back and waits, knowing Berlusconi won't be able to stay away from so many scantily clad women for long. However, unbeknownst to Morra, Berlusconi's attention is elsewhere. Finding himself in a political position to which he is unaccustomed (leader of the opposition), he is at something of a loss as to how to fill his day. On a more personal level, his marriage to Veronica Lario (Elena Sofia Ricci) is breaking down, despite his best efforts to salvage the relationship. Meanwhile, his old friend, Ennio Doris (also Servillo), points out that due to how tight the 2006 election was (_L'Unione_ took the _Camera dei deputati_ by a margin of .1%), if Berlusconi could persuade six sitting senators to switch to the opposition, Prodi's government would collapse. Meanwhile, Veronica heads to Cambodia, leaving Berlusconi unsupervised at home, and by now he's very aware of who is living next door.\r\n\r\nA controversial film in Italy from the moment of its announcement, Sorrentino was unable to secure funding from his usual financier, Medusa Film, which is co-owned by Berlusconi. Released in Italy in two parts, _Loro 1_ (104 minutes) and _Loro 2_ (100 minutes), the film was released internationally as one piece, running 145 minutes.\r\n\r\nMore formally inventive than any of Sorrentino's previous work, the visual structure of _Loro_ is not entirely dissimilar to that employed by Adam McKay in _The Big Short_ (2015) and _Vice_ (2018), with the cast even breaking into a full musical number at one point. And, as will come as a shock to precisely no one, _Loro_ looks absolutely amazing. There's the gorgeous and vibrant cinematography by Sorrentino regular Luca Bigazzi, rendering Sardinia as a lazy, sun-kissed nirvana bathed in the verdant green of the foliage and the rich blue of the ocean and sky, with the colours in general so vibrant as to make Luca Guadagnino's _Call Me by Your Name_ (2017) seem practically black and white in comparison. The richness of the film's visual aesthetic is helped immeasurably by the luxurious and gaudy production design by Stefania Cella (_What Just Happened?_; _Downsizing_; _White Boy Rick_), the decadent and seductive wardrobe by Carlo Poggioli (_Cold Mountain_; _Van Helsing_; _Divergent_), and the makeup by Maurizio Silvi (_Moulin Rouge!_; _Hannibal Rising_; _Zoolander 2_), hilariously recreating Berlusconi's waxen surgery-enhanced features and permatan, effectively turning Servillo into a human Ken doll.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the film is almost _too_ beautiful. Sorrentino employs such lush, over-the-top beauty because he is satirising soulless elegance (and soulless tack); that which is aesthetically pleasing but metaphysically empty. By all-but drowning the audience in extraordinary, but ultimately meaningless, opulence, could he be accused of recreating and thus partially validating that which he is mocking? Yes, he could, although the counter-argument would be that he's too smart a filmmaker and too consummate an artist to 'accidentally' stumble into legitimising that which he is attempting to satirise. Take, for example, how he employs female nudity, of which there is a huge amount, almost all void of much in the way of narrative justification. On the surface, it's gratuitous nudity-for-nudity's sake. However, the lack of any meaningful rationale for showing such nudity is precisely the point; to show that the characters dispassionately view women as commodities. Every male in the film, and even some of the females (for example, Morra's business partner Tamara (Euridice Axen) and Kira (Kasia Smutniak), an acquaintance of Berlusconi's with whom Morra becomes infatuated) look at the escorts as objects whose bodies are for nothing beyond satisfying the lust of lascivious men and generating profit for their pimps. The sight of so many beautiful young women degrading themselves for lecherous old men leaves a nasty aftertaste, precisely as is intended.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with a bizarre scene depicting a lamb wandering into Berlusconi's villa. After a moment, the air conditioning turns on, and the lamb literally freezes. It's an absurdist scene right out of Franz Kafka, Luis Bu\u00f1uel, or Roy Andersson, and it immediately sets the tone for the film, alerting the audience that this is not going to be a typical warts-and-all biopic; instead, it's going to be surreal and strange, slightly out of sync with the real world. Is Sorrentino saying that the only way one can parse a man such as Berlusconi is by placing him in a reality not quite our own, by fictionalising him and rendering him absurd? Perhaps. However, the film closes by intercutting the L'Aquila earthquake with his return to power; Italy is literally shaking to its core as he regains his authority, and there's little absurdity about this sequence.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting facets of the film is how relatively lenient Sorrentino is \u2013 Berlusconi is not exactly sympathetic, but neither is he what you would call a villain. In this sense, the film reminded me of Oliver Stone's _W._ (2008), in which Stone takes an unexpectedly even-handed approach in his depiction of the presidency of George W. Bush. Part of the reason Berlusconi comes across as not completely reprehensible is because of Toni Servillo. A performer of immense talent, Servillo is too intelligent and nuanced to allow any part lapse into caricature, and so, even when Berlusconi is at his most irredeemable, Servillo never allows us to forget there is a soul in there somewhere, however well-hidden it may be. A good example is a scene showing us Berlusconi at his most licentious, as he attempts to seduce Stella (Alice Pagani), a quiet and somewhat withdrawn young escort. As Servillo plays it, the scene is more pathetic than anything else; a sad old man unable to see how shameful his behaviour really is.\r\n\r\nServillo's Berlusconi remains always a bully, but he's also a man horrified by the fact that he's growing old, and his refusal to go gently into that good night is mixed with the occasional bout of regret. Servillo also lets us see just how much it genuinely hurts Berlusconi when his marriage breaks down, as he is still desperately in love with Veronica, despite the fact that his behaviour has led her to despise him. As he realises her mind is not for changing, he is able to get her to admit that she still loves him. However, she also says that he is not the same man she married, telling him, \"_you never reveal yourself. You are one uninterrupted performance._\" Tellingly, he isn't quite sure how to respond to this, and it's a legitimately painful moment. In this sense, the film essentially challenges the audience not to hate the man, despite his many reprehensible actions and characteristics. On a more superficial level, Servillo perfectly captures Berlusconi's ridiculous grin, his obsession with opulence, his disdain for etiquette, and his ability to spin anything to make himself look good, irrespective of the facts clearly showing that he's lying (and yes, it's supposed to remind us of a certain pathological liar currently living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW).\r\n\r\nAnd although the film does feature Noemi Letizia (Pasqualina Sanna), it ends prior to the commencement of the alleged \"bunga bunga\" parties (supposedly mass orgies involving up to 20 women, who would perform African sexual rituals with Berlusconi). The first of these was not until February 2010, so there's also no Ruby Rubacuori, and the film addresses little that would later be cited in Berlusconi's 2013 trial for soliciting an underage prostitute.\r\n\r\nThematically, a major issue is acquisition; of capital, of property, of power, of influence, of anything. The driving force of so many of the characters (especially people like Morra, Tamara, and Kira) is simply \"more\". These are people who can literally never be satisfied. Indeed, on three separate occasions, a character says, \"_Having it all isn't enough_\". Another theme is the normalisation of decadence, a theme conveyed primarily by how Sorrentino shoots certain scenes. For example, we see cocaine being consumed so often that by the time we get to the last half-hour or so, we don't even register it anymore. This isn't the case of a filmmaker accidentally overexposing a trope. Rather, overexposure _is_ the trope; something like this should never be normalised, yet in this environment it most certainly is.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of decadence, the first half of the film is so full of sensationalist hedonism as to make the _milieu_ of _La grande bellezza_ look Puritan by comparison. Cocaine being snorted off escorts' bodies is a recurring motif, and naked or near-naked women are in the background so often you don't even see them after a while. In one brilliantly staged scene, as Morra and his escorts are walking through Rome, a garbage truck crashes and explodes, throwing its contents into the air before it rains down on the escorts. However, just as the garbage reaches them, the film cuts to a pool party in Morra's Sardinian villa, and instead of garbage falling from the sky, the escorts are instead in the middle of a shower of ecstasy tablets. Make of that metaphor what you will.\r\n\r\nThe _milieu_ is almost entirely devoid of morality; drugs are universal; sex is transactional; politicians are corrupt, petty, and venal egotists; innocence is something no one even remembers. Berlusconi's own attitude to holding public office is brilliantly dramatised in arguably the film's best scene. After deciding to return to politics, he tests himself to see whether he still has \"it.\" Bearing in mind that he made his fortune and reputation successfully selling real estate in a hostile buyers' market, he randomly cold-calls a gloomy housewife and proceeds to sell her a luxury apartment that he readily admits hasn't even been built yet. It's a Servillo acting masterclass, and it's very funny, but it's also very telling - rather than brushing up on policy, or trying to clean his act up, this is how he prepares himself to attempt to topple the sitting government.\r\n\r\nHowever, for all its strengths, _Loro_ is nowhere near the quality of Sorrentino's recent English-language output - _This Must Be The Place_ (2011), the horrifically underrated _Youth_ (2015), and the glorious _The Young Pope_ (2016), whilst it pales in comparison to its closest stylistic precursor, _La grande bellezza_ (for my money one of the top twenty films of the century, thus far). Sure, everything that makes a film a \"Sorrentino film\" is present and accounted for (as I said in the introduction, this is perhaps the most quintessential Sorrentino film yet) - there's the visual opulence, the hedonistic _milieu_, the undercurrent of corruption and greed, the casual sexuality. However, unlike, say, _La grande bellezza_ or _The Young Pope_, in _Loro_, the visual panache can often come across as an end unto itself, rather than serving the story and\/or themes.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem, however, is that structurally, the international cut is unable to escape the bifurcated narrative design of the original. Very much a film of two halves, the first half focuses on Morra and a group of politicians and hangers-on (the eponymous \"loro\"), as they position themselves within Berlusconi's orbit, and the second focuses more tightly on Berlusconi himself (who doesn't actually appear on screen for almost an hour), especially his relationship with Veronica, and his attempts to once again become prime minister, with the film rarely leaving his Sardinian estate. And as you can probably imagine, the transition is not entirely smooth, especially insofar as entire subplots are abandoned without explication or resolution, and seemingly important characters fade into the background and often disappear (Morra himself features in only a couple of scenes in the second half), which does have the effect of making the whole thing feel a little scattershot at times.\r\n\r\nThat said, however, this is still Sorrentino, so no matter the problems, there's always going to be much to admire. He's a master _auteur_ who always has something fascinating to say, and here turning his attention to perhaps Italy's most notorious post-War politician, he gets plenty of inspired mileage out of the tawdry subject matter. Very much a chronicler of the darkness behind Italy's sparkle, Sorrentino suggests that Berlusconi, and men like him, are driven by vanity and a desire for power as its own reward. Yes, the storyline is a little slack, and, yes, it somewhat unexpectedly finds humanity in the man, and yes, it's Sorrentino's weakest film for a while. But it's also a Sorrentino film. And for that, if nothing else, it's worth a look.","id":"5d5f1d19f263ba2ba594b4c7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d5f1d19f263ba2ba594b4c7","movie_id":541660}

Algos means \"suffering.\" So nostalgia is the suffering caused by an unappeased yearning to return._\r\n\r\n- Milan Kundera; _Ignorance_ (2000)\r\n\r\nMarketed in China as a romance, _\u5730\u7403\u6700\u5f8c\u7684\u591c\u665a_ [lit. trans. _Last Evenings on Earth_] was released on December 31, 2018, earning an unexpected $38 million at the Chinese box office on its first night. However, when the young couples looking forward to a mainstream romantic date movie to ring in the New Year found themselves watching a cryptic 150-minute labyrinthine meditation on the nature of memory, with the niceties of plot and character development very much subservient to mood, tone, and formal experimentation, they reacted with bemusement, to put it mildly. January 1 saw a flurry of angry social media posts, with \"can't understand _Last Evenings on Earth_\" trending, and the forums of ticket merchant Maoyan flooded with negative reviews, earning the film an audience rating of 2.8\/10. Needless to say, business dropped off somewhat thereafter, and when the film's theatrical run concluded three weeks later, it had earned a total of $41 million, meaning that roughly 93% of its box office was earned on opening night.\r\n\r\nAnd to be fair, I can understand the confusion and belligerency. Released in English-language markets as _Long Day's Journey Into Night_, the film is the love child of Andrei Tarkovsky and Wong Kar-wai, garnished with a truly batshit insane salad-dressing made up of an unholy mixture of filmmakers such as Peter Greenaway, David Lynch, Guy Maddin, and Leos Carax, playwrights Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter, poet Paul Celan, painters Marc Chagall, Francis Bacon, and Jackson Pollack, and novelists Franz Kafka, Marcel Proust, and Patrick Modiano; not exactly a compendium of the most accessible artists of all time. As unconcerned with formal conventionality as it is with narrative resolution, this is an art-house movie through and through, an esoteric puzzle made up of two distinct parts. Whilst the 2D first half is a measured, but reasonably conventional albeit non-linear noir, the second is composed of an unbroken 50-minute 3D shot that's as aesthetically audacious as it is narratively elliptical, and I honestly do feel for those bewildered Chinese audiences expecting to ring in the New Year with a gently romantic film. Because it most certainly isn't that. The second feature from 30-year-old self-educated writer\/director Bi Gan, _Long Day's Journey_ is aggressively enigmatic, and the absence of character arcs, the formal daring, the languorous pacing, and the resistance to anything approaching definitive conclusions, will undoubtedly see many western audiences reacting similarly to their Chinese counterparts \u2013 equal parts bafflement and infuriation. However, if you can get past such issues and go with the film on its own terms, you'll find a fascinatingly esoteric examination of the protean nature of memory, a film that in both form and content seems to belie its writer\/director's youth and relative inexperience.\r\n\r\n_Long Day's Journey_ tells the story of moody loner Luo Hongwu (Huang Jue), a man haunted by his past. In 2000, he met and had a brief but memorable relationship with the mysterious Wan Qiwen (T\u0101ng W\u00e9i), whom he has never been able to forget. When he returns to his home city of Kaili to bury his father, he finds himself attempting to track down Qiwen, as the story of their relationship is told via flashbacks, revealing her involvement with karaoke-loving gangster Zuo Hongyuan (Chen Yongzhong) and Luo's own unresolved trauma concerning the murder of his friend Wildcat (Li H\u00f3ngq\u00ed). However, it soon becomes apparent that just because Lou remembers a thing doesn't necessarily mean that that thing happened. When his search leads him to a dingy movie theatre, he puts on a pair of 3D glasses and falls asleep, finding himself in an abandoned mine from which his only hope of escape is to beat a young version of Wildcat (Feiyang Luo) at ping pong. The rest of the film takes place in his dream world. Or in the 3D movie playing in the theatre. Or in an amalgamation of both. Or in something else entirely.\r\n\r\n_Long Day's Journey_'s biggest selling point is unquestionably the aesthetically audacious second hour. The film starts as a garden variety noir \u2013 the world-weary voiceover, the femme fatale revealed through flashbacks, smoke-filled rooms, the back alley meetings, the dangerous gangster, the troubled friend, the darkly fatalistic tone. There's even a clue written on the back of a photo. However, all of these genre markers are jettisoned when Luo enters the cinema, putting on his 3D glasses, just as the audience is prompted to do likewise. The film's title card then appears onscreen for the first time (a full 70 minutes in), and the movie adopts a far more elliptical and esoteric stance than the investigative noir structure of the first half.\r\n\r\nUnlike 'single-take' films such as Gaspar No\u00e9's _Climax_ (2018), Erik Poppe's _Ut\u00f8ya 22. Juli_ (2018), and Sam Mendes's _1917_ (2019), which use long-takes and 'hidden' edits to give the effect of a single-shot, the second half of Long Day's Journey follows films such as Alexander Sokurov's _Russkij Kovcheg_ (2002) and Sebastian Schipper's _Victoria_ (2015) insofar as it was legitimately shot via one single take. And not only that, but it's a complex and visually layered shot too, featuring drones, Steadicams, intricate blocking, elaborate external locations with multitudes of people, practical effects, complex interior locations, even a lengthy sequence set on a zip line. Considering the scope, it would be an impressive enough technological accomplishment in 2D, but that it was filmed with bulky 3D cameras is almost unbelievable, and that three cinematographers (Yao Hung-I, Dong Jinsong, and David Chizallet) worked on the project is unsurprising \u2013 Hung-I shot half of the 2D material, Jinsong shot the rest of the 2D material and planned the 3D sequence, whilst Chizallet actually shot the sequence.\r\n\r\nWhat's especially laudable about the sequence, however, is how it never becomes gimmicky. Most movies released in 3D have no real thematic justification for being in 3D, nothing in their content to justify their form, whilst films such as _Victoria_ have no real thematic justification for being single-shots. _Long Day's Journey_, however, justifies both decisions \u2013 the single-shot works in tandem with the 3D to create a vibrant and complex world of depth and vitality, but one that never seems completely real; there's always the sense of an artifice, something highly 'subjective' getting between the audience and the on-screen images, as if we're not seeing things objectively but instead seeing an individual's interpretation of things \u2013 it's reality, but it's mediated reality, with all the subjective distortions that such a thing implies.\r\n\r\nThis is a film about memory, specifically the idea that memory can be deceptive, and may have as much to do with dreams as with objective reality. In this sequence, as memory, reality, and dream seem to blend into one another, with even identity itself dissolving (several of the main actors re-appear in completely different parts), Gan shows us something that approximates a dream as well as anything you're ever likely to experience, outside actually dreaming. Any film can throw something surreal onscreen and call it a dream scene, but _Long Day's Journey_ manages to convey not just the content of a dream, but the illogical _texture_ of a dream. You replace the 3D images with 2D images, or you replace the single-shot with edited content, and you fundamentally lose that texture; the 3D\/single-shot form is as important as James Joyce's removal of punctuation is in creating the impression of a mind on the brink of falling asleep in the last episode of _Ulysses_ \u2013 restore the punctuation, and the interrelatedness of form and content is lost.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of literature, although the film may seem unrelated to Eugene O'Neill's 1941 play (the Chinese title similarly references a short story collection by Roberto Bola\u00f1o), a common theme is memory and the all-consuming power of time. The conventional first half of the film concerns itself not just with memory, but with the imperfect nature of memory, essentially suggesting that obsession is nothing more than a trick of the mind, an attempt to reattain something that may never have existed in the first place (also an important theme in the play). In the film's press notes, Gan explains;\r\n\r\n>_it's a film about memory. After the first part, I wanted the film to take on a different texture. In fact, for me, 3D is simply a texture. Like a mirror that turns our memories into tactile sensations. It's just a three-dimensional representation of space. But I believe this three-dimensional feeling recalls that of our recollections of the past. Much more than 2D, anyway. 3D images are fake, but they resemble our memories much more closely._\r\n\r\nIndeed, it's worth noting that the most recurrent visual motif in the film is that of reflection \u2013 not just in mirrors, but so too in puddles, which act as slightly more distorted (subjective?) versions of the relatively perfect reflection one gets from a mirror. So even here, one can see that Gan is examining the distortions of memory and the fault line between objectivity and subjectivity.\r\n\r\nAll of which will probably go some way to telling you whether or not you're likely to enjoy _Long Day's Journey_. Make no mistake, this is an esoteric film that isn't especially interested in plot or character, and which uses form to explore complex issues such as memory, subjectivity, and obsession. It's rarely emotionally engaging in a conventional sense and the minimalist plot can result in some rather glib moments. The storyline is elliptical, the characters archetypal, the themes subtle, and, all things considered, the very aspects which one person will find transformative, will completely alienate another. You either embrace the emphasis on mood and tone, or you fight it, trying to find a linear narrative through-line. Personally, I loved its formal daring and admired Gan's confidence and the singularity of his vision, but at the same time, I found each section outstayed it's welcome a little, and felt the first half could lose a good 15 minutes, and the second around 10 or so. Gan also walks a very fine line between emotional detachment and emotional alienation, and it's a line he crosses a couple of times. Nevertheless, this is an awe-inspiring technical achievement, an ultra-rare example of a film which perfectly matches form to content, and a fascinating puzzle that trades in the undefinable nuances of memory. If you have the patience to work with it, the rewards are many.","id":"5e1a776f1d820f0017268f7b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e1a776f1d820f0017268f7b","movie_id":486898}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"_Lords of Chaos_ is not a Mayhem biopic. If you're looking for that, or if you're looking for a film about the rise of Black Metal in Norway, look entirely elsewhere. This is - at its surface - basically just a film about Euronymous and his relationship with Dead, and then with Varg. But it's really about \"edge\". About the kvlt of black metal that was arguably more vital to its identity than the actual music. About evil for evil's sake alone. This brutality that from the outside looking in is almost as cartoonish as it is despicable. \r\n\r\nI was born too late to be in the real thick of the black metal scene at its peak (and living in the Southern Hemisphere didn't help much either), but when I was coming up in the 2000s, the black metal scene might not have been thriving, but it was there, and I was a part of it. Edginess took precedence over everything else. It was a huge part of my identity, and it was the entire identity of some of the people I spent my time with. We never killed anyone, of course, but it got dark, and the music did honestly take a backseat to that edginess. _Lords of Chaos_ does the same. The music takes a backseat. _Lords of Chaos_ is so not about Mayhem in fact, that I honestly can't remember if Hellhammer, (garbage human, strong contender for world's best living drummer, and member of Mayhem for over 30 cumulative years) ever even actually got a line in this thing. \r\n\r\nI remember being young, and getting sick of proving myself to people whose whole idea of what made a black metal band count as \"trve\" enough was the fact that I'd never listened to them. Eventually, I told one such a fellow that the best black metal band in history was Twisted Sister, and then he never bothered trying to \"outrank\" my dedication to black metal again. What would be the point at that stage? _Lords of Chaos_ seems to view black metal in pretty much the same way. Twisted Sister could be the best black metal band in history for all that _Lords of Chaos_ actually displays about the subject.\r\n\r\nBut after all that, you know why I still liked _Lords of Chaos_? Maybe some of it was just nostalgia, but for the most part, it's that there was actual characters in it. Sure the characters were, to a man, all assholes. And they may not have strongly resembled the people they were based on (except for the asshole part, that seems fair). But I was still invested in them. It wasn't just a mad rush to get from one notable point in a band's history to the next. There were people in it who interacted with each other. And that makes this the best musical biopic I've seen in years (despite not actually being one.)\r\n\r\n70%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_","id":"5e86c6baaf58cb0015e234a7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e86c6baaf58cb0015e234a7","movie_id":426249}

{"author":"trineo03","content":"First of all, just like in the last movie the acting in this film is excellent but with a few exceptions. Eddie Redmayne was still excellent as Newt but I think he did a better job in the first film. Same thing with Dan Fogler who didn\u2019t seem as funny but useless and could have just been written out of this film. But I did really like Jude Law as a young Dumbledore and Joshua Shea who plays young Newt. Joshua played younger Newt so well that he actually looked like a younger version of Eddie. Jude Law brought the same kind of attitude towards Dumbledore that we all know and love. The special effects and set designs still looked marvellous. The creatures special effects just like last time were great and looked like if we saw them in real life that\u2019s what they would look like. The sets looked directly like they got taken directly out of a history book. Now with this film being a sequel, you would think they would fix the problems they had in the last film but for this one, they didn\u2018t. The main thing that bugged me was Johnny Depp. He didn\u2019t do a good job of playing the main villain. It could be because of the writing or just because of his acting. Next is all of the subplots. I counted there are around four of them. But seeing how I couldn\u2019t really figure out the main plot one of those subplots could have been the main plot. The last thing is the pacing in this film. Some scenes just seemed like the plot stopped for this one scene that could have just been taken out. The entire film felt really slow and only in the action scenes did it seem to pick up. At least the music was good. In the end, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald just seemed like a cash grab film.

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_An extraordinarily lazy adaptation_**\r\n\r\n> _With school turning out more runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers, grabbers, snatchers, fliers, and swimmers instead of examiners, critics, knowers, and imaginative creators, the word 'intellectual,' of course, became the swear word it deserved to be. You always dread the unfamiliar. Surely you remember the boy in your own school class who was exceptionally 'bright,' did most of the reciting and answering while the others sat like so many leaden idols, hating him. And wasn't it this bright boy you selected and tortured after hours? Of course it was__. We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone made equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are happy, for there are no mountains to make them cower, to judge themselves again. So! A book is a loaded gun in the house next door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach man's mind. Who knows who might be the target of the well-read man?_\r\n\r\n- Ray Bradbury; _Fahrenheit 451_ (1954)\r\n\r\nI don't do remakes. They're a cancer of the industry. Where I am more flexible, however, is in adaptations of novels that have already been adapted. After all, my all-time favourite film falls into this category (Terrence Malick's _The Thin Red Line_ (1998) was the second adaptation of James Jones's novel). _Fahrenheit 451_ is also a second adaptation; in this case, of Ray Bradbury's 1953 novel, and, for all intents and purposes, it's a misfire. Bradbury himself has said the novel is not about censorship, as is often assumed, but was written in response to the Second Red Scare and the rise of McCarthyism. More specifically, it's a treatise on the dangers of an illiterate society unquestionably accepting the word of a monopolising centralised mass media.\r\n\r\nAdapted for the screen and directed by Ramin Bahrani (_99 Homes_), the film is set at an unspecified point in the future, after a second civil war has been fought. All aspects of society are rigidly controlled by the Ministey, an authoritarian government that believes unhappiness, mental illness, and difference of opinion come from unregulated reading. As such, all books have been banned, although simplified and edited Ministry-approved editions of texts such as the Bible, Herman Melville's _Moby Dick, or, the Whale_ (1851) and Virginia Woolf's _To the Lighthouse_ (1927) are available on the internet (known as \"the 9\"). Special units of \"firemen\" are tasked with locating and burning any remaining books, and estimates suggest that within 20-30 years, books will have become completely extinct. The film follows two such firemen; Cpt. John Beatty (Michael Shannon), the veteran and somewhat disillusioned mentor of Guy Montag (Michael B. Jordan), an idealistic rookie who believes unquestioningly in the firemen's work. That is until he meets Clarisse McClellan (Sofia Boutella), who educates him as to the real history of the US, the rise of the Ministry, and why they want literature destroyed.\r\n\r\nNow, you'd think that in this age of Trump's fake news and people using Facebook as a news source, something with this subject matter would speak volumes to a contemporary audience. And you'd be right. Unfortunately, this film isn't about sheeple and mass media. Apparently unaware of Bradbury's statements, the filmmakers have focused almost exclusively on censorship. But it falls down in other areas as well. Mildred Montag is absent, hence the theme of addiction to television broadcasting which tells people how and what to think. Additionally, the infrequent and scattered allusions to the importance of literary texts serve to undermine the absolutely essential nature of what the rebels are doing by memorising whole texts. This should be the film's absolutely central statement, but instead, it comes across as a bunch of weirdos being quirky. Jordan plays Montag as a bombastic loudmouth TV personality. Shannon is, well, Shannon. Don't get me wrong, I love the guy. He's an actor of immense talent. But here, he's playing an identical character to the one he played in Guillermo del Toro's _The Shape of Water_ (2017). It's an extraordinarily lazy performance. In fact, everything about the film is lazy. Bahrani's direction is flat and uninspired; the whole thing looks like _Blade Runner_-lite. It's all very conventional and safe, which neither the novel nor Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's 1966 adaptation was. And this conventionality and safety grind against the inherently rebellious subject matter, rendering it less urgent, and hence, less potent.","id":"5cb566d192514108cef35bb3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cb566d192514108cef35bb3","movie_id":401905}
{"author":"geekr","content":"_By JD Phillips, geekr.org_\r\n\r\nThe Harry Potter movies are great but one of the main flaws of the original franchise was the struggle the films had condensing the lengthy novels into movies under three hours. Despite the Fantastic Beasts sequel not being based on a book, it still somehow feels like its stressing to condense a five hundred page book into a smaller narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe movie runs from scenario to scenario so quickly that it\u2019s hard to remember what all happened in its muddled story. That\u2019s not to say the film is terrible at all, surprisingly. For a movie that has serious pacing problems throughout and has more interest in setting up sequels than it is at finding a memorable plot of its own, it\u2019s actually very entertaining.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe returning cast members are all back and while none leave quite the impression they did before they\u2019re all still entertaining in their own way. Newt is back but the movie doesn\u2019t seem nearly as interested in him and his magical monsters than it is with all of the new elements. Redmayne is still terrific in the role, however, and makes the character much more interesting than the script does by itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nJacob and Tina are back as well though both of their stories are shelved for most of the film and completely forgotten in the final moments.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe biggest surprise though is that Queenie gets the best arc of any character in the movie. She was one of the more interesting characters in the original and while many of the twists in the film fall flat, the one involving her character was my favorite moment of the entire movie. I\u2019m more excited to see her story resolved than I am most of the other elements.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone who has seen the trailers that the new characters kind of take over the film from the returning players. Jude Law and Johnny Depp\u2019s Dumbledore and Grindelwald are what this film is more focused on than any other plot element.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth veteran actors shine so much that the movie loses energy when they aren\u2019t on screen. Law effortlessly settles into Dumbledore\u2019s twinkly-eyed wise, yet manipulative schtick.\r\n\r\n\r\nDepp also kills it as Grindelwald. In fact, it pains me to say this because of how much of an ass the actor is in real life, this is the most I\u2019ve liked Depp as a performer since his first time playing Jack Sparrow. He avoids most of the oddball antics he\u2019s been milking for so many years and delivers a subdued, terrifying performance as Grindelwald. He more than holds his own against Ralph Fiennes, which is saying something.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther new players are a mixed bag. Zoe Kravitz\u2019s Leta Lastrange is an interesting character but none of the others really stand out. Newt\u2019s brother Theseus is a particularly big missed opportunity. The film never adequately explains what caused the rivalry between the two Scamanders and it all gets resolved before there\u2019s a chance to go into it more. Claudia Kim\u2019s Nagini may have caused a big stir when she was announced in one of the trailers but very little is actually done with her character. It feels more like a stunt than anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe biggest stunt comes from the big reveal in the end featuring Ezra Miller\u2019s Credence. There\u2019s a huge twist that not only breaks established history but feels extremely forced. For one, the movie never really explains how Credence came back to life in the first place. It feels like Ezra Miller became a bigger commodity for DC since he is the Flash so now the franchise is committing more to him than initially intended. There was no hint at all in the first movie that he was secretly connected to existing characters in a big way, so it seems out of left field. Regardless, I love Ezra Miller and hope the twist gets him better material in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe movie doesn\u2019t feel much like a Fantastic Beasts franchise anymore but when it does focus on its titular magical creatures, it really shines. The design and concept of the creatures lead to some of the best visuals of the entire Harry Potter pantheon. In fact, it feels like a real shame that we can\u2019t get a smaller franchise that is just about Newt\u2019s magical zoological adventures. The quieter moments of the movies where Newt is just connecting with a magical animal on its own terms are truly beautiful. Unfortunately, these moments get overtaken by the larger story around them.\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel like this franchise is straining to be two different franchises at the same time. It would almost make more sense to separate them into a smaller scale \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d franchise and a larger scale \u201cCrimes of Grindelwald\u201d franchise. This mishmash of different ideas is feeling a little too much like the Hobbit films.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomehow though, despite all of the messiness of the movie\u2019s screenplay, I still found myself entertained throughout. While it may never hit the heights of its legendary predecessors, this film easily proves that the Wizarding World still has lots of magic left. Maybe the executives at Warner Bros should consider other avenues like television or other films so that Newt\u2019s film series doesn\u2019t carry the weight of one of the most magical film series ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cFantastic Beasts: Crimes of Grindelwald\u201d may not rise to the levels one would hope for, it still proves itself to be worth your time, if even just for one viewing.\r\n\r\n\r\n**7.0**","id":"5bf42ec6c3a36818a30a7175","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bf42ec6c3a36818a30a7175","movie_id":338952}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***A superior and realistic medieval film***\r\n\r\n\u201cOutlaw King\u201d (2018) is the sequel to the events shown in \u201cBraveheart\u201d (1995). The story begins in 1304 during the last year of William Wallace\u2019s life. After Wallace is drawn-and-quartered, Robert the Bruce (Chris Pine) takes up the torch for Scotland\u2019s war of independence over England. Disregarding the excellent epilogue, the movie ends with the Battle of Loudoun Hill in 1307 where Robert the Bruce takes on a 3000-man English force with only 600 Scots.\r\n\r\n\"Outlaw King\" is actually better than the overrated \u201cBraveheart\u201d: Chris Pine is an all-around superior protagonist to Gibson; Florence Pugh is more beautiful compared to Sophie Marceau (or Catherine McCormack) in a petite, curvy way; not to mention she\u2019s a more interesting character; the locations are better (even though the locations in \"Braveheart\" are excellent); the music edges out the score to \"Braveheart\"; the movie's more streamlined and consistent; and the film's all-around more compelling and realistic.\r\n\r\nTrue, \"Outlaw King\" doesn't top Patrick McGoohan's delightfully diabolic portrayal of the pompous Longshanks nor does it have the superb defenestration sequence. But it lacks the sluggish start of \"Braveheart\" (the opening 25 minutes); the eye-rolling betrayal scene; the equally eye-rolling episode where Wallace rides into a noble's bed chamber on a freakin' horse and easily escapes (Why Sure!); and, lastly, the overlong and dull execution sequence in \u201cBraveheart\u201d wherein the Christ symbolism is laid on too thick.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also more historically accurate in that it doesn't have the Scots wearing kilts or painting their faces, nor does it wrongly have Robert the Bruce betraying Wallace, which never happened (although he initially disowned him publicly, obviously for political reasons, he secretly supported his war effort and openly admitted it later).\r\n\r\nWhile \u201cOutlaw King\u201d is more historically accurate, it has its own less significant inaccuracies: Elizabeth & Majorie actually escaped Kildrummy Castle, along with Robert\u2019s sisters, but were found by Edward\u2019s men shortly later; Edward II (Billy Howle) wasn't even at the Battle of Loudoun Hill so, naturally, the duel with Edward II never happened; actually, Edward I (Stephen Dillane) was not yet dead when this battle was fought in 1307 so his son was not yet crowned; Queen Elizabeth wasn't put in a cage, but Robert\u2019s sister was; the English were already familiar with the Scottish hedgehog formation by the time of Loudoun Hill and, in fact, destroyed this formation with arrows nine years earlier at Falkirk; Elizabeth was held in captivity for over seven years before Robert could negotiate her return in 1314 after his great victory at the Battle of Bannockburn (the movie makes it seem much shorter).\r\n\r\nClosing word: If you like realistic medieval flicks like the excellent \u201cTristan + Isolde\u201d (2006) be sure to check out \u201cOutlaw King.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 1 minute and was shot mostly in Scotland, but also England.

Yes, I could have done without the little bits of film clips they threw in repeatedly: the marble or whatever it was rolling on the floor, the red scarf, and so on. There was no explanation that I could see and perhaps deserved to be on the cutting room floor, so to speak. And the ending was a bit too ambiguous for me, which probably was what they were aiming for, so congratulations to them on that front.\r\n\r\nThe question of suicide vs. homicide reminds me of when I took philosophy classes in college and noticed how a few leading philosophers in the early days of science committed suicide, whether because they were addressing questions no one had thought about before, or uncovering uncomfortable answers, or some other emotional response to the deep investigation into the human condition. And I wonder, do physicists ride the same sort of emotional roller coaster as they delve closer to answers to the big questions of where the universe came from, or indeed, are there multiple universes?\r\n\r\nSo anyway, I found Out of Blue to be entertaining, intriguing and thought provoking with a subject matter you rarely see explored in theatrical films, so I forgave its cinematic transgressions in other areas.","id":"5e88cb2160b58d0013eb2ffb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e88cb2160b58d0013eb2ffb","movie_id":477016}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_A clich\u00e9d, predictable, tonally inconsistent mess_**\r\n\r\n> _Somewhere in the universe two black holes collide - as heavy as stars, as small as cities, literally black (the complete absence of light) holes (empty hollows). Tethered by gravity, in their final seconds together the black holes course through thousands of revolutions about their eventual point of contact, churning up space and time until they crash and merge into one bigger black hole, an event more powerful than any since the origin of the universe, outputting more than a trillion times the power of a billion Suns. The black hol__es collide in complete darkness. None of the energy exploding from the collision comes out as light. No telescope will ever see the event._\r\n\r\n- Janna Levin; _Black Hole Blues and Other Songs from Outer Space_ (2016)\r\n\r\nPart murder-mystery, part esoteric cosmological rumination, part metaphysical neo-noir, Carol Morley's _Out of Blue_ is a complete shambles. That this is so gives me no pleasure at all, as I'm a big fan of both _Dreams of a Life_ (2011) and _The Falling_ (2014). _Dreams_, in particular, was a seismic gut-punch of a movie, beautifully made, and thoroughly sobering. I saw Morley do Q&As for both films at the Dublin International Film Festival, and I've always found her to be articulate and insightful, so I was really looking forward to _Out of Blue_. Loosely based on Martin Amis's 1997 novel _Night Train_, the film wears its influences very much on its sleeve, primarily Nicolas Roeg (whose son, Luc serves as a producer) and David Lynch. Obviously designed as a puzzle, the story only ever seems half-formed, as if we're seeing it through gauze. Mixing tones, themes, and styles, the film tries to be many things at once, but ultimately ends up being none of them; far too simplistic to be a fully realised examination of the nature of existence, far too predictable to be a whodunnit, far too clich\u00e9d to be a noir.\r\n\r\nSet in New Orleans in an unspecified time period, the film begins with rising astrophysicist Jennifer Rockwell (Mamie Gummer), an expert on black holes and a proponent of the multiverse theory, giving a lecture on how humans are \"_made of stardust_\". The following morning, her body is found in the observatory in which she worked, shot three times. Homicide detective Mike Hoolihan (Patricia Clarkson), a recovering alcoholic who lives for the job, lands the case. As she starts investigating, she learns that Jennifer had become increasingly disturbed by the nature of her research into black holes. The daughter of Vietnam War veteran and wealthy businessman, Colonel Tom Rockwell (James Caan), and his wife, Miriam (Jacki Weaver), Jennifer had a fraught relationship with her parents, and many of her colleagues. Soon, Hoolihan has two main suspects; Jennifer's shifty and seemingly perpetually nervous boss, Professor Ian Strammi (Toby Jones) and her boyfriend\/colleague, Duncan Reynolds (Jonathan Majors), who, upon finding out that Jennifer is dead, doesn't ask \"how\" or \"when\", but \"why\". The investigation will ultimately involve quantum mechanics, dark matter, string theory, Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, and the double-slit experiment, as well as forcing Hoolihan to confront a childhood trauma she has repressed, of which the murder seems to be evoking flashbacks, and an unsolved serial killer case from the 1970s; the \".38 Killer\", who always killed women that looked a lot like Jennifer.\r\n\r\nI haven't read the Amis novel on which the film is based, so I don't know if Morley has been successful in transplanting the tone to film, but irrespective of that, _Out of Blue_ attempts to connect the relative mundanity of human suffering to the vast unknowable mysteries of the universe. On the surface, this is quite similar to what Terrence Malick does in _The Tree of Life_ (2011). However, whereas Malick was essentially making the point that the birth of a galaxy is analogous with the birth of a child and that spirituality and science are not mutually exclusive, Morley sets our existence as a random and infinitesimal fragment in the impossible-to-conceive-of enormity of the universe.\r\n\r\nAlthough ostensibly set in a realistic _milieu_, the film has an undercurrent of Lynchian weirdness that seems to place it just ever so slightly outside normality, with Morley intermixing her larger metaphysical concerns with a mundane whodunnit. To be fair, she does give us clues that the murder investigation is not where the audience should be focused; for example, when Hoolihan first arrives at the crime scene, as a detective is briefing her, the sound fades out and the camera moves away, suggesting the details of the crime are irrelevant. However, this doesn't change the fact that the predictable outcome of the investigation has virtually nothing whatsoever to do with black holes and the multiverse, with the reveal of the killer seemingly overriding the film's more esoteric themes, in a manner which severely undercuts the presentation of those themes. Audiences will be left asking such questions as why is there so much information on Jennifer's research; is it all just an elaborate MacGuffin; is it simply that Morley was unable to find a way to dramatize it, thereby integrating the two strands of the film? The idea is obviously that in searching for the killer, Hoolihan is essentially discovering herself, played out against the backdrop of infinity, but the film never addresses why we should care, as it doesn't actually say anything interesting or significant about the connection between humanity and the strange goings-on of space-time.\r\n\r\nThe quotidian nature of the whodunnit isn't helped by the fact that much of the acting is questionable, which seems unbelievable given the cast. Jackie Weaver appears to be in a completely different film to everyone else; James Caan is simply doing an imitation of John Huston in Roman Pola\u0144ski's _Chinatown_ (1974); Devyn A. Tyler as novice reporter Stella Honey, and Todd Mann and Brad Mann as Jennifer's creepy twin brothers never manage to escape the archetypal noir parameters of the characters they play; Yolanda Ross and Aaron Tveit, as Hoolihan's boss and colleague, respectively, are basically extras; even Patricia Clarkson struggles with breathing life into the material, although it's certainly unfortunate that the film is being released not so long after Karyn Kusama's infinitely superior _Destroyer_ (2018), in which Nicole Kidman gives a similar performance. Much of the problem, however, lies with Morley's script, rather than the actors. Essentially refusing to allow the audience any kind of emotional connection with the characters, Morley instead reduces the performances to shouting and clich\u00e9s. There is one excellent scene in which Hoolihan gets drunk and takes off her clothes onstage at a strip club, and it's excellent because it's the one scene where Clarkson is allowed to engage with the audience at an emotional level, evoking both shock and pity.\r\n\r\nEven the always-excellent Clint Mansell (_Requiem for a Dream_; _Black Swan_; _Filth_) is off his game, with his score failing to provide much in the way of texture or nuance, and occasionally seeming to actively work against what we're seeing. On the other hand, the cinematography by Conrad W. Hall (_Panic Room_; _Olympus Has Fallen_) is excellent, flattening New Orleans in the background, and essentially creating an oppressive and generic geographical location that could be anywhere and is always just out of reach, something which works in tandem with Hoolihan's repressed memories. Hall also does some solid work during the flashbacks to Hoolihan's childhood.\r\n\r\nWith the identity of the killer proving so banal (and just so predictable), the film essentially tasks its metaphysical component with doing all the heavy lifting, and this certainly does seem to be Morley's main concern. However, despite creating a dream-like narrative, always receding from the viewer, Morley can't cut loose of the shackles of genre, with the film's last act falling back on melodrama and unlikely coincidences. Ultimately, we're left with a film where nothing emerges fully formed. If it's really about Hoolihan's existential discovery of self, why is psychological nuance utterly absent? If it's a murder mystery, why is it so predictable and trite? If it's an esoteric rumination about eternity and the universe, why are so many of the necessary components presented in such a simplistic manner? Morley's themes and tones end up tripping over and undermining one another, as she singularly fails to integrate the metaphysical concepts with the murder plot. All in all, it's a misfire for a heretofore promising director.","id":"5d37818b60c51d185982fbf5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d37818b60c51d185982fbf5","movie_id":477016}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Could do with a bit more vitality, but the acting is superb_**\r\n\r\n_I knew there was an old axe down cellar; that is all I knew._\r\n\r\n- Stefani Koorey quoting Lizzie Borden; _The Preliminary Hearing in the Lizzie Borden Case_ (2005)\r\n\r\nWritten by Bryce Kass, and directed by Craig William Macneill, _Lizzie_ is based on the _cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre_ of Lizzie Borden (not to be confused with director Lizzie Borden, or extreme porn star\/director Lizzy Borden), who was accused and subsequently acquitted of the axe murders of her father and stepmother in Fall River, Massachusetts in 1892, a crime that is still officially unsolved. A \"_smash-the-patriarchy_\" (to use a quote from producer and star Chlo\u00eb Sevigny) revisionist take on the material, the film presents Borden as a protofeminist lashing out against patriarchal oppression, homophobia, and sexual assault. Strikingly contemporary in its thematic concerns, this long-time passion project for Sevigny adopts the perspective of the #MeToo movement, proposing a version of events wherein Borden is forced to actively fight back against a lifetime of subjugation. Although the languid pace will alienate many viewers, whilst the liberties it takes with historical facts will irk others, there is much to praise here, including fantastic cinematography, terrific sound design, and flawless acting.\r\n\r\nThe film begins on the day of the murders, August 4, 1892, with Borden (a terrific Chlo\u00eb Sevigny) and housemaid Bridget Sullivan (Kristen Stewart, with a surprisingly convincing Irish accent) working in the garden moments before the bodies are discovered. The narrative then jumps back six months, presenting the family dynamic leading up to the murders. 32-years-old, Borden lives with her domineering father, Andrew (a lecherous Jamey Sheridan); stepmother, Abby (Fiona Shaw), and elder sister, Emma (a criminally underused Kim Dickens). Although the Borden family are prominent members of the community, Andrew is well-known for frugality, refusing to install indoor plumbing or electric lights in the house, believing them \"_extravagances_\". When Sullivan arrives as a live-in housemaid, she and Borden quickly grow close, with Borden attempting to teach her to read and write. Meanwhile, the family is receiving written threats, which Borden believes are connected to her father's land acquisitions. Overhearing Andrew discussing his will with his brother-in-law, John Morse (a slimy Denis O'Hare), Borden is shocked to learn Andrew plans to leave everything to Abby. She later discovers that Andrew is regularly sexually assaulting Sullivan. Eventually, the friendship between Borden and Sullivan turns romantic. However, when Andrew learns of it, he forbids Borden from seeing Sullivan again, something Borden refuses to accept.\r\n\r\nWell-known in the US because of the nursery rhyme, this is actually the first theatrical feature to depict Borden's story, although it has been adapted many times for other mediums; a 1948 Agnes de Mille ballet (_Fall River Legend_), a 1952 Michael Brown musical number (in _New Faces of 1952_), a 1961 Chad Mitchell Trio song (\"Lizzie Borden\"), a 1965 Jack Beeson opera (_Lizzie Borden_), a 1975 Paul Wendkos-directed TV movie (_The Legend of Lizzie Borden_), a 1980 Sharon Pollock play (_Blood Relations_), a 1984 Evan Hunter novel (_Lizzie_), a 1985 Angela Carter short story (\"The Fall River Axe Murders\"), a 1989 Walter Satterthwait novel (_Miss Lizzie_), a 1998 Christopher McGovern and Amy Powers musical (_Lizzie Borden_), and a 2014 Nick Gomez-directed TV movie (_Lizzie Borden Took an Ax_), which led to a limited series (_The Lizzie Borden Chronicles_).\r\n\r\nThe idea for the film originated with Sevigny herself, who brought it to Kass to write as a TV miniseries almost a decade ago. The script was sold to HBO in 2011, but by the time the network decided to move forward with the project, Lifetime's _Lizzie Borden Took an Ax_ was nearing completion. When it spawned _The Lizzie Borden Chronicles_, HBO decided against proceeding with Sevigny's version, so she and Kass purchased the rights back, with Kass adapting the script into a feature film. Pieter Van Hees was hired to direct, but had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts, and was replaced by Macneill. The idea that Borden and Sullivan were lovers is not original to Kass's script, as it was first posited in Hunter's novel. He theorised that Abby had caught the girls having sex, firing Sullivan, and prompting Borden to kill her. When Andrew returned home, Borden confessed, but when he reacted with horror, she also killed him. In later life, Borden was rumoured to be a lesbian, but there was no such speculation about Sullivan, who moved to Butte, Montana and got married. Speaking to the _Huffington Post_ at Sundance 2018, Sevigny revealed she was somewhat disappointed with the finished film, stating\r\n\r\n> _almost everything that was on the page was filmed, and a lot of it didn't make it in the movie. More stuff with me and Fiona Shaw. There was more to the relationships that made them more complicated, and also then informed why Lizzie did it. Now it's a little more vague than what Bryce and I intended._\r\n\r\nOne of most interesting aspects of _Lizzie_ is its narrative structure. Beginning on August 4 just as the (unseen) bodies are discovered, it then flashes back six months to Sullivan's arrival in the Borden house. Building up to August 4 again, this time we are shown the bodies, but we don't see the murders. It then jumps forward to the trial, before once again flashing back to August 4, this time showing us the actual killing. This pseudo-_In Cold Blood_ structure is well-handled for the most part, and has a number of advantages. For one, it allows the film to briefly cover the trial, whilst still employing the murders as a powerful and very effective _d\u00e9nouement_. It also allows the film to build tension around an event which the audience know is coming; by not showing the killings (twice), it has the effect that when the film does actually depict them, they are all the more impactful, placing a suitable cap on what is essentially a story of forbidden love.\r\n\r\nFrom an aesthetic point of view, there's much to praise, with Noah Greenberg's cinematography particularly laudable. Often framing Borden in windows, doorways, and behind railings, whilst also using shallow focus to flatten backgrounds, the sense is that this is a woman living a confined life with little room to move, trapped in her immediate environment. When she and Sullivan first kiss, the camera pulls back to reveal that Andrew is watching them \u2013 even in this moment of release, they are still trapped in his domain. Borden is also often shot off-centre, or reflected in mirrors, particularly as she talks to someone who is on camera. This reinforces the sense that she is trapped, and also feeds into the metaphorical meaning of a later scene where she spreads the shards of a broken mirror outside the door of Sullivan's room to cut her father's feet as he emerges.\r\n\r\nDank and airless, the dimly lit Borden household, outside of which the film rarely ventures, is practically another character in and of itself. Complimenting Elizabeth J. Jones's production design, Greenberg's photography gives rise to a restrictive and claustrophobic _mise en sc\u00e8ne_, which is often lit with only a single candle. However, it's not just how he lights scenes that impresses, it's also how he uses the camera; gliding over important details without hammering home why we should be paying attention (the first time we see the hatchet, for example). Also worth mentioning is how Macneill uses the full-frontal nudity towards the end of the film. Although it will no doubt be accused of gratuitousness by some, it's not only historically accurate, it's shocking, necessary, and makes a powerful statement. God forbid a woman should ever appear naked on screen in a scene _not_ of a sexual nature. Assisting Greenberg's photography and Jones's design is Ruy Garc\u00eda's superb sound design. Of particular note are the floorboards, which creak with the slightest touch, making any kind of clandestine interaction between Borden and Sullivan virtually impossible, and thus contributing to the sense of the household as a prison. Enhancing this even further, is the lack of warmth in the sound design, with footsteps and voices echoing and bouncing off the walls due to the lack of any soft surfaces.\r\n\r\nAs a narrative of female empowerment (albeit of the homicidal variety), most of the film's main themes relate to combating the patriarchal strictures of the Gilded Age, represented primarily by Andrew and John, both loathsome characters in their own way, and Abby, who reinforces patriarchal hypocrisy by unquestioningly submitting to it (she is well aware that Andrew is abusing Sullivan, for example). Talking to the _Huffington Post_, Sevigny explains,\r\n\r\n> _we just really wanted to focus on how she went about finding [her freedom] and how important that was to her and what that meant to her. Whether it was through the relationship with Bridget or ultimately killing her parents for money \u2013 because money equalled freedom then. It still does. I wanted it to be this rousing, smash-the-patriarchy piece and then she gets everything she wants, monetarily \u2013 the capitalist dream._\r\n\r\nPresenting Borden as a woman driven to her wit's end, with few practical options in a society that looks down on her because she is unwed and in her 30s, the film depicts a free-spirit living in a cage, yearning for agency, with the murders presented, at least in part, as her attempt to break free of such restrictions. Suffocated by unquestioned authoritarian patriarchal rule, Borden essentially becomes a protofeminist heroine, actively rebelling against the dominion of men and the women who enable them.\r\n\r\nSullivan, who acts as the audience's moral compass, faces different obstacles, primarily related to economics and social caste. Her place in the ideological and socio-economic hierarchy is manifested in the fact that the family call her Maggie (the generic name given to all Irish servants). However, Borden's insistence on calling her by her actual name (which is historically inaccurate, as Borden also called her Maggie) lays the groundwork for their later emotional connection. Presenting their relationship as an illicit romance which they had to hide because of the moral bigotry of the age, the film very much adopts a #MeToo sensibility, as Borden and Sullivan fight back against self-righteous judgement, unchecked abuse, and socially sanctioned oppression. In this sense, when Borden and Sullivan strip naked before the murders, they aren't just undressing to avoid getting incriminating blood on their clothes, they are repudiating the garments that have restricted them in a physical sense just as much as men have in an ideological sense.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some sizeable problems in all of this. For one, the film lacks energy, and the slow pacing will leave some viewers bored to tears. Additionally, apart from Sevigny and Stewart, the rest of the cast is wasted, particularly Shaw, O'Hare, and Dickens (who only has a handful of scenes, and is virtually a background extra). None of their characters come across as possessing any kind of interiority, instead existing almost exclusively as archetypes; the wicked stepmother, the lecherous uncle, and the ice-cold older sister. Additionally, although he has a lot more to do, Sheridan's Andrew is completely over-the-top, only one or two beats away from a moustache-twirling mega-villain. Perhaps the most egregious problem is that the film seems as war with itself. On the one hand, it wants to be an elegant, period-appropriate tale of women attempting to take their destinies into their own hands in a Victorian society not predisposed to allow such, but on the other, it wants to present a modern story of murder and homosexual women (Patty Jenkins's _Monster_ (2003) in corsets, if you will). At times, such as the superb depiction of the murders themselves, you can feel the modern sensibilities rise to the surface, but for the most part, they're stifled by the hushed austerity of the more muted _milieu_.\r\n\r\n_Lizzie_ tells the story of an initially powerless victim who lashes out and, quite literally, slays patriarchal authority. Just by giving Sevigny the first significant starring role of her career, the film earns a lot of brownie points, as she's been an unsung, but consistently brilliant supporting player since her debut in Larry Clark's _Kids_ (1995). Alongside her, Stewart equates herself very well, even having a decent go at an Irish accent, and the passion between the two, though period-appropriately muted, is completely believable. However, the film's attempts to shoehorn in 21st century moral values doesn't entirely work, primarily because Kass's script tips the scale in Borden's favour to a ridiculous degree \u2013 there's Andrew's over-the-top villainy (not just an authoritarian homophobe, but a rapist to boot), John's creepy intimations, Abby's refusal to stand up for her step-daughters, Borden's protofeminist rhetoric and humanitarianism, the alterations to historical fact to ensure the audience is never in any doubt as to where its sympathies are supposed to lie. Weighing the scales so decisively drains the film of any ambiguity and most of its vitality, presenting a binary story of righteous good slaying hypocritical evil, rather than a murder with many facets. A Gothic tale told from a #MeToo perspective, _Lizzie_ tries to be many things at once \u2013 a revisionist history, a feminist tract, a championing of homosexuality, a murder mystery, a period drama \u2013 but ends up kind of falling into a no man's land between genres. Still though, there are aspects of the film that are enjoyable, if you can look past the enervating pace.","id":"5d1fc21acae17c001132b66e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d1fc21acae17c001132b66e","movie_id":460071}

{"author":"Gill-Man","content":"Damien Chazelle has already proven himself to be one of the freshest new directors of the decade so far. Even after delivering the hard-hitting\u00a0Whiplash\u00a0and the emotionally-wrecking and whimsical\u00a0La La Land, he still knows how to surprise fans of his work, returning to the silver screen with grace. Combining every element of his previous outings that made him a household name, Chazelle makes sure the audience feels every ounce of power that he's thrown into his latest directorial effort. Oddly enough, it's his first foray into biopic\u00a0territory, a zone where many revered filmmakers have failed to capture the reality of the moment they're attempting to bring to life.\r\n\r\nGoing in, you'll already know how the movie ends, which is the problem most directors encounter when making a biopic. Finding a way to transfer the actuality of the moment while still feeling original and never appearing boring is a hard task that very few have been able to truly accomplish. With First Man, Chazelle manages to land a spot on that list of directors,\u00a0and for good reason. He keeps true to the true story with a film that's so intense and fully realized that you might forget that it actually happened.\r\n\r\nSpace movies have always been a highlight of cinema. From Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s' 1902 silent film\u00a0A Trip to the Moon\u00a0and Stanley Kubrick's\u00a02001: A Space Odyssey\u00a0to the\u00a0Star Wars\u00a0and\u00a0Alien\u00a0franchises, films taking place in the farthest reaches of the universe prove to be some of the most intriguing and original creations brought to viewers' eyes (even by today's standards). It's the true stories that really prove to be some of the most effective, however. Sure, fictional ones show us what could be possible; but it's the depictions of true events that show us what\u00a0was\u00a0possible, creating a harrowing story of patriotism in the process.\r\n\r\nFrom a technical perspective,\u00a0First Man\u00a0is a marvel on all fronts. Linus Sandgren, the cinematographer who won an Academy Award for his work on\u00a0La La Land, returns to collaborate with Chazelle and once again delivers a grand spectacle that should not be missed out on while in theaters. The cinematography is stunning. Hues of yellow and blue pop, lighting a path towards the characters and showing no sign of stopping once they've started. Certain scenes are given an extra boost from the home-video-style camerawork, beautifully grainy and shaky in all of the right ways.\r\n\r\nJustin Hurwitz (Chazelle's roommate in college), another frequent collaborator, also returns to score the film and knocks it out of the park as expected. Hurwitz obviously knows how to write music, but its how his compositions fit in with the scenes and themes they're tied to that make them so worthwhile. Hurwitz invests you in the midst of all the chaos with all of the orchestral beauty surrounding his pieces. That's the thing about his scores, though: it's hard to objectively rank them because of how different they all are. Chazelle is a unique director because he never sticks to the same formula over an over again, and the same can be said for the accompanying music for each of them.\r\n\r\nActing is on point here; Ryan Gosling hits a huge emotional nerve with incredibly investing performance as Neil Armstrong. He keeps to himself (namely, his personal life) but is willing to risk it all for the mission. Nothing from Gosling is single-layered; everything is complex and detailed to the point that you might as well be in the room with him.\r\n\r\nClaire Foy also delivers an amazing portrayal as Janet Armstrong, Neil's wife. Foy topples every housewife stereotype that embodied this specific time period, giving a strong, contained, and free-willed performance of a woman who is certainly not afraid to share her thoughts on issues concerning her husband.\r\n\r\nThe flag controversy is totally stupid. The moon landing scene doesn't need the image of Armstrong planting the flag on the moon to dish up a heavily emotional response from the audience. If you get a chance to screen it in IMAX, definitely do. The expanded aspect ratio only comes into play during this specific scene but it is utterly transfixing.\r\n\r\nFirst Man\u00a0is one of the best films of the year, no doubt about it. Every shot is perfection. Every sound is excellence. There is no comparison to what Damien Chazelle and co. have accomplished here; even iconic films like\u00a0Apollo 13\u00a0can't live up to the new bar of quality Chazelle has set for the space drama subgenre.\u00a0A harrowing journey from start-to-finish, and a true masterwork in many respects,\u00a0First Man\u00a0is one film that delivers upon its promise and then some. Performances and technicalities are perfect, but that's what Chazelle will continue to be known for: perfection.","id":"5bca354c925141561a01915c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bca354c925141561a01915c","movie_id":369972}
{"author":"JPV852","content":"Direct-to-Video and On Demand movies, the ones that generally skip any major theatrical release, are more often than not rather terrible or at best bland. But a funny thing happens every so often, one tends to surprise. Final Score, albeit can get silly at times, was quite fun and entertaining.\r\n\r\nDave Bautista plays Michael Knox, a former soldier visiting his \u201cbrother\u2019s\u201d widowed wife and daughter, Danni (LARA PEAKE), whose father was killed during a mission led by Knox. He\u2019s come to take Danni to a football (soccer) game.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Arkady Belav (RAY STEVENSON) and his merry men of terrorists, infiltrate the stadium for the match. Belav learns that his brother, Dimitri (PIERCE BROSNAN), had faked his death 17 years earlier in order to stop the bloodshed during a revolution in the Russian state of Sakovya for independence. Arkady believes once the people see Dimitri alive, despite undergoing heavy plastic surgery to look a lot like Pierce Brosnan, will rise up and the revolution will be revitalized.\r\n\r\nArkady and his crew have not only jammed signals so people inside cannot get use their cell phones, they have also rigged columns in the stadium with C4 explosives. Once Knox gets wind of what\u2019s going on, he goes into action first to protect Danni and then take down Arkady, with the help of stadium attendant Faisal (AMIT SHAH), who knows the lay of the land. Brutal violence ensues.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t mind admitting, I genuinely enjoyed Final Score. It\u2019s a movie that certainly had more than a few silly moments, most notably Knox riding a motorbike onto a heavy fabric roof along with some eye-rolling dialogue, one towards the end that reminded me of the \u201cswing high\u201d line in Signs. But even so, Dave Bautista has proven he does have enough charisma to carry a movie while Ray Stevenson, to no one\u2019s surprise, does play an effective villain even when his character\u2019s motives don\u2019t seem to be well thought out. And finally Pierce Brosnan gets the prestigious \u201cand\u201d credit meaning he\u2019s only in the film for a few minutes and minimal dialogue, but even so, seems to give it his best for such a limited part. As much as I liked Stevenson, kind of wish Brosnan played the villain here\u2026\r\n\r\nFinal Score was directed by Scott Mann who also helmed the dull film Heist from 2015 (which co-starred Bautista) but here the action was pretty well shot and even in the asinine moments, were still rather suspenseful. The script was written by \u201cThe Lynch Brothers\u201d (David and Keith Lynch; both making their feature debuts) and Mann\u2019s co-to man, Jonathan Frank who wrote Mara also for Saban Films.\r\n\r\nIn the end, this is not some tremendous action-thriller and certainly does have shades of Die Hard, but even so, I was generally surprised considering the track record for these direct-to-video flicks that are more often than not, are terrible. This one, was actually pretty damn good.","id":"5d6992e4511d090010938549","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d6992e4511d090010938549","movie_id":421658}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Aesthetically laudable, emotionally vapid_**\r\n\r\n> _I am comfortable with my level of public discourse._\r\n\r\n- Neil Armstrong declining to be interviewed for \"Armstrong's Code\" (Kathy Sawyer); _The Washington Post_ (July 11, 1999)\r\n\r\nMore an intimate character drama than a grandiose examination of man's place in the cosmos, _First Man_ is far more concerned with domesticity than the actual journey to the moon, attempting to demonstrate that behind the great moments of history exist personal demons and private motivations. Nothing wrong with that of course \u2013 contextualising small character beats against a larger historical canvas can produce excellent cinema. Terrence Malick's _The Thin Red Line_ (1998), for example, uses the Battle of Guadalcanal as the background against which to engage all manner of personalised existential Heideggerian philosophical conundrums, whilst Michael Mann's _Ali_ (2001) is more interested in Ali's private struggles outside the ring than his public bouts within it. However, for this kind of storytelling to work, one thing is essential \u2013 emotional connection. The audience must, in some way, care about the people on screen, otherwise their introspective problems are more than likely to feel like they are just getting in the way of the larger story. And that is exactly what happens in _First Man_ \u2013 there is a lifelessness at the film's core, an emotional vapidity that can't be filled by exceptional technical achievements and laudable craft. The film attempts to celebrate Project Gemini and the Apollo Program, whilst also working as a character study of a man known for his emotional taciturnity. And whilst it achieves the former, the film's Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) is so stoic and closed-off as to be virtually disconnected from the rest of humanity.\r\n\r\nBased on James R. Hansen's 2005 biography, _First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong_, the film begins in 1961, with the sixth of Armstrong's seven North American X-15 research flights (which actually took place in April 1962). Ascending to 207,000 ft., when Armstrong attempts to turn the aircraft back towards the landing strip at Edwards Air Force Base, a control malfunction causes him to hold the nose up for too long, and he accidentally bounces off the atmosphere, forcing him to take drastic action to land. From there, the film hits all the beats you would expect in the lead up to the Apollo 11 mission in 1969; the death of his daughter, Karen (Lucy Stafford) from a brain tumour; his acceptance into Project Gemini; his friendships with Elliot See (Patrick Fugit) and Ed White (Jason Clarke); NASA's shock at the Soviet's successes in the Space Race, particularly Alexy Leonov's EVA; Armstrong's selection as commander of Gemini 8; See's death in a Northrop T-38 Talon crash; Gemini 8's calamitous docking with the Agena Target Vehicle; the death of White, Gus Grissom (Shea Whigham), and Roger B. Chaffee (Corey Michael Smith) during a plugs-out test of Apollo 1; Armstrong's near death whilst testing the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle; his selection as commander of Apollo 11; his marriage problems with his first wife, Janet (Claire Foy); the lunar landing alongside Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll); Armstrong's private sojourn to the Lunar East crater; and finally, the return to Earth.\r\n\r\nWithin this framework, the film remains tied almost exclusively to Armstrong's perspective, with the occasional shift to Janet. This sets up something of a problem, as the real-life Armstrong was very much a reluctant celebrity\/national hero, and despite his extraordinary accomplishments, he was not the most interesting, relatable, or easy-to-empathise-with-individual. Never one for the spotlight, when Hansen's biography was published, Armstrong was living unassumingly in a quiet Cincinnati suburb, whilst in a famous 2001 comment, when asked in an interview for the Johnson Space Center Oral History Project if he had ever gazed at the moon prior to the Apollo 11 mission, he replied, \"_No, I never did that_.\"\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, the film sets itself the task of attempting to penetrate this most private of men, explaining why he was so singularly driven, even to the detriment of his family, to the point where not only did he plan not to tell his children he may not return from the Apollo 11 mission, he intended to leave without saying goodbye at all, until Janet changed his mind. And herein lies perhaps the film's most egregious failing. It's almost as if director Damien Chazelle (_Whiplash_; _La La Land_) and screenwriter Josh Singer (_Spotlight_; _The Post_) think the Apollo 11 mission isn't interesting enough by itself \u2013 there needs to be some kind of deeper \"why\" behind the whole enterprise. Armstrong can't simply be a driven individual, his heroism isn't enough, there must be some kind of psychological motivating factor.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the attempts to tease out the inner workings of Armstrong's mind don't really work, as he remains very much in his own world, impenetrable to both the other characters in the film, and the audience \u2013 no matter what Gosling, Chazelle, and Singer do to dress him up, Armstrong comes across as aloof and interiorised. Partly at fault here is Gosling's performance, with its fulcrum of emotionless stoic masculinity. This is a performance we've seen him give several times before \u2013 Henry Bean's _The Believer_ (2001), Nicholas Winding Refn's _Drive_ (2011), and, especially, Denis Villeneuve's _Blade Runner 2049_ (2017) all spring to mind - and this familiarity doesn't help matters. Instead of giving the character hidden depth, the few discernible traits he possesses make him something of a cardboard cut-out, a 21st-century screenwriter's idea of what an American man who grew up in the 40s and 50s should be (complete with retconned political correctness).\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that the filmmakers choose to locate Armstrong's primary motivation in Karen's death, which is presented with a mawkish sentimentality that, at best, fails to convince, and, at worst, actively distracts. With the lunar mission presented as much about advancing mankind as it is dealing with personal trauma, Chazelle goes to great lengths to link Karen's death with Armstrong's determination \u2013 as she is dying, he holds her and looks wistfully into the sky (indeed, whilst the real-life Armstrong attests to never gazing profoundly at the moon, the film's Armstrong never stops looking at the thing); after her funeral, he slips her bracelet into a drawer; later, he has an hallucinatory vision of her playing with other children; and on the moon's surface, he drops the bracelet into the Lunar East crater and cries a few tears for her. At one point, Janet reveals that Armstrong never mentioned Karen after the funeral, and that's a believable, and deeply emotional, detail. The problem lies in the overkill surrounding it, detracting from whatever genuine emotion such details should evoke. Every time we see Gosling stare yearningly into the sky, the potency of the film is diluted just a little bit more.\r\n\r\nA big question in all of this, of course, is whether Armstrong really dropped the bracelet into the crater, had a vision of his daughter, and shed a few manly tears, or is this Hollywood romanticising history? The answer is, we don't know. During his interviews with Armstrong and Janet for the biography, Hansen formulated the theory that maybe Neil left something for Karen on the surface. However, when Hansen asked Armstrong if he could see the manifest for the mission, Armstrong told him he had lost it, something which would have been highly out of character for such a fastidious record-keeper. In fact, he hadn't lost it, he had donated it to the Purdue University Archives, but it is under seal until 2020. However, when Hansen asked Armstrong's sister June if it was possible he had left something of Karen's, she said that it was. So, the fact is we don't know what Armstrong did when he wandered over to the crater (his sojourn there was literally the only part of the landing that wasn't by-the-book). However, for me, the whole thing comes across as far too syrupy, an amateur psychological profiling of a man who was intensely private. Personally, I would have much preferred the Lunar East trip to remain a mystery \u2013 by showing us what they think might have happened, Hansen, Singer, and Chazelle cheapen the intensely personal nature of the moment, which Armstrong obviously chose to keep secret for a reason.\r\n\r\nA good example of the film's attempts to shoehorn everything into a writer's conception of the story concerns Armstrong's training on the MASTIF (Multiple Axis Space Test Inertia Facility). The film shows him passing out, before coming to, and asking to go again. This pays off later when the Gemini 8-Agena docking goes wrong, and Armstrong experiences the same forces as he did in the MASTIF. However, because of his experience, he remains conscious, and is able to retrieve the situation. Except Armstrong never trained on the MASTIF. The device was abandoned after Project Mercury as NASA felt it was unrealistic, and didn't prepare the pilots for anything they would ever experience in reality. It's one of the ironies of NASA history that the man who experienced what the MASTIF simulated never trained on the machine itself. The problem here is that the real story (Armstrong's sheer force of will helps him overcome the odds) is infinitely better than the invented one (Armstrong's training helped him overcome the odds), which is indicative of a larger problem \u2013 the film always seems like someone's idea of what happened.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, Chazelle wastes absolutely no time in letting us know that this is Armstrong's film, with the excellent opening sequence taking place primarily from his POV. However, the scene also introduces the first example of Chazelle's pungent romanticism. As the shaking of Armstrong's X-15 momentarily stops, and the noise dies away, a majestic sense of calm descends. However, rather than trust the audience to extract their own interpretation of the moment, Chazelle can't resist a BCU of Gosling's eyes, with the curvature of the earth reflecting on his visor. On the other hand, a well-handled aspect of this technique is that because the film adheres so rigidly to Armstrong's perspective, very little of what he himself can't see is shown. So, for example, instead of depicting the vast infinite expanses of space, Chazelle keeps the audience tucked tightly inside the _Eagle_ landing module (at least up to the point of the descent to Tranquility Base).\r\n\r\nIndeed, make no mistake, the lunar landing itself is beyond spectacular, with the incredible score by Justin Hurwitz and the superb cinematography of Linus Sandgren (_American Hustle_; _Joy_) coming into their own. The sequence was shot in 70mm IMAX, and it makes extraordinary use of the larger frame, with the first panorama of the lunar surface as awe-inspiring as anything in Stanley Kubrick's _2001: A Space Odyssey_ (1968) or Terrence Malick's _The Tree of Life_ (2011). An especially well-directed part of the lunar descent is that rather than lay down a busy foley track, Chazelle pulls out the sound out altogether, creating an eerie, otherworldly moment that literally gave me goosebumps.\r\n\r\nThematically, as with all three of Chazelle's previous films, the clash between the domestic and the professional is front-and-centre. _Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench_ (2009), _Whiplash_ (2014), and _La La Land_ (2016) all focus on artists who sacrifice emotional relationships so as to reach an artistic peak \u2013 they are all stories of men whose passionate devotion to their work and pursuit of perfection alienates the women in their lives. In this sense, _First Man_ very much fits Chazelle's _oeuvre_, he seems as obsessed with how men attempt to balance work and home-life as is Michael Mann. Armstrong is not an artist, of course, but he is a perfectionist, and the pursuit of his craft does make the woman who loves him unhappy. To this end, Chazelle utilises various methods, such as having NASA radio chatter play over scenes of Jan at home alone. The film's ending is also extremely low-key and private, stripping away the finery of the Apollo mission, and leaving us instead with two people attempting to re-connect.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite the magisterial last 30 minutes, and some sporadically well-handled moments, _First Man_ is underwhelming, and, for long portions, interminably dull. As good as that final sequence is, it's no compensation for the plodding and lifeless two hours that precede it. And overall, the film isn't a patch on Philip Kaufman's _The Right Stuff_.","id":"5cfad9c10e0a2606a2c9ee40","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cfad9c10e0a2606a2c9ee40","movie_id":369972}

{"author":"Steve Parker","content":"You\u2019ve probably seen mainstream movies about women being sexually harassed at work which are highly dramatised, revenge-thrillers that are exciting to watch. WORKING WOMAN is the complete opposite of that in tone. What WORKING WOMAN does is explore the issue of sexual harassment of women at work by telling the story slowly, subtly, in the context of real life where Orna has to manage completely alone. Even those closest to her don\u2019t understand what she is going through \u2014 male or female. And while Orna ultimately fights back, she does this in a way which is much more realistic and within the power of anyone to accomplish \u2014 providing they are able to fight in their own way, not the ways that Hollywood may sensationally represent. WORKING WOMAN takes a slow burn approach and, while I cannot speak for women who watch this movie, the ending, for me, was an empowering one. Liron Ben-Shlush, who plays Orna, is brilliant in a subtle performance that strikes powerfully at the viewer\u2019s emotional heart. WORKING WOMAN is a powerful articulation of what so many women have to put up with in the work place and the loneliness and isolation that the social power that allows some men to perpetrate abuse on women. This movie should be watched by all women and men to gain a deeper appreciation of what women experience.","id":"5e80266b1d6c5f00181c81ed","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e80266b1d6c5f00181c81ed","movie_id":544392}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Overstays its welcome, but the acting is terrific, and the screenplay sporadically excellent_**\r\n\r\n>_Seventeen years ago, I was given the news of my grandmother's Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis. I was devastated for her. She was 68, young for such a thing and younger in spirit, sharp as a tack, a red-headed, heart-centered woman who demonstrated her Irish heritage in a work ethic and generosity of love that brought her to the highest levels of administration in, ironically, geriatric nursing._\r\n>\r\n_I was perhaps more devastated for her husband, my grandfather. He adored her and had all his life. The__y were small town Illinois farm kids who grew up together and married young, and forty years and four kids later were still in the throes of the sweetest kind of love affair. They'd bicker and flirt over breakfast; she\u2019d climb into his lap and kiss him all over; they were better together and never apart, and her diagnosis seemed like the cruelest end to such a love story._\r\n>\r\n[...]\r\n>\r\n> _I wrote_ What They Had _as a means of working through this generational grief. I wrote it for myself, and for my mother, and for her brothers, to preserve for us a memory that I now understood we\u2019d all eventually lose. I wrote it for all the reasons I had always written\u2014to figure out things I did not understand, to find some workaround for loss, to find some order in things that felt un-orderly and unfair._\r\n>\r\n> _Making the film felt like cheating death. It was granting my grandparents new life, getting to know them better and deeper, as an adult rather than as a child. It was returning to Chicago, the place I left when I was fourteen but still feels like home. And it was reckoning with myself, the woman I\u2019d become, holding up a mirror to determine how much that woman was serving me, serving other real women I knew, wondering what our culpability was for that, what kind of courage it might take to confront those things and step out on the other side._\r\n\r\n- Elizabeth Chomko; \"Filmmaker Letter\"\r\n\r\nThe debut film of writer\/director Elizabeth Chomko, partly based on her own experiences with her grandmother, _What They Had_ depicts a family trying to deal with the horrors of Alzheimer's. Very much in the tradition of films such as Richard Eyre's _Iris_ (2001), Sarah Polley's _Away From Her_ (2006), and Richard Glatzner and Wash Westmoreland's _Still Alice_ (2014), _What They Had_ attempts to avoid becoming too lachrymose by finding humour in the condition and focusing on how the family are ultimately brought together rather than torn apart. It's not perfect, of course, running a good ten minutes too long and straying into melodrama more than once, but for all that, it's still a fine film, with some fantastic writing, and a superb cast doing exceptionally truthful work.\r\n\r\nSet in Chicago, the film begins with Ruth (Blythe Danner) waking up in the middle of the night, putting on her shoes, and walking out into a blizzard. When her husband, Burt (a career-best performance from Robert Foster), awakens to find her gone, he calls their son, Nick (Michael Shannon), who in turns calls his sister, Bridget (Hilary Swank). Living in California, Bridget is in a loveless marriage to the nice but dull Eddie (a blink-and-you-miss-him cameo by Josh Lucas) and seems to be perpetually sparring with her daughter Emma (Taissa Farmiga), who may or may not have dropped out of college without consulting her parents. With Emma in tow, Bridget flies to Chicago just in time to hear that Ruth has been found - riding the train to her childhood home, worried that her parents will be concerned as to why she is out so late. As the family take Ruth home, the film's central conflict becomes apparent; Nick wants to put her in a \"memory centre\" (basically a nursing home that specialises in Alzheimer's patients), but Burt won't hear of it, becoming angry at the mere mention (\"_She's my girl. You're not taking my girl away from me_\"), and insisting that no one could look after her as well as him. An old-school man's man, devout Catholic, and Korean War veteran, Burt is living in deep denial, insisting that Ruth is not as bad as everyone else is claiming, despite her being in the sixth of the seven Alzheimer's stages; \"severe decline\". Nick called Bridget hoping she would back him up regarding the nursing home, as she has power of attorney. But, although she does agree with Nick that Ruth needs to be in a home, she is reluctant to go against Burt's wishes.\r\n\r\nA product of the Sundance Institute's Screenwriters Lab, in 2015 Chomko's script for _What They Had_ won the prestigious Academy Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting. Chomko uses Ruth's illness as a prism through which to examine a number of peripheral themes, not the least of which is how her condition opens up long-gestating fault lines between the various family members, as they come to fight about everything and anything. As Swank explains,\r\n\r\n> _it's a movie that deals with family, family dynamics, and what you do when in a crisis like that, and how you come together, and how it shines a light on the weaknesses within the family and the strengths within the family._\r\n\r\nRuth isn't the central character, and her disease is not the focal point; this is a film about a family in crisis, a crisis precipitated by Ruth's illness, but fuelled by their own personal problems. Nick has sunk every penny he owns into a bar that isn't doing too well, and which Burt has never bothered to visit, whilst his long-time girlfriend has left him, fed up waiting for him to propose; Bridget finds herself increasingly dissatisfied with her career as a chef and her marriage to a man who was essentially chosen for her by Burt; Emma has been thrown out of her college dorm for drinking, and seems to have little to no interest in remaining in college; Burt disapproves of Nick's unmarried status, and belittles his son by referring to him as a bartender rather than a bar owner, whilst he believes Bridget's unhappiness stems from her lapsed Catholicism and the influences of the California environment. One of the strengths of Chomko's script is how she deals with the manifestation of these various problems, deftly handling the presentation of emotions, with the audience empathising first with one character and then another, with no one depicted as completely right or completely wrong.\r\n\r\nAnother strong aspect of Chomko's script is how she is able to generate laughs from Ruth's condition. At one point, Ruth announces she's pregnant, and Burt tells Nick that in anticipation of the arrival, they've got out all his old baby things. In another scene, a solemn Nick tells Bridget that Ruth hit on him, but Bridget is unable to keep a straight face, and the two end up laughing hysterically. At church, when Emma informs Nick that Ruth has just drunk the holy water, he quips, \"_at least she's hydrated_.\" When a telephone rings in the apartment, Ruth enters the room holding a stapler to her ear, complaining that she can't hear anything. None of these scenes felt disrespectful or exploitative, and in the case of Ruth hitting on Nick, Chomko actually returns to it later in the film in a key scene when Nick tells Burt about it, and for the first time, we see a chink in Burt's armour - for the first time he doesn't have an instant response, with Foster brilliantly portraying just how difficult Burt is finding it to process what he has just heard.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, a great deal of the film takes place in Burt and Ruth's apartment, perhaps a by-product of Chomko's theatrical background. Cinematographer Roberto Schaefer (_Monster's Ball_; _The Paperboy_; _Miles Ahead_) shoots the interiors with a very warm colour palette that cools down considerably whenever the film moves to another location, setting up the apartment as the emotional heart of the story. There are also a couple of visual flourishes here and there. A really beautiful shot occurs right at the start; as Ruth walks away from the apartment into the snow, she slowly fades out, literally disappearing into the night. An especially noticeable visual motif is the use of photographs and old home movie footage, both of which feature predominantly throughout the film. Initially, I thought this was a fairly clich\u00e9d technique (how many heartfelt family dramas feature an opening with home movie footage depicting a happier time), but in the case of _What They Had_, it actually pays off beautifully in the final sequence. Chomko also features a number of scenes in which characters get bad news whilst in bed - subverting the notion of one's bed being a place of rest and security.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the acting, given the cast, it should come as no surprise how universally impressive it is. As Ruth, Blythe Danner gives a pathos-rich lyrical performance in which she must react to everything without registering anything. The film's depiction of Ruth may be romanticised, but as a performance, Danner's work is flawless, as she switches from knowing she's a grown woman with grandchildren to believing she is a young girl still living with her parents. Foster plays Burt as a bully, albeit not a self-aware one; he has no idea how much ideological authority he wields over his children, or how afraid of him they are, or that Bridget feels he pushed her into a marriage she didn't want. One of the subtexts of the film is the long-term impact that having such an overbearing parent can have on a child, but the strength of the performance is that Burt is not a wantonly bad man; he thinks he has done right by his children, and he remains always charming. Despite his bravado and machoism, however, his most salient characteristic is his unwavering love for Ruth, who he still refers to as \"_my girl_\". A scene of them exchanging Christmas presents is as poignant a scene as you're likely to see all year, with his love and her quiet dignity intertwining to create probably the best scene in the film. Bridget is, by definition, a passive character for most of the film, but Swank gets a lot of mileage out of playing her inner struggles; she very much wants to assert herself, whether it be in her dealings with Nick, Burt, Emma, or Eddie, but something constantly holds her back. Shannon, whom we're used to seeing as a snarling monster, reminds us here of why he is considered such an acting powerhouse and how impressive he can be playing a more 'normal' character. Doing arguably his best work since Sam Mendes's _Revolutionary Road_ (2008), he plays Nick as utterly exhausted with the burden of helping to look after Ruth without so much as a thank you from Burt. However, the irony at the heart of the performance is that Nick is turning into exactly the same kind of bully as Burt, something he doesn't seem to realise. And whilst Burt's soft centre is apparent in how he relates to Ruth, Nick's becomes clear insofar as what he wants more than anything is his father's approval.\r\n\r\nHowever, a number of factors hold the film back. Firstly, like most films about Alzheimer's, it depicts the condition as not quite as bad as it really is (Ruth never becomes violent, for example, as so many sufferers do), with the choices faced by the family far more binary and clear-cut than is so often the case. Chomko also makes a few directorial misjudgements. For example, the final scene features a truly bizarre bit of on-the-nose symbolism that at the screening I attended elicited laughter in what should have been the emotional apex of the story. Speaking of the end, there are about five scenes which could legitimately have served as the _d\u00e9nouement_ (all of which seemed to be wrapping things up), with the film running a good ten minutes too long, and missing a chance for a really powerful final impression, ending on a beautifully poignant comment by Ruth. Another problem is the subplot involving Emma's attitude towards college, which Chomko never manages to make feel like anything other than an insubstantial and unimportant tangent. There's also something of a discrepancy in the film's presentation of the family as emotionally repressed old-school Catholics, and the fact that they literally spend the entire film talking to each other about their feelings.\r\n\r\nThese few issues aside though, this is an impressive debut. It's not the best Alzheimer's movie ever made (thus far, that is _Away From Her_), but it's a fine addition to the subgenre. Chomko elicits excellent performances from the central quartet and displays some nice visual touches as director. I didn't find it as emotional as I expected (or as emotional as it seems to think it is), but it's definitely a heartfelt film, and you could do much worse than to seek it out.","id":"5d3ccb1121621b0012ef9776","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d3ccb1121621b0012ef9776","movie_id":451919}

This was Houston's final interview; 13 weeks later, she was dead.\r\n\r\nI wasn't a huge fan of Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal's _Whitney: Can I Be Me_ (2017). The film was built on the foundation of never-before-seen backstage footage from Houston's World Tour 1999, but I felt the narrative was poorly constructed, jumping from her divorce from Bobby Brown in 2007 to her death in 2012 with very little detail on what happened in those five years. This had the effect of making the last part of the documentary feel rushed and incomplete. I went into it not knowing a huge amount about Whitney Houston (apart from the obvious bits and pieces that everyone knows), and I came out still not knowing a huge amount about her.\r\n\r\nWritten and directed by Kevin Macdonald (_One Day in September_; _Touching the Void_; _Marley_), Whitney covers almost identical terrain as Broomfield and Dolezal, with many of the same interviewees appearing in both films, and much of the same factual information presenting itself (Houston tried drugs long before becoming a celebrity; she was criticised as \"_acting white_\" and selling out her culture by many black people, and was booed at the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards (where her single \"Where Do Broken Hearts Go\" was nominated for Best R&B\/Urban Contemporary Single - Female\"); she was hounded with questions regarding her sexuality for much of her life, etc). One hugely important absence from both films, of course, is Robyn Crawford, Whitney's one time best friend, road manager, and probable lover, who was pretty much the only person in Houston's life who seemed to tell her what was what and have her best interests at heart. Apart from a beautiful obituary for _Esquire_ (on whose editorial staff Crawford's wife works), Crawford has maintained a dignified silence since Houston died, and neither Broomfield and Dolezal nor Macdonald were able to persuade her to speak on camera. This leaves a sizeable lacuna in the narratives of both films, as it is fairly unlikely anyone will really get to the core of who Houston was until (or indeed if) Crawford decides to tell her own story. As a side note, one interesting figure who didn't appear in _Can I Be Me_, but who does unexpectedly pop up in _Whitney_ is Clive Davis, president of Arista Records, and the man who signed Houston to her first record deal.\r\n\r\nFor all their similarities, however, I found Macdonald's film superior to _Can I Be Me_. _Whitney_ has two major, and interconnected, advantages over the earlier film. Can I Be Me is more concerned with facts, and probably covers more \"Did you know\" moments, such as the idea to open \"I Will Always Love You\" capella style was actually Kevin Costner's. However, having said that, Macdonald does manage to squeeze in a couple of not especially well known moments of his own; for example, Houston's haunting rendition of \"The Star Spangled Banner\" at the 1991 Super Bowl (where she had her bandleader and arranger Rickey Minor take the radical step of altering the time signature from a 3\/4 to a 4\/4) was completely unrehearsed, and the revelations regarding Dee Dee Warwick are shocking to say the least. However, what Macdonald does much better than Broomfield and Dolezal is that, on several occasions, he takes time out from the narrative to simply let the audience hear her sing. Probably because of this, his film is considerably more emotive. I was very moved by it on a couple of occasions; I don't remember being moved by _Can I Be Me_ at all. One scene in particular I found very upsetting recalls that horrific scene in Asif Kapadia's _Amy_ (2015), where Amy Winehouse is performing in Serbia a month before she died. In _Whitney_, it's footage from her Nothing But Love World Tour 2010, as she tries and completely fails to sing \"I Will Always Love You\" in Newcastle. The crowd is respectful enough, but given that so much of the documentary is simply about her voice, seeing her like this is very sad, as with her hoarse voice, she can barely stay in tune, let alone hit the high notes, sounding more like someone doing a bad karaoke rendition than one of the greatest singers of all time.\r\n\r\nAnother very well handled part of the documentary's narrative is its coverage of what could be termed \"mainstream media complicity\" in her suffering. Look, Whitney Houston was a drug addict and a terrible mother, who was indirectly responsible for Bobbi Kristina Brown's death, insofar as she gave her child no stability, and introduced her to a world of substance abuse. Nobody is arguing anything different. But she was also a person, suffering deeply, in public, and very few people did, or even tried to do, anything to help her. The film presents a 2002 sketch from _Saturday Night Live_ with Maya Rudolph as Whitney, in which she addresses the infamous Diane Sawyer \"_crack is whack_\" interview, and a scene from a 2005 episode of _American Dad!_, in which an emaciated Whitney \"sings for crack\" in the Smith living-room. These clips were probably funny at the time, but aren't especially funny now, and they serve to highlight one of the most bizarre paradoxes of our celebrity-obsessed society; we love to build people up and up and up, but, at some arbitrary point in time, we decide they've become too popular, too successful, too talented, so we do anything to pull them down, and when something goes wrong in their lives, really catastrophically wrong, our response as a society is not empathy, kindness, or understanding, but scorn, derision, and sarcasm. What a strange world we've made.","id":"5cc25b089251412577fe7e74","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cc25b089251412577fe7e74","movie_id":507256}

So I will learn to live with it...Because I can live with it...I can live with it...Computer - erase that entire personal log._\r\n\r\n- Cpt. Benjamin Sisko; Final words of \"In the Pale Moonlight\" (first aired, April 15, 1998)\r\n\r\nPremiering in syndication on January 3, 1993 and ending with the broadcast of its 176th episode on June 2, 1999, the thing that I loved most about _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ was the very thing that made Trekkies hate it - it just didn't feel like _Star Trek_. At least, not entirely. The Gene Roddenberry-created _Star Trek: The Original Series_ (1966-1969) and _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ (1987-1994) were both shows built around idealism, depicting how by the time of the 23rd and 24th centuries, humanity had put aside its petty squabbles, created global political harmony, and even done away with money, with Earth itself now a veritable utopia. Meanwhile, the human-led United Federation of Planets were very much the good guys, with Starfleet as the always-honourable, morally irreproachable _de facto_ police force of the galaxy, facing off against the nefarious Klingons, Romulans, Gorn, Tholians, Ferengi, Borg etc. They were shows about exploration and diplomacy, but above all, they were shows about optimism, about how humanity can rise above any adversity, about how hope should never be lost.\r\n\r\nAnd then came _Deep Space Nine_, or, to use a moniker originally intended as derogatory, but which has since been appropriated as a badge of honour by the show's makers and fans, \"dark _Star Trek_\". And what was so dark about it? Well, by way of illustration, let's look at the sixth season episode \"In the Pale Moonlight\", regarded by some (myself included) as the finest hour of the entire _Star Trek_ franchise, and by others as the episode where _DS9_ most egregiously violated the edicts of Roddenberry's creation. Deep into the Dominion War, (the concept of a prolonged and costly war, in and of itself, was fairly antithetical to the idealism of the franchise), the Federation and the Klingon Empire had been getting their asses handed to them for months by the Dominion (again, in Roddenberry's original conception, the good guys rarely lost). With the Romulans reluctant to get involved in a conflict that has little to do with them, they are tending towards a wait-and-see approach. However, Starfleet knows that if the war continues along the same lines for much longer, there will be no way back. And so, in an effort to ensure the Romulans enter the war, Captain Benjamin Sisko (the legendary Avery Brooks) lies, cheats, cajoles, and is a party to murder. And if that isn't bad enough, not only does he admit in his personal log that he would do it all again if he had to, he then erases the log entirely. This was psychological territory totally alien to Trekkies, raising the kind of moral questions one simply never encountered when dealing with such idealised characters as James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). This was some seriously dark material. This was not _Star Trek_.\r\n\r\nAnd, on that point, I agree. This was not _Star Trek_. This was better.\r\n\r\nAlthough created by Rick Berman and Michael Piller, the real creative force behind _DS9_ was executive producer and lead writer Ira Steven Behr. With Berman and Piller focusing their attention on _Star Trek: Voyager_ (1995-2001), from _DS9_'s third season onwards, Behr was essentially left to his own devices (and if _DS9_ is \"dark _Star Trek_\", _VOY_ is \"_Star Trek_ for kids\"). And, much like Michael Mann's involvement with _Miami Vice_, you can almost pinpoint the exact moment when Behr took hold of the reins (although in the case of _Miami Vice_, it was a dramatic dip in quality upon Mann's departure). From the last episode of the second season (\"The Jem'Hadar\"), Behr and his exceptional team of writers (Robert Hewitt Wolfe, Ronald D. Moore, Hans Beimler, and Ren\u00e9 Echevarria) would set about crafting a pioneering show that did things and went places not only unique for the _Star Trek_ franchise, but unique for syndication entirely. Long before the Second Golden Age of Television, _DS9_ occupied a fascinating middle-ground between the episodic storytelling of _TNG_ and the serialisation format employed by most shows today. Indeed, it has more in common with today's binge-worthy long-form narratives than with any of its contemporaries. This is one of the reasons why it has proved so popular on Netflix in recent years - it lends itself to watching six or seven episodes at a time so as to get a better sense of the overarching narrative tapestry, a tapestry which _TOS_, _TNG_, and _VOY_ simply didn't have. Often criticised at the time (if you missed even one episode, especially in the heavily serialised last two seasons, you could easily get lost), this style of storytelling is exactly what's expected by people who've never known life without streaming, and partly because of this, the show has aged extremely well.\r\n\r\nAll of which brings us to _What We Left Behind: Looking Back at Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, a partly fan-funded documentary directed by Behr and David Zappone. The documentary is built around three core components; the cast and crew looking back at their time on the show (often very emotionally), a writers' room mapping out the first episode of a hypothetical eighth season (which ends up sounding awesome), and everyone from military vets to clergy to TV producers to human rights campaigners to professors of history discussing just how ahead of its time the show really was. And thankfully, the documentary is absolutely superb, and something no _DS9_ fan can possibly miss.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Behr announced that he had reassembled most of the cast and many of the crew for an as-yet unnamed documentary. Partly complete, he explained that they were lacking sufficient funds to scan the original camera negatives and convert them to HD. With the documentary featuring 22 minutes of original clips, Behr explained they were only planning to convert a couple of minutes, with the rest being left in their original broadcast 480i format. Setting up an Indiegogo fundraising page to crowdsource the rest of the capital, the fund surpassed its target of $150,000 less than 24 hours after going live. Going on to raise over $631,000, the documentary team ultimately decided to convert all 22 minutes of original footage.\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to an important point that I simply can't over-emphasise; it's worth the price of admission just for these 22 minutes. _TOS_ and _TNG_ have already had their 1080p conversions, but _DS9_ has only ever been seen in 480i, even on Netflix. With that in mind, the documentary offers a unique opportunity, possibly the only opportunity fans will ever get to see parts of the show in full HD (in 2017, Treknews.net published a fascinating interview with Robert Meyer Burnett, who was in charge of the _TOS_ and _TNG_ Blu-rays, where he explains in great detail why it's unlikely _DS9_ or _VOY_ will ever be converted to HD for any medium). Obviously, the space stuff looks truly amazing, with the epic battle scenes from \"Sacrifice of Angels\" standing up against anything you'd see in a big-budget movie in terms of scope and elaborateness. However, even the smaller character moments really pop - the colours are so much richer (especially the reds and blues in the uniforms), the blacks and shadows so much deeper, the makeup more nuanced, the subtlety of background detail more noticeable.\r\n\r\nIn a roundtable with Behr, Zappone, and producer\/editors Joseph Kornbrodt and Luke Snailham, shown after the screening I attended, even Jonathan West, the show's director of photographer from the third season on, is shown as being amazed at how good the original footage looks after the conversion process. And not only is it in HD, it's also in 16:9. Like _TNG_, _DS9_ was originally shot on 35mm before being converted to video for editing, and broadcast at 1.33:1. However, unlike _TNG_, _DS9_ was framed to protect for widescreen (meaning that although it was shot with the intention of being converted to 1.33:1, so too was it composed as if widescreen was the intended goal). The same is true of _The Wire_, which was broadcast at 1.33:1, but converted to 1.78:1 for its Blu-ray release, a process made easier by the fact that it was shot to protect for widescreen. And as anyone who has seen _The Wire_'s magnificent 1080p\/1.78:1 conversion will attest, the difference is night and day. In the roundtable, there are some split-screen comparisons between the clips as they originally aired and as they appear in the documentary, and it's like watching a completely different show. It's definitely my inner nerd coming out, but some of the footage gave me goosebumps. Literally.\r\n\r\nThe film begins with the cast reading extracts from some of the criticisms aimed at the show in its early years - mainly revolving around the fact that it wasn't _TOS_ or _TNG_, that it was too dark and morally ambiguous, that it wasn't as good as _Babylon 5_ (the temerity!), that it was on a station instead of a ship (how could it \"boldly go\" when it couldn't go anywhere, boldly or otherwise), that there were too many non-Starfleet characters, that the characters were too flawed. And whilst these criticisms are played for laughs, Behr and Zappone don't shy away from looking at some of the more painful moments - Avery Brooks being forbidden from having a goatee and a shaved head, so as not to appear, to quote then Paramount Television chairman Kerry McCluggage, \"_too street_\" (as Behr points out, \"_we were expecting Avery Brooks, one of the coolest cats on the planet, and instead we got the boring dad version of Avery Brooks_\"); Rick Berman not understanding why Behr wanted to introduce a war storyline, and later complaining that the show had become too violent (leading to Ronald D. Moore's famous rejoinder, \"_it's a fucking war! What do you mean it's too violent?_\"); Terry Farrell (who played Jadzia Dax) asking to be written out of the show with only one season left because she felt she was being mistreated behind the scenes; the entire cast (except Colm Meaney) not being especially happy with the arrival of _TNG_'s Michael Dorn in the fourth season; the lesbian kiss in the fourth season episode \"Rejoined\" that ignited huge controversy; the psychological toll that playing Benny Russell in the sixth season masterpiece that is \"Far Beyond the Stars\" took on Avery Brooks (who also directed the episode, brilliantly, I might add).\r\n\r\nThe film also spends a lot of time looking at some of the series' more politically-charged moments. _Star Trek_ in general has always done political themes very well, but whereas _TOS_ and _TNG_ tended to operate via allegory and metaphor, _DS9_ was more direct, shining an unflinching light on all kinds of issues. Terrorism, for example, was built into the show's DNA in the character of Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor), a former member of the Bajoran Resistance who had waged a guerrilla war against the Cardassian forces during the Occupation of Bajor. This conflict was actually introduced in the fifth season _TNG_ episode \"Ensign Ro\", and the character in _DS9_ was originally intended to be the titular Ro Laren (Michelle Forbes). Ultimately, however, _DS9_ went much further than _TNG_, depicting Kira as suffering from PTSD and crippling survivor guilt. It's especially interesting to hear Behr and Visitor talk about how the character of Kira (a freedom fighter to the Bajorans, a terrorist to the Cardassians) almost certainly wouldn't work in a post-9\/11 world. The film also reminds us how PTSD was also addressed when the character of Nog (Aron Eisenberg) lost a leg in battle during the seventh season episode \"The Siege of AR-558\", with the next couple of episodes looking at the psychological implications of his injury. The film presents several military vets attesting how much it spoke to them to see _DS9_ handling such weighty themes with dignity and grace.\r\n\r\nAnother important theme was racism, which was addressed many times, but never more explicitly or more successfully than in \"Far Beyond the Stars\", which is set in 1953, and depicts a writer, Benny Russell (played by Brooks), whose science fiction short stories are pulled from publication when word gets out that he's black, leading to what is hands down the most emotionally devastating and powerfully acted moment in the franchise's history. In relation to LGBTQ+ issues, the film points to the aforementioned kiss in \"Rejoined\" and also the long-rumoured but never confirmed theory that recurring character Elim Garak (Andrew Robinson) was in fact gay. Indeed, in relation to inclusivity, Behr laments that the show could have done better, arguing that one kiss and one rumour over seven years wasn't enough and that he should have done more, especially in terms of having the courage to reveal Garak's sexuality. It's a remarkable admission and the kind of raw honesty that's rare for a documentary made by the very people whom it is about.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, the film addresses how _DS9_ was the only show on TV which depicted science and religion as co-existing. With most shows treating them as binary opposites, _DS9_ was unique in being a science fiction show where several of the main characters were deeply religious; indeed, Sisko is even a religious icon to the Bajorans, something with which he is initially uncomfortable, but which he later embraces, with religion becoming more and more important in the show's mythology. An issue that illustrates just how little acknowledgement the show has gotten is the importance of black characters. _DS9_ was not the first TV show with a black lead, that was the _Spencer for Hire_ spin-off _A Man Called Hawk_ (which starred none other than Avery Brooks), but it _was_ the first show to regularly feature scenes with _only_ black characters. When discussing this aspect of the show, Behr is unable to contain his frustration when he relates how an episode of _That's So 90s_ pointed to _Homicide: Life on the Streets_ (1993-1999) as being the first show to feature scenes of all black characters, never even mentioning _DS9_. This kind of thing is something the show's cast and crew (and fans) have gotten used to over the years, but it's still somewhat upsetting to see just under the radar the show was despite the pioneering work it was doing.\r\n\r\nAnd with that said, if the film has an overriding theme, it's vindication; the sense that the choices the showrunners made at the time, choices which were criticised and often not understood, have stood the test of time, with the show rightfully thought of today as unusually mature and progressive. Behr mentions, for example, how the writers always treated plot as secondary to character, something which was opposed from on-high, but they never wavered, writing stories whose primary function was to facilitate character development (contrast that with something like _Sons of Anarchy_, an entertaining show, but one which buried its characters under a never-ending avalanche of plot). Another example of this vindication concerns the three-part second season opener; \"The Homecoming\", \"The Circle\", and \"The Siege\". The first three-episode arc in _Star Trek_ history, the idea was met with considerable resistance, with Paramount execs arguing that a three-parter would never work. However, as the show would go on to prove time and again (ultimately doing an unprecedented ten-episode arc in the last season), being on a space station rather than a ship lent itself to multi-episode storylines.\r\n\r\nAnd one final point. The reveal of the \"greatest moment in the history of _DS9_\", which comes during the closing credits, is one of the most epic examples of Rickrolling you'll ever see (albeit with a _DS9_ twist).\r\n\r\nAre there some problems with the film? Yes, a couple. Most notably, Avery Brooks does not appear (there is some interview footage, but it's archival). This leaves a massive lacuna in the film, not just in a practical sense, but in an emotional one as well; he was the heart of the show (and the only actor to appear in all 176 episodes), so for him not to feature is massively disappointing. However, in the years after the show went off the air, Brooks has gradually retired from film and TV acting (his last credit was _15 Minutes_ in 2001) whilst also appearing at fewer and fewer _Star Trek_ events. A tenured Professor of Theatre at Rutgers University, he hasn't done anything _DS9_ related since his truly batshit insane appearance in William Shatner's _The Captains_ in 2011, and obviously, Behr was unable to persuade him to appear. Another problem is that with Behr conducting the interviews, there's a sense in which he lets both Berman and McCluggage off too easily, especially in relation to the Terry Farrell situation, whereas a stronger interviewer wouldn't have accepted their deflecting and ambiguous responses. Another small problem is that Behr occasionally \"stops\" the film entirely to intercut scripted moments, usually involving himself. As the director and primary subject, this technique crosses the line into self-indulgence, and yes, the scenes are supposed to be humorous, but they're nowhere near as funny as the off-the-cuff moments elsewhere, and they are both structurally awkward and thematically unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThat aside, however, _What We Left Behind_ is an exceptional documentary. _DS9_'s reputation as the \"dark _Star Trek_\" is not unearned, but as the film reminds us, it was often bleak but never cynical, often pessimistic but never nihilistic. On the contrary, what the film does especially well is remind us just how humanistic the show really was, perhaps the most humanistic iteration of the entire franchise, and that any bleakness or darkness was earned by the contrasting moments of levity and humanity, by the depth of the characters and their relationships with one another. Looking at its myriad of strong women, its commentary on the psychological cost of war, its engagement with racial tensions, its marrying of science and religion, the film is about what the makers of the show left behind, but so too is it about how the show changed the future of television. The interviews with the cast and crew really drive home just how much it changed their lives, whilst the clips of fans talking about why they love it so much illustrate the extent to which it touched people. And given that _Deep Space Nine_ was so long maligned, considered the \"middle child\" of the _Star Trek_ family, it's ironic that, in essence, _What We Left Behind_ is about the love which the show has engendered.","id":"5d800f3a8e20c5002c347833","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d800f3a8e20c5002c347833","movie_id":522055}

Oliver Whitney); _ScreenCrush_ (May 2, 2018)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tully_ tells the story of Marlo (Charlize Theron), a New York suburbanite pregnant with her third child. Her husband, Drew (Ron Livingstone) is loving, but somewhat neglectful, showing more interest in playing video games than helping Tully maintain the house and family. Clueless about the pressures of motherhood, he fails to notice when Marlo begins to show signs of post-natal depression. However, shortly after the baby's birth, Marlo's wealthy brother, Craig (Mark Duplass) hires a night nanny named Tully (Mackenzie Davis) to help take some of the pressure off Marlo. Reluctant to embrace the idea at first, Marlo soon forms a tight bond with Tully, who introduces Marlo to a lifestyle she had never imagined.\r\n\r\n_Tully_ is one of those films that the less you know about it before seeing it, the better. Featuring committed performances from Theron and Davis, the film is written by Diablo Cody (_Jennifer's Body_; _Ricki and the Flash_) and directed by Jason Reitman (_Thank You for Smoking_; _Juno_; _Men, Women & Children_), a partnership which also produced _Young Adult_ (2011), in which Theron also starred. There's a definite thematic uniformity between the two films, as if they exist in an almost sliding doors-like relationship to one another. My only real issue with _Tully_ is that the supporting characters are very thinly drawn - Drew, the well-meaning but ineffectual husband, is especially void of substance. But the nature of the story, to a certain extent, necessitates this. In any case, this is an excellent study of an issue very rarely put on-screen - imperfect motherhood. A word of warning though; neither the poster, nor the trailer do the film any favours whatsoever. It's funny in places, but this is not a comedy.","id":"5cb2f0c30e0a2626e3c8346f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cb2f0c30e0a2626e3c8346f","movie_id":400579}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Built upon a fascinating temporal\/cognitive dissonance that works well, but the narrative is painfully dull and the characters taciturn_**\r\n\r\n> _The tradition of the oppressed teaches us that the 'state of emergency' in which we live is not the exception but the rule. We must attain to a conception of history that is in keeping with this insight. Then we shall clearly realise that it is our task to bring about a real state of emergency, and this will improve our position in the struggle against fascism._\r\n\r\n- Walter Benjamin; \"\u00dcber den Begriff der Geschichte\" [\"Theses on the Philosophy of History\"] (1940)\r\n\r\n> _You know the fairy tale about the man who died, don't you? He was waiting in Eternity to find out what the Lord had decided to do with him. He waited and waited, for one year, ten years, a hundred years. He begged and pleaded for a decision. Finally he couldn't bear the waiting any longer. Then they said to him: 'What do you think you're waiting for? You've been in Hell for a long time already._\r\n\r\n- Anna Seghers; _Transit_ (1944)\r\n\r\n> _Being a refugee is much more than a political status. It is the most pervasive kind of cruelty that can be exercised against a human being. By depriving a person of all forms of security, the most basic requirements of a normal life, by cruelly placing that person in inhospitable host countries that do not want to receive this refugee, you are forcibly robbing this human being of all aspects that would make life, not just tolerable, but meaningful in many ways._\r\n\r\n- Ai Weiwei; _Human Flow_ (2017)\r\n\r\n_Transit_ is based on Anna Segher's 1944 novel of the same name about a German concentration camp survivor seeking passage from Vichy Marseilles to North Africa in 1940, as the Nazis move ever closer to the city. However, rather than a 1:1 adaptation, the film is built upon a fascinating structural conceit \u2013 although it tells the same story as Segher's novel, it is set in the here and now. At least, some elements are set in the here and now. In fact, only part of the film's _milieu_ is modern. So, although such things as cars, ships, weaponry, and police uniforms are all contemporary, there are no mobile phones, no computers, people still use typewriters and send letters, and the clothes worn by the characters are the same as would have been worn at the time. Think of it this way \u2013 we've all seen modern dress productions of Shakespeare (from Barry Jackson's introduction of the concept in the 1923 Birmingham Reparatory Theatre production of _Cymbeline_ to Orson Welles's 1937 Mercury Theatre production of _Julius Caesar_, on up to films such as Richard Loncraine's 1995 adaptation of _Richard III_ and Baz Luhrmann's 1996 adaptation of _Romeo and Juliet_). So it would be like a Shakespeare production in which everyone is wearing modern dress, but they're still fighting with swords. In essence, what this means is that the film is set neither entirely in 1940 nor entirely in 2019, but in a strange kind of temporal halfway-house, borrowing elements from each. \r\n\r\nThere's a fairly obvious reason that writer\/director Christian Petzold (_Yella_; _Barbara_; _Phoenix_) employs this strategy, and it has to be said, it works exceptionally well, with the film's thematic focus symbiotically intertwined with its aesthetic to a highly unusual degree. In this sense, although the film ostensibly tells a story about 1940s Europe, its focus on refugees and its pseudo-modern setting mean that it also acts as something of a \"state of the nation\" address for Europe in 2019. In particular, it speculates as to what could happen in the not too distant future, given the rise of militant anti-immigration rhetoric and neo-fascist political ideology. The film doesn't so much suggest that history is repeating itself, as postulate that there's no historical difference between then and now. Unfortunately, aside from this daring aesthetic gambit, not much else worked for me, with the plot painfully somnolent and the characters void of virtually any relatable emotion.\r\n\r\nThe film begins in Paris, as Georg (Franz Rogowski) is entrusted with delivering some papers to George Weidel, a famous communist author currently in the city. After narrowly avoiding arrest, Georg makes his way to Weidel's hotel room but finds the writer has committed suicide. Taking an unpublished manuscript, two letters from Weidel to his wife Marie, and Weidel's transit visa for passage to Mexico, Georg and his companion Heinz (Ronald Kukulies) stowaway on a train heading for Marseilles, one of the few European ports not yet under the control of the \"fascists\", and where the hotels will only accept guests who can prove they will soon be leaving (i.e. people who already have transit visas for passage to another country). _En route_, Heinz dies from an infection, and upon arriving in Marseilles, Georg visits Heinz's Moroccan wife, Melissa (Maryam Zaree), to break the news. However, when he discovers that she's deaf, he has to explain Heinz's death through her young son, Driss (Lilien Batman), with whom he quickly forms a bond. Meanwhile, he heads to the Mexican consulate intending to return Weidel's belongings in the hopes they may get to his wife. However, when he is mistaken for Weidel himself, he realises he has a chance to escape Europe, with Weidel booked on a ship sailing in a few days. As Georg awaits passage, he has several encounters with a mysterious woman, who, it is soon revealed is none other than Marie Weidel (Paula Beer), who is waiting for word from her husband. Not telling her that Weidel is dead, Georg finds himself falling for her, and begins to contemplate the new life he believes they can make together. However, things become more complicated when Driss takes ill and is tended to by local doctor, Richard (Godehard Giese), himself a refugee who is currently in a relationship with Marie and is desperate to flee with her so as to begin work in a children's hospital in Mexico. Weidel's transit visa, however, is for only two people.\r\n\r\nWith a _milieu_ that is authentic to neither the 1940s nor the 2010s, _Transit_ is _Casablanca_ filtered through Franz Kafka; it's what you might imagine if Sam (Dooley Wilson) played a polyphonic synthesizer, but Rick Blain (Humphrey Bogart) was still a Spanish Civil War veteran. Shot on location in Paris and Marseilles, everything from street signs to cars (including a few electric ones) to the front of buildings is modern, whilst Hans Fromm's crisp digital photography hasn't been aged in any way whatsoever (people who had a problem with Michael Mann shooting _Public Enemies_ (2009) on digital will be especially unimpressed). \r\n\r\nIn terms of cultural signifiers, Petzold keeps it fairly vague, although there is a reference to, of all things, George A. Romero's _Dawn of the Dead_ (1978), whilst the closing credits are scored by Talking Heads' \"Road to Nowhere\" (1982). Aside from that, Petzold avoids the minefield of choosing which cultural artefacts to include and which to leave out. However, for everything that seems to locate the film in the 21st century, there's something which seems to locate it in the 1940s, whether it be the absence of mobile phones, computers, and the internet, the ubiquity of typewriters and letters, or the clothes worn by the characters (except the police, who are dressed in modern riot gear). Along the same lines, Petzold keeps the politics generalised, with no mention of Nazis, concentration camps, or the Holocaust (indeed, it is never fully established why Georg himself is fleeing, although one assumes it's because he's a Jew). Instead of these specifics, the film makes references to archetypal \"fascists\", never-defined \"camps\", and systemic \"cleansing\". As an aside, the fact that so many of the refugees are trying to reach Mexico carries its own political undercurrent, with Mexican immigration to the US such a hot-button topic at the moment. In this sense, the film's racially motivated raids, importance of documentation, and inhumane detention conditions allude to 2019 as much as they recall 1940.\r\n\r\nThe combination of liminal elements of modernity and period-specific history sets up a temporal\/cognitive dissonance which places the narrative somewhere between fact and allegory, as if it were inverted magic realism. This, in effect, forces the audience to move beyond the abstract notion that what once happened could happen again. Instead, we are made to recognise that the difference between past and present is an unimportant semantic distinction only, and that that which once happened never really stopped happening; political displacement today is, for all intents and purposes, just as it was in 1940. Indeed, given the resurgence of Neo-Fascism across Europe, built primarily on irrational xenophobic fears of the Other in the form of immigration, the refugee crisis could very well become a global crisis (some would argue it already is), with Transit attempting to serve as a wake-up call. Along the same lines, the film's temporal dislocation suggests both the specificity and the universality of the refugee experience \u2013 every refugee is fundamentally unique, but so too is the experience the same, irrespective of when or where it happens. The important point here is that Petzold was able to lift a story from 1940 and place it in a relatively modern _milieu_ without changing much. The fact that conditions in 1940 can so easily slot into 2019 speaks to his central theme \u2013 nothing has changed for refugees.\r\n\r\nThe other important aesthetic choice is the use of a very unusual voiceover narration. Introduced out of the blue as Georg begins reading Weidel's manuscript at around the 20-minute mark, there's no initial indication as to the narrator's identity or when the narration is taking place. Additionally, the narrator is unreliable, as on occasion he describes something differently to how we see it. At the same time, the voice seems to alternate between omniscience and rigid subjectivity; at times, he speaks about something beyond Georg's perception (Georg is the focaliser throughout the entire film), at other times he describes Georg's innermost thoughts. The narration also \"interacts\" with the dialogue at one point \u2013 in a scene between Georg and Marie, their dialogue alternates with the VO; they get one part of a sentence and the VO completes it, or vice versa.\r\n\r\nHowever, although I really liked the temporal dissonance, the experimental VO didn't work nearly as well, serving primarily to smother the characters. The sudden introduction and the alternating range of the narrator's perceptions serves only to pull you out of the film as you try to answer a myriad of questions - where and when is the voice is coming from; what is its relationship to the narrative; are we hearing a character speak or someone outside the _fabula_; how can the narrator have access to Georg's innermost thoughts at some points but not at others; why is the voice able to accurately describe things not seen by Georg, but often inaccurately describe things which are; why does the narration seem to be ahead of the narrative at some points, behind it at others; what is the purpose of the pseudo-break of the fourth wall by having the VO alternate with dialogue? I certainly don't have answers to all of these questions, but I think the point of the destabilising\/defamiliarising narration is to reinforce the importance of storytelling \u2013 the experience of being a refugee is not lineal or ordered, but a mass of stories within stories and fragments that often contradict one another.\r\n\r\nThematically, Petzold has always been interested in issues of identity, political disenfranchisement, people desperate to leave somewhere, and ghosts (sometimes literal, sometimes existential), and _Transit_ is no exception. Weidel figuratively haunts the entire narrative, whilst Georg and the refugees, in general, exist as pseudo-ghosts, haunting Marseille until they can leave. However, this focus on ghosts also highlights several of the film's failings.\r\n\r\nTo suggest the disenfranchised nature of what it is to be a refugee, Petzold depicts Georg as essentially a non-person; he has very little agency of his own and is instead someone to whom things happen. In short, he's passive, less a protagonist than a witness. Passive characters can work extremely well in the right circumstances (think of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in the first act of George Lucas's _Star Wars_, Chance Gardner (Peter Sellers) in Hal Ashby's _Being There_, or the most famous example, Hamlet), but here, passivity combines with a dearth of backstory and character development, whilst Rogowski plays the part without a hint of interiority. In essence, we see Georg wandering around Marseille a lot...like really a lot. And we don't see him doing a huge amount else. Easily the most successful scenes in the film are those showing his friendship with Driss because they're the only moments where he seems like a person rather than a narrative construct, they're the only parts of the film that ring emotionally true.\r\n\r\nThat this is so is a serious problem, as the friendship is very much a subplot, and is secondary to the love story between Georg and Marie. Except that it isn't a love story; there's no emotional realism to it whatsoever, with the two characters becoming involved for no reason other than it said they had to in the script. I do understand what Petzold is going for here. He doesn't want a Hollywood love story of fireworks and poetic monologues, he wants to show that the war and their status as refugees has stripped them of their identities, and they are now effectively shells. However, this in no way necessitates such a badly written relationship void of any and all emotional truth.\r\n\r\nWhat Petzold is trying to do in his characterisation of Georg is clear enough; as an archetypal refugee, Georg can't be seen to have much control over his affairs as that would betray the actual experiences of real refugees. In this sense, his time in Marseille _must_ be static, an existence in-between more fully realised states. Petzold uses this to try to imply that to be divested of one's country is to be divested of one's identity. So, my criticism that Georg is a non-person is very much built into the film's DNA. Am I criticising the film for doing what it set out to do, and for doing it exceptionally well? Not really. I understand that Georg must be passive. However, the extent of his passivity renders him completely unrealistic \u2013 he's not a person, he's a robot, and the Georg at the end of the film is the same character as he is at the start.\r\n\r\nTied to this is the lack of forward narrative momentum. Again, I understand that Petzold is trying to stay true to the experience, that the life of a refugee in a place like Marseille in 1940 must necessarily involve a lot of waiting, a lot of repetition, and a lot of frustration. But again, it's the extent to which the film goes to suggest this, with entire sections going by without anything resembling a dramatic event. Yes, inertia is part of the theme insofar as the film depicts people suffering from crippling inertia, but it doesn't necessarily follow that the film needs to be so unrelentingly dull and uneventful.\r\n\r\nEasily the most egregious problem is one that arises from a combination of these issues \u2013 it's impossible to care about any of the characters. Think of films as varied as Markus Imhoof's _Das Boot ist voll_ (1980), Terry George's _Hotel Rwanda_ (2004), or Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki's _Le Havre_ (2011) and _Toivon tuolla puolen_ (2017). All depict refugees from various conflicts at various stages of their journeys, and all ring true emotionally, because they are populated by characters about whom we come to care. This is precisely what _Transit_ is lacking. There is simply no pathos, with none of the characters coming across as anything but a cipher, a representative archetype onto which Petzold can project his thematic concerns. With little in the way of psychological verisimilitude or interiority, they simply never come alive as real people.\r\n\r\nAn intellectual film rather than an emotional one, _Transit_ is cold and distant and has a hugely unimportant and out-of-place voiceover narration (although to be fair, the VO is the only thing which allows us access to Georg's feelings). And this coldness and distance has a cumulative effect, with the film eventually outlasting my patience. The temporal dissonance works extremely well, but it's really all the film has going for it. Petzold says some interesting things regarding the experience of refugees in the 21st century _vis-\u00e0-vis_ refugees of World War II, and the mirror he holds up to our society, showing us how such people are treated, isn't especially flattering. If only we could care about someone on screen. Anyone.","id":"5d96789f3bd26e13a4b62633","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d96789f3bd26e13a4b62633","movie_id":471853}
{"author":"lumenactus","content":"THIS IS A REVIEW REPRINTED FROM MovieCrypt by Kevin Ranson \r\n\r\n\"  Hardboiled detectives, femme fatales, and a mandatory MacGuffin are all part of the tradition we call film noir. \u201cGuns, dames, and hats\u201d are the order of the day in these brooding period pieces, a bygone era of Hollywood like westerns and musicals. There have been the occasional callbacks with films like L.A. Confidential, Sin City, and even the original Blade Runner repurposing it as a vision of the future \u2014 a detail mostly missing from the recent sequel. All of these undertakings require extensive budgets, finding or recreating the trappings and props of the time period, and to develop the visuals required to invoke the all-important atmosphere that defines the film style. Rarely are the words \u201cindependent\u201d and \u201cnoir\u201d uttered in reference to a feature-length film intended to celebrate and champion a new entry into this staple of the movie industry, but with the right combination of players, passion, and just long enough of a shoestring to fish spare change out of the sewer, can a compelling dark thriller become the end result?\r\n\r\nAs evidenced by Trouble Is My Business, the answer is a resounding \u201cyes.\u201d Less a passion project than a labor of love, writer-director-actor Thomas Konkle gathered the necessary ingredients and managed to draw forth a film by sheer force of will. With years involved in the writing, planning, independent and personal financing, and using every movie-making trick imaginable, Trouble is to film noir what Once Upon a Time in the West was to the western: the final word. With classic elements, a fresh cast, and painstaking detail, Konkle has created a world both familiar and new. Twists, betrayal, and mystery are finely intertwined with the wit, violence, and eventuality of the genre.\r\n\r\nLocations are important to a production like this, but what couldn\u2019t be found and rented had to be created \u2014 often digitally. While Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow buckled under the weight of \u201clook what we can do,\u201d Konkle puts his players in the foreground and allowed the story to dictate the effects, not the other way around. With talents like Jordana Capra as matriarch Evelyn Montemar and Vernon Wells as Detective Barry Tate, the production is nearly seemless and perhaps too-real in its detail, from meticulous editing to a sweeping soundtrack. It\u2019s clear what the filmmakers wanted this to become, and the time put into the post production shows what can be done with today\u2019s off-the-shelf filmmaking tools and the ingenuity of modern creators.\r\n\r\nOver the last five years, this reviewer has seen several independent productions shaped from concept to completion. From an old-time rocket ship carrying space rangers into the great beyond to a backwoods werewolf reneging on his deal with the devil, there\u2019s no shortage of imagination out there while Hollywood continues to reboot television and movie franchises they never understood to begin with. Trouble sets itself apart in both ambition and execution, and the risk yielded a great reward: a film deserving to be seen and appreciated.\"\r\n","id":"5ab30dd70e0a267e5b003435","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ab30dd70e0a267e5b003435","movie_id":513285}

However, as it turned out, this one I liked a lot as you can see from my rating.\r\n\r\nAs a computer nerd and science fiction geek this movie was of course right up my alley. I have thought other movies would be my kind of movies before but been sorely disappointed by ignorant and incompetent screen writers and directors trying to cash in on subjects that they knew absolutely nothing about. Spielberg did a good job of not screwing this one up.\r\n\r\nThe core of this movie is of course plenty of action and computer generated special effects with a somewhat apocalyptic story to bind everything together. The story works but it is not really anything special and some of the stuff, like the loyalty centers, was frankly a bit silly. But, as I wrote, it works and does not get in the way so that\u2019s good enough for me.\r\n\r\nAs the previously mentioned nerd and geek I absolutely loved the abundant references to science fiction, fantasy and gaming history and lore. For me those were soo cool. I will probably watch the movie again just to focus on the background and see how much stuff I can spot. Stuff that I missed when watching the movie the first time.\r\n\r\nThe CGI effects and the action was also pretty awesome. The movie starts off right away with a great and absolutely insanely wild car race and continues to go strong from there. The battle at Doom castle at the end is just epic.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that made me go WTF was at the end [SPOILER AHEAD] were Mr Asswipe Sorrento finally catches up with the High Five\u2019s van and the he just freezes and looks at Wade with a silly look on his face. What the fuck was that? Just stupid for no good reason.\r\n\r\nWell, few are the movies where there\u2019s nothing to gripe about. On the whole though this movie was great in my book. Also, I cannot say how pleased I am to finally watch a Hollywood movie that is not a remake or a sequel or a prequel or some other lame excuse to rehash a movie that has already been made.","id":"5ba74234c3a3680e52021def","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ba74234c3a3680e52021def","movie_id":333339}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Old-fashioned filmmaking with a progressive theme_**\r\n\r\n> _She looked at me and the expression on her face was an expression of dislike, one I hadn't seen before but knew right away. Later I would see it turned toward other people. But the first time was looking at me and was because she believed she'd done all she could that was correct and the best thing, and it had only gotten her stuck with me. And I couldn't do anything that mattered. Though if I could I would've had my father be there, or Warren Miller, or somebody who had the right words that would take the place of hers, anybody she_ _could speak to without just hearing her own voice in a room and having to go about the trouble of pretending she did not feel absolutely alone._\r\n\r\n- Richard Ford; _Wildlife_ (1990)\r\n\r\nThe directorial debut of actor Paul Dano, _Wildlife_ is based on the 1990 novel by Richard Ford, and is written for the screen by Dano and his girlfriend Zoe Kazan (with Dano also serving as producer, and Kazan as executive producer). Looking at the implosion of a family from the perspective of a 14-year-old member of said family, the film is thematically similar to Sam Mendes's _Revolutionary Road_ (it's at least partly about a couple falling out of love, and a marriage disintegrating), tonally similar to Derek Cianfrance's _Blue Valentine_ (a non-judgmental and regretful feeling pervades, with the film unwilling to cast either party as the villain), and aesthetically similar to the Texas scenes in Terrence Malick's _The Tree of Life_ (the period detail drips off the screen, whilst the use of a child as the focaliser colours much of what's depicted). And although _Wildlife_ is a piece of remarkably nostalgic filmmaking, at the same time, it tells somewhat of a progressive story. Subtly depicting an Americana on the cusp of massive social upheaval, the film demonstrates the uncertainty with which second-wave feminism manifested itself at a grassroots level prior to really taking off in 1963. Although it's essentially a character study, the film also suggests the 1950s-style clean-cut, neatly trimmed, rigidly defined way of life, built around the perfect nuclear family wherein a wife must be subservient to her husband, is about to become a thing of the past. Understated, restrained, narratively precise, but still granting the characters room to breathe, the film is emotional without being melodramatic, encouraging empathy without manipulating the audience. It does run the risk of seeming insurmountably old-fashioned to today's superhero-obsessed cinema goers, but, nevertheless, this is an accomplished piece of work for a first time director, suggesting Dano has been paying attention whilst working with auteurs such as Paul Thomas Anderson, Denis Villeneuve, Paolo Sorrentino, and Bong Joon-ho.\r\n\r\nSet in Great Falls, Montana in 1960, the film tells the story of the peripatetic Brinson family; father Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal), mother Jeannette (Carey Mulligan), and 14-year-old son Joe (Ed Oxenbould). Having moved to Montana due to financial problems, the family again finds itself in trouble when Jerry is fired from his job at a country club. Although the club asks him to return soon thereafter, his pride won't allow him, and he instead takes a position fighting a forest fire near the Canadian border for a dollar-an-hour. Meanwhile, Jeannette gets work as a swimming instructor, and Joe begins working part-time in a portrait photo parlour. When Jerry leaves to go north, Jeanette accuses him of abandoning the family, and, overnight, her behaviour changes dramatically; she starts to dress differently, to wear her hair differently, to speak differently, to cease doing housework, to talk ill of Jerry in front of Joe, etc. Striking up a friendship with one of her swimming students, Warren Miller (a superb Bill Camp), a wealthy World War II vet with a car dealership, who is clearly romantically interested in her despite the difference in their ages, Jeanette soon stops even trying to hide from Joe the fact that she is extremely unhappy with Jerry, and there may be no way to repair the damage.\r\n\r\nNestled behind that simple narrative are the fledgling social upheavals, still very much in their infancy, that would characterise the duration of the 1960s, particularly the notions of what a woman's role should be in the home and the very definition of family itself. Initially, Jeanette is depicted as a quintessential 1950s wife and mother, almost to the point of clich\u00e9; she cooks, cleans, washes the clothes, does the dishes, sees that Joe attend to his homework, and when Jerry loses his job, it is Jeanette who goes out looking for work for both of them. She knows that her (unspoken and unacknowledged) role in this patriarchal society is to hold the family together, and it's a role that is nothing like she thought it would be when she was younger. Although she and Jerry seem to love one another, or they certainly used to, she clearly feels trapped by her domestic situation, so when Jerry takes off in a misguided attempt to reaffirm his masculinity by fighting a forest fire, something in Jeanette either snaps, or clicks into place, depending on your perspective.\r\n\r\nHowever, although Jeanette may know she no longer wants to be a housewife, she has no idea what she does want, and her attempts to find out form the bulk of the narrative's conflict. Set three years prior to Betty Friedan's ground-breaking _The Feminine Mystique_ (1963), which redefined the parameters of all gender-based topics, depicting a society in which women were not content to do their husband's bidding, raise children, and stay quiet, Jeanette's story could very well have formed the template for Friedan's analysis. Suffocated by her current situation, she sees little hope of escape, until she realises the opportunity that Jerry leaving has presented to her.\r\n\r\nI've seen several reviewers criticise the fact Jeanette goes from dutiful mother and loyal wife to a no-longer-maternal and possible adulteress literally overnight. However, for me, the fact that the transformation happens so quickly is exactly the point; when she goes to bed, she's a wife and mother, trapped in her domestic environment, but when she wakes the next morning, she realises that she has an opportunity to escape, perhaps the best opportunity she will ever get. This has been building up for years, but she has gotten so used to feeling lost that when she gets a chance to change things, she doesn't even recognise it as such, at least not at first. Once she does, however, Jeanette makes a conscious decision to stop performing the role delegated by men. As much of the female population of the western hemisphere would be asking over the next ten or so years, Jeanette wants to know, \"_is this all there is?_\" She wants more than simply getting through the day. In this sense, she recalls Nora Helmer from Henrik Ibsen's _A Doll's House_ (1879), Laura Brown from Michael Cunningham's _The Hours_ (1998), or any number of Tennessee Williams heroines \u2013 a woman who wakes up to find she has become deeply unhappy despite attaining everything she once wanted, and who sets out to do whatever it takes to alter her course. Determined to forge a new identity, she is adamant she won't become one of the \"_standing dead_\" (the term used for trees that survive a forest fire). The question is, can she do so without completely destroying her family. The film may ostensibly be a coming-of-age drama, but Jeanette's existential crisis is the real meat and potatoes.\r\n\r\nThat all is not well in the Brinson household is hinted at in the opening scene, where Jerry and Jeanette have a couple of inconsequential but noticeable disagreements over dinner (such as whether Joe should continue pursuing football). This scene establishes an assuredness and subtlety-of-hand that lasts for the entire film, with Dano's directorial work proving unexpectedly sophisticated. For example, something he does several times is have characters walk off-screen to speak, whilst keeping the camera trained on Joe as he tries to listen, with the dialogue barely perceptible from just off the edge of the frame. As well as being an excellent use of off-screen space, something you don't see too often, this technique ties us rigidly to Joe's POV early on, inculcating us into his worldview. Another very nice piece of direction is an early montage cutting between Jeanette riding her bike, Jerry driving the car, and Joe riding the bus, in which each character is facing a different direction, each in isolation from the other two. It's basic cinematic shorthand, showing instead of telling, but it's very well done. Equally impressive is the penultimate scene, where Dano uses the windows of the Brinson house to block the characters in such a way as to suggest both their inner emotions, and the prevailing theme at this point of the film. For the most part, however, Dano's direction is invisible, relying far more on static painterly compositions than camera movement (which is not to say the camera _never_ moves). In this sense, Diego Garc\u00eda's cinematography is not that different from what Joe himself is doing at his part-time job, something which again reinforces his subjective viewpoint.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, from an aesthetic point of view, the film's period detail is superb, with Akin McKenzie's production design, Miles Michael's art direction, and Amanda Ford's costume design absolutely immaculate. The school desks, the leg brace Miller wears, the supermarket layout, the radio, every detail seems utterly authentic. There is also an unnerving sense of calm throughout the whole film, but the kind of calm that seems posed to erupt into something undesirable at any time. Everything is measured and exact to the point where I was reminded of the work of Edward Hopper multiple times, particularly something like _Chop Suey_ (1929) or _Room in New York_ (1932).\r\n\r\nThe acting, as you would expect, is universally superb. On paper, Jeanette and Miller are very much the villains of the piece, but Mulligan and Camp's performances are so full of warmth and genuine emotion that you simply can't look at them as antagonists, and the film itself never judges them. I've been a big fan of Camp since his brilliant turn as Frank Nitti in Michael Mann's _Public Enemies_ (2009), and with films like this and his Emmy nominated performance in _The Night Of_ (2016), it's terrific to see him start to get the kudos he deserves. He's especially good in the scene where he tells Joe a story about switching off the engine of his airplane in mid-air so he could glide silently with a flock of geese. It could be a narcissistic boast, it could be a metaphorical bit of advice, it could be an attempt to win Joe over, or it could simply be a way to try to connect. In Camp's hands, it's all of these, and more, playing Miller as both a letch but also someone in possession of an innate kindness, not an easy balancing act to pull off by any means.\r\n\r\nMulligan, for her part, plays Jeanette as utterly weary, much older than her years, at times fragile, at times rock solid, both vulnerable and manipulative. Full of anger, she simply can't hold in her emotions any more. Unfortunately, in letting them out, she betrays Joe by forgetting he is only 14-years-old. When she starts drunkenly dancing with him at Miller's house, the scene is deeply uncomfortable, but Mulligan's performance is such that we don't condemn her, at least, not completely. She never allows the audience to lose sight of the fact that although she is behaving rather poorly, she is a prisoner, and is reacting against her restraints as best she can.\r\n\r\nGyllenhaal's performance is more understated than Mulligan's, but no less impressive. Playing Jerry as someone who likes a drink, perhaps a little too much, he is the kind of person who blames everybody else for everything, and refuses to see the bad in himself \u2013 he bitterly tells Joe he was fired from the country club \"_because people like me too much_.\" Dano is also astute enough to give his actors plenty of room to react (which obviously comes from his own acting background). A great deal of time is spent showing characters looking, listening, thinking etc, acting via silence, which is not something you see a lot of these days.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are a few problems. Essentially a tale of marital angst, the narrative is not especially original \u2013 we've seen this story before, many times in fact, and for all the craft on display, Dano never really manages to say anything wholly original. Additionally, his measured direction is also too good in places \u2013 everything is so ordered, neat, and trim, that at times, the milieu doesn't seem lived-in, but more an abstract concept of what the period was like. The film could do with being a little messier in places, both in terms of direction and in terms of what's actually on-screen. Additionally, there are a few lines that sound great on paper, but which are just not the kind of things one says in real life. For example, Jeanette tells Joe, \"_I feel like I need to wake up, but I don't know what from, or what to_\". Later she says, \"_I wish I was dead. If you have a better plan for me, tell me. Maybe it'll be better than this_\". This kind of dialogue seems more interested in hitting thematic waypoints than developing character beats. Similarly, late in the film, Jerry says to Joe, \"_It's a wild life. Isn't it, son?_\" Proclaiming the film's title in this context doesn't even remotely work, and the line feels totally out of place, to the point of ripping you out of the narrative.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, _Wildlife_ is about how society was changing in 1960, and on the other, about how that change manifests itself within the Brinson family. Yes, it's another \"death of the American dream\" story in a long line of such films, but here, the focus is, for the most part, on character rather than theme, with Jeanette functioning in kind of a synecdochical manner; our specific entry point, she is the individual that facilitates an examination of the masses. And yes, Dano may take his eye off the ball a couple of times, with the odd bit of clunky dialogue, and a somewhat too picture-postcard perfection, but all in all, this is an excellent directorial debut.","id":"5d0c2c83c3a36836b71fc6c6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d0c2c83c3a36836b71fc6c6","movie_id":417812}
{"author":"mram16","content":"This film contains two movies, and I enjoyed one of them:\r\n\r\nWidows is the story of a trio of...well, widows, who hatch a scheme to pull off a heist. The reason why the widows choose to pull off this heist in the first place is a threat by gangster-turned-political-hopeful Jamal Manning (played by Brian Tyree Henry). It was his money that the deceased husbands of the women were trying to steal before dying in an explosion set off by a hail of police bullets. The money burned up in the flames, and he wants to be repaid. Veronica Rawlings (played by Viola Davis) comes into possession of the plans for a future robbery that her husband Harry (played by Liam Neeson) was planning, and with no other options she and the other women decide to use the plans to commit the robbery themselves in order to pay off the debt (with plenty of money left over).\r\n\r\nThe cast does a commendable job, with particularly good performances put forth by Viola Davis and Elizabeth Debicki as two of the titular widows, Cynthia Erivo as the babysitter for a third widow (played by Michelle Rodriguez) who gets brought into the scheme, and Get Out's Daniel Kaluuya as a cold-blooded henchman who doesn't need to walk around screaming and shouting in order to be terrifying. Also worth a mention is Robert Duvall, who may not be in the movie a whole lot but is memorable nonetheless. The film is shot well by cinematographer Sean Bobbitt, with one standout scene being the short drive taken by Colin Farrell's Chicago Machine political candidate from an area of blight to the nice, quiet street that he lives on at the edge of the ward where he hopes to be elected as alderman over his opponent (Manning). The camera watches as rundown inner-city buildings give way to nice houses that wouldn't seem out of place in a tidy little suburb.\r\n\r\nFor a while it is interesting to watch as the women, who were not involved in their respective husbands' lives of crime, try to ready themselves for the heist. Midway through the film, however, there's a surprise reveal. I said in the title of this review that this film contained two movies, one that I liked I liked. The movie that I liked ended with this \"twist\", and this is where the movie that I didn't like began. Not only is the twist totally unnecessary, but the film just seems to go downhill from there. The women, whose robbing skills seemed understandably shoddy up to this point, suddenly seem to work together like a well-oiled machine. There are more twists thrown into the mix (such as the identity of the person they will be stealing from). The fate of the Rawlings' son, hinted at earlier in the movie. is revealed in a poorly executed scene. The climax of the film feels like a second-rate action flick, and the playing-out of the big twist revealed earlier in the film feels contrived. Then the film ends in a, \"Really, that's how they're going to end this?\" way.\r\n\r\nI don't hate this film (faint praise, I know), but I feel that there was so much wasted opportunity. If only they had kept making the movie from the first half of this film I could have given it a higher rating, but as it stands I give it a 6 out of 10.","id":"5bf71ee29251415ccc0d1632","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bf71ee29251415ccc0d1632","movie_id":401469}

That means you need a big white star._\r\n\r\n- \"Steve McQueen and Viola Davis on Hollywood, Race and Power\" (Reggie Ugwu); _The New York Times_ (November 15, 2018)\r\n\r\nArguably the most ambitious heist movie since _Heat_ (1995), just as did Michael Mann's genre (re)defining epic, _Widows_ has aspirations far beyond the limits of its generic template. Written by Steve McQueen and Gillian Flynn, and directed by McQueen, the film is based on the 12-episode British TV series of the same name written by Lynda La Plante, which aired on ITV in 1983 and 1985 (a six-episode sequel series, _She's Out_, aired in 1995, and the original series was unsuccessfully remade as a four-episode miniseries on ABC in 2002). McQueen's first two films, _Hunger_ and _Shame_, were two of the finest films of 2008 and 2011, respectively, but I'm pretty sure I'm the only person on the planet who didn't like his third, the recipient of the 2014 Academy Award for Best Picture \u2013 _12 Years a Slave_. Reading around some of the professional reviews of _Widows_, I seem to again find myself very much in the minority regarding a McQueen film; it has been very well received (91% approval on Rotten Tomatoes at time of writing), but I was left distinctly underwhelmed. Operating firmly within a genre framework, the film essentially tries to filter the basic heist template through a feminist pseudo-#MeToo prism, taking in such side-issues as political corruption, police homicide, Black Lives Matter, institutional racism, American gun culture, hegemonic masculinity, and the importance of wealth. McQueen approaches genre much like Michael Mann, as opposed to, say, Quentin Tarantino, using the generic template as a launch-pad to examine various socio-political issues, as opposed to using it as a destination in and of itself. The problem, however, is that he tries to pack far too much into too short a space of time. Whilst I can certainly appreciate and celebrate how progressive the narrative is, placing a black woman at the centre of a genre traditionally dominated by white men, the film still needs to work as a genre piece, or no amount of moralising, didacticism, polemics, or political grandstanding can save it. And this is where _Widows_ fails most egregiously \u2013 the core genre elements are as far-fetched and ridiculous as anything you're likely to see out of mainstream Hollywood, which serves to undermine and dilute the serious topicality for which McQueen is obviously striving.\r\n\r\nSet in Chicago, the film's protagonist is Veronica Rawlings (Viola Davis), an officer with the Chicago Teachers Union, married to career criminal Harry (Liam Neeson). Although she is not involved in his business, she knows what he does, and is happy to look the other way, allowing the couple to live a life of relative luxury. As the film begins, Harry and his crew, Carlos Perelli (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), Florek Gunner (Jon Bernthal), and Jimmy Nunn (Coburn Gross), are fleeing from the police after a heist gone bad, a chase which ends in a shoot-out during which their van explodes, killing all four. Meanwhile, Jamal Manning (Bryan Tyree Henry), a local crime boss, has decided to run for alderman of the 18th Ward against Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell, with the strangest Chicagoan accent you've ever heard), the son of retiring incumbent alderman Tom Mulligan (Robert Duvall, chewing scenery from scenes in which he doesn't even appear). Although the Mulligan family has controlled the 18th for over 60 years, due to a recent redrawing of the city's constitutional borders, Jack finds himself having to campaign in the poor black neighbourhoods which his father never had to worry about, thus giving Jamal a shot in the election. This connects up to the main plot insofar as Harry's fatal last job was stealing $2 million from Manning and his psychotic enforcer brother Jatemme (an ice-cold Daniel Kaluuya), cash which burnt up in the explosion. A few days after Harry's funeral, Jamal gives Veronica one month to liquidate her assets so as to pay him back. However, she discovers Harry's notebook, which contains a detailed plan for a heist worth $5 million. Deciding to use the notebook to carry out the heist, she recruits Linda Perelli (Michelle Rodriguez), whose store has been repossessed to cover Carlos's gambling debts, and Alice Gunner (Elizabeth Debicki, in the film's standout performance), whose odious mother, Agnieska (Jacki Weaver) has pushed her into high-end prostitution. She also approaches Amanda Nunn (a criminally underused Carrie Coon). However, with a four-month-old baby to look after, and reasonably secure finances, Amanda is reluctant to get involved. Still needing a fourth person, Linda recruits her babysitter, Belle (Cynthia Erivo), about which Veronica isn't thrilled, but with no other options, and the night of the heist rapidly approaching, she acquiesces.\r\n\r\nAs this plot outline should make very clear, _Widows_ is pure pulp, albeit pulp with something on its mind. McQueen's first genre film, he approaches it with the same seriousness with which he approached political protest, sexual addiction, and slavery. Obviously not especially interested in making what he sees as a generic crime thriller about bereft women taking matters into their own hands (which is about as political as the original series got), he and Flynn use the material as a vehicle for a racially-tinted critique of both powerful men (who are mainly, but not exclusively, white) and the corrupt systems that enable them. By creating a canvas depicting life at various social strata in Chicago \u2013 from the inherited white privilege of Jack Mulligan to the materialistic social trappings so important to Veronica, from the poor black neighbourhoods of the Manning family to the \"_everything is a transaction_\" philosophy of high-powered real-estate \u2013 the film attempts to address a plethora of racial, political, and gender issues. With this kind of Richard Price-style cross-section of an urban _milieu_, _Widows_ reminded me a little of _The Wire_. However, whereas David Simon, Ed Burns, _et al_ had 60 episodes to depict Baltimorean drug dealers, dock workers, politicians, educators, and journalists, McQueen and Flynn have just over two hours, and the results are concomitantly streamlined.\r\n\r\nAnd herein lies one of the film's biggest problems. Rather than trying to deal with one or two core issues with something resembling thoroughness, it instead tries to deal with upwards of about seven, and ends up saying little of relevance about any. There's gender, economics, politics, racism, police corruption, prostitution, gun culture, materialism, etc. It often feels as if McQueen and Flynn were simply throwing ideas against a wall to see what stuck, especially when you consider just how little attention some of these themes receive, making you wonder why they're there at all. Gun culture, for example, is really only addressed when Alice is assigned the task of buying the team's weapons. Asking where she is supposed to go to get guns, she is told simply and unironically, \"_this is America_\", a wink-and-a-nod point which relies almost entirely on the audience's left-leaning political affiliations. Another example is that of racially-motivated police homicide, a theme which feels especially shoehorned in. Several years prior to the film, Veronica and Harry\u2019s teenage son, Marcus (Josiah Sheffie), was shot and killed by a white police officer at a routine traffic stop. And that's about it really. Marcus does factor into the film's big twist (kind of), but the racial overtones of his killing are never brought up again, and it remains unclear what McQueen is trying to say with this underdeveloped subplot. And ultimately, with so much thematic material competing for attention, much of it disconnected from the containing narrative, it's hard to focus.\r\n\r\nWhich is not to say, of course, that none of the film's themes are foregrounded. Gender, for example, is built into the plot, especially in relation to notions of subverting the patriarchal status quo. As they prepare the heist, Veronica tells the team that their greatest strength is the element of surprise, because \"_no one thinks we have the balls to pull this off_\". Later, she reminds them they have \"_to look and move like a team of men_\". Whilst on the heist itself, they have to disguise their voices so no one realises they are women. Similarly front-and-centre is the theme of race relations, something introduced in the opening frames \u2013 an above-the-bed shot of Harry and Veronica engaged in some _very_ heavy petting. Whilst promoting the film, Viola Davis has spoken a lot about how unusual it is to open a film with an interracial pseudo-sex scene, and she's right about that; even in a world which celebrates something like Jeff Nichols's _Loving_ (2016), interracial couples are still relatively rare on-screen, especially sexually active older couples (speaking at a Q&A screening of the film in LA, Davis said,\r\n\r\n> _I don't care how much people say they're committed to inclusivity \u2013 they're not committed to that; the opening shot in this movie where you have a dark-skinned woman with a big nose and wide lips and all of that, and her natural hair, kissing \u2013 romantically kissing a white man onscreen._\r\n\r\nRace is also dealt with via several references to Albert Woodfox, one of the so-called Angola Three, and a man who spent 43 years in solitary confinement in Louisiana State Penitentiary, from April 1972 until June 2015. Woodfox is actually quoted on a radio report to which Jatemme is listening, discussing what it feels like to realise that \"_nothing you do is gonna change your situation_.\" Of course, this is _exactly_ what the widows are trying to do (and, in a far less noble, though arguably far more legal sense, so too is Jamal).\r\n\r\nAnother excellent shot that carries huge thematic importance, this time in relation to city-wide macroeconomics, can be seen when Jack and his assistant, Siobhan (Molly Kunz), travel from a poor black neighbourhood to the affluent white suburb in which his campaign headquarters is situated. Filmed in one of McQueen's patented single-takes, what's especially interesting here is that after Farrell and Kunz get into the car, we can hear them, but we can't see them \u2013 regular McQueen cinematographer Sean Bobbitt (_The Place Beyond the Pines_; _Kill the Messenger_; _Stronger_) leaves his camera fixed on the bonnet, with only a portion of the windshield and one of the side-mirrors visible. Meanwhile, we see the city rapidly change in real-time in the background, taking only a couple of minutes to go from skid row to millionaire's row. McQueen's unusual camera placement forces the audience to acknowledge just how thin the line is, geographically speaking, between rich and poor (recalling that great quote from Bubbles (Andre Royo) in the first season of _The Wire_; \"thin line between heaven an' here\"). At the same time, of course, the ideological divide is massive.\r\n\r\nOf vital importance to this particular theme (the vast differences between the haves and have-nots) are the Mulligans. Robert Duvall plays Tom Mulligan as a closet racist (and sometimes he doesn't bother with the closet); an old-school politician who believes that whoever can grease the most palms and line the most pockets should become the most powerful. An angry vestige of a dying era, Tom resents the fact that a Mulligan must slum it to win black votes. Of course, Jack is no angel (he starts a program to get minority women back to work by making it easier for them to open businesses, from which he then takes a cut), but he is smart enough to recognise that the era of men like his father is over. I'm not sure if Duvall's over-the-top performance is the best thing about the film, or one of the worst; in one scene, during an intense argument with Jack, Tom _quite literally_ starts frothing at the mouth, and no one comments on it. He's just that type of character, and the film gleefully embraces his particular brand of crazy, often pushing scenes between him and Jack a beat or two beyond the point where they reach what should be their natural conclusion. For example, when Tom scoffs at the abstract painting on Jack's wall, and mocks his son for spending $50,000 on \"_wallpaper_,\" Jack retorts, \"_it's art_\", to which Tom growls, \"_wallpaper_.\" This is where a normal film would end the exchange, but _Widows_ allows each man another salvo; \"_Art_!\" says a frustrated Jack. \"_Wall. Paper_,\" replies Tom, steadfastly refusing to back down. It's wonderfully uncomfortable, and you get the sense this is not the first such allegorical exchange between these two, with the scene speaking to the relationship between money and power at the centre of the Mulligan subplot.\r\n\r\nA less signposted, but equally as important theme is the corruption, dishonesty, and mercenary-like behaviour endemic to all levels of society. The most obvious examples of this are probably the political corruption of the Mulligans and the street thuggery of the Manning brothers, but there are many more examples throughout the film. For example, the Chicago PD doesn't have much of a presence, with the main representative, Det. Fuller (Michael Harney) appearing in only two scenes as your basic corrupt movie-cop, Elsewhere, Linda is entrapped by the corruption of the loan sharks who buy her husband's gambling debt, Alice by her mother, who forces her into prostitution, and by David (Lukas Haas), the real-estate agent who pays for her services, and even Veronica, by Harry's chosen career path and the dangers to which it has exposed her. Really, the only man in the film who isn't corrupt in some way is Bash (Garret Dillahunt), Harry's loyal-to-a-fault working-stiff chauffeur, but even he (like Veronica and the rest of the widows) lives off the proceeds of crime. The system may be built on a foundation of toxic patriarchy (a very different thing to toxic masculinity), but the women are no angels in this _milieu_; no one is immune to the corrupting influence of socio-political norms. This is a world in which David's philosophy (\"_everything is a transaction_\") is universally subscribed to; for better or worse, people are either bought outright or sell off pieces of themselves.\r\n\r\nFor me though, the whole thing was underwhelming and predictable, with a twist that's as ridiculous as they come, and a narrative that relies far too much on coincidence and movie-logic. The widows need to disguise their voices on the job? Good thing that Belle's daughter has a gizmo that does exactly that! A highly successful modern-day thief who writes everything down longhand? A team of people (irrespective of gender and race) who become experts in something as complex as pulling off a major heist in a matter of weeks (what is this, _Battlefield Earth_)? For all its real-world social and political concerns, I never once bought into the central premise, that these four women could actually pull this off, and that undermines everything else. Much as David Simon has always argued _The Wire_ was about the quintessential American City, McQueen is here attempting to tell a story much larger than the sum of its parts. However, unlike the Baltimore of _The Wire_ (or the LA of _Heat_), McQueen's Chicago doesn't feel lived in (as opposed to say, Michael Mann's depiction of the same city in _Thief_); it feels like someone's idea of a city rather than an actual depiction of that city.\r\n\r\nJust because a film addresses certain themes doesn't mean it earns a free pass (\"_look, Hollywood cares about poor people; we better not criticise the ridiculous plot_\"), and from a narrative standpoint, _Widows_ is pretty ludicrous. With the plot often feeling contorted to support the themes, rather than the themes arising from the plot, McQueen's didactic and polemic concerns seem to have overridden his abilities as a storyteller. More a vehicle for protestation than anything else, that it tries to cover so many topics makes the whole experience emotionless, as if the filmmakers were dispassionately working off a checklist of issues on which to touch, rather than allowing the plot to organically lead into those issues. As I mentioned above, for this kind of film to work, the central heist narrative must be able to stand on its own, and this one most definitely cannot, which works to flatten and neuter the very real criticisms that the film is so concerned with enunciating. The socio-political commentary, for the most part, is never really integrated into the narrative \u2013 so you end up with a film that feels like its preaching at you rather than talking to you, light on emotion and dramatic verisimilitude, but top-heavy with moral superiority. If it had embraced its genre a bit more, and eased back on the homiletics, it would have worked much better, not just as a genre exercise, but, perhaps more importantly, as political commentary. As it is, it's a very good-looking but unoriginal, and at times, outright dumb movie, that seems to always assume its intellectual ascendency to the audience.","id":"5d12a3bbc3a368128121698b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d12a3bbc3a368128121698b","movie_id":401469}
{"author":"Bhargavi Chandrashekar","content":"Sometime time back, I had mentioned that Tagaru will be a perfect launch for Dhananjaya to pull him into the big league. His immense talent was either less utilized or went unnoticed.\r\n\r\nSuri, is a character based Director and casted Dhananjaya perfectly for Daali character in this latest film Tagaru and the result is impactful or has he unleashed a star-villain for Kannada films but care should be taken that Dhananjaya shouldn\u2019t be type casted as he is a star material and will only glide in leaps if the able directors uses his talent properly in future. for both, Tagaru happens to be the 9th film of their careers respectively and their maiden partnership struck the goldmine.\r\n\r\nFor Suri, Casting such a mammoth star cast with equally talented ones was one of the biggest coups he did in his career. Suri, is a director who very well knows his ability and invests heavily on his craft with all the available resources within his confines. When he made Kendsampige he had to sell off his property to produce it and the outcome was altogether new experience for the audience.\r\n\r\nThe story of Tagaru is simple and linear. It\u2019s the operation of cleansing society by eliminating the gangsters of same group but what awe-struck the audience is the presentation of the subject ,screenplay, crisp dialogues, razor-sque editing and placing the scenes in a jumbled way which soars and scores heavily and something that reminds of Upendra\u2019s style of film making.\r\n\r\nSuri with Tagaru once again ventures into the underworld genre. This genre has been his forte ever since his debut and every time he makes a film in this genre it has a detailing and exploration of the darker side of the society but he makes exception this time by planting a cop in this underworld saga and allows a game between cat and mice.\r\n\r\nIf the first half goes on killing spree, spilling blood on each frame, depicting grey activities of underworld and placing all the scenes randomly making the audience a bit of restless to connect all the non linear dots linearly; then the second half is all about powerful performances and letting away the plot to thicken giving time for the audience to understand the reasons for restlessness in the first half.\r\n\r\nShivarajkumar is on winning spree these days. He tasted success with Bangara S\/o Bangarada Manushya, stamped impeccable authority on Mufti as a Gang-lord and now with Tagaru as a shrewd Cop dominates and completely owns the second half sheerly through his stone faced expressions, dialogues and action. While Dhananjaya as an antagonist largely dominates the screen space every time he comes on it. Every scene of the film gets loud cheer for the mass appeal provided.\r\n\r\nThe duel between Shivanna and Dhananjaya is a treat, then comes the Combination of Vasishta and Dhananjaya who complements equally and both acted dreadfully by entering the souls of their characters. Though the character of Vasishta as Chitte overshadowed by Dhananjaya\u2019s Dolly but he still holds the ground and etches his visbility. Bhavana\u2013Manvitha are apt, veteran Devaraj is under-utilized and the character Uncle is non-impactful.\r\n\r\nThe film completely banks on the screenplay, impactful dialogues, razor sharp editing, pulsating background score and soulful music.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, some of the grey scenes could have been avoided, story could have been a little more tighter, road journey scenes could have been precise in the first half.\r\n\r\nThe tireless work of the Technical departments are visible, special mention for Mahendra Simha\u2019s cinematography and Deepu S. Kumar\u2019s editing; while Charanraj has become the new sensation through his music and background score.\r\n\r\nSuri once again collaborated with Shivanna, after making a critically well claimed Kaddipudi, and he knew he not only had to surpass the previous expectations but also had to give bigger; thereby ends up gifting himself the biggest blockbuster of his directorial career. His saga of living the open ended climaxes (Kaddipudi \u2013 Alpa Virama, Kendsampige \u2013 Part 1 \u2013 kaage Bangara and now Tagaru \u2013 2) just continues. For his talent, Suri should move away from underworld genre and try in different genres as well.","id":"5def3f45688cd000142181df","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5def3f45688cd000142181df","movie_id":510568}

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"Tau artificially misuses its intelligence through undeveloped triangular concepts. Remember \u2018Ex Machina\u2019? The simple concept of questioning the state of existence between humanity and artificial intelligence. Whether a sentient entity can reach transcendence or remain restrained within the limitations of their code. How about \u2018Her\u2019? Injecting emotional resonance to the artificial intelligence by making them sound and feel almost human. Two stellar features that illustrate the experimentation of AI capabilities. Then comes Netflix\u2019 exclusive Tau. A streetwise woman kidnapped and secluded as a test subject for a scientist who is researching the human mind in order to produce AI.\r\n\r\nA cross between an Escape Room game, any kidnapping crime thriller and conscientious existentialism. The problem with this interpretation of said intellectual code, is it\u2019s boring. Vehemently dull to the point where you are wanting something to take you by surprise. Wishing for some sort of twist to smack you across the face with robotic hands. It\u2019s by-the-number narratively speaking. Woman is kidnapped, woman must try to escape the clutches of Skrein\u2019s mundanely miscasted scientist, where woman then befriends a wall by reading poetry and listening to classical music. What\u2019s on this wall you may ask? A triangle.\r\n\r\nMuch like \u2018Oblivion\u2019, this three-sided geometric shape is now associated with sentience. Relating to the Illuminati perhaps? Regardless, does not matter. For the vast majority of the second and third act, Monroe\u2019s gloriously wasted talents were used to humanise this floating triangle, which for all intents and purposes, actually works in conjuring an emotional connection. Then, before the shoddily explosive conclusion that diminished the semi-intellectual approach beforehand, Pyramid Head has code randomly removed (because that\u2019s how computing works...) and so all characterisation that was meticulously built up for the past forty minutes, dissolved into nothingness. Poof! Gone!\r\n\r\nTau, the actual name of the musically-inclined triangle, was the only \u201ccharacter\u201d to have significant development. Even when it attempts to question humanity and what it means to be a \u201cperson\u201d in the most basic form available. Monroe\u2019s expositional memory flashbacks? Nope. Skrein\u2019s constant moping around? Nah. So to essentially erase Tau\u2019s character was frustrating more than anything. It made the entire conclusion worthless and one-dimensional. The visual effects and overall production were decent considering the small budget, replicating modernised architecture exquisitely. Which further infuriates me due to the lack of care that went into the plot, characters and inconsiderate pacing. Cold as code!\r\n\r\nAdmittedly I did nearly fall asleep due to the repetitious nature of the narrative, mostly consisting of Skrein failing to meet a deadline whilst Monroe begs Mr. Triangle to let her escape willingly. So I guess if you\u2019re having trouble sleeping, and you desire a quick remedy, stick on Tau.","id":"5e206914b3316b0013033053","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e206914b3316b0013033053","movie_id":411143}
{"author":"LachieD","content":"Another film by Lars von Trier done very much in the flavor of his previous picture, Nymphomaniac. It is, in my opinion, much less uneven and messy, but still too undisciplined to feel fully realized and satisfying. It ranges from brilliant to dubious constantly, while Nymphomaniac, despite also containing brilliant segments, sinks to cringe-worthy more than once.\r\n\r\nSimilarly to Nymphomaniac, where our main character is exploring a central part of her personality, in the case of that film her sexuality, by confessing her history to another character, all intertwined with commentary from philosophy and religion, here it's a murderer confessing the central part of his personality, his killer nature, to another character, all again mixed with dialogues on philosophy, art, etc. So in the style and approach the films are quite similar. Maybe even more that I would prefer, because Nymphomaniac didn't rub well off me, as the premise took precedence over proper story development.\r\n\r\nThe story in The House That Jack Built again is told in episodic manner, here even more so with the narrative being split into separate \"incidents\", and it often feels too artificial, staged, and improbable. I'm not sure how much this was premeditated and intentional. As I already mentioned, it feels too often quite implausible and ridiculous. It makes you question director's true intentions with this approach. Is he toying with the nature of the film medium, with audience expectations, or is simply using this narrative instrument to make a statement on art and (his own) filmmaking? It's hard to say. The approach however, has a quite potent result, which is in my opinion accidental. It tapped on that feeling of reality being stranger than fiction, and that impression of life being utterly indifferent to people doing evil things. But how the movie was executed, it makes you feel that this aspect of the film was a mere accident of the director's approach, and not a fully realized vision. As previously noted, the script veers into absurd one too many times for this sense of reality being stranger than fiction to have a chance to establish a footing, or simply, too feel convincing and compelling. As maybe it should have been. From the technical standpoint, I've found the usage of shaky cam very innapropriate for the story being potrayed and rather detrimental to the enjoyability of the film. But missed opportunities in the script feel more jarring to me, to be terribly bothered with this specific directorial choice.\r\n\r\nIt is definitely a more satisfying film than Nymphomaniac, but again feels too sketchy, too undisciplined, it's hard to embrace it. Despite being a fan of self-referential, meta filmmaking, I think this specific approach does this film a disservice. A more subtle, distanced angle, would do this story, keeping the same structure, wonders. It just so obvious that von Trier has the chops for a much more compelling film. You can sense is so many times during the course of this film, that you feel frustrated witnessing how he opts for another direction repeatedly.\r\n\r\nLars von Trier is a marvelous director, a talented visionary willing to tap into uncharted territories, and because of his prestige he is able to secure solid budgets for his film projects, as well as A listers probably doing the work for a discount, just to be in a Lars von Trier film. In that sense, his every new project is an exciting event for any film buff. But after these last two endeavors, I'm personally starting to lose interest. I'm simply convinced that discipline is important in art, and von Trier, at the current stage of his artistic career, chooses to blatantly disregard it, with weak results.\r\n\r\nWorth being seen, but don't expect to be very impressed.","id":"5c23a3be0e0a264ddef19baf","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c23a3be0e0a264ddef19baf","movie_id":398173}

The transitions from one scene to another was a bit off and the story overall had a more fantasy tone over the more grounded and realistic tone The Conjuring and Annabelle movies had. Much of the story felt like it was just forced to setup a shot or scene which does hurt it. It isn't a perfect movie but I'd watch it again. It is like Indiana Jones meets Silent Hill.

{"author":"mram16","content":"Lackluster entry in the Millennium film series:\r\n\r\nA solid performance by Claire Foy (First Man, Unsane) can't do much to elevate a weak script that, quite often, not only asks you to suspend your disbelief, but to abandon your disbelief altogether.\r\n\r\nThis film is based on the fourth of five books (to date) in the popular \"Millennium\" series of novels, which happens to be the first of the books written by author David Lagercrantz after the passing of original author Stieg Larsson. The first three books were adapted into a trilogy of films in their native Sweden (all of which were released in 2009), and the first book, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, was given an American adaptation helmed by David Fincher in 2011.\r\n\r\nThe story of the newest entry in the film series revolves around a top-secret program called Firefall, which would allow whoever wields it to take control of the world's nuclear weapons. The program was designed by Frans Balder (Stephen Merchant), who has a young autistic son. Balder, having come to realize that the program is too dangerous for any government to control, contacts super-hacker Lisbeth Salander (Foy), asking for her help to find and destroy the program. Unknown to them,however, a mysterious group known only as the Spiders are also after the program. Salander receives help along the way from good friend Mikael Blomkvist (Sverrir Gudnason), a journalist working for Millennium magazine (from which the book series gets its name). In the meantime, Lisbeth's attempt to acquire the Firefall program leads American National Security Agency security expert Edwin Needham (LaKeith Stanfield) to travel to Sweden in hopes of tracking her down.\r\n\r\nAction abounds, and as the film progresses we learn the identity of the leader of the Spiders, a secret tied to Salander's murky past. Eventually all parties converge on a house in the mountains that is all-too-familiar to Salander, where the film's climax plays out.\r\n\r\nThe film appears to retcon certain details from the previous films (e.g. Blomkvist is younger than he should be), which can be off-putting to those familiar with those films.. Vicky Krieps, who audiences may remember from her fantastic performance in 2017's Phantom Thread, is wasted in a brief appearance as Millennium's publisher Erika Berger. While Salander has been established as a first-class hacker in previous films (as well as in the books on which they're based), here her hacking skills often reach levels of unbelievability. An example of this: in one scene Salander hacks into a car's systems while actively pursuing in another car.\r\n\r\nIn the end we are left with a film that could have been greater than it is, but which was hobbled by a poor script filled with overly convenient contrivances. The film's one saving grace is Foy, who does the most with what she is given.","id":"5bf71e069251417c1d069ba5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bf71e069251417c1d069ba5","movie_id":446807}

As much an interrogation of his own dark psychology as an \"up yours\" to his detractors and the oft-levelled accusations of misogyny and nihilism, von Trier all but _dares_ you to be offended, whether by the violence done to a duckling, the cold-blooded murder of children, the verbal degradation of a woman, the critique of the #MeToo movement, the celebration of Albert Speer, or the mockery of American gun culture. Partially self-reflexive in nature, the film suggests a parallel between murder and artistic creation, with von Trier offering more of an _apologia_ than an apology for his oeuvre. When he's really on his game - _Breaking the Waves_ (1996), _Dancer in the Dark_ (2000), _Dogville_ (2003), _Antichrist_ (2009), _Melancholia_ (2011) - von Trier is capable of depicting horrific violence alongside psychologically complex characters and scenes of devastating emotional veracity. _House_, which is far too long and tends towards self-indulgence, doesn't come anywhere near those heights, and is thus more open to accusations of empty provocation, but von Trier has definitely tapped into \"something\" here, and, love it or hate it, you _will_ react to it.\r\n\r\nAs the film begins, we hear (but don't see) a conversation between Jack (an emotionless Matt Dillon) and \"Verge\" (the always superb Bruno Ganz) as Jack attempts to defend and justify his serial killing. Choosing to discuss five random but illustrative \"incidents\" over a period of twelve years during the 70s and 80s, the subsequent film is divided into six sections (\"1st Incident\", \"2nd Incident\" etc., and \"Epilogue: Katabasis\"). A wannabe architect whose mother forced him to be an engineer, Jack, who suffers from OCD, contends that his murders are literal works of art, and has given himself the moniker \"Mr Sophistication\". And short of describing each incident, that's about it as far as plot is concerned, although it certainly wouldn't hurt to be at least partially familiar with the work of William Blake and the _Inferno_ book of Dante Alighieri's _Divina Commedia_ (1320).\r\n\r\n_The House That Jack Built_ was originally developed as a TV miniseries by von Trier and Jenle Hallund, who has a \"Story By\" credit on the final film. Premi\u00e8ring out of competition at Cannes 2018, it was the first time von Trier had been to the festival since receiving a \"lifetime\" ban in 2011 for making ill-judged comments about sympathising with Hitler. Not that he is saying sorry, of course; how could he be when the film extols the work of Albert Speer, and lauds the design perfection of the Stuka dive bomber. The first film in Cannes history to feature a warning on the tickets (for \"_sc\u00e8nes violentes_\"), at the much-publicised premi\u00e8re, over one-hundred people walked out, although those that stayed gave it a ten-minute standing ovation. This kind of extreme polarisation has continued ever since; _House_ is one of those rare films whose Metacritic scores range from zero (Jessica Kiang's hilarious rant for _The Playlist_) to 100 (Michael Roffman's review for _Consequence of Sound_). Particularly galling to some viewers has been the scene where a young Jack (Emil Tholstrup) cuts off a duckling's leg, places it back into the pond from which he took it, and watches it drown. PETA, however, defended the film, praising the fact that it draws attention to the link between adolescent animal abuse and adult psychopathy, and for the realistic special effects (which, it has to be said, are flawless \u2013 like many viewers, I thought the scene had been shot for real).\r\n\r\nTo begin parsing the film, one first needs to look at the character of Jack himself, specifically his lack of emotional interiority. Call it sociopathy, call it an inability to empathise, whilst there's definitely an intellectual core (seen in the many digressions he and Verge take concerning art and the nature of the artist), Jack is emotionally dead. Although we see him practising various emotional states in the mirror, he does this so as not to stand out when in the company of others, and the only _real_ emotions we ever see from him are irritation and anger, and even they are rare. Irritation is confined mainly to the 1st Incident, where he gives a lift to a woman whose car has broken down (Uma Thurman), and gradually gets more and more vexed as she goads him \u2013 telling him he looks like a serial killer but is obviously way too much of a \"_wimp_\" to ever actually kill anyone. Anger is mainly seen in the 5th Incident, when, right as he is about to murder a group of men tied up in the industrial freezer he uses to store bodies, he realises he has been sold hollow-point bullets instead of full metal jackets, prompting an infuriated trip to the gun store and a hilarious berating of the owner, Al (Jeremy Davies).\r\n\r\nHowever, the running joke with Jack is not his emotional barrenness; it's his utter banality (the \"_banality of evil_\" personified). A frustrated architect, he's convinced that if he hadn't been forced to study engineering he could have been another Antoni Gaud\u00ed, Albert Speer, or Frank Lloyd Wright. In reality, however, he proves incapable of designing and building even a modest house \u2013 his grand artistic ambitions undermined by his limited abilities. Indeed, his delusions of grandeur are such that he sees himself of the same ilk as people such as Shakespeare, Mozart, Blake, and, especially, Glenn Gould. In contrast to these heightened artistic aspirations, especially in the early stages of the film, his actions are often those of a bumbling neurotic. Interestingly, however, the more he kills, the less his OCD bothers him; essentially, the more pain he inflicts on the world, the less in pain he feels.\r\nSpecifically on this point, it's impossible to ignore the parallels between Jack and von Trier himself. Von Trier, who suffers from depression and has battled alcoholism, has said in the past that his films are a kind of therapy, an attempt to work out his own inner demons. In this sense, the more films depicting pain and torment that he makes, the less in pain he feels. It's definitely a superficial reading of the character, who is clearly not a 1:1 surrogate for the director, but it's hard to deny the analogy of how Jack feels the need to one-up himself with each murder, becoming more and more sadistic as he goes. This, of course, has become a very common criticism of von Trier's filmography. He has also been accused of misogyny and of exploiting the psychological (and often physical) suffering of his actors, just as Jack is obviously a misogynist who exploits the suffering of his victims. And this isn't subtext. Rather, von Trier himself makes the connection explicit when a discussion of genocide and tyranny features a montage of scenes from his own filmography; _Forbrydelsens element_ (1984), _Medea_ (1988), _Riget_ (1994), _Breaking the Waves_ (1996), _Dogville_ (2003), _Antichrist_ (2009), _Melancholia_ (2011), and _Nymph()maniac: Vol II_ (2013). There's even an element of self-flagellation about the whole thing, with Verge positing that \"_hubris must be punished by Nemesis_\" \u2013 are the criticisms von Trier has faced the Nemesis punishing his hubris?\r\n\r\nThematically, according to von Trier, the film\r\n\r\n> _celebrates the idea that life is evil and soulless, which is sadly proven by the recent rise of the Homo trumpus \u2013 the rat king._\r\n\r\nYep, that's a reference to Donald Trump. As with _Nymph()maniac_, the film is structured around a conversation between two people, with frequent digressions to topics often fairly tangential to the main narrative. So whilst _Nymph()maniac_ gave us treaties on fly-fishing, parallel parking, and the Fibonacci sequence, _House_ features discussions concerning viticulture, the oak tree in Buchenwald, cathedral architecture, photo negatives, and the dichotomy of predator and prey, via a rather simplistic comparative analysis of Blake's \"The Lamb\" (1776) and \"The Tyger\" (1794). One especially interesting digression, and perhaps the most obvious instance of von Trier biting his thumb at his accusers is a monologue where Jack laments the fact that men are the _de facto_ villains of every situation. Being set in the 70s and 80s, there's obviously no specific mention of #MeToo, but it's obvious where the invective is aimed. Coming across like a slightly more unhinged Jordan Peterson, Jack has no time for debates concerning gender fluidity or sexual misconduct, even going so far as to suggest that women are more cooperative murder victims because they're \"_easier to work with_.\" You can all-but hear Rose McGowan blowing a gasket!\r\n\r\nAside from the aforementioned duckling scene, by far the most disturbing scene is the 4th Incident. Here, we are introduced to Jacqueline (an excellent Riley Keough), whom Jack has been dating for a while. What is most distressing about the scene is not how Jack kills her (although it's far and away the most graphic death in the film), but what precedes her murder. After making an incredibly kind and thoughtful gesture, Jack then proceeds to mercilessly verbally belittle her, calling her by the nickname he has given her, \"Simple\", because he believes she is so unintelligent. He then takes great delight in revealing to her that he is Mr Sophistication, enjoying her discomfit as she tries to decide whether or not he's telling the truth. The cumulative effect of the psychological torment is unsettling, to say the least, and when she does finally realise that he is not lying about being a killer, he revels in suggesting that she scream; the futility of which he demonstrates by shouting out an open window, \"_no one will help you_.\" It's a devastating scene, far more emotionally upsetting than it is physically violent, and because of that, it's one of the best scenes in the film, provoking a genuine emotional response in the viewer beyond mere disgust.\r\n\r\nAs unsettling as this scene is, the film can also be extremely funny, with the entire 2nd Incident playing out like an extended _Key and Peele_ sketch. Trying to gain entry to a woman's (Siobhan Fallon Hogan) house, Jack does a hilariously bad impression of a policeman, explaining, \"_I don't have my badge with me because I'm getting a promotion_\", and then cheerfully waving to a passing driver as if they are best friends. Once inside, he only manages to kill his victim at the third attempt, and then, having left the house, his OCD compels him to return three times to check for blood splatters in such places as behind a picture on the wall and under the leg of a chair. Finally, to get away from the cops that have shown up, he ties the body to the back of his van, pulling it along the road, and leaving a blood trail from the house to his industrial freezer, only for it to start raining and erase the blood.\r\n\r\nFrom an aesthetic point of view, Von Trier and regular cinematographer Manuel Alberto Claro shoot _House_ in a cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style; almost the entire film is handheld, with the immediacy further enhanced by having the focus occasionally drift in and out, creating a scaled-back naturalistic look somewhat reminiscent of John McNaughton's _Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer_ (1986). The interesting thing about shooting it this way, however, is that the pseudo-documentarian visual approach clashes with the narrative and thematic concerns, which more closely resemble Mary Harron's _American Psycho_ (2000); both films are focused on unreliable narrators, both feature scenes in which the killers try to confess their crimes and are ignored, and both tell stories that may very well be taking place only in the demented mind of the central character. In a general aesthetic sense, the film ends on a very strong note as Jack and Verge descend to hell (\"Katabasis\" is the Ancient Greek word for \"descent\"). This incredible sequence starts with a stunning repurposing of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix's _La Barque de Dante_ (1822), and culminates in a Hell that's equal parts Hieronymus Bosch, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and Zdzis\u0142aw Beksi\u0144ski.\r\n\r\nHowever, the film is far from perfect. For starters, it can be incredibly self-indulgent. Von Trier's name, for example, appears on the title card, not in the sense of \"A Lars von Trier film\", but just his name, as one would expect to see of a major actor. The film is also unnecessarily long, and there are stretches which are extremely tedious, a problem which also afflicted _Nymph()maniac_, particularly _Volume II_. I'm also not sure that a clip reel of his own films was the wisest choice. Additionally, the female characters are, by the very nature of the film, essentially empty shells who exist only to be murdered. We may feel a degree of sympathy for them (especially Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l in the 3rd Incident), but only Jacqueline has any degree of psychological verisimilitude. Some of the digressions concerning art and its relationship to love and hate are also (perhaps intentionally) juvenile and intellectually vapid.\r\n\r\nWhilst it could be argued that _House_ is about a desensitised world indifferent to suffering, it seems to be more about Lars von Trier and the criticisms that have been levelled against him over the years. Although he doesn't seem willing to apologise for anything, he is more than happy to defend, attempting to use the depiction of violence so as to facilitate introspection, reflecting on the importance (or lack thereof) of morality and culpability in artistic creation. Does he point the finger at an indifferent and often culpable audience yearning for blood, such as Michael Haneke does in _Funny Games_ (1997)? Is he using violent extremes to criticise societal oppression and exploitation, such as Pier Paolo Pasolini does in _Sal\u00f2 o le 120 giornate di Sodoma_ (1975)? Is he simply mocking the contemporary craze for thrill-kill films and TV shows? The answer to each is perhaps. _House_ is an especially self-reflexive and somewhat self-disdainful film, which Von Trier has intimated may be his last. If that is so, it certainly makes for a fittingly provocative and confrontational final word.","id":"5d1e96b01cfe3a0010b0f939","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d1e96b01cfe3a0010b0f939","movie_id":398173}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nThe Favourite is one of the most acclaimed movies of last year, receiving multiple nominations at dozens of awards shows and winning a whole bunch of them (2nd most awarded film of 2018, behind Roma). Being a fan of Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 style, I couldn\u2019t be happier for him, and I was now even more excited to watch what he produced and directed. This movie is a classic example of an Oscars\u2019 tradition of sorts. A lot of audience members make their mission to watch every Best Picture nominee before the big night, and there\u2019s always one film that people fail to grasp on why did it get so much praise? Why are critics all around the world absolutely loving what audiences perceive as an \u201cokay\u201d time at the theater, but which contains a long, weird and maybe even dull (for some) story?\r\n\r\nWell, first of all, this is technically a masterpiece. I mean, every single technical aspect is worthy of recognition. The production and set design are gorgeously eyegasmic. The score is unusual for a period piece like this, but it weirdly works, as it continuously elevates the tension between the three main characters and helps the story flow with an always conspicuous, treacherous feeling. Even the cinematography and the plays with candlelight offer some pretty neat scenes. However, and prepare to be surprised, the costume design steals the show from all the other achievements. This is coming from a guy who has utterly no interest in this particular matter and who rarely talks about it, so I\u2019m as surprised as you are. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not due to the costumes being pretty or appropriate to the time period. Almost every movie that tackles these times nail the costume design, but only a few can tell a character arc through it. Even less are capable of embodying the whole screenplay like this Oscar-bait does. Our protagonists have distinct journeys, but their ends all have similarities. One way of understanding the story is through what they wear, which seamlessly represent the arc that each character takes to get where they eventually end up. These layers of storytelling keep the film intriguing, but Lanthimos\u2019 uncommon methods plus McNamara and Davis\u2019 script will displease some audience members.  \r\n\r\nThe Favourite is that movie that audiences are going to be perplexed about why do critics adore it. There\u2019s no secret, really. Audience members don\u2019t care about the technical part of films. They couldn\u2019t care less about costume design, cinematography, score or how the screenplay is written. They want to be entertained and have a good time at the theater, so I find reasonable if people leave a bit disappointed with one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2018. Lanthimos doesn\u2019t deliver formulaic stories, and he certainly doesn\u2019t film them in a regular fashion, so I firmly believe the general public isn\u2019t really going to enjoy this one. His unique style brings a very different tone, pace and filming techniques that people aren\u2019t used to experiencing. Fortunately, there\u2019s more than just technical attributes to this film. Three magnificent and powerful performances from Olivia Colman, Emma Stone, and Rachel Weisz, carry the whole thing to safe harbor.\r\n\r\nThese three actresses deserve every single nomination they got so far. Colman delivers both a hilarious and emotionally heavy display, as Anne. An incredibly fragile Queen with a shockingly traumatic past, whose love and affection is being fought for between Abigail and Sarah. Most of the laughs this movie gives are through Anne and her petty behavior towards her servants. Colman delivers her body and soul to her role, adding yet another fantastic performance to her splendid career. Weisz is just flawless. Sarah\u2018s arc is Abigail\u2018s opposite in almost every way, and Rachel is remarkably sharp. She doesn\u2019t really have a definite shining moment like Stone or Colman have, but it\u2019s a consistent and robust display from an actress who needed a return to the spotlight.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it\u2019s Emma Stone who shines through with an unbelievable range of emotions and expressions. Her performance in La La Land is great, but as Abigail she is outstanding! She handles her character\u2019s personality change with an impeccable transition regarding her acting and the only reason why she\u2019s probably not getting the Oscar win, is due to the campaign supporting Regina King (If Beale Street Could Talk). Abigail is the character that moves the plot forward by trying to steal Sarah\u2018s place near the Queen. Her intelligent and manipulative moves are extremely captivating, as well as her will to gain Anne\u2018s love.\r\n\r\nYorgos Lanthimos knows his craft and his weird yet unparalleled style is something that will surely deliver even more divisive and confusing films in the future. From the camera angles to his methods of storytelling, he\u2019s one hell of a director-writer-producer! Technically, The Favourite is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the last year. The impressive production and set design plus the addictive score definitely raise the film, but the costume design tells a whole story through what the characters dress during the whole runtime. The screenplay is remarkably-written, filled with complex dialogues and several twists and turns, which lead our characters through eventful arcs. \r\n\r\nOlivia Colman and Rachel Weisz deliver compelling performances, but Emma Stone is in another level. Her range is mind-boggling, and she carries a big responsibility by portraying the character who changes the whole story. Nevertheless, the movie feels a bit too long, and the story drops its interest levels during the transition from the second to the third act. Basically, I\u2019ll put it like this: if you\u2019re just a regular audience member who only goes to the theater to eat popcorn while being entertained, The Favourite isn\u2019t going to make you eat your whole bucket; if you watch films through a more in-depth look, then you\u2019ll be as marveled as I was by the end of it.\r\n\r\nRating: A-","id":"5c5dbecdc3a3683cdb8c413c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c5dbecdc3a3683cdb8c413c","movie_id":375262}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"A crushing disappointment.\r\n\r\nThe hopes were high for this latest Predator rebirth, not because Shane Black starred in the great first Predator film, so therefore he surely must care about the project? But because he's an excellent writer and director. Shane Black can count Lethal Weapon(S), The Last Boy Scout and The Long Kiss Goodnight on his CV, he was the man who put Iron Man back on track after the sag of part 2. Plus he is the creator of two of the best buddy buddy neo-noirs this millennium (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\/The Nice Guys), So how come The Predator stinks of lazy cash cow manure?\r\n\r\nPlot in a nutshell sees the universe's most lethal hunters unleashed on Earth due to the meddling of a soldiers kid and some nosey scientist types. The fate of mankind rests with a group of damaged ex-soldiers and a rather cheesed off female scientist.\r\n\r\nWe have a rehash mishmash of what we have seen before in Predator 87 and Predators 2010. A group dynamic fighting a seemingly invincible foe. The subsequent science aspects such as human DNA inference\/reasoning etc never really add up to much, serving only for a bunch of standard actors shouting, swearing and spouting hopelessly weak jokes and series re-treads. When you think the pic is about to up a gear, get rivetingly dramatic, a poor slice of humour comes our way either by vocal spillage or visual drivel (puppy pet Predator dog, really?). There's a bunch of plot threads that just dangle never to be pulled (PTSD\/our hero's family strife et al), and the Predators loose on Earth - with different agendas - are confusingly shifted about by a screenplay not sure where it wants to land. \r\n\r\nPlus points? Well the cinematography is superb (Larry Fong), and you can't fault this for action quotas, there's plenty of it and it's bloody (both red and green type). The score is the traditional one we had from Alan Silvestri back in the 87 film, in fact it hardly deviates from it and yet Henry Jackman gets the credit. Of course some of the jokes will work for some folk (I would be lying if I said a Whoopi Goldberg gag didn't make me laugh), but the terror has gone, these Predators are no longer scary creatures. This reeks of a troubled production going hand in hand with a cash cow that not only narratively adds up to nothing really, but of a franchise death knell. Shame. 3.5\/10","id":"5cfadcecc3a3680b4e267496","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cfadcecc3a3680b4e267496","movie_id":346910}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Very well made and genuinely creepy socio-political allegory, although the ambiguity and pacing won't be for everyone_**\r\n\r\n> _Disbelief is not just about men disbelieving us. It is about our own disbelief in ourselves._\r\n\r\n- Amber Tamblyn; \"I'm Done With Not Being Believed\"; _The New York Times_ (September 16, 2017)\r\n\r\n_The Wind_ is ostensibly a horror movie about a woman being terrorised by a demon on the American frontier. However, look a little deeper, and you'll find it may very well be a study of prairie madness. However, look even deeper, and it's really a metaphorical examination of the mindset of a less enlightened time, when women were very much second-class citizens who were expected to tend to the home and do little else. A fiercely feminist appropriation of that most masculine of genres - the western - it deals with traditionally gendered themes such as frontier domesticity and postpartum depression, remaining always within the genre's paradigms, even whilst challenging many of that genre's most fundamental tropes. Although it could be accused of wilfully ignoring the narrative of colonial violence and the fact that American pioneers were land thieves who displaced entire populations and destroyed indigenous cultures, the film is nevertheless an examination of the inherent dangers of attempting to cultivate a vast \"uncivilised\" land (both psychological and otherwise). Bleak and pared back, it's one of those films whose lack of budget actually works in its favour (there are only six cast members and one location). A slow-burner that relies on shadows and sound effects, it's built on atmosphere, tone, and escalating psychological terror (there's only one jump scare, although it's a damn good one), in the tradition of Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S\u00e1nchez's _The Blair Witch Project_ (1999), and more recent similarly staged films such as Jennifer Kent's _The Babadook_ (2014), Robert Eggers's _The VVitch: A New England Folk Tale_ (2016), Ari Aster's _Hereditary_ (2018), and, to a lesser degree, Trey Edward Shults's examination of post-apocalyptic psychological disintegration, _It Comes at Night_ (2017). With a wonderfully ambiguous _d\u00e9nouement_, gorgeous cinematography, and chilling sound design, this is an impressive piece of work from first-time director Emma Tammi.\r\n\r\nAdapted by Teresa Sutherland from Dorothy Scarborough's 1925 novel of the same name, _The Wind_ is set somewhere on the frontier of New Mexico in the late nineteenth century. Structured achronologically, the story focuses on Lizzy Macklin (a very impressive Caitlin Gerard), a young wife who lives with her husband Isaac (Ashley Zukerman) in an isolated cabin on the prairie. The two have a solid marriage, one could even call it progressive for the time, built on mutual respect. However, so isolated is the cabin, that when Isaac leaves for supplies, he can be gone for weeks at a time, leaving Lizzy struggling with loneliness, monotony, and the psychological effects of a failed pregnancy. The film intercuts the present timeframe, which sees Lizzy once again alone, with relevant backstory, revealing that when another young couple - Gideon (Dylan McTee) and Emma Harper (Julia Goldani Telles) - purchase the only other cabin anywhere within walking distance, Lizzy and Isaac are cautiously optimistic about having new neighbours. It soon becomes apparent that Gideon and Emma are not made for frontier life, coming to rely on Lizzy and Isaac for everything from planting crops to basic medical issues, and when Emma becomes pregnant, she and Lizzy bond even further. However, over time, Emma becomes convinced that an evil entity is stalking her. Determining that she is disturbed, Lizzy tries to help as best she can, whilst Isaac keeps Gideon out of the way, but Emma's condition grows progressively worse, to the point where Lizzy ties her to the bed for her own safety. Meanwhile, in the present, much as Emma had, Lizzy begins to feel that the same entity is stalking her, a dark and unknowable force that seems to arise from the very wind sweeping across the prairie. However, is she suffering from the same delusion as Emma, or do they both fear something very real?\r\n\r\n_The Wind_ really hits the ground running with a brilliantly conceived and downright ballsy dialogue-free opening scene. With the as yet unintroduced Isaac and Gideon standing outside the Macklin cabin, Lizzy emerges from within, her white dress soaked in blood, carrying the lifeless body of a newborn baby. Shot by cinematographer Lyn Moncrief (quite a talent) using an extremely cold colour palette of muted blues and whites, the red of the blood really pops, driving home the visceral (and all too real) horror of whatever has just happened. And that's even before the slam cut to one of the most disturbing and realistic cinematic corpses I've seen in a long time. The scene perfectly sets the tone, whilst also providing vital plot information _and_ conveying how unforgiving the _milieu_ can be - all without a single word of dialogue, with Tammi's control over the medium belying her lack of experience.\r\n\r\nThis scene occurs at roughly the mid-way point of the story, and it becomes apparent in the third scene that the film is using a non-linear narrative structure that requires viewers pay attention, with temporal jumps often indicated by nothing but bridging sounds, or occasionally subtle changes in wardrobe and\/or hair. Although the last act does settle into a slightly more linear style, the film gets a lot of mileage out of the temporal discontinuity, forcing the audience to question the order and often significance of seemingly inconsequential events, skewering how we would receive the story were it told in sequence, and putting us on edge from the get-go. Much as the film relies on either\/or ambiguity, so too does the narrative structure, with any given scene possibly vital, or possibly not. The fact that we are often uncertain as to exactly where we are in the timeline also mirrors Lizzy's own uncertainty regarding what's happening to Emma, and ultimately, what's happening to herself.\r\n\r\nFrom an aesthetic point of view, although Tammi and Moncrief certainly show the beauty of the New Mexico landscape, they also refuse to romanticise it. This is a harsh world that will punish anyone who doesn't afford it suitable respect, even without the introduction of supernatural elements. As the film progresses, and we get deeper and deeper into Lizzy's psychosis\/haunting, Moncrief shoots the initially vast-open plains in such a way as to become increasingly claustrophobic - there are more scenes at night when we are unable to see more than a couple of feet; there are fewer high-elevation shots, trapping the audience at ground level with Lizzy; the skies become darker, more foreboding, and more oppressive; there are more tightly-framed interior shots. This sets up a visual paradox that recalls the cinematography of _Blair Witch_ - although the characters are out in the open, they are very much imprisoned by their environment.\r\n\r\nEspecially important in the film's atmosphere is Juan Campos's exceptional sound design, which elevates the evocation of dread several notches above what it would otherwise have been, as gunshots, slammed doors, and screams deafeningly pierce the silence without warning. Particularly of note is the sound of the wind itself, which is normal enough to be recognisable, but unusual enough to be unsettling; is that a voice drifting across the plains, or is it a trick of the senses? This works in tandem with Moncrief's excellent use of shadows to suggest a horror that's always just slightly off-camera (which, of course, is far more terrifying than anything that could be shown). Indeed, apart from a single jump-scare (albeit, an effective one), the film's tone is conveyed exclusively through sound and shadow. Tammi is more concerned with mood and ambiguity than in revealing the \"monster\", and in this, the sound design and cinematography serve her extremely well.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, there are some really nice and often subtle directorial touches. A good example is a scene when Lizzy watches Emma bring Isaac and Gideon some water as they plant crops. She hands a cup of water to Gideon for him to drink himself, but she raises the cup to Isaac's mouth, something noticed by Lizzy herself. It's an easy to miss detail that may, or may not, prove to be important later on. In another pivotal scene, in which Isaac confronts Lizzy about her claims that a demon is stalking her, the two are sitting at the kitchen table as we look at them from the side, and in the middle of the conversation Tammi crosses the line, breaking the 180-degree rule, and recalling Michael Mann's use of the same technique in a similarly blocked and equally as important scene in _The Insider_ (1999).\r\n\r\nThematically, whilst it may not appear on the surface, _The Wind_ actually has a lot to say. For starters, the sudden arrival of Gideon and Emma facilitates an examination of the nature of existence on the edge of civilisation, beyond simply using them to illustrate that not everyone is cut out for this lifestyle. Despite the isolation and loneliness, Lizzy seems hesitant to welcome new neighbours, lamenting to Isaac that they will have to get to know the new couple; \"_in the city, strangers stay strangers. Out here, we don't have that luck_\". Later on, when Emma asks if there's a church nearby, Lizzy tells her, \"_not enough folk around here yet_\". This lets us know just how sparsely populated and isolated we really are, with the absence of even organised religion, whilst also subtly suggesting this is a Godless place. And of course, there's the inherent ambiguity; is there literally a demon stalking Lizzy, or has the stress of isolation, the loss of her baby, and the events involving the Harveys simply pushed her over the edge into psychosis? Tammi (and actress Caitlin Gerard) handle this ambiguity beautifully, veering first in one direction and then in another, culminating in a captivating final shot that addresses all of our questions whilst answering none of them.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tammi's main thematic preoccupation is a metaphorical examination of a pre-#MeToo era and its concomitant mindset. Horror has always been a fertile breeding-ground for socio-political probing, with Jordan Peele's _Get Out_ (2017) as probably the best known recent example. Others would include George A. Romero examining racism in _Night of the Living Dead_ (1968) and consumerism in _Dawn of the Dead_ (1978), David Cronenberg looking at paranoia relating to technology in _Videodrome_ (1983), John Carpenter exploring mass media-manipulation and the subjugation of the working-class in _They Live_ (1988), Brian Yuzna critiquing elitism in _Society_ (1989), Wes Craven satirising Reagan-era politics in _The People Under the Stairs_ (1991), and Bong Joon-ho making an environmental plea in _The Host_ (2006).\r\n\r\nIn the case of _The Wind_, it's a sustained allegory for pre-#MeToo politics - a powerful monster targets a vulnerable woman, terrorising her with impunity, whilst the man in her life (and in the case of Emma, even other women) don't believe her claims, basically telling her she should be a good girl and stop causing such a fuss. It couldn't be any clearer if the demon's name was Harvey! The film very clearly shows that Lizzy suffers almost as much from the fact that Isaac doesn't believe her as she does from her conviction in the presence of the entity.\r\n\r\nThat the film is a feminised appropriation of the western mythos serves only to drive home the allegorical nature of the story. Lizzy is, on the surface, a stock character - \"the wife\", the one who looks after the home whilst the men are out doing manly things. So even though she has a relatively progressive marriage, the fact that she may be mentally ill is not something about which Isaac concerns himself; mental illness or not, her role is to maintain the home. This is one of the great ironies at the heart of the film; whether she is literally being haunted or is suffering a breakdown, it doesn't matter, because Isaac isn't going to do anything either way; he no more believes in the demon she claims is stalking her than he is concerned for her psychological well-being. Irrespective of the cause (haunting or breakdown), the dangers of which she warns are very real, and his failure to understand that fact adds to the socio-political framework that Tammi so carefully constructs. And the crucial point here is that Isaac isn't a bad husband; he's just very much of his era.\r\n\r\n_The Wind_ is an extremely impressive horror-western. But it's an even more impressive study of isolation and (possible) psychological disintegration. Genuinely creepy in places, Tammi and her crew have created an exceptionally well-crafted film rich in feminist connotations all the while remaining faithful to a genre not exactly known for its nuanced depictions of women.","id":"5d3cc9f621621b4d6bed9f41","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d3cc9f621621b4d6bed9f41","movie_id":541560}
{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Unexpectedly impressive_**\r\n\r\n> _I couldn't get my mind around how the sisters could leave that home in 1961, close the gates when it closed down, with 796 children buried beneath in the tunnels in coffins, a lot of them in the sewage tank area as we now know. What kind of mentality would leave that place without acknowledging that so many burials were there, so many precious lives were lost? The ideal would be to exhume those little bodies and just show them some dignity and reverence and to perhaps re-inter them in the main Tuam graveyard which is only across the road._\r\n\r\n- Catherine Corless; Receiving the Bar of Ireland's Human Rights Award, October 2017\r\n\r\nTaking its inspiration from the history of Magdalene Laundries in Ireland, specifically the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, Aislinn Clarke's laudable debut feature, _The Devil's Doorway_, is a found-footage horror film. It undeniably has its share of clich\u00e9s, but overall it's an impressive piece of work, dealing in an interesting manner with a truly shameful part of Irish history.\r\n\r\nIreland, 1960. Father Thomas Riley (a brilliant Lalor Roddy) and Father John Thornton (Ciaran Flynn) have been dispatched by the Vatican to a (non-specific) Magdalene Laundry to investigate a possible miracle. Sometime previously, the bishop received an anonymous letter from someone in the laundry claiming that one of the statues of Mary is bleeding from the eyes. True to their biblical namesakes, \"Doubting Thomas\" (as John calls him) is a sceptic, the Vatican's go-to guy when they want to debunk something (by his own admission, he has never seen a true miracle). World-weary and disillusioned, he is the polar opposite of the young and enthusiastic John. Straight from the seminary, John believes blindly in the institution of the Catholic Church, much to Thomas's disdain. Determined to catalogue everything they do, the first 20 minutes of the film mainly involve John getting in people's way and being told to turn off the camera, with Thomas repeatedly pointing out, \"_this is a waste of your film_\". Although Thomas is determined to find the \"_trickster_\" behind the bleeding statue, his initial focus is the manner in which the girls in the laundry are being treated by the nuns (in one especially powerful scene, he incredulously asks John, \"_do you really believe that Our Lady is here? In this place?_\"). Because of this, he immediately butts heads with the rigid Mother Superior (an excellent Helena Bereen channelling Louise Fletcher's Nurse Ratched, and then some). However, with Thomas's focus on the girls, John comes to feel that something supernatural is happening \u2013 he hears, and later sees, bedraggled children playing in the corridors, despite there being no children in the institution; handprints appear on his window; strange sounds emanate from the bowels of the laundry. Testing the blood from the statue, Thomas determines its type, and that it came from a pregnant woman. Initially testing all the laundry girls, none match, and so, to Mother Superior's disgust, he widens the search to include the nuns. However, he again fails to find a match. He and John then learn of Kathleen (Lauren Coe), a young pregnant girl kept chained in a padded room in the basement. Temporarily putting aside the fact that she can speak ancient Greek and seems to know a lot about Thomas's history, he is horrified with her treatment, demanding she receive proper medical attention. A doctor is summoned and upon examining her, he is stunned to learn that although Kathleen is pregnant, she is still a virgin. Then things get really weird.\r\n\r\nFirstly, a bit of background. Usually run by Catholic orders, the first laundry in Ireland, the Dublin Magdalen Asylum, was actually a Protestant institution, and was opened in 1765 by Lady Arabella Denny. In 1996, the Monastery of Our Lady of Charity of Refuge, on Dublin's Sean McDermott Street, closed its doors, the last laundry to do so. In this 231 year period, it is estimated that upwards of 30,000 \"fallen women\" were confined in these prisons in-all-but-name, with over 10,000 imprisoned since Ireland's independence in 1922. The women confined there were sex workers, orphans, victims of rape and child abuse, the mentally ill, young girls considered too flirtatious or beautiful, and those who became pregnant out of wedlock. Essentially used as an unpaid slave labour force, the women spent their days washing sheets (which also serves as a metaphor for the Church's attitude to the laundries \u2013 the women were penitently washing their \"sins\" away). They were physically and psychologically abused by the nuns and exploited by the Church, which was fully aware of what was happening behind closed doors. Of course, it's not just that these women were locked away and mistreated \u2013 it's that they were forcefully separated from any children they may have had, many of whom were illegally sold to wealthy American families.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of Refuge sold part of their convent, St. Mary's Refuge, in the Drumcondra suburb of Dublin. The property developer who purchased the land subsequently discovered an unmarked mass grave holding 155 bodies of women and children. Although the Sisters attempted to cover it up, the media soon found a litany of abuses perpetrated in institutions up and down the country. This led to the 1997 Channel 4 documentary _Sex in a Cold Climate_ and the 1999 RT\u00c9 documentary series _States of Fear_. It was later discovered that the Irish Army, \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in, Guinness, Clerys, the Gaiety Theatre, Dr Steevens' Hospital, the Bank of Ireland, the Department of Defence, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, CI\u00c9, Hasbro, and multiple hotels and golf clubs across the country all had contracts with what were referred to as \"institutionalised laundries\". Indeed, so widely used were these laundries that during the 1940s, the Irish government noted that commercial laundries were letting significant numbers of staff go, as so many businesses were using the cheaper \"institutionalised laundries\".\r\n\r\nIn February 2013, Taoiseach Enda Kenny issued a formal apology to the Magdalene Survivors, calling the laundries the \"_nation's shame_\". A few days later, two nuns gave an interview on RT\u00c9 Radio 1 under condition of anonymity. Arguing that the media coverage was a \"_one-sided anti-Catholic forum_\", they refused to apologise to the Survivors, asking,\r\n\r\n>_apologise for what? Apologise for providing a service? We provided a free service for the country._\r\n\r\nIn July, Bill Donohue, the president of the Catholic League in the United States, claimed,\r\n\r\n> _there was no holocaust, and there was no gulag. No one was murdered. No one was imprisoned, nor forced against her will to stay. There was no slave labour. Not a single woman was sexually abused by a nun. Not one. It's all a lie._\r\n\r\nIn August, the Irish government set up a \u20ac50 million compensation scheme for the Survivors. However, as of 2018, the four religious groups who operated the majority of the laundries (the Congregation of the Sisters of Mercy, the Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd, the Religious Sisters of Charity, and the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of Refuge), have refused all demands from the Irish government, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, and the UN Committee Against Torture to contribute to the compensation fund.\r\n\r\nIt's difficult for an Irish person to even speak about this without becoming angry, as it's one of the darkest chapters of our history, and, along with the revelations regarding state and Church-sanctioned clerical sex abuse, it is the reason why 21st century Ireland has roundly rejected the Catholic Church, an institution which once lorded over every aspect of the country, telling people how to act, what to say, what to think. To give an example of how much the country has repudiated the Church, when Pope John Paul II visited Ireland in 1979, roughly 2,700,000 people came to see him (just shy of half the population of the country). When Pope Francis came in 2018, attendance was less than 130,000.\r\n\r\nIn the vile Magdalene Laundry history, perhaps the most significant scandal was that of the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, County Galway. Opened in a converted workhouse in 1925 and known to locals simply as \"The Home\", it was run by the Congregation of the Sisters of Bon Secours, and catered mainly to unwed pregnant women, who were sent there to give birth. It closed in 1961, but in 2012, a social worker discovered documentation related to over 1,000 babies sent to the United States for illegal adoption. The Health Service Executive soon discovered that The Home had often contacted parents asking for money for the upkeep of children who had already been shipped to the US. Speculating that the discovery could \"_prove to be a scandal that dwarfs other, more recent issues with the Church and State_\", the HSE recommended that then Minister for Health, James Reilly be informed, and a full enquiry launched. However, Reilly was never told, and the details of the HSE report were not made public until the _Irish Examiner_ published a special investigation in 2015. Meanwhile, also in 2012, but unrelated to the HSE enquiries, local Tuam historian Catherine Corless began an investigation into The Home. In 2013, she retrieved the names of 796 children whose deaths were registered there. Cross-referencing the names with local graveyards, however, Corless discovered that only two of the 796 had been formally buried. In 2014, a mass grave was discovered at the site of The Home's septic tank, with the site unmarked and not registered as a burial ground with local authorities. Initial excavations in 2016 and 2017 found that all of the skeletons were between 35 foetal weeks and three-years-old, with most carbon dated to between 1925 and 1950. As of October 2018, a full excavation is planned, and the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation is continuing its enquiries.\r\n\r\nOne might think that nothing more horrific could be made of this subject than the actual facts of the case; after all, Peter Mullan's superb, but exceptionally disturbing, _The Magdalene Sisters_ (2002) is a horror film in everything but name. However, what Clarke and her co-writers, Martin Brennan and Michael B. Jackson, do in _The Devil's Doorway_ is use the very real issues as the foundation for a socially conscious horror film which serves as a conduit for the anger felt throughout the country. In a Q&A after the film screened at Dublin's 2018 Horrorthon Festival, Clarke explained that the decision to make a horror movie about something so serious and important to the nation was because, \"_horror is good at unpacking social trauma_\", allowing a filmmaker \"_to metaphorically explore national pain_.\" Far more concerned with the shifting moral positions of the two priests than it is with devils and demons or silly jump scares (although there are a few of these), the film thus functions as a kind of microcosmic allegory of Irish history; John represents Ireland of the 1960s, innocent and blindly faithful, unwilling to believe anything negative about the Church, whilst Thomas represents the Ireland of today, jaded and disillusioned, spiritually cut off from ecclesiastical doctrine, scathing of Church dogma, and all too aware of the earthly sins committed in the name of Catholicism.\r\n\r\nReading between the lines of the horror tropes, this is a film about _human_ evil \u2013 the primary story is not the investigation into the statues or Kathleen's possible possession, it's the discovery that the institution has been discarding the bodies of dead children in a vast underground catacomb, with the full knowledge of the Holy See. Clarke, an atheist herself, is thus far more interested in showing the hypocrisy of the Church's culpability, condoning the torture of woman and the unsanctified burial of children, whilst it preached morality to the masses, warning of the esoteric dangers of contraception, the evils of homosexuality, and the iniquity of blasphemy. In her view, the evils perpetrated by the nuns against defenceless children are far more horrific and disturbing than anything a demon could unleash on the world. Speaking to Indiewire, she calls the film\r\n\r\n>_a comment on the potential for a church-state to become somewhere where evil happens and evil can be nurtured._\r\n\r\nLooking at issues such as the illogicality of blind faith and the history of organised religions' tendency to marginalise women, often to the point of violating their human rights, Clarke exposes the Catholic Church's duplicity, laying bare their utterly contemptible and self-serving role in Irish history, and it's the anger and sincerity of this message that lingers far longer than any of the film's genre elements. The sympathy Clarke feels for these women and children is palpable throughout. Indeed, in 1997, Clarke herself had a son out of wedlock at age 17, and under different circumstances, could have ended up in a laundry. Thus, the film is intensely personal, as the entire Magdalene scandal should be for all Irish people over the age of 20.\r\n\r\nOne of the film's greatest strengths is Lalor Roddy's performance as Thomas. Playing the priest as cynical and disheartened, worn down by years of debunking claims of miracles, at least initially, he is far more interested in the treatment of the girls than the possibility that the statue's bleeding may be authentic. He's also no shill for the church, seen in lines such as, \"_this place disgusts me. The people who run this place disgust me_,\" or when he describes Giuseppe Verdi's letter to Pope Pius XI asking for special dispensation to allow female singers to perform the _Messa da Requiem_ (1874). As the film goes on, Thomas becomes more and more angry about what is happening in the laundry, leading to one of the most thematically relevant and narratively justified f-bombs I've ever heard in a film. One of the film's primary themes is the hypocrisy of the Church, and the ugliness of organised religion in general, and this theme is carried primarily by Thomas. Roddy's layered interpretation of Thomas's existential crisis is the primary reason the film works so well in an emotional sense. Painfully aware that acceptance of dogma, faith in the Church, and belief in God are three very different things, Thomas finds it increasingly difficult to reconcile his genuine love for God with the practices the Church carry out in His name, with Roddy's performance adding a great deal of both emotional and esoteric complexity to the film.\r\n\r\nThomas isn't the only character to voice criticisms of the Church, however. In perhaps the film's key scene, when Thomas threatens to reveal to the bishop what's happening at the laundry, the Mother Superior laughs, telling him he'd be surprised to learn how unsurprised the bishop is. She then launches her own attack on the Church, arguing that the nuns are used to do the Church's dirty work, with insufficient resources, and, when things go wrong, they must take the blame. An especially good line in this scene concerns the pregnancy of the women in the laundry, with Mother Superior rhetorically asking Thomas, \"_Do you know how many of the babies born here had fathers who were Fathers, Father?_\" Although a contemplable character, everything she says in this scene is relevant and pertinent to Clarke's overall message.\r\n\r\nAt Horrorthon 2018, Clarke was asked if there were any concerns regarding accusations of exploitation during the making of the film. She acknowledged there were, explaining that she remained very much aware during filming that many people who lived in the laundries are still alive today, and that maintaining the integrity of the women and children was paramount on her mind at all times. Speaking to Indiewire, she further explained,\r\n\r\n>_there are women who are only 40 today who have been in these laundries, so I did worry that there might be people who have trauma from these places that would instantly feel that they were being attacked or they were being exploited by the fact that I even made a horror film with these elements._\r\n\r\nHowever, at Horrorthon, she also said she had heard from several Magdalene Survivors who had loved the film, and one woman in particular who travelled from Cork to Belfast to view it, giving an emotional endorsement when it was finished. Indeed, Clarke explained that the film was originally written to be set in 2018, with a group of urban explorers running afoul of eerie goings-on in an abandoned laundry, and it was only when she came on-board that it was relocated to the 1960s. She chose this period because it was during the 60s that the laundries were at the height of their powers. Believing that setting the film in 2018 and depicting urban explorers would have been disrespectful and exploitative (calling to mind Bradley Patrick's disgusting 2012 film, _Chernobyl Diaries_), Clarke felt that to relocate it to 1960 lent it an air of authenticity, whilst also allowing her to deal head-on with the moral issues thrown up by the scandal.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, the film is also interesting, managing to sidestep many of the inherent problems with found-footage films. For example, the fact that it's set in 1960 means it's shot on 16mm rather than VHS or hi-def. The 1.37:1 Academy Ratio, complete with rounded corners, has the effect of making director of photography Ryan Kernaghan's carefully composed images look like historic photographs. The shaky and imperfect footage also gives the film a sense of an old _cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9_-style documentary, with the amount of artefacts helping to sell the first-person immediacy of the cinematography \u2013 lens flares and burn-outs are especially common, and the handheld nature of the filming has a suitably disorienting effect. Granted, John's Bolex camera manages to pick up far more detail in dark locations than would be possible with only a single bulb as illumination, but this is a relatively minor gripe when the overall look is so good. This point also nicely illustrates the avoidance of another pitfall of found-footage horror films \u2013 why the hell don't they drop the camera and get out of Dodge. A problem in many such films, here, the answer is simple \u2013 in many scenes, the camera is providing the only source of light, hence why John keeps it turned on and filming.\r\n\r\nAlso worthy of praise is the sound design, which, as with the cinematography, manages to avoid a bugbear of found-footage films \u2013 pitch-perfect sound irrespective of location and people's distance from the camera. Here, there are multiple examples of dialogue being muffled when spoken away from camera. It's a very simple touch, but it adds a nice air of verisimilitude to proceedings.\r\n\r\nOf course, the film isn't perfect. As the latest in a long line of found-footage exorcism\/possession horror movies (including, off the top of my head, Daniel Stamm's _The Last Exorcism_, William Brent Bell's _The Devil Inside_, David Jung's _The Possession of Michael King_, and Mark Neveldine's _The Vatican Tapes_, the crowded nature of the subgenre, and the general lack of quality of the films, doesn't do it any favours. Additionally, especially as it nears its climax, it regurgitates a number of genre clich\u00e9s \u2013 floating beds, upside down crucifixes, scary nuns, creepy kids, creepy dolls, skeletons, underground caverns, jump scares which don't make a great deal of practical sense etc. Falling back a little too much on the generic conventions it has managed to avoid until the last half hour or so, in this sense, the film ultimately plays it disappointingly safe.\r\n\r\nHowever, all things considered, this is an excellent piece of work, and an extremely accomplished debut. It looks amazing, and is far better than the majority of found-footage movies, arguably the best such film since Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S\u00e1nchez's _The Blair Witch Project_ (1999). The acting is terrific, and it's properly creepy in places. Perhaps most importantly, however, if you can look past the hokum and the genre markers, you'll find a socially conscious film engaging with a painful national scandal through which we are all still living.","id":"5d043e209251413ec5b9f588","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d043e209251413ec5b9f588","movie_id":524789}

And not even ten minutes in, I loved every minute of it. My eyes were glued to the screen. The atmosphere totally carried me away. The acting was phenomenal, the direction by Paul Hyett as well. The score was on point, the costumes looked good. But most important were the effects to me. Sure, there was obviously CGI involved and to some of you this might just look silly. But I totally dug that look. The glowing eyes made this so cool, that I really can't say anything bad about this entire film. And if you are familiar with my reviews you know, that I often not tend to go very hard on movies, but immediately point out everything I disliked without holding back. I had an absolute blast with \"The Convent\" from start to finish. This is the kind of movie \"The Nun\" should have been!!! I see that the overall rating for this film is quite low. And maybe it is just me that this film spoke to some very personal beat inside me, but why should I follow the masses anyway? I never did. I dislike tons of classics, favor many remakes and never gave a damn if my taste in movies is weird or not.

{"author":"thecrustycurmudgeon","content":"While I enjoyed this film, it was a bit of a disappointment compared to the others in this series. As noted by other reviews, the film is haunted by an incredibly poor script. On the other hand, the action is pretty good if you can tolerate the long, poorly scripted scenes in between. \r\n\r\nThe film tries too hard to surpise us with twists, some of which are predictable and others which are just flat. Some of the circumstances in the film are far-fetched. I don't mind suspending belief a bit, but this is neither a fantasy or a science fiction film, so there should be some reasonable level of reality. Several scenes are just ridiculously beyond reason and logic.\r\n\r\nClaire Foy is an excellent actress and I like watching her. She did the best she could with this script. It's unfortunate that the directors chose to portray her as a bit haggard and completely without sex appeal. Certainly, the character of Lisbeth Salander is intended to be a nonconforming ruffian, but Claire Foys' depiction of her is considerably rougher than Rooney Mara's and far less sexually-charged than Noomi Rapace's. This is a shame as Claire Foy does have sex appeal; she either chose or was not encouraged to to use it here. \r\n\r\nIt's an acceptable addition to this series, but it's mediocre in comparison to it's predecessors.","id":"5c409352c3a368638a41e5f3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c409352c3a368638a41e5f3","movie_id":446807}
{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Interesting and reasonably well-made, but morally questionable in how it presents some of the material_**\r\n\r\n> _I'm sure it all started with some distinguished psychiatrist and a roomful of people, and the brilliant idea arises of a new way of studying nature versus nurture. \"Okay, we\u2019ll separate these kinds and watch them grow.\" This is nightmarish, Nazi shit._\r\n\r\n- Elyse Schein and Paula Bernstein quoting Bobby Shafran; _Identical Strangers: A Memoir of Twins Separated and Reunited_ (2007)\r\n\r\nWhat is the primary factor in making us who we are? Were the truly great figures of pure evil \u2013 Elizabeth B\u00e1thory, Adolf Hitler, Harold Shipman, Peter Scully, Adam Sandler \u2013 always destined to become who they became, or are there to be found moments and influences in their environment which turned them into the monsters with whom we're familiar? If our destiny is genetically encoded at the moment of our conception, can we really say there is such a thing as human agency? In short, it's the age-old question of nature vs. nurture; does biological determinism supersede free will? Focused on precisely these questions, twin studies involve researching twins to so as to compare and contrast the importance of genetic factors against environmental factors. A branch of behavioural genetics, when most people hear the term \"twin studies\", they probably think of Josef Mengele's sickening experiments in Auschwitz. However, these experiments were inhuman and not even remotely typical of scientifically approved twin studies, which are an accepted, if somewhat controversial, attempt to determine the etiology of differential psychologies in individuals who are genetically similar. And these are the murky waters charted by director Tim Wardle's _Three Identical Strangers_. Covering some of the same ground as Elyse Schein and Paula Bernstein's book, _Identical Strangers: A Memoir of Twins Separated and Reunited_ (2007), and Lori Shinseki's documentary _The Twinning Reaction_ (2017), the film presents a bizarre stranger-than-fiction story, which begins as a light-hearted human-interest piece before taking several darker turns. A big hit at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the US Documentary Special Jury Award for Storytelling, _Strangers_ is hotly tipped for Oscar glory, and has been almost universally well-received by critics (96% approval on Rotten Tomatoes at time of writing). However, for me, although the fascinating central story is undoubtedly gripping, there are just too many egregious problems in the telling, including an excess of distasteful sensationalism; a dearth of contextualising scientific information; overly simplistic ethical, moral, philosophical, and esoteric conclusions; stylistic drabness; and an overreliance on plot twists, which often forces the filmmakers to manipulate the material beyond what you would expect normal of a documentary.\r\n\r\nThe film begins in 1980, as Bobby Shafran heads for his first day at Sullivan County Community College in New York. However, upon arriving, he is taken aback by how friendly everyone seems, with people acting as if they know him, and welcoming him back. Meanwhile, Bobby is approached by second-year student Michael Domnitz, who had heard that his friend Eddy Gallan had returned to school. Coming to say hi, Domnitz is stunned when he encounters Bobby, who he now sees is identical to Eddy. Learning that Bobby was adopted, and was born on July 12, 1961, Domnitz tells him he has a twin brother. After Bobby and Eddy met, their story is reported nationally, and reading a newspaper article about the twins, David Kellman is stunned by what he sees \u2013 he looks exactly like them, he too was adopted, and he too was born on July 12, 1961. The twins were, in fact, triplets. The trio quickly bond, move into an apartment together, and eventually open a restaurant in New York, Triplets Roumanian Steak House. Becoming minor celebrities, they appear on talk shows across the country and have a cameo in Susan Seidelman's _Desperately Seeking Susan_ (1985). However, they and their families are puzzled as to why they had been separated, and why their adoptive parents had not been told they were triplets. Was it a coincidence that Bobby had been placed with an affluent family, Eddy with a middle-class family, and David with a blue-collar family? Did the regular aptitude and psychological tests they received as children, part of what their parents were told was a \"_routine childhood-development study_\", have anything to do with their separation? What was the involvement of one of the country's largest social service agencies, the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services? How much did New York's most preeminent Jewish adoption agency, Louise Wise Services, know? How was Dr. Peter B. Neubauer of the Jewish Board's Child Development Centre in Manhattan involved? How did the triplets' birth mother fit into what happened? As they begin to investigate, they soon stumble upon a series of shocking secrets that would change their lives, and the lives of many others, forever.\r\n\r\n_Three Identical Strangers_ starts out as jaunty as you could possibly imagine \u2013 Bobby heading off to college as Rainbow's \"Since You Been Gone\" (1978) plays on the radio. Within the first half-hour, the film also features cheerful montages cut to Katrina and the Waves' \"Walking on Sunshine\" (1983) and Kim Wilde's \"Kids in America\" (1981). Ominous this most certainly isn't; with the early parts of the documentary presented as if this were a feel-good story no different from any you might see on daytime TV shows such as _The Phil Donahue Show_ or _The Oprah Winfrey Show_. This makes sense, given how much time the triplets spent on such TV shows. Indeed, so laidback are these early scenes that the whole thing could easily be the opening episode of a sitcom about three likeable guys accidentally learning they're brothers and going on a madcap adventure together.\r\n\r\nAnother noticeable structural element concerns what Wardle and editor Michael Harte referred to at a Q&A after a screening in Dublin as a \"_past tense_\" and a \"_present tense_\". The past tense section covers roughly the first half of the film, running up to the end of the first round of interviews, which were conducted from 2011-2015. The present tense section then picks up in 2016. The transition between the two is pretty obvious, but it's worth mentioning as it's not something you usually see in a documentary. Half-way through the film, Wardle thanks Bobby and David, who are being interviewed separately, and they say goodbye, get up, and leave the room. It's very unusual to see a documentary film drawing attention to its own artifice in this manner \u2013 the furthest most will go will be to include the interviewer's voice, but even that is relatively rare. By featuring a scene like this, especially so early in the film, Wardle and Harte are alerting the audience to the fact that something has changed, and from here on out, things are going to be in a different register; their use of tenses to describe this shift is as accurate a description as you're going to get, almost as if we've moved from pre-recorded material to live footage.\r\n\r\nIt soon becomes apparent that the second half of the film is much less focused on narrative than the first, whereas the first is relatively light in the way of moral, ethical, or philosophical musing. The second, in contrast, becomes increasingly esoteric as the brothers struggle to find out the \"why\" of what happened to them. Both halves feature a mixture of talking heads, archival footage, and reconstructions, but almost all of the reconstruction material and most of the archival footage is confined to the first half, which is a good indication as to the different contents, and all in all, it's a well-managed structural technique.\r\n\r\nOne such technique, however, which doesn't work is Wardle and Harte's decision to repeat certain footage at key moments in the film. So, for example, when an important bit of information is revealed in the present, there are \"flashbacks\" to the relevant moment(s) in the past whose meaning has been altered due to the new contextualisation \u2013 think Bryan Singer's _The Usual Suspects_ (1995) or Christopher Nolan's _Memento_ (2000). The problem with this is two-fold; a) the technique is used far, far too often; and, b) it's sensationalist and manipulative. In a fiction film, this kind of thing can work both aesthetically and thematically, because fictional narratives are focalised, told from either a singular or multiple points-of-view. Within this context, repeating previously seen footage can work very well. Documentaries are not focalised (or they shouldn't be), and as we once again hear dialogue we heard sometimes only 15 minutes previously, the technique (which is not even done in an especially artistic manner) cheapens the whole process, as if the director is literally appearing on screen to remind us not only of why such and such a piece of information is important, but of how it should re-shape our perception of previous events. This goes beyond hand-holding, and into brow-beating.\r\n\r\nAnd with what is this brow-beating concerned? The film really has two major themes; morality\/ethics and nature vs. nurture. In terms of morality, at the Dublin Q&A, Wardle referred to the scientists behind splitting the triplets up as succumbing to \"noble cause corruption\", arguing that they probably set out to accomplish something laudable, but were not above using unethical means to do so. That Neubauer, in particular, could allow this to happen is especially ironic, given the obvious touchstone of Nazi experimentation with Jewish prisoners, and his background as an Austrian Jew who had fled the Holocaust. It does, however, seem strange that when examining the morality of what was done to the brothers, Wardle makes no mention of David Reimer, a male who was reassigned as a girl in 1965 when he was only a few months old and raised female, based upon dishonest advice given to his parents by psychologist John Money, who was attempting to prove that gender identity is learned. As there are a lot of parallels between the brothers' stories and Reimer's, and between Neubauer and Money, including a reference or two would have helped contextualise things.\r\n\r\nAs to the question of nature vs. nurture, initially, events seem to point very much to nature \u2013 the brothers all smoked the same brand of cigarettes; they had all been amateur wrestlers; they had the same taste in women; they had similar speech patterns. The media at the time ate this up, with their appearances on talk shows designed to leave the audience stunned at their similarities. However, as the documentary goes on, the argument shifts, with the brothers themselves admitting they emphasised their similarities at the time, and the media was more than happy to ignore any differences, leading to what was apparently a clear win for biological determinism. As time went on, their differences began coming to the surface, and ultimately, the documentary very much argues in favour of nurture.\r\n\r\nHowever, how it goes about establishing this argument is extremely questionable, with Wardle sliding more and more into sensationalism. So intent is he on controlling our perceptions that he leaves out a massive piece of information until such time as he deems it pertinent to reveal, and when he does so, he explicitly tells us what to think about it, pushing us to one specific response, when the event cries out for a more ambiguous presentation. It's difficult to go into any of this without straying into spoilers, so consider the rest of this paragraph a spoiler. Essentially, Wardle paints the suicide of one of the brothers as unquestionably the result of his adopted father's harsh disciplinarian parenting, a father who is still alive, and who appears in the film. Wardle and Harte do this by cutting from a clip of that father wondering if he had a role in the suicide to one of the other brothers basically saying, to paraphrase, \"_I'm still alive because my parents weren't as strict as his_.\" Blaming his death entirely on parenting in this manner is facile, grossly overly simplistic, and offensive. In fact, the way Wardle handles the suicide in general is deplorable, teasing it and teasing it, before gleefully revealing it for maximum tabloid-esque shock value. The sense of Wardle manipulating the material isn't helped by the fact that the absence of the third brother from the talking head interviews tips off the audience from the get-go as to where the story is heading. Why not just state it right up front, cutting back on the silly twist element of the narrative? It's not like people would get up and walk out upon seeing a \"spoiler\" like that at the outset \u2013 this is a documentary, not an M. Night Shyamalan film.\r\n\r\nThere are other problems, however. Aesthetically, the documentary is drab and dull, almost lifeless. With nothing cinematic about it whatsoever, it could easily be a report from a TV news magazine show, designed for maximum exposure rather than artistic inventiveness. The recreations are bland, and the talking head interviews are flat. Additionally, twin studies are a recognised and accepted scientific practice, but Wardle is so intent on making sure we are appalled at what happened to the brothers that he provides almost no context whatsoever. If he had spent less time trying to steer the viewers' emotions and more in providing a broader theoretical framework, the film would have worked much better, allowing the audience to find their own position in relation to what was done rather than simply following the director's lead. He also ignores a great deal of potentially interesting material. For example, why did their restaurant fail? According to the film, it was because of \"_different work styles_\". Which means absolutely nothing. Why does he not go into this a little? In fact, we never really get any sense of what the brothers' day-to-day life was like after they found each other. When they moved in together, how did that feel, for example? It's as if he doesn't want to dig too deep into anything just in case he finds something that might not fit into the grand narrative he's constructing.\r\n\r\nThe story of T_hree Identical Strangers_ poses fascinating questions about nature vs. nurture and the morality of certain types of research, but the film is so intent on the \"nurture\" answer that Wardle's subjective opinion comes across far more than it ought. More interested in driving home the shock value of some of the events than providing a penetrating documentary about free will vs biological determinism, there is little here that a reader wouldn't be able to find on Google. Given the outrageousness of the material, that Wardle has made such a conventional film is disappointing. It's an interesting enough piece, but that's more to do with the fascinating subject than the presentation, with the whole thing feeling a little too much like a Wikipedia entry.","id":"5d15583f50f7ca0030140b36","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d15583f50f7ca0030140b36","movie_id":489988}

So off we go with the hero having a troubled backstory, a money made funder out of his depth, ladies with life quandaries, a man who can't swim working in the middle of the ocean! and on we go. Throw in some quite awfully scripted dialogue and it's cheese sarnie time.\r\n\r\nStatham is nearly always a good watch - in the muscle bound action hero kind of way - though you see the cracks between what the film was meant to be and what it ended up as. For you see that The Stath comes off as taking it all too seriously, which in this released cut is ridiculous. He's surrounded by no mark actors, though no short supply of beauty (Bingbing Li socko gorgeous\/Ruby Rose hard sexy) and the narrative feeds us all the pointers of exactly where this will end up. There's a couple of nifty fun homages to Jaws, some decent suspense scenes, and the cinematography (Tom Stern) is pin sharp and pleasurable.\r\n\r\nBest bet to enjoy this is to know it's a \"12\" rated friendly piece, to understand it has ultimately ended up as a same old same old monster movie. It's a million miles away from the class of Jaws, and lacks the tongue in cheek knowing of Deep Blue Sea, but it fills a gap in that undemanding time wasting way. 5\/10","id":"5ce8fa380e0a261bbbca04c8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ce8fa380e0a261bbbca04c8","movie_id":345940}

This is still a Xavier Dolan film, and for all the right reasons, even down to his continuing dissection of the complex relationships between mothers and sons, and when he has sure footing, his flashes of spectacle in this film are really wonderful. He also connects so beautifully with his cast, with almost all of them in perfect step with him. This isn't a hidden masterpiece, but it also is nowhere near a disaster. It's an arresting misstep from a deeply passionate filmmaker who cares about every frame, who is trying for something genuine and honest, and yes, he chooses the framework of the privileged and the white, but these are (for all their problems) our modern mythical figures. To Rupert, John is a god, a superhero, an ideal to reach for, and the ultimate understanding of the film is that it is far more important to be human than iconic. In many ways, through his journey to discover that for himself, this is the gift that John gives Rupert in his letters. 'The Death and Life of John F.

In both cases the people were seen to be, if not quite 'savages', at least not fully 'civilised.' And in the penal colony, just as with the Celtic fringe, this judgement was to justify eviction and rigorous social control measures which would deliver exclusive 'ownership' and control of the most productive land to a powerful and privileged elite._\r\n\r\n- James Boyce; \"An environmental history of British settlement in Van Diemen's Land: The making of a distinct people, 1798- 1831\" (2006)\r\n\r\nHollywood has always had a curious relationship with colonialism. Whilst the British colonisation of the Americas tends to be frowned upon, one of the most popular genres of all-time, the western, was, for many decades, an un-ironic celebration of the white mans' subjugation of the Native American populace. It was only with the revisionist westerns of directors such as John Ford, John Sturges, Sam Peckinpah, and Sergio Leone that the genre began to embrace introspection, deconstructing its own codes and rendering problematic its colonialist tropes. Written and directed by Jennifer Kent, _The Nightingale_ could certainly be categorised as a revisionist western, albeit set in Van Diemen's Land (modern-day Tasmania), an island about 150 miles off the southeast coast of Australia, but it's probably more accurate to class it as a colonial revenge. On the surface, it's very much a genre picture, a rape\/revenge drama set in a western _milieu_. However, as it progresses, it gradually reveals itself as less concerned with hitting genre beats than engaging with issues such as racism, misogyny, innocence, the fine line between barbarism and civilisation, and the cathartic potential of violent revenge (or possible lack thereof). Much as Kent's debut, the exceptional _The Babadook_ (2014), was a horror in name only, its genre serving as a means to a thematic end, so too with _The Nightingale_. Brutally violent (but never gratuitously so), extremely unpleasant, and downright nihilistic at times, it's not going to pack them in at the multiplex, but for those who think of cinema as art first, entertainment second, this is an important, relevant, and mature study of mans' innate capacity for cruelty.\r\n\r\nVan Diemen's Land, 1825. A British penal colony, the island is in the midst of the Black War, with the British army attempting to eradicate the indigenous Palawa population. In an isolated colony, Clare Carroll (a star-making turn from Aisling Franciosi) and her husband Aidan (Michael Sheasby) are Irish convicts with an infant daughter, indentured to garrison commander Lt. Hawkins (an odious Sam Claflin). Convicted of petty theft in Ireland over seven years prior, Clare has served her sentence and is waiting for Hawkins to sign her long overdue letter of recommendation, which would render her and Aidan free citizens. However, Hawkins, who calls her his Nightingale on account of her beautiful singing voice, responds by raping her, and not for the first time. Meanwhile, Cpt. Goodwin (Ewen Leslie) visits the colony to evaluate Hawkins for promotion and a more prestigious command. The night after the rape, Aidan drinks too much and gets into a brawl with Hawkins, the sadistic Sgt. Ruse (Damon Herriman), and the na\u00efve Pvt. Jago (Harry Greenwood). Seeing the brawl, and already unimpressed with the conduct of Hawkins's men, Goodwin tells him he will not be recommending him for promotion. Infuriated, Hawkins orders Ruse and Jago to accompany him on foot through the treacherous bush to Launceston, where he intends to make an in-person appeal for promotion to army brass. However, before they leave, Hawkins and Ruse rape Clare and brutalise Aidan and their baby. And so, determined to exact revenge, she sets off in pursuit of the trio, hiring \"Billy\" Mangana (an exceptional debut from dancer Baykali Ganambarr), a Palawa tracker and one of the last of his people, who hates whites as much as Clare hates Hawkins.\r\n\r\nHaving spent over five years researching the frontier wars, Kent made _The Nightingale_ in collaboration with Palawa elders, with the story of Clare and Billy serving as Australia-specific synecdoche for the general oppression and violence of British colonialism. Both Clare and Billy have been deeply wronged by colonialists \u2013 her as a convict and woman, him as a Palawa. However, one of Kent's masterstrokes is to complicate their dynamic, whereby neither is capable of seeing their similarity to one another, with both convinced their racist point of view is legitimate. When Clare is first told she'll need a Palawa tracker, she responds, \"_I'm not travelling with a black. I'll end up in someone's pot of dinner_\". And in literally the next scene, when Clare tries to hire Billy, his response is, \"_I'm not working for a bloody white woman._\" It doesn't matter to him that Clare is in Van Diemen's Land against her will \u2013 she's part of the white race that has murdered his people and taken his land. At the same time, her view of him is based on the crudest of colonial stereotypes \u2013 that all Aborigines are cannibalistic savages. Indeed, for much of the first half of the film, she refers to him as \"_boy_\" rather than his actual name and exerts her authority over him in a not entirely dissimilar manner to how Hawkins exerts his authority over her.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's not exactly a spoiler to say that much of the film concerns itself with the duo coming to understand the oppression experienced by the other, recognising their parallel experiences. Indeed, in one of the strongest scenes in the film, their first real connection comes as they sit at an open fire, each cursing their oppressors in their respective native tongue, linguistically rebelling by rejecting the colonial signifiers and codes. In the hands of a lesser director, their story arcs could easily devolve into the worst kind of facile and clich\u00e9d movie sentimentality. Kent, however, keeps everything so grounded in bleak reality, the character beats so organic, and the themes so understated (there are no \"cry now\" moments), that virtually every stage of the relationship rings true, with unnecessary, authorial imposed plot never overwhelming characterisation.\r\n\r\nHawkins, for his part, is a representative of the worst aspects of British colonialism, not just the kind of jingoistic and xenophobic thinking that made such colonialism possible, but so too the misogyny, racism, and savagery that underpinned the formation of the largest empire in human history (at its largest (around 1920), the British Empire included 23% of the world's population and covered 24% of the globe). Crucially, however, Hawkins is utterly banal; believing himself destined for greatness, he's incapable of accepting what is apparent to Goodwin and the audience \u2013 he's a poor officer, an amoral and mediocre man whose lofty ambitions infinitely outweigh his negligible potential. He's a symbol of the toxic masculinity that engendered colonialism, but so too is he a flesh-and-blood person with characteristics relatively unrelated to his savagery. This is important insofar as, yes, he's an irredeemable monster, but he's never a pantomime villain.\r\n\r\nAlthough, on the surface, _The Nightingale_ is a rape\/revenge genre piece, Kent argues that this is to miscategorise the film, telling _BUILD_,\r\n\r\n>_it's being classed as a rape\/revenge film because it's got rape in it and people who are feeling the need for vengeance, but it doesn't follow any of the tropes of that genre. In fact, if people who like those kinds of films come and see it, they're going to be infinitely disappointed, because it provides no catharsis. It actually kicks up the question of why are you wanting revenge in that way. Do you really believe it? It's a fantasy, this idea that revenge provides catharsis, it's largely a fantasy._\r\n\r\nThis is an important point, as one of the film's main themes is whether revenge can lead to peace of mind. Does revenge provide fleeting satisfaction, even though it's ultimately futile, or is it a necessary and important part of the healing process? Most troublingly of all, however, Kent asks, irrespective of one's awareness of the heavy psychological cost of violent revenge, are there acts which are so abhorrent, inhuman, and evil that revenge is the only possible response. And if so, how does one reconcile the futility of revenge with its necessity?\r\n\r\nFrom an aesthetic point of view, as one would expect from the makers of _The Babadook_, _The Nightingale_ looks exceptional. Kent and cinematographer Radek Ladczuk shot the film in Academy ratio (1.37:1), with the claustrophobic nearly square frame trapping the characters within it, in direct opposition to the vast open plains in which they often find themselves. Especially important are the BCUs of faces, particularly the recurring motif of shooting from above characters as they lie on their back looking up into the sky, usually at night time. Faces in general, and Clare's in particular, are the film's roadmap insofar as the violence is never abstract; it happens to a person, not a depersonalised body, and it has real consequences \u2013 compare, for example, Clare's face prior to and after the second rape, with Franciosi's exceptionally modulated performance communicating more than language ever could. Indeed, the economy of Kent's visual language is evident from the opening scene, which sees Clare walking through the bush with her baby, as the camera shows us she's carrying a knife \u2013 establishing her independence and strength of character whilst also communicating how dangerous this place is, all without a word of dialogue.\r\n\r\nMuch has been made of the film's violence, particularly the scene where Hawkins and Ruse rape Clare. At both screenings at the Sydney Film Festival, multiple audience members walked out, and North American distributors IFC included a trigger warning independent of the MPAA rating details, stating, \"The Nightingale _features potentially triggering acts of sexual violence towards women, violence towards children and violence motivated by racism._\" Personally, although I found the rape scenes disturbing, I didn't think they were as bad as has been made out, and if you've survived films such as Wes Craven's _The Last House on the Left_ (1972), Lukas Moodysson's _Lilja-4-ever_ (2002), or Gaspar No\u00e9's _Irr\u00e9versible_, you'll be fine with _The Nightingale_. In any case, the violence (whether sexual or otherwise) is never gratuitous, exploitative, or immature \u2013 Kent is no Quentin Tarantino; violence in her work has stomach-churning consequences, and when she chooses to show such violence, there is always a point, whether it be thematic or character-driven, it's never arbitrary violence-for-violence's-sake, or worse, violence-for-titillation's-sake.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, as the Sydney screenings attest, the brutality on display will simply be too much for some \u2013 this most definitely is not a date movie, or a popcorn movie, or a popcorn date movie \u2013 it's dark, brutal, and unrelenting and it asks a lot of the audience. I didn't see this as a problem myself, but certainly, some people believe cinema should entertain, and entertain only, and if you're of that mindset, you'll get nothing from _The Nightingale_. A more objective criticism is that at 136 minutes, it's a tad too long, and it does lapse into repetition from time to time \u2013 if the middle act had been tightened up a bit, cutting maybe 10 or 15 minutes, it would have played better. The _d\u00e9nouement_ is also somewhat rote, which is disappointing given the strength of the filmmaking leading us to that point. I wouldn't necessarily say it doesn't work, but it's the only part of the where it feels like a genre piece.\r\n\r\nThese issues aside, however, this is exceptionally strong filmmaking. With not a hint of sentimentality in its unflinching depiction of the horrors inherent in the subjugation of an entire people, _The Nightingale_ confirms Kent as a major _auteur_ with a distinctive voice and the courage to remain true to her subject-matter, however abhorrent such truth might be.","id":"5df470644a4bf6001454f63c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5df470644a4bf6001454f63c","movie_id":400090}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"My mind was racing as I watched _The Predator_ in the cinema tonight. I'd heard virtually nothing good about it so my anxious brain kicked into overdrive the whole time the film was going on. As a result of that, I almost feel like I experienced three movies in that theatre. First, obviously the movie on the screen. Secondly, the awesome movie I was theorising could unfurl at the result of each new sequence and plot point, but that sadly never did. And thirdly, the inexcusably awful and franchise-ruining movie that I feared it was about to take a hard left turn into at any minute, and thankfully never did.\r\n\r\nAnd that's really my experience on _The Predator_ overall, and the reason for a stalemate \"2.5 outta 5\" review: It wasn't as good as it should have been, it wasn't as bad as it could have been. Unfortunately, when the movie I'm writing in my head alongside watching it is better than what's actually on screen, when you take into account that I'm an unimaginative, talentless hack, really doesn't cut it for a sequel to _Predator_, one of of only five movies I've ever given a perfect rating to.\r\n\r\nThe best parts of _The Predator_ are when there is an eponymous Predator on screen. So you might think, \"Oh it's not a good movie, but it's a good _Predator_ movie\", and fair enough a conclusion to draw, but no. Part of the problem is, this movie really could have been pulled off with any aliens at all. Take out the Yautja and replace them with... I dunno, the blue skinned pogo-stick people of Planet Hurfadump, and it can still play out functionally the same. See, although I enjoyed watching the Predators do their thing, there was really nothing beyond cosmetic similarities that made them the Predators we've seen in every movie preceding this one.\r\n\r\nI think possibly part of the reason for that is that every other movie with a Predator in it has been an Action Horror movie (albeit Action Horror with ever-increasing Sci-Fi elements from film to film) whereas _The Predator_ is an Action Comedy, just one with some gore. Now I don't think that taking it that route was necessarily and... abysmal failure, let's say, but was Action Comedy the **best** way to take the _Predator_ franchise? I think it's pretty clear that the answer is no.\r\n\r\nIronic that that direction is being taken by Shane Black, the man who has a history with _Predator_ purely because the crew of the first film were determined to have him to work on the script, which he refused. Now here we are more 30 years later and Shane Black finally **has** put his name on a Predator movie, and it's not even good.\r\n\r\nFuck.

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"_**An \"atmospheric character drama\" without any atmosphere, and precious little drama**_\r\n\r\n> _The subliminal mind has many dark, unhappy corners, after all. Imagine something loosening itself from one of those corners. Let's call it a - a germ. And let's say conditions prove right for that germ to develop - to grow, like a child in the womb. What would this little stranger grow into? A sort of shadow-self, perhaps: a Caliban, a Mr Hyde. A creature motivated by all the nasty impulses and hungers the conscious mind had hoped to keep hidden away: things like envy and malice and frustration._\r\n\r\n- Sarah Waters; _The Little Stranger_ (2009)\r\n\r\nI remember when I first saw Paul Thomas Anderson's _Inherent Vice_ (which I loved) in 2014, a colleague of mine (who hated it) was unable to grasp why I had enjoyed it so much. I tried to explain that if he had read Thomas Pynchon's 2009 novel, he'd have appreciated the film a lot more, to which he posited, \"_one shouldn't have to read the book in order to appreciate the film._\" I think I mumbled something about him being a philistine, and may have thrown some rocks at him at that point. So imagine my chagrin when I watched the decidedly underwhelming _The Little Stranger_, a huge box office bomb ($417,000 gross in its opening weekend in the US), and easily the weakest film in director Lenny Abrahamson's thus far impressive _oeuvre_. You see, I really disliked it, but the few people I know who have read Sarah Waters's 2009 novel (which I have not), have universally loved it, telling me I would have liked it a lot more if I was familiar with the source material. To them, I can say only this \u2013 \"_one shouldn't have to read the book in order to appreciate the film._\" It seems my colleague was right after all. I hate that.\r\n\r\nThe film is set in Warwickshire, a West Midlands county in England, in 1948, where Dr. Faraday (Domhnall Gleeson) is a country physician whose life is going nowhere fast. Born into humble beginnings, ever since he was a child, he has wanted to be a member of the gentry. In 1919, he attended a f\u00eate at the opulent Hundreds Hall estate, owned by the aristocratic Ayers family, where his mother worked as a maid, and ever since he has been quietly obsessed with the house. However, by 1948, Hundreds has lost its lustre, is in a state of disrepair, and is now home to only four people \u2013 Angela Ayers (Charlotte Rampling), matriarch of the Ayers dynasty, and who never recovered from the death of her eight-year-old daughter, Susan, many years previously; Caroline (Ruth Wilson), her daughter; Roderick (Will Poulter), Angela's son, a badly-burned former RAF pilot suffering from PTSD; and Betty (Liv Hill), the maid. When Betty takes ill, Faraday is summoned, almost immediately learning that the family is in a dire state, with Angela unable to balance their diminished financial situation with the social responsibility of maintaining the estate. Betty also intimates to Faraday that \"something\" is not right in the house. Offering to treat Roderick's painful burns, Faraday soon ingratiates himself into the family, and becomes a semi-permanent presence in Hundreds. However, that's when things start to go wrong; a child is mauled by a previously passive dog, a mysterious fire guts the library, and noises can be heard throughout the house. As Caroline determines to leave, Faraday attempts to convince everyone there is nothing supernatural happening. Nevertheless, Angela is certain the spirit of Susan is with them; Caroline believes it all has something to do with Roderick's deep unhappiness; Roderick asserts it is something that wants to drive him mad and deprive him of his birthright; and Betty believes it is the malevolent spirit of a former domestic servant. Meanwhile, Faraday and Caroline become romantically involved.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, I haven't read the novel, so most of the proceeding comments are in relation to the film only. Aspiring to blend elements of \"big house\"-based mystery narratives such as Charlotte Br\u00f6nte's _Jane Eyre_ (1847), Charles Dickens's _Great Expectations_ (1861), and Daphne du Maurier's _Rebecca_ (1938), with more gothic-infused ghost stories such as Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" (1839), Henry James's _The Turn of the Screw_ (1898), and Shirley Jackson's _The Haunting of Hill House_ (1959), _The Little Stranger_ is not especially interested in the supernatural aspects of the story _per se_. In this sense, Abrahamson and screenwriter Lucinda Coxon have, to a certain extent, created an anti-ghost story which eschews virtually every trope of the genre. More a chamber drama than anything else, the film has been done absolutely no favours whatsoever by its trailer, which emphasises the haunted house elements and encroaching psychological dread (the fact that the film was pushed back from intended release dates several times suggest the studio themselves didn't know quite what they had on their hands). Indeed, to even mention the supernatural elements at all is essentially to give away the last 20 minutes of the film, as this is where 90% of them are contained.\r\n\r\nWaters herself has stated she does not consider the novel a ghost story. Instead, she was primarily interested in the rise of socialism in England, the landslide Labour victory in the 1945 general election, and how the now fading nobility was dealing with the decline in their power, influence, and financial opulence;\r\n\r\n> _I didn't set out to write a haunted house novel. I wanted to write about what happened to class in that post-war setting. It was a time of turmoil in exciting ways. Working class people had come out of the war with higher expectations. They had voted in the Labour government. They wanted change. So it was a culture in a state of change. But obviously, for some people, it was a change for the worse._\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, the main theme of the film is Faraday's attempts to ingratiate himself with the Ayers family, to transform himself into a fully-fledged blue blood, even when doing so goes against his medical training; his commitment to his own upward mobility is far stronger than his commitment to the Hippocratic Oath. He is immediately dismissive of the possibility of any supernatural agency in the house, and, far more morally repugnant, he does everything he can to convince those who believe the house is haunted that they are losing their minds, that the stress of what has happened to the family has pushed them to the point of a nervous breakdown. He's also something of a passive-aggressive misogynist, telling Caroline, \"_you have it your way \u2013 for now_\", and \"_Darling, you're confused_\". For all intents and purposes, Faraday is the villain of the piece, which is, in and of itself, an interesting spin on a well-trodden narrative path.\r\n\r\nHowever, for me, virtually nothing about the film worked. Yes, it has been horribly advertised, and yes, it is more interested in playing with our notions of what a ghost story can be, subverting and outright rebelling against the tropes of the genre. I understand what Abrahamson was trying to do (after all, my all-time favourite horror movie, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S\u00e1nchez's _The Blair Witch Project_ (1999) is all about psychologically disturbing the audience, with not a jump scare in sight), however, so too does _The Little Stranger_ shun the standard alternative to jump scares \u2013 creeping existential dread \u2013 and as a result, it remains all very subtle, and all very, very boring \u2013 the non-supernatural parts of the story give us nothing we haven't seen before, and the supernatural parts simply fall flat (the \"twist\" at the end is also incredibly predictable).\r\n\r\nOne of the main issues for me is Faraday's emotional detachment. I get that he's the ostensible villain, so we're not meant to empathise with him, and, as an unreliable narrator, his very role is to objectively undermine the subjective realism of the piece, and disrupt the smooth path of the narrative transmission (the same role performed by the Second Mrs. de Winter in _Rebecca_). However, Gleeson\/Faraday practically sleepwalks his way through the entire film, getting excited or upset about (almost) nothing; on a stroll through the estate with Caroline, she apologises for dragging him out into the cold, and he replies, \"_Not at all. I'm enjoying myself very much_\", in the most dead-tone unenthusiastic voice you could possibly imagine, sounding more like he is having his testicles sandpapered (this part also elicited the film's only laugh at the screening I attended). So I know detachment is precisely the point, but, firstly, we've seen Gleeson play this exact same character before \u2013 all brittle, buttoned-down intellectualism \u2013 and secondly, he comes across as more robotic than detached, and after twenty minutes, I was thoroughly bored of him, and just stopped caring. Indeed, all of the characters are somewhat buttoned down, but Rampling, Wilson, and Poulter all give more nuanced performances than Gleeson.\r\n\r\nPartly because of this, and partly because of Coxon's repetitive script, the film is just insanely and unrelentingly dull. Now, I don't mind films in which nothing dramatic happens (Chlo\u00e9 Zhao's _The Rider_ (2017), which barely has a plot, is one of my films of the year), but in _The Little Stranger_ nothing whatsoever happens at all, dramatic or otherwise. By way of comparison, check out Oz Perkin's _I Am the Pretty Thing that Lives in the House_ (2016), a similarly themed film which shuns jump scares but whose encroaching sense of dread creates a potently eldritch tone, something sorely lacking in _The Little Stranger_. Instead, the script just goes round and round, through the motions; \"_this house is haunted_\" \u2013 \"_no, you're just tired_\" \u2013 \"_you're probably right_\" \u2013 \"_I am, have a lie down_\" \u2013 \"_okay. Wait, this house is haunted_\" \u2013 \"_no, you're just tired_\", etc.; wash, rinse, repeat. The pacing is absolutely torturous, and I certainly envy anyone who was able to get more out of the narrative than the opportunity to take a nap.\r\n\r\nOne thing I will praise unreservedly is the sound design. Foregrounded multiple times, this aspect of the film often becomes more important than the visuals. For example, sound edits often bridge picture edits in both directions (L Cuts and J Cuts). Similarly, we repeatedly experience the sound of one scene carrying over into the image of another well beyond the edit itself, so much so that it becomes a motif, suggesting a distortion of reality. Just prior to the dog attack, the sound becomes echo-like and the picture starts to move in and out of focus, as the camera shows Faraday in a BCU, suggesting he is becoming unglued from his environment. This also happens later on with Roderick, just prior to the fire. Perhaps the most interesting scene from an aural perspective is the scene in the nursery near the end of the film. As Angela examines the room, the distorted and difficult to identify sound becomes unrelenting (it is easily the loudest scene in the film). However, as the other characters run through the house towards the noise, all sound is pulled out almost entirely, with only the barest hint of footfalls detectable. This is extremely jarring and extremely effective, working to emphasise the dread all of the characters are by now feeling.\r\n\r\nHowever, beyond that, this just did nothing for me; there was nothing I could get my teeth into, I didn't care about any of the characters beyond the first half hour, the social commentary was insipid and said nothing of interest, the supernatural aspects are so underplayed as to be virtually invisible, and, most unforgivably, the film is terminally boring. Maybe if I'd read the book\u2026","id":"5ceda24a0e0a262bd0cb7616","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ceda24a0e0a262bd0cb7616","movie_id":455108}

{"author":"furious_iz","content":"It's almost like someone forgot to finish writing this film...\r\n\r\nIt starts off well enough, even if the basic premise is a little well worn.  Son with a bright future loses his father suddenly, so mother and son have to shift to the middle of nowhere to make ends meet and cope with their grief.  The house they shift into belongs to a family member who is trying to sell it, so on weekends it is staged as an open house.\r\n\r\nOf course as soon as the open house viewings start, strange things start happening.  This is where the film starts falling apart.  The film-makers can't seem to decide between implying that the occurrences maybe supernatural or someone who came to the viewing but never left.  Which is fine to add a little mystery, but the mystery isn't engaging, there is no hook to it.  Slightly odd things happen for no real rhyme or reason.  You keep expecting there to be a nugget of information as to why they are being targeted, but you get nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen the film finally decides to settle on the menacing slasher route and stick to it, the wheels completely fall off, and this film starts crashing hard.  The film spends 3\/4 of its running time raising questions and answers none of them, but not in an ambiguous way, just in a sloppy writing way.  \r\n\r\nThere's no explanation, no reason why, no back-story, and the killer is constantly blurred, out of focus or in shadow so you never see what he looks like.  Those elements can work, classic films like Duel you never see the psycho truck driver, but at least he has motivation.  In Halloween you never know why Michael Myers goes on a rampage but you get a physical sense of what he looks like, even if you don't really get a good look at his face.  But combining no back-story stalking, with a complete lack of motivation and no decent look at the killer just doesn't work.  You don't care what is happening because there is no reason for it, and not much to look at while it happens.  The protagonists might as well be getting attacked by a shadow.  There is nothing scary or interesting about the killer, because the killer really is nothing apart from a pair of boots.\r\n\r\nThere is absolutely nothing under the surface with this film.  There is no metaphor, there is nothing to learn, no twist, no insight to grief, no character revelations.  Just retreaded clich\u00e9s poorly packaged to give you a boring and pointless final product.\r\n\r\nAvoid this film, it is a waste of your time","id":"5a64efda0e0a261a0402b83e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a64efda0e0a261a0402b83e","movie_id":485774}

It doesn't make women an old-fashioned thing of delicacy._\r\n\r\n- Olivia Colman; \"_The Favourite_ Blows Up Gender Politics With the Year's Most Outrageous Love Triangle\" (Tatiana Siegel); _The Hollywood Reporter_ (November 14, 2018)\r\n\r\n_The Favourite_, the seventh feature from Greek auteur Yorgos Lanthimos, is a film that eschews both convention and expectation. On the other hand, it's also Lanthimos's most accessible by a country mile. Imagine, if you will, a narrative combining Joseph L. Mankiewicz's _All About Eve_ (1950), Ingmar Bergman's _Viskningar och rop_ (1975), and Mark Waters's _Mean Girls_ (2004) filtered through the aesthetic sensibilities of Stanley Kubrick's _Barry Lyndon_ (1975), Peter Greenaway's _The Draughtsman's Contract_ (1992), and Stephen Frears's _Dangerous Liaisons_ (1988), topped off with a dash of Luis Bu\u00f1uel at his most socially satirical, and you'll be some way towards imagining this bizarre and uncategorisable film from a director with as unique and distinctive a voice as you're likely to find in world cinema. A savage morality play, a camp comedy of manners, a Baroque tragedy, an allegorical study of the corruptive nature of power \u2013 it's all of these and yet none of them. I haven't seen Lanthimos's first two films, _O kalyteros mou filos_ (2001) and _Kinetta_ (2005), but I adored _Kynodontas_ (2009), as difficult as it was to watch. I was a little indifferent to _Alpeis_ (2011), but I loved _The Lobster_ (2015), his blackest comedy thus far. His last film, however, _The Killing of a Sacred Deer_ (2017) did very little for me, as I felt it offered nothing we hadn't seen in his previous work. So I came to _The Favourite_ wanting to like it, but ready to dislike it. And I find myself somewhere in the middle. On the one hand, it's too long, the plot too threadbare, and the metaphors and allegories too ill-defined. On the other, the acting is flawless, it looks amazing, the first half is very, very funny, and the end is very, very dark, with the last shot one of the most haunting\/disturbing images I've seen in a long time.\r\n\r\nEngland, 1708. Queen Anne (an absolutely mesmerising Olivia Colman) has been on the throne for six years, with Great Britain finding itself enmeshed in the War of the Spanish Succession. In poor health, Anne has little interest in politics, with the real power lying with her friend, adviser, and secret lover Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (an icy Rachel Weisz). Sarah and Prime Minister Sidney Godolphin (James Smith) plan to finance the war effort by doubling property taxes, but are opposed by the leader of the opposition \u2013 Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford (Nicholas Hoult). Meanwhile, Sarah's impoverished younger cousin, Abigail Hill (Emma Stone, charting a course from doe-eyed _ing\u00e9nue_ to vicious Machiavellian _intrigant_), arrives at Court looking for work. Sarah secures her a position as a scullery maid, but when Abigail learns that Anne is suffering from gout, she uses a herbal remedy on the sleeping Queen without asking permission. Sarah has her whipped for her presumption, but Anne sees a noticeable improvement in her condition, and by way of apology, Sarah gives Abigail a position closer to the Queen. With Harley hoping to use Abigail as a spy to find out what Sarah is planning, and Samuel Masham (Joe Alwyn), a foppish courtier, attempting to woo her, Abigail must quickly adapt to courtly life. Learning of the lesbian relationship between Anne and Sarah, Abigail begins to ingratiate herself with the Queen, leading to a bitter contest between herself and Sarah, as each attempt to establish themselves as Anne's favourite.\r\n\r\n_The Favourite_ is the first film Lanthimos has directed which neither he nor Efthymis Filippou wrote. Although it deals with real historical personages and events, historians probably won't be too thrilled to learn that Lanthimos and his screenwriters Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara are relatively uninterested in either historical actuality or socio-political contextualisation (to say nothing of the slam dancing and frequently anachronistic dialogue). For example, there's no reference to the Glorious Revolution (1688), which saw James II, the last Catholic monarch of England, overthrown; or to the Treaty of Union (1707), which formally brought the state of Great Britain into existence. Similarly, it is never mentioned that Anne was the last Stuart monarch or that Abigail was appointed Keeper of the Privy Purse in 1711. The nature of the political antagonism between the Tories and the Whigs, although often referred to and occasionally witnessed, is kept vague, with little in the way of an historical frame of reference. For example, the film never addresses the fact that Godolphin and Harley were both Tories, with Godolphin heading an administration dominated by leading Whigs (the Whig Junto), and Harley leading a coalition of Country Whigs and Tories in opposition.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there's no evidence whatsoever that Anne and Sarah were lovers. On the contrary, Sarah is known to have found lesbianism abhorrent, commissioning the politician Arthur Maynwaring to write scurrilous poems about Abigail which intimated that she might be gay. Additionally, Anne was devoted to her husband, Prince George of Denmark, who doesn't even warrant a mention, let alone an appearance, despite being alive and well at the time of Abigail's arrival at Court. However, it's also important to note that the film makes no claim to be a history lecture. This is a story about a love triangle, with everything else just the background noise against which that triangle plays out.\r\n\r\nBut although it may not be historically accurate, it is most definitely a Yorgos Lanthimos film, with his peculiar _Weltanschauung_ omnipresent. The emotionless and monotone delivery of dialogue has been scaled back considerably from _The Lobster_ and _Sacred Deer_, but everything else you'd expect is here \u2013 the pseudo-omniscient judgemental glare; the dark absurdist sense of humour; the formal rigidity; the emotional isolation of the characters; the surrealism; the games of psychological one-upmanship; the alienation of the audience; the thematic centrality of shifting power relations; the lack of distinction between poignancy and joviality; the use of self-contained and closed off pocket universes where characters must play by rules differing from those of the outside world; intimate familial conflict (except in bigger rooms than in his previous films); and a disorienting score, which mixes pieces by Purcell, Vivaldi, Handel, and Bach with more contemporary work from the likes of Olivier Messiaen, Luc Ferrari, and Anna Meredith, whilst the closing credits feature Elton John's \"Skyline Pigeon\" (really). Similarly, whilst _The Lobster_ was a savage dystopian-set allegory for discipline and conformity, _The Favourite_ is a merciless satire of decadence and pettiness, taking in such additional themes as class, gender, love, lust, duty, loyalty, partisan politics, patriarchal hegemony, and women behaving just as appallingly as men.\r\n\r\nAs one would expect from Lanthimos, the film is aesthetically flawless, with many of the compositions having the appearance of a _f\u00eate galante_ painting, so meticulously integrated are the costume design by Sandy Powell (_Interview with the Vampire_; _Shakespeare in Love_; _Carol_), the production design by Fiona Crombie (_Snowtown_; _Truth_; _Mary Magdalene_), and the cinematography by Robbie Ryan (_Fish Tank_; _Philomena_; _American Honey_). Powell's costumes are historically inaccurate, but thematically revealing, with the situation of the characters at any given moment directly influencing the design. For example, speaking to _Entertainment Weekly_, Powell says of Abigail and her rise to a position of influence,\r\n\r\n> _I wanted to give her that vulgarity of the_ nouveau riche_, and her dresses get a little bolder and showier. There's more pattern involved and there are black-and-white stripes. I wanted her to stand out from everybody else as trying too hard._\r\n\r\nIn a more general sense, the black-and-white colour scheme of much of the wardrobe contrasts magnificently with Crombie's predominantly brown production design, with the actors effortlessly standing out from the backgrounds. The occasional use of black-and-white stripes is also worth mentioning, as it subliminally intimates that the characters are imprisoned, not so much by their physical _milieu_, but rather within the hypocrisy, pettiness, and forced politeness of the Royal Court.\r\n\r\nOf Ryan's photography, perhaps the most impressive feat is that, despite the many scenes tracking characters through rooms, up stairs, and out doorways, there's not a single Steadicam shot anywhere in the film. He also makes copious use of 6mm fish-eye lenses, which distort the spaces the characters occupy whilst also showing much more of the environment than a normal lens, creating the sense of characters lost within an overload of background visual detail. Combined with the whip pans seen throughout the film, the cumulative effect is a world rendered strange, a place of distortion and unnatural compositions. As Ryan explains to _Deadline_,\r\n\r\n> _by the nature of being able to see everything in front of you, you then get a sense that the characters are almost imprisoned in the location. Even though they have all this luxury and power, they are a little bit isolated in this world. By showing you the whole room and also isolating the character in a small space you get a feeling of no escape._\r\n\r\nAs with most of Lanthimos' work, the film also uses natural light, which makes for some stunning candle-lit night-time compositions, partially recalling the paintings of someone like Jean-Antoine Watteau or, even moreso, Georges de La Tour.\r\n\r\nIn terms of acting, there really are no words to describe just how good Colman is. Utterly inhabiting the character, she is able to elicit empathy mere moments after behaving thoroughly shamefully, communicating a sense of both tragic inevitability and a childlike refusal to accept reality. The character could easily have been a grotesque villain or a pitiful broken shell, but Colman finds a nobler middle ground, straddling both interpretations without fully committing to either, moving from one to the other seamlessly throughout the film. Yes, she can be a horrible person with appalling manners and questionable hygiene, but she is also deeply lonely, a survivor who has lost 17 children in childbirth, a woman whose health has made her old before her time, a deeply tragic figure too na\u00efve to see how badly she is being manipulated by Sarah and Abigail, something encapsulated brilliantly in the haunting last shot. Rather than trying to downplay the contradictory facets of the character, Colman leans into them, illuminating Anne's humanity amongst her least appealing characteristics, and finding both wit and pathos in a character whose mercurial nature and excessive neediness could easily have rendered her the film's antagonist. It truly is one of the finest on-screen performances in a long time.\r\n\r\nWeisz and Stone are also both excellent. Weisz plays Sarah as a clinical manipulator, highly intelligent and relatively emotionless, whereas Stone's Abigail grows from a guileless chambermaid to a vindictive Janus-faced usurper. However, even at her most outrageous, there remains always something of the innocent girl we met earlier in the film.\r\n\r\nThe film's most salient theme, one could argue its very _raison d'\u00eatre_, is the dynamic of gender politics. For starters, it's headlined by three actresses (something which is still rare enough as to be notable), whilst the only two male characters of any significance (Godolphin and Harley) are both portrayed as petty, vainglorious idiots. Indeed, men in general are background players, existing only to be mocked, exploited, and duped \u2013 with their ridiculous wigs and heavy makeup, they exist only to support the women. Speaking to _Entertainment Weekly_, Powell explains that Lanthimos wanted the women to have natural hair and light makeup, and the men to wear gaudy makeup and ridiculous wigs;\r\n\r\n> _normally films are filled with men, and the women are the decoration in the background, and I've done many of those, so it was quite nice for it to be reversed this time where the women are the centre of the film and the men are the decoration in the background._\r\n\r\nSimilarly, speaking to the _Hollywood Reporter_, Weisz explains,\r\n\r\n> _what's interesting to me is that the men in_ The Favourite _are wearing lots of makeup and blusher and lipstick and high heels. That they're peripheral characters who are slightly ridiculous. They're an afterthought. That may not be unusual in life, but it's unusual to see in films._\r\n\r\nHowever, what's especially interesting about the film's depiction of gender is that the world of women is anything but a utopia. Yes, it's relatively free of toxic masculinity and the male gaze, but in most other aspects, there's no real difference between the matriarchy and the patriarchy. Sure, the women are much smarter than the men who surround them, but they are no less greedy or cruel. At the film's post-premi\u00e8re press conference at the Venice Film Festival, Lanthimos explained,\r\n\r\n> _what we tried to do is portray women as human beings. Because of the prevalent male gaze in cinema, women are portrayed as housewives, girlfriends...Our small contribution is we're just trying to show them as complex and wonderful and horrific as they are, like other human beings._\r\n\r\nThe preening and pettiness of the men, of course, is purposely overdone (Harley proclaims at one point that \"_a man must look pretty_\"), creating a _milieu_ where it is men, not women, who tend to be judged by their appearance, objectified, and used. Just look at the hilarious scene where Abigail coldly gives Masham a hand-job as she ruminates about more important matters \u2013 once she has gotten what she wants from him (his hand in marriage), she is no longer interested in him whatsoever, a direct reversal of traditional filmic gender roles, where it is usually men who use women. Men, in _The Favourite_, are utterly disposable.\r\n\r\nAs regards criticisms, although I personally wouldn't class them as flaws, some people will probably dislike the same things that many have disliked in Lanthimos's previous work \u2013 cold formal rigidity, perverse sense of humour, and irredeemable characters being irredeemably horrible to one another. There will be those who find the obviously intentional anachronisms too much, whilst others will take umbrage with the disregard for historical authenticity. For me, whilst I admire Lanthimos for trying to bring something new to his _oeuvre_, especially when compared to _Sacred Deer_, I felt the film was oftentimes trying to work its way through an identity crisis, unsure of exactly what kind of tone to settle on. I had similar feelings about the allegories that run throughout, but are never what you would call fully fleshed out. Obviously, it's a treatise on power and the ridiculous opulence of royalty, but that's not exactly an untapped issue in cinema. Additionally, one of my biggest problems with _Sacred Deer_ was how utterly pointless it felt, and although I got a lot more out of _The Favourite_, I had something of the same reaction to it. It could also be argued that the characters are a little two dimensional, and filmgoers who need a protagonist to latch onto, someone to root for, will be left rudderless.\r\n\r\n_The Favourite_ will probably attract a sizable unprepared audience because of awards buzz, positive reviews, and excellent trailer. Undoubtedly, for a lot of people, this will be their first exposure to Lanthimos, and I can only imagine what people expecting a Merchant-Ivory costume drama will make of it all. Neither morally enlightening nor historically respectful, _The Favourite_ offers a bleak assessment of humanity's core drives; not Lanthimos's bleakest, but a hell of a lot more nihilistic than an average multiplex goer will be used to. The characters within the film live in a _milieu_ of egotism, narcissism, sexual cruelty, psychological bullying, greed, and hunger for power. There's barely a hint of sentimentality, and very little that could be called morally righteous. I would have liked it to have more meat on its bones, but at the same time, one cannot deny that it presents something of a faithful looking-glass, as Lanthimos continues to corner the market in pointing out not just humanity's worst foibles, but its most egregious eccentricities and lamentable character defects.","id":"5d1fc6c315c6361729f3c567","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d1fc6c315c6361729f3c567","movie_id":375262}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"_**A plodding and overlong tale of violence and redemption that doesn't seem to know quite what it's trying to say**_\r\n\r\n> _You are afraid of hell. But that's all religion is, really. Fear of a place we'd rather not be, and where there's no such a thing as suicide to steal us away._\r\n\r\n- Patrick deWitt; _The Sisters Brothers_ (2011)\r\n\r\n_The Sisters Brothers_ is a film set in the American Old West, based on a book by a Canadian, made by a mostly French crew, shot primarily in Spain and Romania, featuring a Brit as an American, an American as a Brit, and a British trans comedian as a ruthless American businesswoman. And I don't bring this up out of mere frivolousness; rather, a certain element of schizophrenia is built into the film's very DNA. On the surface it's a Revisionist Western with a gritty Spaghetti aesthetic focusing very much on a group of anti-heroes, but it's also a story of two brothers getting on one another's nerves, a tale of avarice and the destructive potential of progressive thinking, a chase movie, a dark comedy, a tragic fable, an examination of the days when the Old West was giving way to an ever-encroaching modernity, a look at how the sins of the father are oft repeated by the children, a study of competing types of masculinity, and even a political thesis, postulating that there was a time in American history when certain people genuinely believed they could build a harmonious society based on direct democracy and the kind of socialist attitude to capitalism that would make even Bernie Sanders blush.\r\n\r\nThe English language debut of French director Jacques Audiard, who adapted the script with his regular writing partner Thomas Bidegain from Patrick deWitt's 2011 novel of the same name, the film posits that even those who seem irredeemable may one day find a path to redemption. Very much of a piece with Audiard's more celebrated humanist work such as _De battre mon c\u0153ur s'est arr\u00eat\u00e9_ (2005), _Un proph\u00e8te_ (2009), and _Dheepan_ (2015), _The Sisters Brothers_ works primarily as a character study about people trying to do what they feel is right in a world arrayed against them. Unfortunately, it did next-to-nothing for me. I wouldn't say it's a bad movie, as it clearly has a lot going for it; not the least of which is an unapologetic foregrounding of character over plot. However, its episodic rhythm, bifurcated narrative structure, and poorly-defined morality left me unengaged, frustrated, and rather bored.\r\n\r\n1851; the height of the California Gold Rush. In Oregon, Charlie Sisters (Joaquin Phoenix) and his older brother Eli (John C. Reilly) are hired guns working for \"The Commodore\" (a criminally underused Rutger Hauer). Far more sensitive and thoughtful than his younger brother, Eli is growing weary of the lifestyle, wanting to retire, settle down, and open a grocery store. The more unpredictable and volatile Charlie, however, wants to keep on killing indefinitely. After a mission descends into disarray, Eli is unimpressed when The Commodore appoints Charlie as \"lead man\" for their next quarry; a mild-manner chemist named Hermann Kermit Warm (Riz Ahmed). Telling Eli that Warm has stolen something from The Commodore which they are to retrieve, Charlie is under orders to keep their real purpose to himself for the time being. Unsure of Warm's exact location, The Commodore has already sent highly-intelligent tracker John Morris (Jake Gyllenhaal), a man too gentile for killing, to pick up his trail and detain him until the brothers catch up. Keeping them abreast of his progress via a series of letters, it doesn't take long for Morris to find Warm, telling the brothers he will await them in Jacksonville. However, when Warm learns that The Commodore has sent men after him, he explains to Morris that he has created an elixir that when poured into a river, will illuminate any gold deposits on the river bed, with the only catch being that the potion is extremely caustic, and any sustained exposure results in severe burns. Recognising that Morris is only an advance, he guesses that whoever is still to come is under orders to torture the formula out of him and then kill him. Learning that Warm doesn't want to use the gold for himself, but to help establish \"_an ideal living space, ruled by the laws of true democracy and sharing_\", Morris decides to join him, and they head to San Francisco in an attempt to evade the approaching brothers.\r\n\r\nA passion project for star and producer John C. Reilly, who purchased the rights to deWitt's novel shortly after it was published, it was he who first brought the material to Audiard's attention. One of the best-reviewed films at the 2018 Venice Film Festival, where it won Audiard his first Silver Lion for Best Director, when the film went on general release in North America later the same month, it flopped badly, earning only $3 million against a $38 million budget. That's a shame, as Audiard is immensely talented, and although I personally didn't enjoy this particular film, he deserves as much success as he can get. In terms of the novel, I don't know a huge amount about it, but I would imagine Warm's desire to build a Phalanst\u00e8re in Dallas is inspired by La R\u00e9union, a Fourierist-based utopian community founded in 1855 by Victor Prosper Considerant on the banks of the Trinity River. Wishing to make La R\u00e9union a \"communal experiment administered by a system of direct democracy\", Considerant planned to allow participants to share in profits from capital investments. However, the settlement lasted only 18 months before financial insolvency, shortage of skilled participants, inadequate farming methods, and untenable maintenance costs led to its dissolution.\r\n\r\nAs one would expect from Audiard, working with his regular editor Juliette Welfling (_Le scaphandre et le papillon_; _The Hunger Games_; _Ocean's 8_) and production designer Michel Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my (_Dobermann_; _Les salauds_; _Frantz_) and for the first time with cinematographer Beno\u00eet Debie (_Irr\u00e9versible_; _Lost River_; _One More Time with Feeling_) and costume designer Milena Canonero (_Barry Lyndon_; _Chariots of Fire_; _The Grand Budapest Hotel_), the film looks amazing. Very much adopting the visual style of a Spaghetti Western, everything on screen looks dirty and\/or dusty, whether it's the worn and lived-in costumes, the spartan and uncared for buildings, or even the perpetually unshaven characters and their rotting teeth (an historically accurate detail absent in most modern westerns). Of particular note are the shootouts, of which there are three significant examples. The first takes place at night, and is shot from a distance and without much in the way of coverage; the second is shot primarily from the point of view of two characters doing their best to hide; and the third isn't seen at all - we remain inside as the shooting can be heard on the street.\r\n\r\nThis should convey, as well as anything, just how revisionist _The Sisters Brothers_ is; the genre's tropes are all there, but they're examined from unexpected angles. A bear attack on a camp is not only not seen, it's not even heard, with our first indication of the incident being when one character wakes up to find another has shot and killed a bear during the night; men are seen riding horses, but when a horse is mortally wounded, the man to whom he belongs cries and apologises; whisky is drunk aplenty, but one character would rather sit alone thinking about home than go whoring or drinking; a film about hired guns ends on a shot of a man sitting in a bath; the anticipated climatic shootout plays out in a manner you'll never see coming. If it does nothing else, the film really drives home that to be able to truly subvert generic tropes, one must first understand and respect how those tropes work.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with an extraordinarily beautiful and striking scene. It's night on the prairie, which is so dark, we can make out only the barest outline of a house, with a smaller building nearby. After some shouted dialogue, a shootout begins between the house and the smaller building, with each booming gun blast sending out sparks and illuminating for a micro-second the surrounding area. Having vanquished their opponents, the brothers are about to leave the area, when they see a horse, its back covered in flames, galloping away, trying to outrun the fire from which it doesn't understand it can never escape. Realising the barn is on fire, Eli dashes in to try to save the trapped horses, whilst Charlie urges him to remain outside. Is the metaphor of the burning horse a little on the nose? Absolutely; try as they might, the brothers can never escape that which brings them pain, no matter how far or fast they run. But just because it's not exactly subtle doesn't mean it's ineffective, and as opening visual metaphors go, it's as striking an example as you're likely to find. The scene also immediately establishes the differences between Eli (who would risk his own life to save a group of horses) and Charlie (who sees no point in such sacrifices).\r\n\r\nIn relation to the _milieu_, yes, this is the Old West of John Ford, Anthony Mann, and Sergio Leone, but Audiard defamiliarises it as much as possible. A recurring theme, for example, is that this is a world on the brink of modernity, but whose inhabitants are still very much rooted in the past. This is depicted via a running gag about Eli's fascination with a curious modern invention (the toothbrush; so complicated a device, it comes with an instruction manual), and his childlike glee at staying in a hotel with indoor plumbing. Elsewhere, Morris remarks on how quickly the country is changing, writing, \"_I have travelled through places that didn't exist three months ago. First tents, then houses, then shops, with women fiercely discussing the price of flour._\" Additionally, Warm's progressive egalitarian vision for the future and his desire to use his formula to create a better society for all, allows the film to examine the belief (however short-lived) that out of the lawlessness, land thievery, and Native American genocide, a certain section of the populace hoped a more mutually beneficial society might arise.\r\n\r\nHowever, Audiard, of course, is not na\u00efve enough to suggest that the Old West was especially peaceful or safe; although on the cusp of modernity, this is still a merciless place where violence is a form of currency. But even here, he subverts the genre, using a recurring motif of either Charlie or Eli shooting an already downed opponent pleading for his life, which is certainly not what we've come to expect from the (figurative) white hat protagonists so familiar in Hollywood westerns. Coupled with this, there's the ever-present background of the Gold Rush, and the mercenary mentality it fostered. Indeed, the whole plot is set in motion by The Commodore's greed, and as the film goes on, it comes to focus more and more on the clash between a Darwinian survival of the fittest, might is right mentality (represented by Charlie) and a more esoteric and politically progressive way of thinking (represented by Warm), with Eli and Morris functioning as something of a halfway house between the two extremes.\r\n\r\nIn terms of acting, Phoenix, Gyllenhaal, and Ahmed all have moments to shine (a monologue in which Morris describes his hatred for his father is especially worth looking out for), but this is Reilly's film through-and-through, turning Eli from a possibly oafish sidekick into an achingly human emotional fulcrum. His nuanced performance allows us to see just how badly Eli's conscience is affecting him, and how much he is drifting away from the increasingly amoral Charlie. Eli has no desire to split with Charlie, but he is slowly coming to the conclusion that he may have no option but to do just that. It's an extraordinarily subtle performance by Reilly, that reminded me a lot of his work in Paul Thomas Anderson's _Magnolia_ (1999), where he played a cop in love with a drug addict who shows unexpected emotional vulnerability, and Rob Marshall's _Chicago_ (2002), in which he played the dim but loyal-to-a-fault husband who emerges as the film's only really moral character. His unexpected affection for his horse is especially poignant, and his tendency to sniff a shawl given to him by his girlfriend is beautifully played by Reilly.\r\n\r\nHowever, for all this, I really disliked the movie, for a myriad of reasons. For one, I found it far too episodic, lurching from one incident to next with little in the way of connective tissue between them. I also didn't particularly like the shifts in focus from the brothers on the one hand to Morris and Warm on the other, with each strand serving only to detract from the other, making it impossible for either to fully settle. A knock-on from this is that the film lacks a strong lead character; although everything suggests that Eli is the protagonist, Phoenix is billed above Reilly, and a lot of the time, Eli seems more like Charlie's sidekick than his equal, making it difficult to figure out where one's empathy is supposed to lie. This difficulty becomes especially problematic in relation to the morally questionable _d\u00e9nouement_, in which there is an incident which seems designed for the audience to roundly condemn one of the main characters, only for the film to then give us a 15-minute epilogue seemingly designed to redeem him.\r\n\r\nThis throws into relief what for me was the most egregious problem - none of what we see seems to mean anything, there are virtually no consequences for anything the brothers do (although plenty of consequences for others). This left me scratching my head as to what the film is trying to say. Is it suggesting that even the most morally repugnant of men deserve a shot at redemption? If that is the case, however, its rhetorical position is not especially cogent, as the character mentioned above in no way deserves redemption, allowing his greed and stubbornness to cause untold suffering to others whilst he gets off relatively scot-free. Furthermore, the aforementioned epilogue is hugely anticlimactic, which, I understand, is kind of the point, but it's still a very strange way to wrap things up, feeling forced and emotionally manipulative, completely out of tonal and thematic pace with the rest of the film, and also undermining what could have been a deeply affecting bittersweet final scene. The film is also far too long, and could easily have lost a half hour or more, with the meandering plot becoming interminably boring on more than one occasion.\r\n\r\nAs a kind of an aside, it's also worth mentioning an aesthetic decision that has me baffled. On occasion, the film is shot within a circular frame (think of how films often simulate POV through a telescope), often combined with racked focus and unsteady photography. I'm assuming the idea is to try to replicate the style of a Kinetograph, but given that device wouldn't be invented for another four decades, I'm not entirely sure what the point is, as the scenes which employ the style don't seem to contain anything to justify the usage. An especially strange example is a scene which sees Charlie speaking direct-to-camera, the only example of such in the whole film. Is this a break in the fourth wall, and if so, why? If it isn't a break, from whose POV is the scene shot? This kind of unjustified visual trickery pulls you right out of the film and offers next-to-nothing in the way of thematic compensation.\r\n\r\nThe four performances at the heart of _The Sisters Brothers_ earn it a great deal of leeway. But even taking that into account, I just couldn't get into it. Far too plodding and thematically unfocused, although I initially liked the characters a great deal, by the last act, I just wanted it to end already. It's certainly original in how it approaches a number of generic tropes, and that's to be commended, but the imprecise and poorly constructed episodic narrative saps away the goodwill built up by the aesthetic design and the acting. Is it a western? A comedy? A tragedy? An esoteric political piece? A realist depiction of greed trumping idealism? In the end, it doesn't seem to know itself, trying to be many things, and ending up being none of them.","id":"5d5d8a426743fa00137029fe","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d5d8a426743fa00137029fe","movie_id":440161}
{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Just didn't work for me_**\r\n\r\n> _I had a line that used to end the film but I ended up cutting it out. It said: \"film is the art of conjuring ghosts, not getting rid of them.\" I used to think filming could act like a kind of catharsis and exorcism: you film to try to get something off your chest so that you can get rid of it. But I never found it to play out that way, because by making a film you're essentially creating a ghost that you're going to live and travel around the world with, and talk to people about. Essentially, you're making something that will live on - you're not getting rid_ _of anything. So, it wasn't really cathartic at all. That said, I already felt a certain peace in my relationship with my father before I started making the film. I wasn't in a turmoil trying to work it out, so to speak. But I did feel like there was some unfinished business to attend to, and I wanted to know more about him and his world, and looking back I feel as though I did build something which now has its own existence in the world, and there's something really satisfying about that. But it\u2019s always an unfinished process. I was thinking a lot about the idea of reconciliation when I was making the film. Reconciliation between me and my father, between North and South, between his time and mine. I thought a lot about what it is like to place one image next to another. There's always something missing in between, a weirdly primal desire of wanting to make a whole out of what is not. It's almost like the idea of going back to the womb - a certain desire that can never truly be fulfilled._\r\n\r\n- Donal Foreman; \"The Personal and the Political: An Interview with Donal Foreman\" (Leonardo Goi); _Mubi_ (May 14, 2018)\r\n\r\nFor me, if a documentary gets a theatrical release, there must be a tangible reason as to why. By that I mean, why was it released in the cinema, as opposed to on television, which, in terms of how audiences engage with the mediums, is a more natural home for the documentary form, where a film can find a much larger audience over a longer period of time. There needs to be something, anything, that makes the documentary inherently cinematic in some way. The majority of documentaries don't provide such a reason. For example, two films that spring to mind are Dror Moreh's _The Gatekeepers_ (2012) and Laura Poitras's _Risk_ (2016). _The Gatekeepers_ is about Shin Bet, whilst _Risk_ tells the story of Julian Assange's self-imposed exile in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. The first, which I actually quite enjoyed as a documentary, is a series of visually drab talking-head interviews with the six still-living former-heads of Shin Bet, and the second is a poorly edited and narratively confused valorisation of its subject. Neither feature anything to justify their theatrical release. Compare this to documentaries as varied as, say, Kevin Macdonald's _One Day in September_ (1999) or Jos\u00e9 Padilha's _\u00d4nibus 174_ (2002), with their thriller-esque narratives, plot-twists, heroes, villains, and governmental corruption and conspiracy; David Sington's _The Fear of 13_ (2015), which, despite consisting entirely of an interview with one person, is visually and aurally fascinating; Werner Herzog's _Cave of Forgotten Dreams_ (2010), as aesthetically perfect a documentary as you're ever likely to see, especially if seen in the intended 3D format; or Emer Reynolds's _The Farthest_ (2017), with its awe-inspiring and deeply emotional story of the 1977 Voyager space probes.\r\n\r\nI've spent this first paragraph giving a rather wordy introduction as I want to be clear about where I'm coming from regarding my problems with _The Image You Missed_ \u2013 sadly, it is never able to justify its theatrical release; the whole time I was watching it, I was thinking to myself \"why is this being shown in the cinema?\" I say \"sadly\" because I really wanted to like it; it's a low budget documentary that takes a deeply personal approach to an inherently Irish political situation of which any Irish person over the age of thirty will have memories, and, depending on your political leanings, is either a source of great pride or deeply held shame. In short, there's a lot to root for here. Essentially, the film is a \"dialogue\" between director Donal Foreman and his dead father, Arthur MacCaig. An Irish-American born in New Jersey in 1948, MacCaig came to Belfast as a tourist in the early years of the Troubles, and remained fascinated with the city and the political situation as a documentarian, living first in Paris, and eventually in Belfast itself. Interested in exploring the disparity between the tribal, religious-based conflict depicted in British and American media, with what he saw as a more non-sectarian struggle between \"coloniser\" and \"colonised\", MacCaig's unapologetically Republican stance soon earned him extraordinary access to the IRA (indeed, when he died, he had a pseudo-Republican funeral \u2013 Danny Morrison and Sinn F\u00e9in PRO Joe Austin spoke, whilst Gerry Adams attended).\r\n\r\nMacCaig's best-known film is _The Patriot Game_, a feature-length 1979 documentary made for French television, which uses street-interviews and IRA-insider material to chart the history of conflict in the province of Ulster from the formation of the Northern Irish state in 1922. Critically, the film was a modest international success, with _The Chicago Reader_'s B. Ruby Rich calling it \"_the best overview of the Northern Irish conflict that we've seen_,\" and _The Village Voice_'s J. Hoberman citing it as \"_vivid, informative, and partisan_.\" Closer to home, _The Guardian_'s Kevin J. Kelley praised it for \"_debunking the twin myths that the IRA is a 'terrorist organisation' fighting 'a religious war'._\" As is mentioned in _The Image You Missed_, when the British Foreign Office warned its embassies that _The Patriot Game_ was \"_damaging and highly critical of Her Majesty's Government_,\" MacCaig welcomed it as \"_the best review I ever had_.\"\r\n\r\nMacCaig died in Belfast in 2008, when Foreman was 22. Raised in the North Strand area of Dublin by his mother, Foreman only met MacCaig a handful of times. Nevertheless, they had reconciled a few months before MacCaig died, and after the funeral, Foreman travelled to an apartment MacCaig owned in Paris to go through his belongings. Much to his surprise, he unearthed over one-hundred hours of never-before-seen documentary footage, and the idea for _The Image You Missed_ was born, as Foreman essentially tries to engage in a conversation with MacCaig by way of cutting between MacCaig's footage and his own, directly addressing his dead father, and reading in voiceover letters written by MacCaig (indeed, the whole enterprise could be labelled epistolary in design).\r\n\r\nIn this sense, both the poster and the opening credit read \"_A Film Between Donal Foreman | Arthur MacCaig_\". Not \"a film by\", or \"a film about\", but \"a film between\". The official website describes the film as a \"_documentary essay_\", and this cannot be overemphasised. This is, at the most basic level, a film in which someone still living attempts to 'communicate' with someone already dead (although not, obviously, in a s\u00e9ance kind of way). With that in mind, the film has no discernible narrative as such, using editing to juxtapose, contrast, comment upon, and suggest thematic links between the footage shot by the father and that shot by the son. The narrative jumps back and forth fairly randomly amongst MacCaig's footage, employing what could be termed \"thematic editing\". There's also no real central character; the documentary is not 'about' either man in the classic sense of the term; it's about the space between them.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, for me, it just didn't work. Apart from the already alluded to lack of theatrical justification, which really can't be overstated, one of the biggest problems was the failure to contextualise anything on screen; the tendency to jump in and out of scenes without even remotely attempting to suture the viewer into the _milieu_. Granted, it makes no claims to be an informative historical overview, but the viewer still needs to be situated in some way, shape, or form in relation to what they're watching. Foreman doesn't use the backdrop of the Troubles to inform the dialogue between himself and MacCaig, but neither does he use that dialogue to inform the presentation of the Troubles, so the fact that the film is set in Belfast is, bizarrely, and quite paradoxically, kind of irrelevant. Foreman, however, has argued that the interaction between the personal and the political is a central connective tissue in the film; speaking to _The Irish Times_, he states,\r\n\r\n> _if it had been just about my father and my relationship with my father, without those added layers about politics and history and cinema to engage with, I don't think I would have made the film. I saw his archive as a pretext to grapple with a lot of interesting questions and challenge myself as a film-maker to deal with political questions that I hadn't found a way to do in my films before._\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there's little evidence of this in the film, with the Troubles never being examined beyond that of an intermittent surface-level presentation.\r\n\r\nTied to this is the single biggest issue I had with the film, a question I found myself asking after about twenty minutes \u2013 why should I, or anyone else, care that Foreman had a tough relationship with his father? Who doesn't? I wouldn't expect anyone to sit through a documentary in which I work out my daddy issues, not unless those issues speak to a more all-encompassing truth, and I'm really not sure why Foreman should be any different, as he certainly provides no such reason in the film. And precisely because he _doesn't_ allow the personal and the political to inform one another, the film just comes across as a guy with a camera watching old footage shot by his dad.\r\n\r\nMaybe I didn't respond correctly to the form, maybe I wasn't the target demographic (at the screening I attended, I was the youngest person in the cinema by a good ten or fifteen years at least, and I'm 40), I'm not sure, but whatever the case, I was just left wondering as to what the purpose of any of it was.","id":"5cdb7207c3a36836f6c509f7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cdb7207c3a36836f6c509f7","movie_id":499446}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Laconic, measured and easy to digest, although it could have done with more substance_**\r\n\r\n> _How many addicts are out on the street simply because Mr. Sharp brought the cocaine here?_\r\n\r\n- Sam Dolnick quoting AUSA Chris Graveline; \"The Sinaloa Cartel's 90-Year-Old Drug Mule\"; _New York Times_ (June 11, 2014)\r\n\r\n63 years since he first appeared on-screen (an uncredited role in Jack Arnold's 1955 _Revenge of the Creature_), _The Mule_ is 88-year-old Clint Eastwood's first acting role since Robert Lorenz's _Trouble with the Curve_ in 2012, and his first film as a director since about a week ago. It is, however, the first time he's directed himself since the excellent _Gran Torino_ in 2008. Known for being incredibly efficient when it comes to filmmaking, Eastwood likes to get scripts into production before they've gone through too many rewrites, he rigidly shoots only what's on the page, he avoids multiple takes and on-set experimentation, and he keeps the editing process as simple as possible \u2013 so basically, he's the anti-Terrence Malick. With this in mind, he has maintained an extraordinary rate of turnover, with _The Mule_ the 37th feature he's directed since _Play Misty for Me_ in 1971.\r\n\r\nOf course, when you work at that rate for as long as he has, you're going to put out a few duds, and although his directorial output has gone through ups and downs in the past, his most recent work has been arguably the most disappointing of his career, with pretty much everything he's directed since _Gran Torino_ being subpar. Whether it's the hokey sentimentality of _Hereafter_ (2010), the oversimplification (and awful makeup) of _J. Edgar_ (2011), the lifeless _Jersey Boys_ (2014), the unashamed and troubling jingoism of _American Sniper_ (2015), the unnecessary embellishments of _Sully_ (2016), or the spectacularly misjudged experiment in casting that was _15:17 to Paris_ (2018), the days when he could direct no less than seven masterpieces \u2013 _Unforgiven_ (1992), _A Perfect World_ (1993), _The Bridges of Madison County_ (1995), _Mystic River_ (2003), _Million Dollar Baby_ (2004), _Flags of Our Fathers_ (2006), and _Letters from Iwo Jima_ (2006) \u2013 in a 14-year period are long gone. Indeed, the most notable thing he's done in the last decade is ramble somewhat incoherently to an empty chair.\r\n\r\nThe bad news is that _The Mule_ is a strangely formless film, almost a collection of only vaguely connected scenes rather than an actual narrative with forward momentum; it has precious little depth or nuance; there's some troubling casual racism, most of which we're encouraged to laugh at; the tone is all over the place; Eastwood's character has not one, but _two_ threesomes with young women; and it wastes almost all of its excellent cast. The good news is that, somehow, it's extremely enjoyable, and is easily the best film he's directed since _Gran Torino_.\r\n\r\nTelling the story of Earl Stone (Eastwood), a 90-year-old horticulturist and Korean War veteran, the film begins in 2005 as Stone is honoured at a daylily festival. Clearly enjoying the adulation (and the attention from the ladies), he doesn't seem to care that he's supposed to be attending the wedding of his daughter Iris (Eastwood's real daughter, Alison Eastwood). As she frets about his failure to turn up, Mary (Dianne Wiest), Stone's ex-wife and Iris's mother, points out that it's not a shock, as he has a history of letting his family down. The film then jumps to 2017 \u2013 Iris hasn't spoken to him since her wedding, and he is estranged from the whole family, except Iris's daughter, Ginny (Taissa Farmiga), who is herself getting married. His daylily business has gone bust, unable to compete with online shopping, and his house is in foreclosure. After a very public dressing down from Mary, Stone is approached by a friend of Ginny's who tells him that he knows some people who will pay anyone with a perfect driving record to \"_just drive_\" for them. Arriving at a garage guarded by heavily armed Hispanics, Stone is told to drive some duffle bags from El Paso to Chicago, with the only rule that he isn't to look inside the bags. He happily agrees, apparently unaware he has just signed on to mule for the Sinaloa Cartel. When he does inevitably look in the bags, finding cocaine, he isn't especially bothered, and as his first few runs go well, the Cartel start to increase the amount of drugs he's muling. So much so that cartel boss, Laton (Andy Garc\u00eda), asks to personally meet this new mule, who has been nicknamed \"Tata\" (\"Grandfather\") by his handlers. Meanwhile, the leader of a DEA task force (Laurence Fishburne) is under pressure to start getting results, and so he gives agents Bates (Bradley Cooper) and Trevino (Michael Pe\u00f1a) instructions to start making arrests sooner rather than later, which they promise to do, explaining that they are nearing in on a prime target \u2013 a prolific mule known only as Tata.\r\n\r\nWritten by Nick Schenk, who also wrote _Gran Torino_, _The Mule_ is, extraordinarily, based on a true story. Specifically, it's inspired by Sam Dolnick's 2014 _New York Times_ article, \"The Sinaloa Cartel's 90-Year-Old Drug Mule\", which tells the story of Leo Sharp, an award-winning horticulturist and World War II veteran who became the Sinaloa Cartel's most reliable mule. Despondent from financial problems and the loss of his daylily business, Sharp began transporting cocaine from Arizona to Michigan in 2005. With Sinaloa quickly realising how reliable he was, he was soon moving up to 300 kilograms per trip and transporting as much as $2million dollars in the opposite direction. In October 2011, while in possession of 90 kilograms, Sharp was arrested by Michigan state police operating as part of a DEA task force. He was sentenced to three years in prison, but was released in 2015 after a year behind bars, due to declining health. He died of natural causes in 2016 at the age of 92.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be said about _The Mule_ is that the trailer is misleading. And then some. Suggesting a tense, nail-biting thriller in which Stone is appalled to find out what he has been transporting, but is unable to back out of his deal, and must try to keep the Cartel on-side whilst evading the attention of the DEA, the trailer has next-to-no relationship with the actual film. It's not tense, my nails were thoroughly unbitten, Stone isn't overly concerned when he learns what's in the bags, and the very narrative structure means it's inevitable that Bates will catch up to him sooner or later. It most certainly isn't the Michael Mann-esque crime thriller it's being advertised as. Instead, _The Mule_ is laconic and contemplative, laid-back and not especially dramatic (there's more fireworks in the arguments Stone has with his family than in his relationship with the Cartel, and the film as a whole is more _Last of the Summer Wine_ than _Miami Vice_). Indeed, as drama, _The Mule_ is fairly insubstantial, telling a threadbare story populated by underwritten characters, void of much of an emotional core, and with next-to-nothing in the way of an exciting _d\u00e9nouement_.\r\n\r\nAs a director, Eastwood's last three films (_American Sniper_, _Sully_, and _The 15:17 to Paris_) have all told true stories of ordinary people who have come to be seen as heroes for one reason or another, whether they wanted to or not. Earl Stone is definitely not a hero (any more than Leo Sharp), but he is an everyman, a person down on his luck who finds a way to stick it to the system. And that makes him, at best, empathetic, and at worst, an anti-hero (yes, the fact that he's literally transporting misery and suffering is problematic, but we'll get to that). Stone is charming, funny, and intelligent, and his attempts to make up for his mistakes with Iris by being there for Ginny seem genuine. Eastwood plays Stone as full of regret, someone who knows he was a terrible husband and father, and the fact that his estranged daughter is played by his real daughter gives the film the impression of being personal (Eastwood, like Stone, has an, let's be diplomatic, \"appreciation\" for the ladies). From a physical standpoint, Eastwood looks noticeably older than he did in _Trouble with the Curve_; he walks hunched over, he looks frail enough for a strong wind to knock him down, there's next-to-no meat on his arms. Almost all of that Eastwood-ruggedness is gone, and this is easily the most physically vulnerable we've ever seen him on screen, even more so than that other titan of old-school American masculinity, John Wayne, who made _The Shootist_ (1976) when he was literally dying.\r\n\r\nIn a lot of ways, Stone is not unlike Walt Kowalski, the hateful racist character Eastwood played in _Gran Torino_. They are both Korean War veterans who find themselves alienated from the world they live in, and who believe the next generation lack fortitude (at one point, Stone complains, \"_this generation can't open a fruit-box without calling the internet_\"). However, Stone is much softer, and on the universal scale of racism, whereas Kowalski is Mel Gibson-racist, Stone is Prince Philip-racist; the type of racism we forgive because he's 837 years old, half-senile, and grew up \"_in a different time_.\" Sure, he calls Hispanics \"beaners\" and jokes about them getting deported, but they don't seem to mind. Sure, he pulls over to help a black couple change a tire, proudly telling them he likes \"_to help the negro folks out_\", but they just politely inform him that people don't use the word \"negro\" anymore. And it isn't just ethnicities. Encountering a group of lesbian bikers, he refers to them as \"_dykes on bikes_\". All three of these examples are played for laughs, and whilst that might be fair enough in a film that depicts non-Caucasians with something resembling diversity, _The Mule_'s non-white characters are one-dimensional stereotypes; every Hispanic character, for example, is either a drug-running criminal (most of whom have neck tattoos) or an industrious labourer. If the film itself didn't come across as so racially reductive, Stone's racism would be easier to accept and defend.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the film's most egregious failing, however, is that it never once addresses the fact that Stone's criminal enterprise is fuelling addiction and destroying lives; as far as the film is concerned, he may as well be transporting oranges. The darker implications of his drug-running are kept firmly behind the curtain, out of sight of the audience. Instead, _The Mule_ presents Stone as almost a modern-day Robin Hood, using his new-found cash to pay for Ginny's wedding and education, and to renovate the local VA hall. This _could_ be a sly comment on Obama-era economics, suggesting that the country is in such a mess that issues like the exorbitant price of education and the mistreatment of veterans can only be addressed with the proceeds of crime. But honestly, that's a serious stretch, and it seems far more likely it's the film's way of ensuring we continue to admire Stone despite what he's doing. In any case, even when the film has no option but to directly deal with his criminality, it's done in such a way as to minimise the darker aspects. For example, Laton may be the most jovial and least-threatening drug lord ever put on screen. Garc\u00eda does what he can with the part, but given the fact that most of his screen time sees him fooling about with a solid gold shotgun, his options are limited (one legitimately funny moment sees Stone marvelling at Laton's mansion, asking \"_who do I have to kill to get a place like this?_\" to which Laton responds, \"_many, many people_\"). A much more effective character is Gustavo (Clifton Collins Jr.), Laton's henchman. Collins Jr. is a superb actor, and can do legitimately intimidating in his sleep, but even an actor of his calibre can do little with only three scenes, in two of which he doesn't even have any dialogue (in a film with a wasted cast, the underuse of Collins Jr. stands out).\r\n\r\nHand-in-hand with the film's non-threatening drug runners is its depiction of local law enforcement, who are, for the most part, presented sarcastically (at one point, Stone distracts a pesky cop with a tub of caramel popcorn). The DEA characters are presented a little more respectfully, however. Fishburne's unnamed character, for example, is depicted as a good agent shackled by a bureaucracy that only cares for short-term wins. Thus, they pressure him to pressure his field agents to get results before the case has matured, meaning any arrests will be strictly low-level. This aspect of the film reminded me of the first season of _The Wire_, where Deputy Ops. Ervin Burrell (Frankie Faison) is constantly pressuring Lt. Daniels (Lance Reddick) to get some \"_dope on the table_\" \u2013 small scale arrests that provide a photo op for Baltimore PD brass to proudly display the confiscated dope on the table, irrespective of the fact that such operations result in the arrests of street hoppers rather than anyone in management.\r\n\r\nA key scene in relation to the film's depiction of both law-enforcement and minorities, but one which is disappointingly played for laughs, is when the cops pull over who they think is Tata only to quickly realise it's the wrong man (it's a young Hispanic) and they're guilty of racial profiling. The man is terrified, well aware of stats concerning police shootings of non-whites (there's something deeply unsettling about how well he knows the routine, and his line, \"_statistically speaking, this is the most dangerous five minutes of my life_\" speaks volumes about modern America). The scene should have given rise to a socio-political commentary \u2013 what is it like to be the victim of racial profiling, how does it feel to know that you've just committed racial profiling, what does it say about society in general when an innocent man knows enough about such instances as to fear for his life? Eastwood, however, is more interested in guffaws. We've seen racial profiling and resultant deaths examined in several recent films \u2013 Steve McQueen's _Widows_, George Tillman, Jr.'s _The Hate U Give_, and Reinaldo Marcus Green's _Monsters and Men_ (all 2018) \u2013 as well as slightly older titles such as Paul Haggis's _Crash_ (2004) and Ryan Coogler's _Fruitvale Station_ (2013), but the depiction here is, sadly, very shallow. The film is also silent on the inverse \u2013 that Stone is such a good mule because of his white privilege.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that the film's structure is bizarre \u2013 there's no real sense of narrative cohesion, as one scene jumps to another without a huge amount connecting them. You could take the various driving scenes, cut them in a completely different manner, and you would still have the same film; Stone picks up the drugs, drives for a while, drops off the drugs and gets paid, drives some more, has a scene with his family, we check in on the DEA, Stone picks up the drugs, drives for a while etc. The whole thing feels void of urgency, and after a while you realise that the threadbare outline of a story is all the story you're going to get. Additionally, there's an utter lack of tension (for which Eastwood tries to compensate with silly scenes such as when Bates follows Stone into a parking lot and shouts \"Hey.\" Is he going to arrest our hero? Nah, Stone just left his flask behind). On top of this, the way Eastwood's camera leers at the bare asses of a bunch of women at a party in Laton's house is disconcerting, and pretty much a textbook example of the male gaze. Also, with the single exception of Stone, the characters are one-dimensional at best (Fishburne's character doesn't even get a name; Pe\u00f1a is nothing but the comic relief to Cooper's straight man).\r\n\r\nIf all that sounds negative, it should, because I focused on what I felt was wrong with the film. However, irrespective of these failings, I thoroughly enjoyed _The Mule_. It could and should have been a lot better. It could have been a socially conscious thriller looking at racial profiling, drug-dealing, American masculinity, generational conflict, socio-economic issues. But, in fairness, that isn't the film Eastwood set out to make. He has made many interesting political films in his career. _The Mule_ is not one of them. Instead, he's turned the material into a jaunty, congenial, inoffensive, and easy-to-watch meditation on age and family, set in a _milieu_ where the one-time trappings of male success are now considered character failings, and focused on a character unable to wrap his brain around this shift in ideology. Despite myself, I can forgive the casual racism, the structural problems, the wasted cast, the use of serious social issues to get cheap laughs, and I can do so because the film is simply enjoyable. _The Mule_ isn't going to change your life, nor is it going to win Eastwood a legion of new fans. But it was never supposed to. Instead, it accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. And it's immensely entertaining to boot.","id":"5d2906e8a294f000112a3b9e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d2906e8a294f000112a3b9e","movie_id":504172}

Sticking strictly to a formula that will either infuriate or satiate horror genre fans, \"The Nun\" delivers enough creepy boo-jump tropes to keep it above average. There's plenty of roaming about dark corridors and churchyards, with lanterns our only prominent saviours from the terrors of the dark. If, and it's a big if, you don't mind that Corin Hardy's film isn't trying to raise the bar for horror, and is in fact staying safe, then there's a decent enough good time to be had here. If you be one of those who constantly moans about bringing nothing new to the table, don't bother with this one, in fact, think of something new to bring to the table yourselves then... \r\n\r\nThe set-pieces hold up well enough (buried alive shiver shiver), the atmospheric dread only occasionally punctured by Abel Korzeniowski's bombastic score. The story is interesting enough, such as why the entity is bringing terror to the abbey, what is the link to the \"Warren\" family, and the backstory axis for Father Burke (Demi\u00e1n Bichir) brings another demonic layer to the plotting. While talking about \"bringing something new to the table\", for the first time in this series we actually get a bit of humour, mostly from Jonas Bloquet's likable Frenchie character. Taissa Farmiga holds the lead well, where she has a very appealing visual reaction style that will serve her well if she stays in genre mode. While Maxime Alexandre's cinematography (low lights and fogs) is a big improvement from \"Annabelle: Creation\" and is tonally compliant.\r\n\r\nThis formula has been done much better previously, such as Hammer's take on \"The Woman In Black\", but even then they were going on about new stuff being brought to the table etc etc etc. It is what it is, a boo-jump haunted house (buildings) picture that is there for those who like such things, who buy into it on that level. Is this a great film? Absolutely not, but it works on its intended terms and any expectation of a new branch of horror is going to have you crying over spilt blood. 6\/10","id":"5d9b5c5d1d01910020b7129c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d9b5c5d1d01910020b7129c","movie_id":439079}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Some wounds do not close; I have many such. One just walks around with them and sometimes one can feel them filling with blood. \r\n\r\nThe Favourite is directed by Yorgos Lanthimos and written by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara. It stars Olivia Colman, Rachael Weisz, Emma Stone, Faye Daveney, James Smith, Mark Gatiss, Willem Dalby and Nicholas Hoult.     \r\n\r\nIn early 18th century England, a frail Queen Anne (Colman) occupies the throne and her close friend, Lady Sarah (Weisz), governs the country in her stead. When a new servant, Abigail (Stone), arrives, her charm endears her to Sarah. \r\n\r\nA critical darling with awards and nominations to match, The Favourite, to me at least, is something of an acquired taste. Firstly it should be noted that as a history lesson it's pure bunkum, so much so I wondered if Lanthimos is actually Mel Gibson. Though to be fair to Lanthimos, he never hid from the fact he and his writers were pretty much making it up for entertainment purpose.\r\n\r\nThe craft on show is top level, with three high quality lead lady performances giving their all for the director. Lanthimos also has some nifty camera tricks up his sleeve, it's clear that this is a talent to follow for those so inclined to his off kilter type of film making. Helps, too, that the costuming and set designs are also from the top draw. It's hard to fault from a production standpoint.\r\n\r\nNarratively the pic is pulsing with parliamentary politics that blends with royal shenanigans. Yet ultimately the prime concern is about the battle for Queen Anne's soul between Sarah and Abigail. This consistently remains fascinating, even as Lanthimos continues to sex things up and pitches black comedy alongside the tragic thrum at the core. \r\n\r\nIt's an odd mix of a film that I personally don't think works as a whole, and with the finale a crushing disappointment, it leaves one in awe and yet also unsatisfied. 7\/10","id":"5e76b130a055ef00182d497f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e76b130a055ef00182d497f","movie_id":375262}

{"author":"a_southern_horror_fan","content":"The Basement\" kicks off this basic horror premise with familiar fashion. An abduction and torture porn party favors. There is a quick but impressive set up scene that hints to the horrors in store, it tickles the horror bone and almost champions the idea that this is gonna be a nice, indie gem. Almost. \r\n\r\nConley and Ives don't offer anything that hasn't been scene or written before, but they do show an effort in creating a story with continuity and depth. The production and cinematography is spot on,  edging toward perfect. The characters are standard constructs, common to most movies in this aubgenre, the notable standouts here are both Jackson Davis and Cayleb Long,  who give exceptional performances.\r\n\r\nThe acting at times falters somewhat, a few of Gemini Killer's personalities fall a bit flat- for the most part Davis rocks the crap out of his role. Long has a bit weaker dialog and isn't as developed as Davis' character, but still it is good enough to make their scenes together captivating. The contrasting scenes with Barton are slightly cumbersome, her character is way too two-dimensional, still it is one of her better performances. \r\n\r\nSpecial effects are limited, but what we get is quality, and play on classic torture tropes. The really big gore scene slips to mediocre slightly but it is still a fun, visceral treat. The real horror I'd heavy psychological melodrama and intense drama that holds solid between the two male leads. The score amps up the atmosphere and is a plus. \r\n\r\nOverall \"The Basement\" is a good movie, one of the better indie torture\/revenge horrors I have seen lately. It isn't original by a long shot and the twisted reveal at the end is one you see coming. Still it is worth checking out and the issues aren't enough to kill the entertainment value - even the choppy mansion scenes with Mischa Barton don't hurt \"The Basement\" too much.","id":"5b789343c3a36860ea01a100","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b789343c3a36860ea01a100","movie_id":435097}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"_**Reasonably well made, but barely scratches the thematic surface**_\r\n\r\n> _This is a circus. The consequences will extend long past my nomination. The consequences will be with us for decades. This grotesque and coordinated character assassination will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from serving our country._\r\n\r\n- Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh; addressing the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary in relation to several accusations of sexual assault (September 27, 2018)\r\n\r\n> _We're all going to have to seriously question the system for selecti__ng our national leaders, that reduces the press of this nation to hunters and presidential candidates to being hunted, that has reporters in bushes, false and inaccurate stories printed, photographers peeking in our windows, swarms of helicopters hovering over our roof and my very strong wife close to tears because she can't even get in her own house at night without being harassed. And then, after all that, ponderous pundits wonder in mock seriousness why some of the best people in this country choose not to run for high office._\r\n\r\n- Gary Hart withdrawing from the 1988 Democratic Party presidential primaries after being accused of infidelity (May 8, 1987)\r\n\r\nBased on the non-fiction book _All the Truth Is Out: The Week Politics Went Tabloid_ (2014) by Matt Bai, written for the screen by Bai, Jason Reitman (_Thank You for Smoking_; _Juno_; _Tully_) , and Jay Carson (Hilary Clinton's former press secretary), and directed by Reitman, _The Front Runner_ tells the story of Colorado senator Gary Hart's doomed 1988 presidential campaign. The most likely candidate to win the Democratic nomination, Hart's reputation was shattered when a _Miami Herald_ story accused him of an extramarital affair, and only three weeks into his campaign, he withdrew from the race. The film presents the events of those weeks as a seismic turning-point; when political journalism and tabloid sensationalism irrevocably fused, when private scandal became just as important to the American public as political acumen, perhaps even moreso. Aspiring to the kind of multi-character canvas of Robert Altman or early Paul Thomas Anderson, _The Front Runner_ recalls Altman's 1988 miniseries, _Tanner '88_. However, it spreads itself far too thin, trying to take on the perspective of a plethora of characters, yet telling us very little about any of them, least of all Hart himself. And in the end, it fails to work as either a darkly satirical examination of the Hart scandal, or as a socio-political critique of the current constitutional environment in the US.\r\n\r\nThe film opens in 1984, with Hart (Hugh Jackman) conceding the Democratic primary to Walter Mondale, who stands virtually no chance of defeating incumbent president Ronald Reagan. Three years later, Hart runs again, and this time he is the clear favourite not just to secure the nomination, but to defeat Vice President George H.W. Bush, who was offering the country essentially the same policies that had been seen during Reagan's two terms. Dogged by rumours of infidelity, Hart firmly believes he is entitled to privacy, and that what he does on his own time should have no bearing on his ability to govern. Exasperated at being repeatedly asked about his private life, he challenges the media to follow him, telling them that if they do, they will be very bored. However, after receiving an anonymous tip that Hart is in the midst of an affair, Tom Fiedler (Steve Zissis) of the _Miami Herald_ calls his bluff, following him to his Washington town house and seeing him enter with a woman who doesn't come back out. Over the next three weeks, Hart's campaign implodes, with the film detailing how that implosion is dealt with by a number of people, including his wife, Oletha \"Lee\" Hart (Vera Farmiga), who had asked only that he never embarrass her in public; his campaign manager, Bill Dixon (J.K. Simmons), who tried to warn Hart that the private and the public had become one; _Washington Post_ editor Ben Bradlee (Alfred Molina), who was reluctant to wade into what he saw as tabloid territory; Hart's alleged mistress, Donna Rice (Sara Paxton), who was portrayed in the media as a bimbo homewrecker; fictional _Washington Post_ reporter A.J. Parker (Mamoudou Athie), who covers the story with no small amount of distaste; fictional campaign scheduler Irene Kelly (Molly Ephraim), who promises Rice that she will keep her name out of the media; campaign press secretary Kevin Sweeney (Chris Coy); _Washington Post_ reporter Ann Devroy (Ari Graynor), who believes strength of character is just as important in a presidential candidate as policy; fictional _Miami Herald_ publisher Bob Martindale (Kevin Pollak), who stands by the journalistic integrity of his paper; and Hart's daughter, Andrea (Kaitlyn Dever), who came out as a lesbian just prior to the scandal.\r\n\r\nAlthough the film doesn't absolve Hart of being a terrible husband, it does present him as an inherently decent man trying to protect his privacy, and that of his family, against a predatory and newly mercenary media. Depicting it as more concerned with prurience than rhetoric, the film takes a dim view of the Fourth Estate - its antecedents are films such as Billy Wilder's _Ace in the Hole_ (1951), Sidney Pollack's _Absence of Malice_ (1981), and Costa-Gavras's _Mad City_ (1997) rather than, say, Michael Mann's _The Insider_ (1999) or Tom McCarthy's _Spotlight_ (2015). Following the line of the book, Reitman posits that the _Miami Herald_ and Fiedler (who is, along with Martindale, the _de facto_ villain) did Hart himself, the American people, and political discourse in general a grave disservice insofar as tabloid reporting of this nature has gone on to undercut serious political debate, and has thus subverted the importance of the political process, cheapening it by way of cynicism, sensationalism, and sleaze.\r\n\r\nAlthough ostensibly about the events of 1987, much like Spike Lee's _BlacKkKlansman_ (2018), _The Front Runner_ has one eye on the here and now, musing as to why a man who was merely accused of having an affair (an accusation that was never proved) had his political career destroyed, and yet a man accused of sexual misconduct on multiple occasions, a man who is on tape bragging about how he can sexually assault women with impunity, could be elected to the highest office in the land. The answer suggested by the film is that, since Hart, scandal has become just another aspect of politics, and that which destroyed Hart in 1987 barely made a dent on Bill Clinton in 1998 or Donald Trump in 2016. In this sense, lines such as Devroy's \"_anyone running for president must be held to a higher standard_\" are as much about Trump as they are Hart.\r\n\r\nEssentially, the film argues that the country now has a president like Trump precisely because of what happened to Hart, and in this sense, perhaps its most salient theme is that the Hart scandal represents the point at which politics became a form of entertainment, opening the floodgates to the tabloids, whilst Hart himself became a martyr to this new style of political coverage. The film drives this message home by having Bradlee tell a story about Lyndon B. Johnson, who, upon becoming president in 1963 told the media, \"_you're going to see a lot of women coming and going, and I expect you to show me the same discretion you showed Jack_.\" The media ignored the infidelities of Johnson and Kennedy (and Franklin D. Roosevelt), reporting only on their political activities, and Hart sees no reason why things should be any different for him. In this sense, his blindness is his _hamartia_, ignoring Dixon when he tells him, \"_it's not '72 anymore Gary. It's not even '82_\". The landscape had changed, and Hart's inability to change with it cost him everything.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite the fact that all of that should make for fascinating drama, _The Front Runner_ doesn't really work. The most egregious problem is the depiction of Hart himself. For starters, it's questionable, at best, to portray him as the victim of an increasingly combative media, glossing over the fact that he himself was the architect of his ruination, sabotaging his own political career and humiliating his wife all because of his libido. In this post-#MeToo era, suggesting that a powerful man was wronged when he was exposed cheating is more than a little na\u00efve. Indeed, the film seems to yearn for simpler times, when potentially great men could walk the path to positions of power, unimpeded by intelligent women speaking out against them, or diligent reporters uncovering their less wholesome activities, when infidelity remained hidden from the public. _The Front Runner_ is not a story about a man who learns that private ethical lapses have become intertwined with public policymaking. Instead, it's about a man who was unfairly destroyed by a pernicious press for doing exactly the same thing that his predecessors had gotten away with for decades. And that's a much less interesting film.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, due to a poor script which offers Jackman little in the way of an arc, Hart barely registers as a real person, with little sense of interiority or psychological verisimilitude. Instead, he comes across as a blank slate, a cypher onto which the audience can project its own interpretation. Related to this, Reitman tells us that Hart was an outstanding candidate, offering things that others did not, and had it not been for the insidious media, he would have gone on to become a sensational president. However, the film never gets into the specifics of how exactly he was so different, what he offered that was so unique, or why he would have been such a good POTUS. Reitman asks the audience to take Hart's potential for transformative greatness on trust, never attempting to illustrate any aspect of that potential, a failing which significantly undermines his condemnation of the media.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, the film tries to touch on virtually every aspect of the scandal \u2013 reporter-editor meetings discussing the moral responsibility of the press; campaign staff trying to fight back against tabloidization; gumshoe reporters hiding in bushes and stalking back alleys; the strain on Hart's marriage; the effects on Donna Rice. Ultimately, it casts its net far too wide, briefly covering topics that are crying out for a more thorough engagement. For example, at one point, Rice says to Kelly, \"_he's a man with power and opportunity, and that takes responsibility_.\" That's a massive statement with a lot of thematic leg-work already built in, and serious potential for probing drama, but the film fails to do anything with it, moving on to cover something else. Indeed, Sara Paxton, despite given only two scenes of note, gives a superb performance, finding in Rice a decency and intelligence, playing her as someone who wants to keep her name out of the press because she doesn't want to embarrass her family. She's an infinitely more interesting figure than Hart himself, and the film would have benefitted immeasurably from more of her.\r\n\r\nIn its November 2018 issue, _The Atlantic_ carried an article by James Fallows looking at the alleged death-bed confession by Republic strategist, former adviser to both Reagan and Bush, and current head of the Republican National Committee Lee Atwater that he had orchestrated an elaborate set up of Hart so as to ensure he didn't run against Bush in the election. Obviously, this story only came to light after the film had already been shot, but it isn't even mentioned in the bland one-line closing legend, which tells us only that Hart and his wife are still married today.\r\n\r\n_The Front Runner_ is aesthetically fairly solid; well-directed, well-shot, well-edited. However, given how thematically relevant the Hart story is to the contemporary political climate in the US, especially the increasingly antagonistic relationship between the White House and the media, the script feels bland and overly simplistic. The core of the story is the question of whether or not the press was right to report on Hart's infidelity. Did the public need to know? Did it have any bearing on his ability to lead? The film answers all three questions with a resounding \"no\". However, the cumulative effect is of a scandal skimmed rather than explored, of characters glanced at rather than developed, of controversies summated rather than depicted. There are some positives \u2013 Farmiga and Paxton are both excellent, for example \u2013 but all in all, this is a missed opportunity, lacking both socio-political insight and satirical flair.","id":"5d21116094d8a849844183df","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d21116094d8a849844183df","movie_id":476764}

Rev it up, and you're gone._\r\n\r\n- David Grann quoting Forrest Tucker; \"The Old Man and the Gun\"; _The New Yorker_ (January 27, 2003)\r\n\r\nOf all the young American writer\/directors to break through in the last few years, for me, Jeff Nichols and David Lowery stand tall; in particular, Nichols's _Take Shelter_ (2011), and Lowery's _Ain't Them Bodies Saints_ (2013) and the existential masterpiece that was _A Ghost Story_ (2017). Both filmmakers are five-for-five thus far, with even Lowery's 2016 mainstream Disney remake _Pete's Dragon_ managing to impress in all sorts of ways I wasn't expecting. Apart from being enjoyable in its own right, it also showed us that Lowery is as comfortable making personal small-scale character dramas as he is big-budget special effects blockbusters. With _The Old Man & the Gun_, he stands somewhere between \u2013 it's not as intimate as _St. Nick_ (2009), _Ain't Them Bodies Saints_, or _A Ghost Story_, but neither is it as mainstream as _Pete's Dragon_. Originally touted as Robert Redford's final performance, although he has walked that claim back somewhat, _The Old Man & the Gun_ is a laid-back ballad-like elegy to both the character Redford is playing _and_ to Redford himself. Filmed in the style of a 1970's indie, _Old Man_ is so tied to Redford as a performer as to be virtually self-referential. In short, if you're not a fan of the actor, you will get absolutely nothing from this film.\r\n\r\nTelling the \"mostly true\" story of Forrest Tucker (the career criminal, not the prolific actor), Lowery's script is based primarily on David Grann's 2003 _New Yorker_ article of the same name, which was later collected in his book, _The Devil & Sherlock Holmes: Tales of Murder, Madness & Obsession_ (2010). By the time of the article, the 83-year-old Tucker, who had been robbing banks since his early 20s, had amassed at least 80 successful jobs and escaped from prison 18 times. Usually described by the tellers from whom he stole as \"gentlemanly\" and \"charming\", his M.O. never changed \u2013 he would walk into a bank and ask if he could open an account. When asked what kind, he would pull back his coat, showing his gun (which was often unloaded, and which he never fired), assure the teller that he didn't want any trouble, and quietly talk them through the process of emptying their till. He would then wish them the best, tell them they'd done well, and walk out. The story takes place in 1981, when Tucker was 61 (although in the film, he's 76), and had recently escaped from San Quentin. Although he usually works alone, he does have two colleagues, Teddy (Danny Glover) and Waller (Tom Waits), in what the press later dubs the \"Over-the-Hill Gang\". Fleeing from police pursuit after pulling off his first job since escaping, Tucker pulls over to help Jewel (Sissy Spacek), a widow whose car has broken down on the highway. He doesn't do it out of gallantry, but as a way to hide in plain sight; what kind of person being chased by police would stop to help someone fix their car? Heading to a nearby diner for a bite, Tucker and Jewel strike up a tentative romance. Initially, he tells her he is in sales, but shortly thereafter tells her what he really does, something she's not sure whether to believe. Meanwhile, when he pulls off a job in a bank where Det. John Hunt (Casey Affleck, playing, for a change, Casey Affleck) is queuing, completely unaware of what is happening right behind him, Tucker finds himself closely pursued by Hunt who, having just turned 40, is going through a mid-life crisis, which his wife Maureen (Tika Sumpter) can do little to dispel. The longer Hunt chases Tucker, however, the more he comes to respect him.\r\n\r\nRedford himself brought Grann's article and Tucker's story to Lowery's attention, who subsequently wrote the script specifically for Redford (who also produces). In 1986, whilst imprisoned in San Quentin, Tucker underwent a quadruple bypass, and subsequently began documenting his exploits. Initially writing _Alcatraz: The True Story_, a two-hundred-and-sixty-one page manuscript about how he had escaped from Alcatraz in the 50s (actually, although he was an inmate of Alcatraz, he escaped from an LA hospital whilst having a kidney operation), he then wrote an autobiography called _The Can Opener_, in which he described himself as a \"_highly intelligent, nonviolent type of criminal in the Willie Sutton mould_.\" He was released in 1993 and settled with his wife in Pompano Beach, Florida, where he earned a living giving saxophone and clarinet lessons, and occasionally playing the local jazz clubs. Turning _The Can Opener_ into a script, he tried to recruit Clint Eastwood to direct and star, but was told by Eastwood's secretary, \"_unless you have an agent, he won't read it_.\" Tucker was re-arrested in 1999 after carrying out at least four robberies, and in 2000, he was sentenced to thirteen years. He died of natural causes in 2004 whilst imprisoned at Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Worth. In terms of the film, most of the details of Tucker's life are reasonably accurate, although Jewel is a fictional character. She is, however, loosely based on Tucker's third wife, Jewell Centers, whom he married in 1982. Hunt is also a real person, although, he was a sergeant in Austin, not a detective in Dallas, and he was unmarried and childless (in the film, Hunt and Maureen have two children).\r\n\r\nThe first thing you'll notice about _Old Man_ is its pace, which is measured, to say the least. Ostensibly, this is a heist film, but the crime narrative is very much secondary to tone and character beats. Lowery is relatively uninterested in excitement, suspense, plot twists, or any of the usual generic tropes. Instead, approaching the material casually, he focuses on a year of Tucker's life. You learn pretty quickly, however, what kind of film this will be. Opening with Tucker in mid-robbery, instead of concentrating on his escape, as you would expect, Lowery instead cuts from the robbery to Tucker meeting Jewel, and from that, to a lengthy dialogue scene in a diner as Tucker and Jewel get to know one another. Just as you expect important plot details and character-illustrative moments to be front and centre in a bombastic opening salvo, Lowery gives us two people sitting in a diner talking to one another. And this establishes the tone for the rest of the film, which is as mellow as a film can be; rather than a shot of absinthe, it's a fine Irish malt drunk at a fireplace.\r\n\r\nIndeed, even within this structure, there's not a huge amount of character development, nor is there much of a dramatic arc. And that's not a criticism. Rather, the meditative, quasi-somnolent pace is very much one of the film's charms. To give you an example, about three-quarters of the way through, there's a scene where Jewel fills a kettle as she stares out the window. We are literally watching her thinking. Then she puts the kettle on the stove and thinks some more. The scene lasts a couple of minutes, and is reminiscent of Rooney Mara's four-minute pie-eating scene in _A Ghost Story_, which a lot of people disliked, but which I thought was very much the essence of the film rendered in pure visual form. Here, the kettle scene doesn't forward the narrative one iota. It's precisely the kind of scene that a young filmmaker would be told to avoid in film school. However, it's a key scene for the character, and although the film is only 93 minutes long, Lowery is in absolutely no rush to get through such scenes. Indeed, the heist scenes are very much the background noise against which the more interesting character beats happen. Additionally, Lowery almost completely ignores what, for many, would be the most interesting part of Tucker's story \u2013 his 18 escapes. Instead, Lowery puts them all together into one superb montage.\r\n\r\nHowever, for all that, Lowery's primary goal is not to tell the story of Tucker, or even to introduce the character to the audience. It's to create an ode to an icon, and that icon is Robert Redford. Tucker's story is basically a vehicle which Lowery uses to celebrate Redford; the character is always there, but he exists behind the actor, rather than the other way around. What I mean by this is perhaps best explained by citing its inverse \u2013 an actor disappearing into a character; think Daniel Day-Lewis in Paul Thomas Anderson's _Phantom Thread_ (2017). In _Old Man_, the audience is never allowed to forget that this is Robert Redford on screen, to the point where the performance is self-referential. Indeed, during the escape montage, there's even a clip of Redford from another film, Arthur Penn's _The Chase_ (1966). There's an obvious correlation between Tucker and Redford of which Lowery wants the audience to be very aware \u2013 they are both elderly, and still doing what they do best, reluctant to stop, with a massive CV to prove it. We can never look past the fact that Tucker is played by Redford, and for the most part, Redford is playing Redford, with the film existing in large part only because it explicitly leans on his back catalogue and real-life legacy. Essentially, the whole thing is an extended metatextual allegory for Redford's own impending retirement, not to mention his reluctance to let go.\r\n\r\nAs one would expect from Lowery, aesthetically, the film is fascinating. Lowery is very unusual in the sense that, thus far, he has never used the same cinematographer twice \u2013 _St. Nick_ was shot by Clay Liford; _Ain't Them Bodies Saints_ by Bradford Young; _Pete's Dragon_ by Bojan Bazelli; _A Ghost Story_ by Andrew Droz Palermo; and _Old Man_ by Joe Anderson. Stylistically, the film is most similar to _A Ghost Story_, which was shot 1.33:1. _The Old Man & the Gun_ is 2.39:1, but the cinematography is extremely unique, with the celluloid having a gritty, grainy quality, almost as if it were an amateur project. This is because Lowery shot on Super 16, doing so because he wanted it to look like it had been made in the period in which it was set. This is in direct contrast to, say, how Michael Mann shot _Public Enemies_ (2009), which was 2.35:1, shot on Kodak Vision3 500T 5219 film with modern Arriflex 235s, Arriflex 435s, Sony CineAlta F23s, Sony CineAlta HDC-F950s, and Sony PMW-EX1s, with the use of fast, seemingly anachronistic, digital photography creating a sense that what was happening on screen wasn't necessarily taking place in the past, but could easily have been taking place right now. Lowery, in contrast, tries to suture the viewer into the past _milieu_.\r\n\r\nIn relation to this, Anderson tells _Filmmaker Magazine_,\r\n\r\n> _when making a period piece, I think to really do it well and transport the audience back in time you have to acknowledge the way movies were made in the period that the story is set in._\r\n\r\nHe also tells _Deadline_,\r\n\r\n> _we didn't take an overly technical approach to the cinematography. Sometimes there's little bumps in camera moves, and a pan isn't necessarily perfectly controlled, and it has a lot of personality._\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the news broadcasts were shot using period-accurate video equipment. Initially, the producers wanted to shoot on cheaper digital and then degrade the images, but Anderson insisted on using '80s-era video cameras.\r\n\r\nAnother important aesthetic point is how much Lowery has obviously been influenced by the aforementioned Mann, to whom there are several homages \u2013 the diner scene recalls a similarly shot scene between James Caan and Tuesday Weld in _Thief_ (1981); the scene in the toilet where Hunt approaches Tucker is an obvious nod to Al Pacino confronting Robert De Niro in _Heat_ (1995); and the scene of Tucker gaining inspiration whilst sitting in a cinema recalls a scene where Dillinger (Johnny Depp) does the same thing in _Public Enemies_. In relation to this scene, the movie Tucker is watching is Monte Hellman's _Two-Lane Blacktop_ (1971), a film depicting the openness and freedom of the American highway. Of this choice, Lowery tells _SlashFilm_,\r\n\r\n> _I didn't intend for that movie to be in the movie. We paid homage to_ Blacktop _already when we shot the chase scene with the '55 Chevy, but when I was trying to figure out what movie they'd be watching at the movie theatre, so I just decided one day to try that clip from_ Two-Lane Blacktop _and the resonance it had was just perfect._\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, there are a few. Indeed, we've covered one of them already \u2013 for many, the film will depend far too much on Redford, specifically the self-referential allusions to his career and legacy. If you're not a fan of his, you will get zero from this, absolutely nothing. Similarly, if you aren't familiar with at least some of his previous work, and his status in Hollywood, the whole thing will probably seem inconsequential. Another problem I have concerns Affleck. I know he's a celebrated actor and so forth, but for me, he plays himself in every single movie. There is virtually nothing to distinguish Hunt from Robert Ford in Andrew Dominik's _The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford_ (2007) or Les Chandler from Kenneth Lonergan's _Manchester by the Sea_ (2016) or either of his performances in previous Lowery films. Every performance he gives, he plays a character with the weight of the world on his shoulders, shuffling around, speaking in a low-key hang-dog voice, reluctant to make eye contact, shifting on his feet. The exact same thing in every film, with the exception of Scott Cooper's underrated _Out of the Furnace_ (2013), where he showed some fire.\r\n\r\nLowery also has a strange habit of introducing themes which seem to be setting something up, only to completely abandon them without any kind of engagement. This is most obvious in relation to Hunt's inter-racial marriage and their two mixed-race children. This is a fictional element added by Lowery, so one assumes there was some thought behind it. But this is Texas in 1981; there wouldn't have been a huge amount of mixed marriages. Yet Lowery seems to portray it as if it's the most normal thing in the world. Indeed, for the wife and children, life is fairly idyllic, with not a hint of any kind of societal disapproval. My point is why would you introduce a mixed-race marriage into this _milieu_ without commenting on it. Lowery obviously has little interest in exploring the social reality of race relations in Texas in the early 1980s, which is fair enough, but if that's the case, why bother raising the issue at all? I'm also mystified as to what we're supposed to make of the scene where one of Hunt's daughters writes a get-well card to Ronald Reagan after he was shot by John Hinckley Jr..\r\n\r\nThese issues aside, however, _The Old Man & the Gun_ is a fine film. As much about Robert Redford as it is Forrest Tucker, although that won't appeal to everyone, there is much to praise. Made in a key so low, it's practically subterranean, Lowery hinges everything on Redford's presence, and, for the most part, it works well. There's little in here to get overly excited about, but neither is there much to criticise. Yes, the film is somewhat insubstantial, and there's virtually nothing here beyond the Redford\/Tucker character, but it's still beautifully made, and, honestly, there's nothing wrong with spending 93 minutes hanging out with Redford, whether he's playing Forrest Tucker or Robert Redford. Whether or not this is actually his last performance remains to be seen, but if it is, it's as fine a send-off as any Hollywood icon could hope for.","id":"5d1e92d994d8a83116409459","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d1e92d994d8a83116409459","movie_id":429203}

However, whilst the idea is sound, the execution is poor, and due to some very basic missteps, the narrative's potential profundity is rendered singularly uninteresting.\r\n\r\nWritten and directed by Xavier Giannoli (_Marguerite_), with Marcia Romano (_Sous le Sable_; _Marguerite_) and Jacques Fieschi (_Un C\u0153ur en hiver_; _Yves Saint Laurent_; _Mal de pierres_) credited with \"collaboration\", the hook does a fine job of drawing the audience in. Jacques Mayano (Vincent Lindon) is a French photographer just returned from an unspecified war zone where his colleague was killed in a bomb blast. As a result of the explosion, Mayano is having aural problems and suffering from PTSD. Upon returning to France, he quickly becomes directionless, until he is contacted by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints \u2013 the body within the Vatican which investigates claims of miracles, with an eye towards possible canonisation. Mayano is told that a young girl named Anna (Galat\u00e9a Bellugi) claims to have seen a Marian apparition in a field just outside a small village. However, frustrated with the Vatican asking questions, as well as their scepticism regarding the validity of Anna's claim, the local parish priest, Fr. Borrodine (Patrick d'Assum\u00e7ao), has cut off contact with the Church hierarchy, and is using a not-unwilling Anna to entice pilgrimages to the area, subsequently encouraging the devout to purchase items in a spectacularly tacky gift store. In an attempt to ascertain the merit, or lack thereof, of Anna's vision, the Congregation want Mayano to head an investigative team.\r\n\r\nSo far so good. It's a fine _raison d'\u00eatre_, and the first act is excellent, depicting Mayano learning the Congregation's inner workings, spending time in the Vatican Apostolic Library reviewing documents detailing both valid and invalid (as decreed by the Congregation) instances of miracles, travelling to the village, and meeting his team (a combination of secular and laity). However, once the investigation proper begins, the bottom falls out, as Giannoli seems to have no idea where to take the story.\r\n\r\nFor a start, the film is far, far too long; clocking in at 144 minutes, it could easily have lost a half-hour without compromising the central narrative drive at all. In fact, the whole thing felt like a workprint; far too much fat on its bones, so much wasted motion, and no editing rhythm within individual scenes, many of which continue for several beats after they have come to what should be their natural conclusion. In tandem with this, there are so many half-developed subplots which never integrate with the main narrative - Mayano's PTSD and hearing problems, orphans, a children's home, adoption, mysterious letters, a missing girl, possible profiteering from Anna's visions. Additionally, with so much going on at a plot level, both Mayano and Anna are extremely under-written, with virtually no character development between them; Mayano is essentially an archetypal \"atheist photographer,\" and Anna is very much a cipher.\r\n\r\nHowever, the biggest problem is that the film simply can't make up its mind as to what it wants to be - an examination of canonical doctrine or a standard mystery. And because of this pseudo-schizophrenic quality, the plot is shaky at best, with the superficial far outweighing the substance. Related to this, the film concludes with a wholly unnecessary and poorly conceived twist that plays out as relatively unrelated to what we've just spent the last two hours watching, focusing as it does on a character we haven't met up to the penultimate scene.\r\n\r\nAnother problem, given the inherently evocative nature of the subject matter, is that Giannoli misses a perfect opportunity for critique. You'd expect that a contemporary film dealing with what is increasingly looked upon as arcane dogma would engage in some way with the issues that that dogma throws up; the nature of apparitions in both a contemporary and a historical sense; the Church's attitude to instances where they were unable to debunk the claimant; their attitude to cases where they were able to prove a hoax; the process of investigating an apparition, and the Congregation's prerequisites for approving canonisation; their tendency to mix the ordained with the professional on the investigative teams, such as historians, psychologists, and scientists. None of these issues are explored in any way, as the film sets up an intriguing providential-based framework, but then fails to introduce the scrutiny with which to analyse the surrounding themes. Essentially, the film says nothing of interest about anything.\r\n\r\nFor his part, however, Giannoli certainly seems to think it does. In the film's EPK, he says of Mayano,\r\n\r\n> _he has come across a world in which proof counts for nothing and the invisible world keeps its secrets._\r\n\r\nAnd this is essentially where the problem lies; the twist simply doesn't integrate with the rest of the film, and ends up working against the presentation of faith, diluting Giannoli's thematic concerns to the point where it's difficult to tell what he is trying to say. If the film is truly about the invisible world keeping its secrets, why does he feel the need to introduce a twist which thoroughly explains all of those secrets? Similarly, of the Congregation's work, Giannoli states,\r\n\r\n> _one should not imagine that the Church hopes for and encourages the authentication of apparitions. On the contrary, I think they are a hindrance to them. Faith doesn't need proof or it's no longer faith._\r\n\r\nHowever, the film is literally about an attempt to find that proof, and once again, the twist compromises the apparent intention. Giannoli also refers to the film as\r\n\r\n> _a thorough documentary investigation into the supposed proof of the existence of God._\r\n\r\nThere's no evidence of this at all in the finished product, where perhaps some kind of engagement with the issues thrown up by, for example, agnosticism or noetics might have been interesting.\r\n\r\nAnd for evidence that films dealing with this kind of deeply esoteric\/metaphysical subject matter can work, one need only compare _L'Apparition_ with films such as Jessica Hausner's _Lourdes_ (2009) or Dietrich Br\u00fcggemann's _Kreuzweg_ (2014). In _Lourdes_, a woman (Sylvie Testud) confined to a wheelchair makes a pilgrimage to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes, hoping to regain the use of her legs, and in the process engages with issues such as the Church as a profit-centred business, the nature of divine healing, and the role of vehement scepticism contrasted with that of blind faith. _Kreuzweg_ tells the story of Maria (Lea van Acken), a fourteen-year-old girl from a fanatical Catholic family, whose only desire in life is to become a saint. With this in mind, she sets about replicating Jesus's path in Golgotha through the fourteen Stations. The film engages with a myriad of conundrums and challenges; an indictment of religious fundamentalism, the nature and power of obsessive faith, the likelihood or unlikelihood of genuine miracles, the place of divinity in the modern world, the Church's attitude to suffering, and the validity of secular interference in ecclesiastical matters. _L'Apparition_ gets nowhere near this level of analysis. Instead, it's two hours plus of serious people acting seriously, but not actually saying anything of note about anything, capped off with as ill-advised a twist as you're likely to see all year.","id":"5cd8a4790e0a263868ccca95","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cd8a4790e0a263868ccca95","movie_id":482712}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Well, when the credits started to roll I cannot say that I felt it had been a waste of time and money. I did indeed have some enjoyment watching this movie. However, it could have been a lot better.\r\n\r\nFor starters, what is the point of making a movie about a bloody \u201cdinosaur shark\u201d and aim for a PG-13 rating? Whoever made that incredibly stupid decision obviously missed the mark big time. I think this was the biggest fault with the movie. There were so many missed opportunities. The entire scene at the beach at the end of the movie was just wasted for example.\r\n\r\nThe script was of course somewhat illogical with holes in it large enough to drive a, well, a Megalodon through them. This however was something that I more or less expected given the kind of movie. First of all it is science fiction and fantasy after all and second, it appears that these kind of movies never seem to get anything better than mediocre script writers\u2026at best.\r\n\r\nThere were some good things though. I have read the book and I didn\u2019t really like it. In my review I gave it 2 out 5 five stars. The main reason for this was that the book was more of a bad soap opera than a horror\/thriller. It was so filled with unlikable, scheming and backstabbing assholes that it was really not enjoyable. Jason\u2019s ex wife was such a despicable bitch that she alone ruined the book for example.\r\n\r\nLuckily the movie had toned down that aspect of the book quite a lot. Actually, in the end, there was really only one truly despicable asshole in the movie and he met with the fate that he deserved thanks to his own stupidity.\r\n\r\nSo, I did enjoy the movie and, as a science fiction and fantasy fan, I am glad to have watched it. I mean, a giant pre-historic shark on the big screen does have a certain cool-factor after all. It was somewhat saved by Jason Statham being in it though and it could have been a lot better.","id":"5c2111490e0a264de6edc6b8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c2111490e0a264de6edc6b8","movie_id":345940}
{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Bleakly compelling, although the last act is weak_**\r\n\r\n> _And you, Tacitus,_\r\n\r\n>_observe how I make my grove_\r\n\r\n>_on an old crannog_\r\n\r\n>_piled by the fearful dead_\r\n\r\n- Seamus Heaney; \"Kinship\"; _North_ (1975)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately released the same day as a little film called _Avengers: Endgame_, _The Dig_ will most likely pass from Irish cinemas without much of an impact. And that's a real shame, as it's a fine film. Written by Stuart Drennan, and directed by the Tohill brothers, Andy and Ryan, in their feature debut, the film is essentially a study of psychological breakdown, and the emotional damage that can be done by a self-appointed Sisyphean task which, by definition, can never be completed. Looking at the tendency in rural Ireland to anthropomorphise the Land, celebrating how it sustains and condemning how it betrays, the film probes the thin line between obsession and insanity, whilst also examining issues of memory, guilt, and the question of whether the guilty should be afforded an opportunity for atonement. It's bleak and oppressive (both in form and content), and doesn't feature a huge amount of (or any) laughs. Working extremely well for about three-quarters of its runtime, the script unfortunately comes undone in the last act, suddenly turning into a murder-mystery, complete with a ridiculous twist that belies the realistic minimalism employed thus far. Still though, it's beautifully shot, brilliantly acted, and very well directed, and, assuming you're finished jumping through time with Ant-Man, you could certainly do worse than checking it out.\r\n\r\nThe film begins as Ronan Callahan (the always intense Moe Dunford) returns to his hometown, having spent 15 years in jail for the murder of his girlfriend. Callahan was blind drunk the night of the murder, and remembers nothing of the incident, but as he was the last person with whom she was seen, and as her skin was found under his fingernails, he was convicted. Now tee-total, he's planning to sell his dilapidated farm and move on, but is stunned to learn that Sean McKenna (a superb Lorcan Cranitch), the dead girl's father, has spent literally every day of the last 15 years digging on the bog where her body is believed buried. Obsessed to the point of near madness, Sean refuses to stop - not for his still-living daughter, Roberta (a quietly despairing Emily Taaffe), who's seriously worried about his mental health; not for the local constable, Murphy (an intimidating Francis Magee), who has his own plans for Callahan; and certainly not for Callahan himself. However, still suffering from crippling guilt for a murder he can't remember, Callahan takes the unexpected decision to help Sean with the dig, much to both Roberta and Murphy's chagrin.\r\n\r\nMuch like recent Irish films such as Brian O'Malley's _The Lodgers_ (2017), Aislinn Clarke's _The Devil's Doorway_ (2018), and Lance Daly's _Black '47_ (2018), _The Dig_ works very much within genre parameters, but wherein the tropes of said genre are given a uniquely Irish thematic inflection. Whereas _The Lodgers_ uses a haunted house story to examine issues of aristocratic legacy and the landed gentry, _The Devil's Doorway_ uses demonic possession to explore the horrific history of the Magdalene Laundries, and _Black '47_ uses a revenge western as a way into the Great Famine, _The Dig_ is essentially a Revisionist Western - it takes place primarily on a vast open bog; in the only bar in the one-horse town, whiskey is poured into shot glasses and drunk straight; local law enforcement is in the form of one formidable man, who does things his way, and even carries a gun in his belt; a local murderer returns, with the locals wanting to drive him out of town (and actually forming a posse to do so at one point); women are generally ignored, despite being far more grounded than any of the men. As in the aforementioned films, however, genre is used in _The Dig_ not as an end in and of itself, but as a launching pad to other thematic concerns; an exploration of the importance of the Land, how time doesn't necessarily heal all wounds, and how extreme grief can drive a person to the brink of insanity.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with a sequence showing Callahan returning to the village, walking to his farm, which is now boarded up and derelict, examining the house and checking to see if the water is still working, before finding multiple bottles of alcohol secreted in various places, all of which he pours out. The scene is entirely wordless, and reminded me a little of the opening scene in Paul Thomas Anderson's _There Will Be Blood_ (2007). It's pure visual storytelling, and a great example of one of the most fundamental aspects of the filmic medium - show, don't tell - perfectly setting the bleak tone for what's to come, and giving us plenty of information about Callahan without the need for clunky exposition.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, the Tohills and cinematographer Angus Mitchell shoot the film as if clouded in a perpetually arid gloom. One of those films where you can feel the cold and damp through the screen, the palette avoids too many strong primary colours such as red or yellow, and is instead dominated by muted earth tones. The bleak wintery _Waiting for Godot_-style landscape through which Callahan walks in the opening scene is a bit on the nose as metaphors go, but it is effective in establishing the coldness and darkness in both his and Sean's hearts. For the scenes on the bog, from time to time, Mitchell uses high-elevation shots, showing us the sheer size of the bog in relation to the miniscule amount of land already dug up, really driving home the absolute impossibility of the task Sean has set himself. These shots also help to convey that although the characters are out in the open, the environment is their prison, much like the woods in Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S\u00e1nchez's _The Blair Witch Project_ (1999) and the prairie in Emma Tammi's _The Wind_ (2018).\r\n\r\nIn terms of the acting, Cranitch plays Sean as contorted beyond recognition by grief, with not a hint of the man he must once have been. Every ounce of his strength goes on the dig, which has become his only reason for living, and all that matters to him now is finding his daughter so he can give her a proper burial - in a nice unspoken irony running throughout the film, Sean needs to exhume her body so he can bury her. Dunford, for his part, is predictably intense, all silent brooding and beaten down anhedonic resignation.\r\n\r\nThematically, the film is at its best when examining grief, bereavement, obsession, and atonement. However, the importance of the Land remains thematically paramount at all times. Helping to establish the sense of a history and lineage, a fairy tree is featured throughout the film, whilst there is also a reference to the Seanfhear Chruach\u00e1in, a remarkably well-preserved body dating from the Iron Age which was found in 2003, naturally mummified in a peat bog in Offaly. Another important historical reference is more subtle. Politics are noticeable by their absence, and although the film is set just across the border in Northern Ireland, there's not a single reference to the Troubles. However, anyone familiar with The Disappeared, sixteen people abducted, murdered, and secretly buried by the IRA between 1972 and 1985, will immediately see parallels with the plot. Specifically, the vast task before Sean recalls the plight of the family members of those who were disappeared, who for decades had no information whatsoever on where their loved ones had been buried (and in some cases, the bodies are yet to be located). All of this feeds into the general importance of the Land in rural Ireland, with the characters attributing to it a sentience recalling some of the Bull McCabe's proclamations in Jim Sheridan's filmic adaptation of _The Field_ (1990). The Land as depicted in _The Dig_, however, is far from benevolent, with the sense being that if Sean's daughter is never to be found, it's because the Land has consciously made the decision not to reveal her. As Sean himself states, \"_the land decides_\".\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a sizable problem with the film. For much of its runtime, the narrative is taut, the characters believable, the _milieu_ oppressive. However, in the last act, the movie rather inexplicably turns into a murder-mystery, with a plot twist that undermines the gravity of what has gone before. I've no idea what Drennan or the Tohills were trying to say with this, and although the actors act the hell out of it (particularly Dunford and Magee), they simply can't overcome the silly \"dun-dun-duuuun\" nature of the twist. The entire last act is also predicated on classically misogynistic male ideas about the desires of women. After so much hard-hitting realism and almost tangible existential suffering, the _d\u00e9nouement_ is rote and contrived, more akin to an episode of _Midsomer Murders_ or _Shetland_, and seriously undermining the emotional build-up which has heretofore been very well handled.\r\n\r\nThat said, this is still a very impressive first feature, and another fine Irish film, coming in the wake of such strong recent work as Aoife McArdle's _Kissing Candice_ (2017), Daly's aforementioned _Black '47_, and Paddy Breathnach's _Rosie_ (2018). Equal parts bleak and oppressive, it remains mostly compelling, with a quartet of excellent performances, and a strong emotional connection with the audience.","id":"5d6712d306f9840012a78c75","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d6712d306f9840012a78c75","movie_id":519316}
{"author":"Purplehearts","content":"Horror is baaaaack! \r\nAnd with a vengeance.\r\n\r\nThe Nun is not for people that don\u2019t like horror movies or burnt out on them. Don't expect character development either. Don't expect to be shock like you were when you watched The Exorcist. I\u2019ve read several critic reviews were they just don\u2019t get it. They use words to describe it like \u201cusing every trick in the horror trope\u201d or \u201cpredictable\u201d, \u201cthrowing the kitchen sink at\u201d, or \u201cnot enough character development\u201d. Well forget what you heard because there is more bite to this movie than you\u2019d expect. \r\n\r\nOkay, so we begin with a spooky opening sequence where two nuns are fighting to save humanity from a malevolent presence that is about to enter our world. One is dragged into a room and the other commits suicide by hanging. Suicide is a sin, right? Makes you wonder what type of evil is powerful enough to destroy Catholic nuns?\r\n\r\nBeing the beginning of The Conjuring movie universe, this story begins like this, Father Burke (Demi\u00e9n Bichir) is summoned by the Vatican to investigate the suicide of a nun at The Abbey, a castle located somewhere in Romania. Apparently Father Burke has a trauma and a shameful past after having failed to save a teen from an exorcism he performed. Makes you wonder why The Vatican would send a priest like Father Burke on such a dangerous mission. The Vatican doesn\u2019t send Father Burke alone on this task though. They assign Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), who hasn\u2019t yet taken her vows. A nun that hasn't taken her vows yet, and not your typical nun either. She's contrary to the average nun. She seems so innocent.\r\n\r\nFather Burke and Sister Irene are taken to The Abbey by a local delivery man, Frechie (Jonas Bloquet). (You may remember Frenchie as the first exorcism performed by The Warrens from the original The Conjuring. Lorraine Warren has the painting of The Nun at their home and references it in the film.) Sister Irene was chosen to go on this assignment because she experiences visions, these visions provide the information needed to uncover what actually occurred at The Abbey.\r\n\r\nThe Abbey has been the site of a malevolent force locked away for centuries. The Church took over The Abbey and placed a congregation of nuns to pray 12 hours a day to keep the evil force in control. However, after WW2 bombing weaken the structure of The Abbey, the evil locked inside of it found another way to escape, and using the guise of a nun, slowly grows in strength causing terror on those around it. \r\n\r\nYes, The Nun is a supernatural survival horror installment of The Conjuring universe. You don\u2019t have to be a die hard fan of the horror genre in order to be scared. Yes, there is a lot of the same tropes from the most popular supernatural horror movies and that is because this is how demonic infestation happens. \r\nDirector Corin Hardy and screenplay writer Gary Dauberman do wonderfully.\r\n\r\nWhat this film gives us is tricky camera and visual effects that showcase how the demon works. We find out that the demon\u2019s name is Valak\u2013an ancient demon from Hell that was summoned by the count performed sacrificial rituals. \r\nIf you are expecting character development then you\u2019re not going to find it here. This story doesn\u2019t need a lot of characters at all. You don\u2019t need a lot of information about these characters because Valak is the only character this story is about.. One minute he\u2019s behind the character\u2019s back, the next his shadow appears on the wall, he reanimates dead corpses and even manifesting animals and the usual superhuman strength as well as taking on human form. He ghosts the characters as well. It\u2019s always interesting to see how the director and screenwriter pull off these visual effects. \r\n\r\nFather Burke character plays like a detective searching the castle for any information he can use to exorcise the demonic spirit from the world while Sister Irene uses her visions to lead her to the truth about what occurred at The Abbey as well as discover anything that she can use to send the evil spirit back to Hell. If you like Ash from the Evil Dead horror series, then you\u2019ll like Frenchie because he is the outsider in all of this providing necessary dark humor. Frenchie isn\u2019t afraid to use a shotgun to blow off the heads of a couple of deadites disguised as nuns.\r\n\r\nWhat also makes this film enjoyable to watch with a group, is the pacing. There are enough slow moments for you to make jokes about the characters or the visual bombarding your senses.\r\n\r\nI give this film an enthusiastic 7\/10 for its creepy mood and intense disturbing images. And those squeamish people, no worries. There isn't a lot of gore. \r\n\r\nDefinitely a great popcorn horror flick to watch in the dark with your friends. Definitely worth the movie ticket. You won't be disappointed as long as you keep what I've said in this review in mind.\r\nIf I were to rate its place among the other films in The Conjuring universe, I would rate as follows\r\n\r\n1) The Conjuring\r\n2) The Conjuring 2\r\n3) The Nun\r\n\r\n* 4) Annabelle Creation","id":"5bdcd3f20e0a26058d000145","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bdcd3f20e0a26058d000145","movie_id":439079}

{"author":"trineo03","content":"First of all, the set design in this film is spectacular. Every set makes you feel like you really are there with these characters. I also really liked the costume designs on them. It was an excellent choice for everybody and to show how the royalty has better-looking clothes compared to everybody else in the film. The acting in this film was marvellous. Nobody seemed like a character but a real human being. You can easily relate to either Stacy or Margaret in a way. For example, you either connect to Stacy because you are the type of person who plans out everything or Margaret who is spontaneous. I had no issues with the pacing at all in this film. Everything seemed to flow from one thing smoothly to the next. I think one of the only things that bugged me about this film was how everything happened like magic and was never explained.There was a character in this film that just kept appearing at the right moment and it was never explained. And two characters would stand underneath mistletoe that magically appeared out of nowhere. Also, it doesn\u2019t seem realistic. Yes, I know this is a fictional film but they make the characters out to be stupid and not question why Stacy or Margaret is acting differently than usual. They show signs of questioning it but again like when things happen in this film they just shrug it off. Other movies who have done this kind of plot had a few characters shrug it off but not all. Also, I\u2019m pretty sure who wrote this movie wrote A Christmas Prince there is a lot of similarities between the two princes. In the end, this movie is good for people who like RomComs or who don\u2019t.

How many respected directors have the star power to get a movie made that, even with a violent Mexican drug cartel involved in the plot, turns out to be a thoughtful, mostly gentle character study of an old man awakening fully to regrets of how he treated his family in his younger years. This type of story even goes against the grain of the violent movies that made Eastwood a star in the first place. \r\n\r\nIt is not a movie I will likely watch again - there is just too much out there still to see for this movie to draw me in a second time.

{"author":"Ditendra","content":"With so many movies today about exorcisms, I was expecting just another copy of those movies, but on my surprise, this movie was different and well shot, quite scary. Atmosphere was good, makeup was done brilliant and almost everything in short was great, but there were few mistakes in some scenes that were too unrealistic and basically mistakes. For example: When Megan shows Lisa the footage of camera where corpse is clearly visible in the corridor, Lisa says that it's just a shadow? Seriously? Shadow of what? How in the center of something there can be shadow of nothing? And then Lisa notices the medicine Xanax and starts giving Megan a hard time and lectures about using Xanax completely ignoring the footage and fact that something unusual, some figure is spotted in the camera. This scene was very unrealistic and in real scenario any sane person would pay attention to that footage instead of stupid Xanax.\r\n\r\nSecond mistake was when Megan tells Randy about wound of corpse and Randy also recalls that corpse had a huge wound and now it's gone and instead of being shocked and curious how it happened guy starts talking about his past life that he had problems with drinking... I understand that horror genre is unrealistic itself, but those scenes were too much and lacked the common sense.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, the opening scene, well while it didn't have such big mistakes as those two scenes, I think it wasn't necessary and it looked like typical those copy exorcist movies I mentioned at the start.\r\n\r\nIf movie didn't have those mistakes, I would give it 10.","id":"5d9c4601439be100127954cd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d9c4601439be100127954cd","movie_id":434555}
{"author":"Key-Si","content":"What once started as a short film in 2016 now has become a full length feature film. Both directed by Jon Knautz, \"The Cleaning Lady\" tells the story of 'Shelly' (Rachel Alig), who becomes the cleaning lady for 'Alice' (Alexis Kendra). 'Shelly's face is terribly scarred and at first the introverted woman barely speaks, avoids eye contact and and her personality stands in a total contrast to 'Alice', who does makeup work for a living. 'Alice' fell terribly in love with 'Michael' (Stelio Savante), a married man. Knowing that this relationship is kind of toxic, she attends to a self help group, 'The Love Addicts' (same thing as the AA, just for the relationship thing), and the movie takes a while to get going. A little too long, because first this film feels a lot like a low budget drama and aside from the opening, where you see 'Shelly' putting rats into a blender, there is nothing horrifying going on for quite some time. So long, that you actually get bored with the film. We see the two women meet up for scheduled cleaning appointments, in between we get the relationship going back and forth and a deeper look into the childhood of 'Shelly', filled with abuse by her mother, scenes where they just sit down for dinner, doing makeup together... Boring stuff for the most part. When things finally get going, \"The Cleaning Lady\" turns into the Horror movie I was waiting for though, and I really liked how things played out. Unfortunately it took so long to get there, that I can't really call it a good film anymore. It is watchable and there are quite a few nice scenes if you have the patience to sit through the long intro, but if you don't, \"The Cleaning Lady\" might not be for you. The acting is fine and the burned skin effects look very convincing (especially if you seen what a beauty Rachel Alig actually is) and for this being an extension of a short film, it wasn't bad at all. But at least a little excitement during the first 30 to 40 minutes would have been nice.","id":"5d62c50939a45d41ebc05b0c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d62c50939a45d41ebc05b0c","movie_id":534271}

On the contrary, it was a blast from beginning to end with Alicia Vikander lending a nice touch of innocence to Lara, which is a clear nod to the 2013 game reboot which is what the film is based on.\r\nHer tortuous relationship with her dad was predictable, but it wasn't overdone and it's a key element in the Lara story. On the other hand, we're plunged into the action right away and in that respect I was more than happy as the scenes were both exciting and typically Lara Croft. She uses keys, there are puzzles, traps,maps, evil foes and magnificent set pieces that, if you've ever played the games, will be instantly recognisable as Tomb Raider.\r\nMuch as has been said about the last two games perhaps giving a conflicted projection of Lara Croft - on the one hand a tormented soul and on the other, a ruthless killing machine. In all the games, she always killed the foes just to survive and the balance was just right here, with Alicia Vikander lending just the right amount of steely determination to the role.\r\nMore importantly, I could relate to the film having played all the games - the plane on top of the waterfall, the rolling spikes and the collapsing floor later on - all drew me in wonderfully.\r\nI'll take two please, or preferably three!","id":"5b0e747692514153b7003e12","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b0e747692514153b7003e12","movie_id":338970}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This movie is, to me, a quite nice special effects extravaganza. In some ways I actually liked this movie more than the first one.\r\n\r\nSure, the underlying story is totally ludicrous. Come one, fighting giant monster with big clumsy robots that requires two people in some strange mind melt to maneuver is just ridiculous. Just send in a couple of fighter jets with some suitable devices that go boom and be done with it. But then, the purpose of these movies are to show off giant robot special effects and on that note they certainly deliver.\r\n\r\nThis installment in the franchise seems to be more geared towards the younger audience as far as the story and the cast goes. Some people like it, some don\u2019t. Personally I\u2019m fairly neutral.\r\n\r\nAs with the previous movie the story is not really that much to write home about. It has plot holes big enough to drive I giant robot through. I just had to say that didn\u2019t I? Still, there are some parts of this story that I liked better than the first one. It is a quite straightforward story with clear heroes, clear bad guys.\r\n\r\nIt does not really have any of that lazy stupid plot twist where some dumb ass politicians are trying to shut down the program to save money. Sure the program is in some danger but this time it is due to a new program that actually sounds reasonable and could improve things. Of course said program gets sabotaged but hey, we, the audience, want our big silly robots right?\r\n\r\nThe story is also mostly devoid of any stupid SJW crap or silly green preaching. The ridiculous crap about Dinosaurs being the first invasion and that we had terraformed the planet (global warming and all that stuff) so a second invasion was more likely to succeed was just an insult to the more intelligent among the audience and took off a star or two from the first movie for me.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I quite enjoyed the movie. It delivered where it counts, that is in the special effects department. Loads and loads of special effects mostly involving giant robots and Kaijus slugging it out with massive property damage as a result. They are literally beating each other up with skyscrapers for Christ sake!\r\n\r\nThe story, acting and everything else is adequate. Nothing more and nothing less. I do miss some colorful characters like Hannibal Chau (Ron Perlman) from the first movie. The characters in this one was more bland that has to be said.\r\n\r\nIt seems like a lot of people on IMDb and elsewhere have their pants in a twist over this movie and rates it one or two stars out of ten. That\u2019s just nonsense. A one star rating is for a movie that is truly awful in all aspects. The special effects alone elevates this movie above one star. You might not like the turn towards the younger audience or something else in the movie but it still does not make it a one star movie.\r\n\r\nSure if you are not a science fiction or fantasy fan and do not care about special effects then I guess you could feel this is an awful movie but then why did you watch it in the first place? It is the second installment in the franchise so it should come as no surprise that the movie lives and dies by it\u2019s special effects.\r\n\r\nI would say that if you like giant robots, monsters and special effects and don\u2019t mind a fairly thin story aimed for the slightly younger audience then there is a fair change that you will find this movie entertaining.","id":"5b6334c5c3a368188603e44e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b6334c5c3a368188603e44e","movie_id":268896}

And if ever a film didn't scream \"sequel\", it was that one. Apart from the fact that it was only a modest box-office hit (grossing $84.9 million against a $30 million budget, in an era when the only films that become franchises must gross $800 billion in the first five minutes of their release), the storyline was carried to a fairly natural conclusion \u2013 Alejandro Gillick (Benicio del Toro), protected by his CIA handler Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), successfully manipulated na\u00efve and idealistic CIRG officer Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) into helping him exact revenge for the murder of his wife and daughter at the hands of drug baron Fausto Alarc\u00f3n (Julio Cesar Cedillo). The film concluded with Graver getting what he wanted, Gillick getting revenge, and Macer in possession of a more realistic, if bitter, understanding of how the US conducts its affairs in Mexico.\r\n\r\nA sequel felt wholly unnecessary. But a sequel is what we have. When a suicide bombing in Kansas kills fifteen people, the US government authorise Graver to adopt \"_extreme measures_\" to combat Mexican drug cartels, who are suspected of smuggling the terrorists across the border. Deciding to instigate a war between the two major cartels, Graver recruits Gillick to assassinate a high-profile lawyer for the Matamoros cartel while Graver and his team kidnap Isabel Reyes (Isabela Moner), the daughter of the kingpin of Matamoros' rival. Taking her to Texas, Graver and Gillick then 'rescue' her in a false flag operation, making it appear she was kidnapped by her father's enemies. As they transport her back to Mexico, Gillick begins to bond with her. However, after they cross the border, the Mexican police escorts double-cross them, and Isabel flees into the desert, pursued by Gillick. Meanwhile, the US government determines that two of the suicide bombers from Kansas were domestic terrorists, and thus were not smuggled into the country. With this mind, to help quell tensions with Mexico, Secretary of Defense James Riley (Matthew Modine) orders the CIA to abandon the mission, much to Garver's disgust.\r\n\r\nWith the first film wrapping up so neatly, the announcement of a sequel seemed like a typical Hollywood cash grab, one which would most likely crap all over the legacy of the truly excellent original. However, as bits and pieces of info regarding the sequel began to filter through, it started to feel less and less like the usual Hollywood knock-off we're all used to seeing. For starters, Taylor Sheridan would return as sole-writer, in a script that would not go in what, for many, might seem the only real direction in which to take the story - Macer getting revenge for Graver and Gillick using her. Instead, Macer wouldn't even appear, as the script would instead focus on pseudo-antagonists Gillick and Graver. To this end, the only other actors who would also return would be Raoul Max Trujillo as Rafael, one of Gillick's contacts in Mexico, and Jeffrey Donovan as Steve Foraing, Graver's number two. The big concern for a lot of people, however, was who would replace the irritatingly talented Villeneuve in the director's chair. And so it was another welcome bit of news when the man chosen was Stefano Sollima, the Italian director of _A.C.A.B. \u2013 All Cops Are Bastards_ (2012) and _Suburra_ (2015), as well as most of the episodes in the first season of _Gomorra: La serie_ (2014).\r\n\r\nOkay, so first things first. _Soldado_ isn't a patch on _Sicario_. Not even close (and, needless to say, there's nothing here to come anywhere near _that_ dinner table scene). And there are some problems which were largely absent first time around. For example, the narrative suffers slightly from the absence of Macer, not insofar as she herself is irreplaceable, but more in the sense that the audience no longer has a surrogate. Because we know who Graver and Gillick really are this time around, there is obviously no point in the film playing its cards close to its chest, and so it adapts a more balls-to-the-wall, damn-the-torpedoes approach. This renders the narrative more morally simplistic than the first film. In tandem with this, perhaps wisely, Sheridan has written _Soldado_ as a more conventional action-thriller than _Sicario_, but this has the knock-on effect that when the bullets start flying, as they do on several occasions, all the political\/moral back-and-forth is made to seem nothing more than the material that gets us from one shootout to the next. Additionally, there's an element of repetition, as Isabel is traded off from one group to the next, and one definitely gets a sense of _d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu_, as she becomes a metaphorical cog in the screenwriter's machinery. Also, although Solima's direction is good (with that resume, how could he not get the gritty tone right), it's not as sharp as Villeneuve's. Finally, and this is a small point, the title of the film translates as _Hitman 2: Soldier_ [or _Hitman: Day of the Soldier_ in North America]. This makes not a lick of sense, and instead sounds like a 90s action movie starring Michael Dudikoff.\r\n\r\nHowever, for all that, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The script is sharp, relevant (references to a spineless POTUS undermining intelligence operations will be sure to please at least half the audience), gruff, and cool. With the two _Sicario_ films, _Hell or High Water_ (2016), _Wind River_ (2017), and _Yellowstone_ (2018-), Sheridan is fast becoming one of Hollywood's most accomplished writers. The film also stars two of the coolest men on the planet being masculine and suppressing their emotions. Del Toro never so much as even hints at cracking a smile, whilst Brolin has lost some of the sardonic dismissiveness he possessed in the first film, but none of the bluster or self-confidence. All things considered, for a film that never seemed to have any real reason to exist, this is a cracking piece of storytelling, and has me already looking forward to the next instalment.","id":"5cc1774e0e0a265b0fef7efb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cc1774e0e0a265b0fef7efb","movie_id":400535}

{"author":"Feli~","content":"Luca's \"Suspiria\" brought me no words.\r\n\r\nThe horror in this movie is not like anything else I've ever heard or seen. The sheer film in Luca's \"Suspiria\" is not like anything that is made by major movie studios such as Columbia, Paramount, 20th Century Fox, Disney, and the like. Director Luca Guadagnino transitioning from the LGBTQ+ drama adaptation \"Call Me By Your Name\" \u2014 transitioning to the avant-garde, psychological study in his version of famed director Dario Argento's 1977 \"Suspiria\".\r\n\r\nHorror movies today don't scare me. Horror movies of the 21st century seem to be involved in so much gratuitous gore, typical plotlines, a roulette set of actors playing quasi-characterization, varying degress of quality. Luca's \"Suspiria\" \u2014 a horror movie from 2018 \u2014 did not scare me. Luca's \"Suspiria\" unnerved me. Luca's \"Suspiria\" built slowly in tension, but also captivated me with raw interest \u2014 \"Suspiria\" dealt its final blow, finishing with a nightmarish sixth act and an epilogue.\r\n\r\nArgento's \"Suspiria\" is a movie out of time in its own way. Argento's \"Suspiria\", a film released in 1977, looks fresh and modern \u2014 Argento's \"Suspiria\"'s fixation on primary neon colors and gore \u2014 Argento's \"Suspiria\" with prog-rock, percussion score by the band Goblin. Director Dario Argento, however, does not like Luca's \"Suspiria\". Director Dario Argento claims it is without spirit, fear and music \u2014 Argento thinks the design is beautiful, so Guadagnino must have done something right.\r\n\r\nLuca's \"Suspiria\" is a movie unlike anything out of sheer audacity to become its own. Luca's \"Suspiria\" in the way it handles narrative into six different, self-contained \"acts\" ending with an epilogue \u2014 Luca's \"Suspiria\" in its washed-out, bleak setting complementing queer, disenfranchised coloring and nonconforming visual narrative \u2014 Luca's \"Suspiria\" with its brooding realism, mysterious witchcraft and black magic \u2014 Luca's \"Suspiria\" with mesmerizing visuals; unexplained syntax; self-contained exposure; restraint. Horror in Luca's \"Suspiria\" is much more than simple disgusting imagery \u2014 Gore in Luca's \"Suspiria\" is far and in between, but is visceral and disgusting all the same \u2014 Nudity in Luca's \"Suspiria\" is all female, except one male.\r\n\r\nPolitics and dance in Luca's \"Suspiria\" are vital to understanding 2018 \"Suspiria\". Dance carries witchcraft and spells, and with it \u2014 uncompromising emotion, femininity, power, and rawness. The German Autumn of 1977, in which Luca's \"Suspiria\" is set in a time where Berlin is divided into East and West (and when Argento's \"Suspiria\" was released). The Lufthansa hijacking and the RAF faction. The mention of the Third Reich by Dr. Klemperer as a religion, and a delusion. What is and is not a delusion.\r\n\r\nThere's something dramatic about Luca's \"Suspiria\" itself. Dr. Lutz Klemperer in losing his beloved wife, Anke, in the Holocaust. Sara in losing her beloved friend, Patricia. Madame Blanc in beginning to love her newfound daughter, only to regret what she has done to her. The three girls in the ritual wishing for death, to be given a motherly kiss and then die. Klemperer's meek inability to stop what he has witnessed through psychotherapy; his helpless stature in the finale. His erased memory to absolve him of his guilt, and of what he had to witness.\r\n\r\nDakota Johnson; the one actress from the terrible, mainstream \"Fifty Shades\" film trilogy. Dakota Johnson becomes remarkably unnerving, feminine, sexual, motherly, and incomprehensible. Tilda Swinton \u2014 her counterpart, Lutz Ebersdorf. Tilda Swinton's role as a matriarch and founding mother of a coven; Lutz Ebersdorf's role as a skeptical psychotherapist; a grieving widow. Chloe Grace Moretz as a politically-troubled woman; unstable woman; paranoid woman. Everyone's performance as their roles felt utterly average \u2014 Everyone's average performance as their roles grounded reality to the movie.\r\n\r\nThom Yorke in the music department did a nice job. Thom Yorke's score for Luca's \"Suspiria\" evoked the mood of a 70s prog-rock band with a niche for ambient synthscapes, musique concrete moods and piano experimentation; if we're judging Thom Yorke's soundtrack, its a nice collection of songs that should have been a Radiohead double album than a soundtrack. Of course, Thom Yorke's score did not always fit Luca's \"Suspiria\"; Some scenes with Thom Yorke's pieces grated the scenes' moods to pieces, yet in a similar manner as Goblin's score for Argento's \"Suspiria\".\r\n* A movie that left me deeply unsettled, and scared in my subconscious. A movie that made me depressed when it was depressed. A multi-faceted piece, Luca's \"Suspiria\" is a rooted testament in femininity and matriarchy. Luca's \"Suspiria\" is a movie without words.","id":"5c4565f50e0a264965c6a5ca","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c4565f50e0a264965c6a5ca","movie_id":361292}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Politically juvenile, with a troubling approach to the Feminine, but it's certainly convinced of its own profundity_**\r\n\r\n> _It did not excite me, it betrayed the spirit of the original film: there is no fear, there is no music. The film has not satisfied me so much._\r\n\r\n- Dario Argento's assessment of _Suspiria_; _Un Giorno da Pecora_ (January 18, 2019)\r\n\r\nReleased in 1977, Dario Argento's giallo classic _Suspiria_ (the first part of his _Tre madri_ [_Three Mothers_] trilogy) has a plot you could fit on a stamp \u2013 a young American dancer goes to the famous Tanz Dance Academy in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, only to find it's a front for a witches coven. That's it, and as the film barely leaves the confines of the Academy, there is no contextualising of the plot against any kind of socio-political background. By no means is it a good film, with terrible acting, a dire script, and laughable effects, but it's immensely enjoyable, partly because it's genuinely creepy in places, but mainly because it doesn't take itself too seriously; the filmmakers know it's nothing more than a surreal, gaudy, style-over-substance, shock-for-shock's sake, Grand Guignol head-trip, and they lean into that identity rather than trying to transcend it. Luca Guadagnino's remake (yes folks, it's a remake) is the polar opposite \u2013 it has an intricate plot covering all manner of themes and topics, featuring several new characters, and setting everything against a complex socio-political background; the acting and effects are excellent; it takes itself very, very seriously; and it continually tries to prove to the viewer that it is much more than a piece of kitsch horror. According to Guadagnino, his version of _Suspiria_ is a \"_homage_\" to the \"_powerful emotions_\" of the original (it's a remake), whilst actress Tilda Swinton calls it \"_a cover version_\" (it's a remake). The real question, however, is not how similar or dissimilar it is to Argento. The real question is whether the film is a beautifully mounted insightful exploration of female sexuality, a celebration of a self-contained matriarchy set against the destructive chaos of a failing patriarchy, and a psychoanalytical investigation of national trauma and World War II guilt, or is it an overlong, dull, self-important, incoherent mess, that in trying to be both feminist and feminine somehow ends up being both misogynist and misandrist? Working kind of like a hybrid of Nicholas Winding Refn's _The Neon Demon_ (2016) and Darren Aronofsky's _mother!_ (2017), the film is as far as you can get from Guadagnino's more recent work, specifically _A Bigger Splash_ (2015), and _Call Me By Your Name_ (2017); one can only imagine what people who expected more of the warm sun and delicate eroticism seen in those films must have felt after spending 152 minutes in an arid Berlin winter, witnessing bones pushing through skin, decapitations, night terrors, meat hooks being used in ways meat hooks were not intended to be used, Holocaust survivors, political terrorism, and witches trying to organise an election.\r\n\r\nSet in \"Divided Berlin\" in October 1977, the film is divided into six acts (\"1977\", \"Palaces of Tears\", \"Borrowing\", \"Taking\", \"In the M\u00fctterhaus (All the Floors are Darkness)\", and \"Suspiriorum\") and an epilogue (\"A Sliced-Up Pear\"). It begins with Patricia Hingle (Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, who appears to be cornering the market in rubbish Hollywood remakes), a student at the prestigious Helena Markos Tanzgruppe [Helena Markos Dance Academy] arriving at the home of her psychoanalyst, the Carl Jung-in-all-but-name Dr. Josef Klemperer (Tilda Swinton, credited as Lutz Ebersdorf). Terrified and not making much sense, Hingle tells Klemperer she has discovered something sinister about the Academy and is now in fear for her life. Although Klemperer believes she is delusional, he is concerned for her well-being, but she flees, leaving behind her diary. Meanwhile, Susie Bannion (Dakota Johnson), a Mennonite from Ohio, arrives at the Academy hoping to audition. Impressed with her abilities, lead choreographer Madame Blanc (also Tilda Swinton, channelling Pina Bausch), admits her to the Academy. Becoming close with her roommate, Sara Simms (an excellent Mia Goth), Susie quickly finds herself dancing the lead in the Academy's upcoming piece, _Volk_. Meanwhile, in Hingle's diary, Klemperer reads that the academy is a front for a witches' coven, and learns of the \"Three Mothers\", a triumvirate of powerful witches who predate Christianity \u2013 Suspiriorum (Sighs), Tenebrarum (Darkness), and Lachrymarum (Tears). At the same time, he is trying to find out what happened to his wife, Anke (Jessica Harper, who played Susie in the original), who disappeared in 1944 after he tried to convince her it was safe to remain in Berlin. Meanwhile, the Academy's matrons hold an election to choose the coven's leader, with Blanc running against Helena Markos (also Tilda Swinton!), a vote which Markos narrowly wins. Unaware of any of this, as Susie becomes increasingly close to Blanc, Sara grows suspicious of the matrons and begins to investigate on Klemperer's behalf.\r\n\r\nGuadagnino has been obsessed with Argento's original since he first saw it in 1984, and in 2007, he optioned the rights and hired David Gordon Green to write and direct a remake (there's that word again), something with which Argento himself was not especially pleased, believing the film didn't need to be remade. In 2013, Green revealed that legal issues had prevented the film from being made, and in 2014, he also cited the escalating budget. However, in 2015, Guadagnino announced that he himself was now directing a \"_homage_\" (it's a remake), from a script by David Kajganich (_The Invasion_; _True Story_) which focused on \"_the uncompromising force of motherhood._\" Guadagnino's _Suspiria_ is the kind of horror movie that goes for slow-burning psychological dread (there is literally not a single jump-scare), and from the time the project was announced, it has divided opinion, something which continued when it was released; it's that rarest of films whose Metacritic scores range from 0 (for example, Mike LaSalle's review for the _San Francisco Chronicle_) to 100 (for example, Joshua Rothkopf's review for _Time Out_).\r\n\r\nAs the plot outline should make clear, the film deals with a variety of weighty themes, one of which is the political turmoil of the era. Set in October 1977, the events of the _Deutscher Herbst_ [German Autumn] are constantly on the fringes of the narrative \u2013 the film opens with a street demo; radio reports speak of Ulrike Meinhof's death in police custody in May 1976, the imprisonment of Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin, the activities of the far-left, anti-imperialistic terrorist group _Rote Armee Fraktion_ [Red Army Faction - RAF], the hijacking of _Lufthansa Flight 181_ by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the kidnapping of Hanns Martin Schleyer; the story the academy put out to explain Hingle's departure is that she has joined the RAF; a bomb explodes off-camera.\r\n\r\nAnd it is in relation to politics where we encounter the first, and most certainly not the last, of the film's problems. Arguing that Germany's failure to process their Nazi past and confront their national shame is manifesting as political disenfranchisement, Guadagnino employs a pseudo-Jungian approach to show that the country's political turmoil runs parallel to the struggle for control of the coven. Emphasising that the world of witches was once harmonious under the rule of the Three Mothers, just like Germany, it has now devolved into factionalism, complete with backroom political manoeuvring, subterfuge within the ranks, and animosity bordering on aggression. Within this dynamic, the matrons are the privileged ruling elite, and the students are the uneducated and disenfranchised \"_volk_\".\r\n\r\nBut to what end does Guadagnino make this parallel? What is he trying to say? Rarely have I encountered a narrative which employs such blatant yet inconclusive and vague political contextualisation. Take the Berlin Wall as an example, which is literally right outside the Academy's door. Why is it there? Why are there so many shots of it? What purpose does it serve in the narrative? The answer is, none. It's purely ornamental, with Guadagnino seemingly hoping for meaning by association \u2013 people see the Wall, and immediately begin to attribute to it all manner of allegorical significance, when in fact the film itself suggests nothing of the kind. And none of the other political symbols amount to much more; they certainly don't inform any grand thematic statement or political thesis. Guadagnino bombards the viewer with empty historical and political themes which do nothing for the central storyline, functioning instead as decoration, utterly trivialising and completely disconnected.\r\n\r\nAlso important in relation to the film's politics is _Vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung_ [\"Overcoming the past\"] \u2013 essentially, post-1945 Germany's attempt to come to terms with World War II and the Holocaust. This is primarily seen in Klemperer's search for his wife, which throws up another problem. Klemperer, who is not in Argento's original, is a surrogate for the audience. Nothing wrong with that, it's a standard screenwriting technique used to facilitate more organic exposition. However, Klemperer is an extremely distracting and painfully on-the-nose device to afford Guadagnino a vehicle for a political subplot, which is completely superfluous to what is happening in the coven. Every single reference to Anke could be removed from the film, leaving Klemperer as simply an amateur detective trying to find out what happened to Hingle, and the film would work just as well. In fact, it would work better. As his search for his wife becomes more prominent, and he becomes more central, all that is achieved is the waning of the central plot. In a story ostensibly about the Feminine, it's rather troubling that the emotional core of the film is male. The film's preferred point of view is his, with even the epilogue focusing on him. Klemperer is quite literally a man in a woman's world, but exactly why Guadagnino felt the need to shoehorn a man into a story about women is anybody's guess.\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to another theme; femininity (if not necessarily feminism). That the film is deeply interested in this is shown in a number of ways. For example, Susie is told by head matron Tanner (Angela Winkler) that the academy ensures the \"_financial autonomy of our girls_\"; speaking of Nazi Germany, Blanc says the regime wanted women to \"_close their minds and keep their uteruses open_\"; Susie is reminded that \"_before the war, Germany had the strongest women_\". Additionally, Klemperer is played by Swinton, meaning the film effectively has an all-female cast (the only other men with any lines are Glockner and Albrecht (played by Mikael Olsson and Fred Kelemen, respectively), two completely useless policemen whose main scene involves the witches hypnotising them and mocking the size of their genitalia). However, the film isn't interested in idealising female empowerment. Instead, it depicts a matriarchy beset by disruption and the chaos of a struggle for power. As Guadagnino tells Jezebel,\r\n\r\n> _if we talk about the Great Mother, we cannot deny the terrible mother. True feminism is something that doesn't shy away from the complexity of the female identity._\r\n\r\nBut does the film imply that a powerful group of women is something to be inherently feared? Partly. Indeed, the very theme of witchcraft itself (perhaps the purest historical manifestation of the patriarchy's fear of female agency) carries an undercurrent of misogyny, which is not helped by the nudity and repeated violent objectification of the female body. There's a very thin line between condemning the male gaze, which is what Guadagnino claims to be doing, and recreating it, and it's a line which _Suspiria_ frequently crosses (for an excellent example of a film which recreates the male gaze for the purpose of satirising and ridiculing it, see Coralie Fargeat's superb _Revenge_). Maybe the problem here is simply that a story inherently about matriarchy, female empowerment, and the importance of motherhood, is a story a man can't tell very well. I'm reminded of Sofia Coppola's remake of _The Beguiled_ (2017), of which she argued,\r\n\r\n> _this story had to be directed by a woman. The essence of it is feminine, it's seen from a female point of view._\r\n\r\n_Suspiria_ also has a feminine essence, but it doesn't have a female point of view, and one can't help but wonder what a talented female director like Coppola, Mary Harron, Patty Jenkins, or the genius that is Lynne Ramsay would have made of this material.\r\n\r\nHowever, even aside from these problems, there are a plethora of other issues. The character of Blanc, for example, is poorly written, and is stripped of agency towards the end of the film, so by the time of the _d\u00e9nouement_, she anti-climatically does little in the direction of either outright evil or redemptive good; instead, she just kind of hangs around. As for the matrons, apart from Tanner, none receive an iota of characterisation; they are simply a jumble of non-individualised background extras. The same is true of the dancers. Indeed, there's an absolute dearth of subjectivity or interiority for anyone beyond Susie, Blanc, Klemperer, and, to a lesser extent, Sara and Tanner. There's a clich\u00e9-riddled scene showing Blanc telepathically channelling nightmares to Susie, full of images of skulls, worms, rotting flesh, etc. Nothing we haven't seen a hundred times before. Finally, the film is immensely silly in places. For example, the much-talked-about climax is presided over by what can only be described as a female Jabba the Hut wearing sunglasses. Another example is after Susie first dances at the academy, she confides to Blanc, \"_it felt like what I think it must feel like to fuck._\" \"_Do you mean fuck a man?_\" asks Blanc. \"_No_,\" replies Susie, \"_I was thinking of an animal._\" Of course you were.\r\n\r\nFrom an aesthetic point of view, however, there's a great deal to admire, as one would expect from Guadagnino, who is working with much of the same crew as from his last couple of films. Walter Fasano's editing is wonderfully disjointed, often cutting maniacally between inserts, barely affording the viewer time to register the images. The compositions and camera placement of cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom (_Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives_) are also fascinating, often putting the camera in such a position as to purposely give a less than perfect view of a particular space. Combined, these two techniques are disorientating and frequently defamiliarising, rendering mundane geographical spaces such as offices, dorm rooms, and rehearsal studios as foreboding and unknowable, almost protean, never allowing the viewer to forget that something is not quite right in this _milieu_. Contributing to this sense is the blocking, particularly the recurring motif of staging conversations so that one character is off-screen, only visible to the audience via reflection. Especially noticeable is the film's colour, or lack thereof. Whereas Argento's original was awash in garish and exaggerated reds, purples, blues, greens, and yellows, Guadagnino's remake was conceived as \"_winterish_\", with as limited a use of primary colours as possible; grey, beige, and brown predominate. Giulia Piersanti's costumes are also superb, with Susie's wardrobe noticeably changing from conservative dresses and sweatpants to more revealing tank tops and shorts as she gains in confidence. Thom Yorke's Krautrock-style score is also excellent, as different from Goblin's prog-rock music from the original as you could possibly imagine.\r\n\r\nThe cumulative tension and dread are also reasonably well managed in the first half of the film, and there are individual scenes of great brilliance. At one point, Sara goes snooping around the Academy, finding something genuinely shocking, the reveal of which is masterfully staged by Guadagnino and Mukdeeprom. Easily the best scene in the film is the one that so traumatised audiences at CinemaCon 2018. As Susie performs an especially energetic dance for Blanc in one room, unbeknownst to her, she is psychically linked to a dancer in another, and every movement of her body is manifested violently in the other room, with the other dancer being flung about like a rag doll. The scene is horrifically gruesome, with bones piercing through flesh, blood and urine flowing copiously, and limbs contorting into truly disturbing positions. What really sells the scene, however, is the combination of Fasano's brilliant intercutting (maintaining continuity of movement from room to room cannot have been easy), Damien Jalet's superb choreography, and the disturbing sound design by Frank Kruse and Markus Stemler (_Cloud Atlas_; _In the Heart of the Sea_; _Assassin's Creed_) contrasting the sharp snapping of breaking bones with the wetter sounds of those bones penetrating flesh.\r\n\r\nSelf-indulgent like little else I can think of, _Suspiria_ is absolutely convinced of its own profundity. Far, far too long and far too self-serious, its themes and messages are poorly iterated, it's insanely dull for long periods, and it's badly unfocused. It's almost an hour longer than the original, and, honestly, it uses that hour to say precisely nothing of interest. The simple fact is that the slight story at the film's core (a coven of witches using a dance academy as a front) is unable to bear the massive weight of themes and narrative diversions heaped upon it; the vehicle just can't carry the message. Its politics are no more insightful than tabloid headlines, and serve only to detract from what is supposed to be the narrative's focus. Ultimately, it has little to say about femininity, feminism, political protest, the Holocaust, Cold War Germany, or World War II guilt, but it damn sure works hard to convince us it has a great deal to say about such topics. As cold as the Berlin winter it depicts, _Suspiria_ is equal parts emotionless, mechanical, and dull.","id":"5d1556d871ffdf003086d189","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d1556d871ffdf003086d189","movie_id":361292}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I have to admit that I was a bit hesitant about watching this movie since it seems to have received quite a bit of flak. But then so did The Last Jedi and I liked that one a lot so a few days ago me and the kids sat down to watch Solo on my home cinema rig.\r\n\r\nWhat I found was a quite enjoyable action adventure movie. Yes, the story is simple and quite predictable but that is fine by me. What I wanted was a simple and straightforward action roller coaster and that was pretty much what I got. I did not want some deep crap with a lot of social pointers all over the place. It is Star Wars, it is meant to just entertain. Action and special effects \u201c\u00fcber alles\u201d plain and simple.\r\n\r\nPortraying Han Solo when he was young is of course a quite tall order for any actor. Everyone is going to compare him with Harrison Ford and that is pretty much a recipe for failure. Personally I am happy that they picked an actor that was not especially well known from other movies, at least not to me. If they had not done that I would have compared him not only to Harrison Ford but also to whatever character he had played before. I think Alden Ehrenreich did a fairly good job of portraying a young Han Solo.\r\n\r\nActually, I think most of the actors was fairly okay. It\u2019s not a Shakespeare play after all. It did sadden me that Woody turned out to be such an asshole in the end though. For most of the movie I quite liked the guy.\r\n\r\nThe story was, as I already wrote, simple and straightforward. Predictable as hell of course but then, in these kind of movies the story is more or less only a means to tie together the action. It worked for me. I am so glad that they actually did tie up a certain loose end at the end of the movie though. If Solo hadn\u2019t been in that last game of cards with Lando and the outcome not been what it was I would have been seriously miffed about the entire movie. Probably one of the scenes I liked the most actually.\r\n\r\nAs I am writing this the movie has a rating of 7 out of 10 on IMDb and I think that is pretty much spot on. I have to say that I am quite sad about Disney\u2019s knee-jerk reaction to pull the brakes on the Star Wars movies. This is so typical of the Hollywood bean counters nowadays. If a movie is not making an insane amount of money the first couple of weeks it is considered a failure and the standard response is to pull the franchise. That is essentially saying that there is something wrong with the audience. We made a good movie but you did not like it so we kill the franchise way of thinking. Well, news flash dumb asses, if the movie didn\u2019t sell as well as you estimated either there is something wrong with your over-inflated estimates or with the movie you did. It\u2019s your fault, not the audience. Make a better one or fix your estimates! Okay, as a Star Wars fan I am perhaps biased but I am so tired of dumbass bean counters, not just where movie making is concerned.","id":"5bddb79e0e0a260593010bd7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bddb79e0e0a260593010bd7","movie_id":348350}

{"author":"garethmb","content":"Back in 1977 I remember going into the original Cine Capri to see \u201cStar Wars\u201d with some friends. I was very young but little did I know that movie would change my life and put me on the path that I am now. Over the decades that have followed I have read the books and comics, played with the toys, played the video games, and eagerly watched any new film or television show related to the franchise.\n\nThe fact that Disney has put out a new film every years since \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d is great for fans like me as those three year waits; to say nothing of the 17+ years between the Original and Prequel Trilogies were tough.\n\nThrough it all my favorite character has always been Han Solo. I do not know what it is but the brash, cocky, money loving; scoundrel who gets in and out of trouble yet does the right thing in the end has always connected with me.\nSo when news came that there would be a new movie based on the early years of the title characters I was excited but concerned as Harrison Ford is so iconic in that role I could not see how anyone could measure up.\n\nCombine that with original Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller being removed from the film after shooting a significant number of weeks, there was ample concern to go around.\n\nFortunately for fans, Director Ron Howard has crafted a very enjoyable film as \u201cHan Solo: A Star Wars Story\u201d deftly combines the action, visuals, and humor that made the films cinematic legends and in doing so introduces new characters and expands the lore of the Star Wars Universe.\n\nThe film follows a young Han (Alden Ehrenreich), who hustles to survive and get off the world of Corrilia.\n\nHan like many kids on the street pull all sorts of scams under the control of various criminals and he plots to escape with his friend Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke).\nWhen an opportunity arises, Han takes it, but finds himself in the Imperial Navy which does not bode well for a person with strong opinions and a mind of his own. \nFate steps in once again and introduces Han to Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), and a mentor figure in the form of a man named Beckett (Woody Harrelson).   Han attempts to prove himself to his new crew as he sees this as his way out to a better life. However with things take a turn for the worse, he must work with his new associates to clear the slate with a deadly crime boss named Dry\u2019den Vos (Paul Bettany).  \nAs anyone who follows the series knows Han has a way of escalating a situation and this leads the crew to recruiting Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover), into the crew as they set off to pull off a risky and dangerous mission to get the much needed resources to save their lives.\n\nWhat follows is a very enjoyable film that has an appropriate amount of humor and character building as well as plenty of good action and effects which should keep fans of the series happy. The new characters were very enjoyable and added a new depth to Han as well as the Star Wars mythos but what really impressed me was that at no time did I find myself comparing Ehrenreich to Harrison Ford. He was charismatic and enjoyable in the role and I easily believed that this was Han before life, the universe, and circumstances turned him into the man we would know years later.\nGlover is uncanny with his version of Lando and he at times almost sounded like Billy Dee Williams and had many of the mannerisms of the character down His back and forth with Han was great to see and we got a much deeper understand of both the characters and their complicated history with one another.\n\nClark and Harrelson round things out well as they provide a great balance to Han. One is a mentor and one is the link to the life he had and the dreams he wants to achieve.   Ron Howard moves things along well without rushing things as while it does take a bit of time getting up to speed, it happens at a natural pace without seeming rushed. Howard also does not rely on an abundance of effects to carry the film. There are plenty of practical FX and makeup creations to make you well aware that this is a vast and diverse galaxy but he uses them and the CGI to enhance the story rather than carry it.\n\nThere are numerous nods throughout to past films as well both visual and verbal and a few great surprises along the way. It is believed that more adventures of the younger Han will be coming in the future and I cannot wait for them to arrive as this was a very fun film. Now the only hard part will be the 19 month wait for Episode IX as the five month wait from the last film already seems like ages ago and I cannot wait for more.\n\n4.5 stars out of 5","id":"5afc39c9c3a36807270066ad","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5afc39c9c3a36807270066ad","movie_id":348350}
{"author":"Movie Queen41","content":"I have been a Star Wars fan since childhood. In fact, Star Wars: A New Hope was one of the first movies I ever saw in a theater. And I really enjoyed this movie. Don't believe the naysayers. There has been a lot of bad press surrounding the movie since the directors got fired and had to be replaced by Ron Howard. There was also some controversy of whether the lead actor was any good as Han Solo. The movie is not the mess we were led to believe. It works pretty well. Good action and special effects and lots of interesting alien creatures, as we would expect from a Star Wars movie. Alden Ehrenreich does a good job to make the role his own instead of doing an impression of Harrison Ford. Woody Harrelson, Phoebe Walter-Bridge, Donald Glover, and Paul Bettany also do good work in the film.

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_A sharp satire that runs a little too long and takes a bizarre left-turn that will alienate many_**\r\n\r\n> _In my view, corporations are illegitimate institutions of tyrannical power, with intellectual roots not unlike those of fascism and Bolshevism._\r\n> \r\n[...]\r\n> \r\n_We can - and should - certainly begin pointing out that corporations are fundamentally illegitimate, and that they don't have to exist at all in their modern form. Just as other oppressive institutions - slavery, say, or royalty - have been changed or eliminated, so corporate power can be changed or eliminated. What are the lim__its? There aren't any. Everything is ultimately under public control._\r\n\r\n- Noam Chomsky; _The Common Good_ (1998)\r\n\r\nA paean to the proletariat. A pro-union battle cry. An ideological evisceration of late capitalism. A deconstruction of corporate greed and the concomitant commercialisation of self-worth necessary to succeed. A critique of identity politics. An allegory of institutional racism in big business. A lampooning of Silicon Valley bro culture. _Sorry to Bother You_, the debut feature of writer\/director Boots Riley, is all this, and more. Very much in the key of absurdist fiction such as Dino Buzzati's _Il deserto dei Tartari_ (1940) and Ralph Ellison's _Invisible Man_ (1952), as well as race-conscious satirical cinema such as Robert Downey Sr.'s _Putney Swope_ (1969) and Melvin Van Peebles's _Watermelon Man_ (1970), whilst drawing more direct inspiration from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's _Faust_ (c.1806-1831), Alex Cox's _Repo Man_ (1984), and the work of Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, and, bizarrely, Ken Loach, _Sorry to Bother You_ is a black comedy\/Juvenalian satire\/science fiction\/horror\/magic realist\/allegorical character study. In short, it's impossible to classify. Dealing with the obstacles facing African Americans in a white-dominated corporate _milieu_, and positing that the experience of workers is determined by both labour conditions and race, the film examines labour relations, wage issues, worker solidarity, unionism, mass media, and the dangers of betraying oneself and choosing corporate advancement over friendships, relationships, and personal integrity. Although it's a beat or two too long, and although the spectacularly bizarre left-turn at the end of the second act will surely alienate a lot of viewers, the deconstruction and comic appropriation of code-switching results in a film that is constantly inventive, highly confrontational, and extremely funny.\r\n\r\nSet in Oakland, California in an \"alternate present\", the company WorryFree offers food and lodging in exchange for a lifetime labour contract with no wages, a practice which the Supreme Court has deemed legal and not equivalent to slavery. Standing against WorryFree is the radical group \"Left Eye\", who organise protests and vandalise WorryFree's billboards. Unconcerned with any of this is Cassius \"Cash\" Green (LaKeith Stanfield), who lives in his uncle Sergio's (Terry Crews) garage with his girlfriend, Detroit (Tessa Thompson), a performance artist and, unbeknownst to Cash, a member of Left Eye. Struggling to pay rent, and with Sergio close to losing the house, Cash gets a job at the telemarketing firm RegalView, selling encyclopaedia sets. Initially finding it difficult to make any sales, Cash's luck changes when an older co-worker, Langston (Danny Glover), explains that he must use his \"_white voice_\" to be in any way successful. Proving adept at doing so, Cash quickly rises to become one of RegalView's elite \"Power Callers.\" Meanwhile, a co-worker, Squeeze (Steven Yeun), forms a union and recruits Cash, Detroit, and their friend Salvador (Jermaine Fowler). Despite participating in an organised protest, Cash is surprised to get promoted. Now working in the luxurious upstairs suite, where he's mentored by Mr. _______ (a hilarious Omari Hardwick), Cash learns that RegalView is secretly selling human labour to WorryFree. Despite his misgivings, he is earning a substantial wage, and soon finds himself torn between his career and the labour movement. This is exacerbated when WorryFree CEO Steve Lift (a spectacular Armie Hammer) offers him a salary of $1 million a year to work directly for WorryFree. However, Cash then makes a discovery that changes everything, not just for himself, but potentially for all of humanity.\r\n\r\nRiley, who identifies as a communist (but not a Marxist), is best known (thus far) as the lead vocalist of the far-left hip-hop groups The Coup and Sweet Sweeper Social Club. His father, Walter, was a political activist, joining the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in the '50s, and helping to organise the Greensboro sit-ins in 1960, protesting racial segregation in Woolworths and spearheading the Civil Rights' sit-in movement. Later, he joined CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], SDS [Students for a Democratic Society], and the PLP [Progressive Labor Party]. Riley himself joined the PLP when he was 14, but left when he was 20, subsequently becoming a prominent member of the Occupy Movement in Oakland, and playing a key role in the 15 October 2011 global protests. The screenplay for _Sorry to Bother You_ was inspired by Riley's time working as a telemarketer, and the necessity of altering his voice so as to hide his ethnicity. The script was completed in 2012, but he had no means to make it. Instead, The Coup recorded an album of the same name, based on the script. Of the album, Riley told _The Chicago Tribune_, it talks\r\n\r\n> _about the same stuff I'm always talking about. Capital and labour; racial inequality; organising the masses against a caste system of privilege; that sort of thing._\r\n\r\nWords which are very applicable to the film. The script was then published in Timothy McSweeney's _Quarterly Concern_ in 2014, and Riley was subsequently invited to the Sundance Institute development labs to hone it further.\r\n\r\nAt its heart, _Sorry to Bother You_ is an anti-corporate, proletarian rally cry, something with which Riley has been engaged for decades; just listen to \"Fat Cats, Bigga Fish\" from _Genocide & Juice_ (1994), \"5 million ways to kill a C.E.O.\" from _Party Music_ (2001), or \"My Favorite Mutiny\" from _Pick a Bigger Weapon_ (2006). In relation to this, Riley tells DemocracyNow,\r\n\r\n> _the Taft-Hartely make it so you can't do solidarity strikes. And the reason why they make it so you can't do solidarity strikes is because they're effective. And so, we need a labour movement that's going to break those laws, because the laws that exist make the current ways of organising unions much harder. So, [the film] is almost also a call out to folks that consider theirself radicals._\r\n\r\nSimilarly, he explains to Hot97,\r\n\r\n> _we need to have movements that can actually shut down industries in order to get what we want._\r\n\r\nHowever, unlike Sam Levinson's recent satire _Assassination Nation_, _Sorry to Bother You_ is not especially interested in politics _per se_, certainly not in the explicit sense of films such as Sergei M. Eisenstein's _Stachka_ (1925), Haskell Wexler's _Medium Cool_ (1969), or Warren Beatty's _Bulworth_ (1998). This is not to say that the film ignores politics completely, rather it approaches the subject obliquely. For example, the country's most popular TV show, _I Got the Shit Kicked Out of Me_, involves people being violently assaulted by family and friends and then dunked in a vat of faeces, with Riley providing little to no contextualisation (think _It's Not My Problem!_ from Paul Verhoeven's _Robocop_ (1987), where Bixby Snyder's (S.D. Nemeth) catchphrase, \"I'd buy that for a dollar\", is used as a one-size-fits-all response to every situation). This mindless consumption of meaningless and morally questionable content indicates the passivity of the masses, their critical faculties either dormant or absent entirely (an inverse _verfremdungseffekt_, if you will). Clips of the show feature prominently throughout the film, allowing Riley to depict a _milieu_ where popular entertainment has reached an unimaginable low. Another example of a pseudo-political aspect of the film are the ubiquitous billboards and TV commercials advertising WorryFree, suggesting the corruption or co-opting of mass media. Additionally, Left Eye clearly recalls Antifa.\r\n\r\nHowever, in relation to the most obvious political target for a film of this ilk, Trump's presidency, Riley has explicitly stated it is not an attack on Trump. Indeed, he wrote the script during the Obama administration, before Trump had even announced his candidacy. To ensure that the audience wouldn't think the film's invective was aimed at Trump, Riley made some changes after the election, such as removing a line where Mr. _______ says, \"_WorryFree is making America great again_\". On this pseudo-prescience, Riley tells the _LA Times_,\r\n\r\n> _there are so many things in this movie that, when I wrote them, hadn't happened yet [...] The reason that these things are becoming more and more clear to us now is because it's connected to our economic system, not just connected to who's in elected office._\r\n\r\nAs this suggests, Riley's focus is very much on economic issues, with a lot of the humour derived from pecuniary-based situations. One of the easiest ways to parse the film is to approach it as a parable about selling out, equal parts polemic and acknowledgement that it's next to impossible _not_ to sell out in some way. Indeed, the last act of the film explicitly deals with the literal dehumanisation of the workforce (and I do mean \"literal\" \u2013 to say any more would be a spoiler). RegalView and WorryFree exist in an economic system built upon impoverishing the many for the benefit of the few, with Riley attempting to expose the importance of a poverty line for the continued functioning of late capitalism. Within such a system, he suggests, it is exceptionally difficult for African Americans to succeed unless they are willing to code-switch. In this sense, although the concept of \"_white voice_\" does have a practical function within the narrative, its most salient characteristic is as an object of allegorical satire, a hyperbolic caricature of what African Americans need to do to survive in the Caucasian bro-culture corporate ranks of Silicon Valley; they must literally relinquish part of the self and pretend to be something Other. Speaking to DemocracyNow, Riley explains,\r\n\r\n> _the new capitalism is \"there is no capitalism here. What are you talking about?\" It's like, this is not a workplace, this is a bean bag room. And I'm not your boss, I'm your friend who tells you what to do.\" And so, as opposed to the oil baron idea, these are the cool people that everyone loves._\r\n\r\nThis is represented most clearly in the film by Steve Lift.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, however, it's not just at RegalView where white voice is necessary; in attempting to woo customers to her art exhibition, Detroit too employs white voice. However, unlike Cash or Mr. _______'s white voices (provided by David Cross and Patton Oswalt, respectively), Detroit's is not only white, it's also British (voiced by Lily James), a distortion not only of her ethnicity, but so too of her nationality. She uses this voice to convince customers to take her art seriously, suggesting that she feels if she spoke in her real voice, they would not do so.\r\n\r\nThe film also delights in fairly subtle and oftentimes semi-obscure intertextuality. For example, a pair of earrings worn by Detroit declares, \"Bury the rag deep in your face\". This is from the Bob Dylan song, \"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carrol\" (1963), which is about a black barmaid who died after being assaulted by the 24-year-old William Zanzinger, from the wealthy Zanzinger tobacco farming family. Zanzinger was initially charged with murder, but this was later reduced to manslaughter and assault. He was found guilty by a three judge panel and sentenced to six months in prison, as well as a fine of $500. Elsewhere in _Sorry to Bother You_, during a piece of performance art in which she encourages the audience to throw mobile phones and balloons filled with lamb's blood at her, Detroit quotes from Michael Schultz's _The Last Dragon_ (1985), a martial arts movie produced by Motown founder Berry Gordy. Another example of intertextuality is that Mr. _______ dresses like King George (Robert DoQui) from Jack Hill's blaxploitation classic _Coffy_ (1973).\r\n\r\nAesthetically, the film adopts a visual style obviously influenced by Michel Gondry, and, to a lesser extent, Terry Gilliam. An especially interesting aesthetic device, as anyone who has seen the trailer can attest, is how white voice is handled \u2013 rather than having the actors simply speak in a different voice, Riley instead has the white actors' voices overdubbed; when Salvador first hears Cash's white voice, he literally tells him \"_you sound overdubbed_\". However, the lip syncing is, presumably intentionally, far from perfect, with the voice not quite aligning with the actors' mouth movements. This throws the scenes \"off\" ever so slightly, creating an extra layer of surreality, and highlighting just how absurd the whole thing is, drawing attention to the lengths these people have to go to achieve real success. The fact that our culture places such value on \"correct\" intonation is, in and of itself, absurd, like an extreme version of the phone voice that pretty much everyone has, and by failing to perfectly sync white voice to black actor, Riley is able to deconstruct and draw attention to this absurdity.\r\n\r\nThe film's other big aesthetic innovation is having Cash plunge (not especially gracefully) into the living room of the people he calls, desk and all. Obviously, this draws attention to the level of intrusion with which most people greet telemarketers, but, at least in the early stages, it also highlights Cash's own discomfit at being the intruder, seen most clearly when he drops in on a couple having sex. This is an excellently-handled piece of visual shorthand, conveying Cash's internal process, without having him verbalise it at any point.\r\n\r\nAlso impressive is the acting. While the standout performances are definitely Hammer and Hardwick, Stanfield certainly holds his own, with his body-language providing a clinic of wordless performing. Early on in the film, he's hunched over and put-upon, his every movement seemingly uncomfortable, as if ill at ease in his own skin. Later on, however, after his promotion at RegalView, his physicality acquires a more easy nature, he carries himself more confidently, as if high-powered telemarketing has helped him to find himself, something which is, in the context of the whole, doubly ironic. And no matter how surreal things get (and trust me, they get very, _very_ surreal), the cast keep everything grounded, as if what they're experiencing at any given moment is the most natural thing in the world.\r\n\r\nOf course, it isn't all perfect. The wildly unexpected plot twist at the end of the second act will be too much for some people (there were multiple walk-outs at the screening I attended). The film is also just a beat or two too long, and the bottom does fall out to an extent before it reaches its madcap _d\u00e9nouement_. There's also a mid-credit scene that serves as a kind of epilogue that I'm led to believe was a re-shoot when test audiences found the initial ending too abrupt. For me, however, it doesn't entirely work, and I would have much preferred the original, somewhat darker, ending. Also, with so much satire and humour floating about, almost by definition, not every joke lands, However, the flip side to this is that when Riley's humour does hit the target, it's sublime \u2013 Mr. _______ literally beep-denied a name, for example, or Cash's two-word rap being gleefully cheered by Lift's assembled yuppies.\r\n\r\n_Sorry to Bother You_ is as timely and relevant as it is funny and irreverent, as progressive as it is radical, and as inventive as it is confident. Exploring the intersection between race and economics from a wholly satirical point-of-view, the film both condemns and sympathises with those who choose to sell-out in some way so as to climb the ladder of success. Now in his late-40s, Riley is a veteran political protestor, a Chomsky-literate agitator, who is here positing that the most significant divide in the US isn't between white and black, it's between those with money and those without. Suggesting that the desire to cross this divide can lead to a herd mentality, the film argues that the labour force must never forget their collective strength, and must never turn on one another, as in such a situation, management will use workers like horses. A hugely impressive debut, and it will be interesting to see what Riley tackles next.","id":"5d1bdd614dc34a000fa06872","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d1bdd614dc34a000fa06872","movie_id":424781}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Let me give you some advice. Assume everyone will betray you. And you will never be disappointed.\r\n\r\nSo the latest in what is becoming a long running sci-fi franchise sees Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich) get his prequel movie. Unsurprisingly, such is the ferocious core fan base of the Star Wars series, it has been met with a mixture of outright hatred to pats on the back appreciation. It really is a case here of jumping in to view it on its own terms to at least give it a chance. The truth is, is that if this was a stand alone movie being judged purely as a science fiction action movie, then it would be better appreciated. For this is cracker jack entertainment in that sphere, with superbly constructed worlds inhabited by delirious looking aliens species, feisty droids hold court, and the humans are daring, cheeky and even sexy. It is in short quality and fantastical sci-fi, even if in truth as per the Solo character trajectory it's safe film making.\r\n\r\nWe, as in the royal Star Wars fans we, all have our card carrying belief that our opinion on any Star Wars film is correct, but really the only advice I can honestly give here is that if you haven't seen it yet then at least give it a chance. Those that have seen it have their minds made up either way, so personally I can only say how much fun I had watching it - twice! All the dots are joined towards the Solo character I love so dear, from back when with childhood eyes in the late 70s I was transfixed on that big screen. How great to see how Han met Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and how their brilliant friendship begins.

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Great style, precious little substance_**\r\n\r\n> _In most movies like this, these sort of psycho, sexual thrillers, the female character is there to be a damsel in distress, there to be naked or there to be killed in a really brutal way. This movie sets up, here's a guy who wants to kill a prostitute, so you think the movie is getting to deliver all those things, but it so doesn't. The beauty of Mia's character is that she doesn't let herself be any of those tropes, she doesn't let herself be a damsel in distress, get killed, be taken advantage of; she really is the one with all the power and_ _the one that's playing on the mind games._\r\n\r\n- Nicholas Pesce; \"Nicolas Pesce on His Film Adaptation of Murakami Ryu's _Piercing_\" (Eric Ortez Garcia); _Screen Anarchy_ (October 2, 2018)\r\n\r\nFrom Nicholas Pesce, the writer and director of _The Eyes of My Mother_ (2016), and based on the 1994 novel by Ry\u00fb Murakami (who also wrote the novel upon which Takashi Miike's similarly themed _\u00d4dishon_ (1999) was based), _Piercing_ is a darkly comic psychosexual thriller. Partly a screwball comedy about a fastidious man's attempt to murder a prostitute, and his confusion and helplessness when he realises that that prostitute is far more disturbed than he is, the film dares the audience to attempt to figure out who is in charge at any given moment, and to ponder whether one (or both) of these characters would actually be quite happy to be the other's victim. Purposely made to look like a sleazy seventies skin flick (the kind you might expect to see being shot on _The Deuce_), the film's sense of nostalgia drips off the screen, manifest in everything from the music borrowed from giallo films to the art-deco production design to the patently fake urban skyline to the lurid opening credits (complete with retro \"Feature Presentation\" card). In this sense, Pesce is a stylist, in the best sense of the term. However, at the moment, he is a stylist without much to say; as in _The Eyes of My Mother_, he is unable to match his not-inconsiderable aesthetic acumen with any kind of significant or tangible emotionality. The two leads are not necessarily the type of characters we're naturally predisposed to feel empathetic towards, but we surely must be expected to feel **something**. Anything. However, with no real sense of psychological verisimilitude nor much in the way of interiority, they remain essentially blank canvases, and primarily for this reason, the film feels more like a sketch than a finished product.\r\n\r\nSet in a non-specific city, the barely-there plot concerns Reed (Christopher Abbott), the clean-cut kind of psychopath about whom the neighbours would undoubtedly say, \"he was always such a nice quiet young man.\" Reed has been having some less-than-wholesome thoughts about his new-born baby, and as the film begins, he's standing over the baby's cot, ice-pick in hand, trying to resist the urge to kill the infant. Only when his partner, Mona (Laia Costa), awakens and calls out to him, does Reed regain his faculties. He then explains, in voice-over, his plan to entrap a prostitute in a hotel room, and murder and dismember her, thus purging himself of the desire to kill his own child. Telling Mona he is going on a business trip, Reed checks into a hotel and books a prostitute who is open to S&M (this way he'll be able to tie her up without her becoming suspicious). Planning every aspect of the murder, he rehearses everything from how long the chloroform will leave her unconscious to how best to carry her to the bathroom to begin the dismemberment, and records every detail in a small book. However, when the prostitute arrives, things go down-hill fast, as Jackie (a superb turn from Mia Wasikowska) is far from completely sane herself. Immediately beginning to masturbate, she throws Reed off his game-plan, causing him to laugh nervously. Seemingly annoyed, she retreats to the bathroom, and refuses to come out. After knocking repeatedly on the door to no avail, Reed, who is still hopeful of being able to salvage the evening's homicide, opens the door and walks in on her. Then things get very weird.\r\n\r\nPartly a film about coming to terms with desires deemed fetishistic by society, and partly an erotic thriller about two people who seem genuinely confused as to whether they're teammates or opponents, the film's most salient theme is, perhaps, the issue of sexual consent, and how easily muddled it can become. It's a brave theme to take on in this post #MeToo era, with the film daring to ask whether consent should still be applicable if a person has consented to something harmful to their person, even up to the point of consensual homicide. Although there's no cannibalism in the film, the storyline reminded me a little of the 2001 case of Armin Meiwes. Looking for a volunteer to eat, Meiwes posted an online ad, \"_for a well-built 18- to 30-year-old to be slaughtered and then consumed_.\" The ad was answered by Bernd J\u00fcrgen Brandes, who went to Meiwes's home, where the two made a four-hour video which depicted Meiwes killing Brandes with Brandes's complete consent, and eating parts of him. Initially sentenced to eight years in prison for manslaughter, Meiwes was re-tried in 2005, after a German court argued he had killed for sexual gratification. Meiwes claimed he had only killed Brandes because Brandes asked him to do so, and sexuality had nothing to do with it, but in 2006, he was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. The film doesn't deal with the case explicitly, but the shifting sexual power-play between Reed and Jackie, and the fact that at least twice, one of them believes they've been granted permission to murder the other, raises similar moral issues.\r\n\r\nWithin the parameters of this theme, one of the most obvious aspects of the film is its sense of humour, with many of the laughs coming from how utterly anal Reed is. Half Patrick Bateman, half Frank Spencer, once an unpredictable human element is introduced into his scheme, he finds himself unable to think on-the-fly. As his meticulously laid plans go up in smoke, he proves comically inept at handling any kind of interpersonal relationship (one wonders how he ever wooed Mona). However, the fact that most of the comedy lands on his shoulders throws into relief perhaps the film's most egregious problem; although a good 90% of the narrative is told from his perspective, there's precious little to his personality. Granted, a couple of final-act flashbacks fill us in on why he is so obsessed with murder, but his character simply isn't capable of filling out the film's 81 minutes. And there's less character detail on Jackie than there is on Reed. And there's even less character detail on Mona than there is on Jackie. Despite this, Wasikowska gives a superb performance, all facial tics, unspoken volatility, and nervous mannerisms, with an almost balletic way of moving. The actress is able to find far more psychological nuance in the character than is ever hinted at in the script.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with Murakami's novel, but I gather that much of the character background that is noticeable by its absence from the film is very much present in the book. According to a colleague of mine, the novel's main focus is the psychology of the two leads (in the novel, Reed's character is Kawashima Masayuki, and Jackie's is Sanada Chiaki), exploring the ways in which childhood trauma lingers into adulthood, manifesting itself in unexpected and exceptionally destructive ways. This aspect has been all but stripped away from the film (apart from the brief aforementioned flashbacks). I'm also told the dark comedy aspect is relatively unique to the film, with the novel working more like a tragedy. In this sense, Pesce seems to have made a conscious choice to trim the book's character beats back to their barest elements, replacing the psychological verisimilitude with a self-depreciative sense of humour and ultimately pointless kinky power-play. Indeed, speaking to Indiewire, Pesce states,\r\n\r\n>_the script probably started out darker than the movie became, but I think through the process of making the movie, we saw what kind of wackiness there was potential for. Particularly in a lot of Japanese literature, there is this awesome sense of humour about the darkest stuff. And while it works differently in a book than it does in a movie, I think through the course of making it, we found how playful it was._\r\n\r\nThe problem for me is that nothing in the film really lingers \u2013 and when some of the imagery is this extreme, it should definitely linger. For example, I've never been able to completely forget my first viewing of _\u00d4dishon_ \u2013 not because of the violence per se, but because the film spends so long building up the character of Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi), so that when those needles and that wire saw come out, you absolutely feel the weight of what is about to happen. In _Piercing_, I don't really think there's any depravity that Reed and Jackie could have inflicted on one another than would have provoked an emotional response, because I didn't know them, and therefore was unable to care about them, as people.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, however, there's a great deal to praise here, with the sound design particularly inventive. During Reed's rehearsal of the murder, he goes through the entire act, from the initial drugging to the dismemberment. On screen, we see him pantomime the actions, but on the soundtrack, we hear the disturbing foley of everything \u2013 so as he's miming sawing, we hear a saw cut through flesh and bone. It's a brilliant way to place us firmly within his subjective experience, and it also serves to remind us that the innocent looking Reed is very much planning to do real harm to someone. On a similar note, the music is absolutely top notch. Eschewing an original score, the film instead employs pre-existing tracks primarily from giallo films, including Goblin's scores for Dario Argento's _Profondo rosso_ (1975) and _Tenebre_ (1982), and Bruno Nicolai's score for Emilio Miraglia's _La dama rossa uccide sette volte_ (1972).\r\n\r\nThe visual aesthetic is oftentimes as impressive as the aural. Exteriors (of which there are very few beyond the opening and closing credits) are obviously miniatures, with very little effort to make them look photorealistic. This sets an otherworldly tone right from the start, as if the film is taking place in a slightly alternate reality, as the real and the fake mix together in Reed's confused mind. Interiors are blank, as if they are show-houses, not actually inhabited by a flesh and blood person \u2013 one shot, for example, shows a drink's cabinet where the bottles have no brands, just the name of the alcohol. Again, this sets the film's reality apart, as if everything is happening just outside our own world, or our own conception of the world. There are also a couple of nods to the master of body horror, David Cronenberg \u2013 a stomach wound pulses and expands as if breathing, a gigantic beetle crawls out of a toilet and infects a character's face, scissor wounds are curiously fingered, a character's ear is split open with a tin opener. It's all very Disney!\r\n\r\nUltimately, however, _Piercing_ is more interested in aesthetics than exploring the psychology of the characters. The increasingly extreme goings-on are never anything more than a jokey end unto themselves, with the psychological path that has led the characters to these extremities relatively ignored. With Pesce focused on comedy beats, there are certainly a few laughs, but there's precious little substance. He's undoubtedly adept at evoking the most absurdly grotesque comedy, but he is, thus far in his career, equally as uninterested in developing character or plot. And for that reason, the film comes across more like a calling-card than a self-sustained and complete product.","id":"5d043f000e0a260eddc993a6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d043f000e0a260eddc993a6","movie_id":440444}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Powerful filmmaking, although the graphic sex scenes and passive protagonist won't be for everyone_**\r\n\r\n> _L\u00e9o has no moral judgement: he is just there. That's his life. He doesn't even know what \"get out of it\" means; get out of what, to go where?_\r\n\r\n- Camille Vidal-Naquet; _Sauvage_ Production Notes\r\n\r\n_Sauvage_ [trans. _Wild_, although a lot of reviewers are incorrectly calling it _Savage_] is the debut film of writer\/director Camille Vidal-Naquet, a former professor of film studies, and takes as its subject the daily grind of a male prostitute. Depictions of prostitution in cinema have something of a chequered history; the best known are probably Luis Bu\u00f1uel's _Belle de Jour_ (1967), which is more interested in female sexual desire than the specifics of prostitution itself, Garry Marshall's _Pretty Woman_ (1990), and Woody Allen's _Mighty Aphrodite_ (1995), both of which are fantastical and utterly divorced from reality. Thus far, it has been the province of smaller films to look at sex workers with anything approaching realism - Keren Yedaya's _Or (My Treasure)_ (2005), Megan Griffiths's _Eden_ (2013), David Pablos's _Las elegidas_ (2015), and, especially, the seismic gut punch that is Lukas Moodysson's _Lilja 4-Ever_ (2002), which is more about sex slavery, but which does deal with the reality of prostitution.\r\n\r\nIn _Sauvage_, Vidal-Naquet strikes a delicate balance between misery porn and objectively delineating the day-to-day of being a sex worker (a balance not found in _Lilja 4-ever_). The film is undeniably bleak, but it's not what you would define as miserablism. Remaining detached from what it depicts, it adopts a clinically dispassionate approach, one that remains always non-judgemental. Intermixing the degrading reality of selling one's self with unexpected moments of tenderness and warmth, Vidal-Naquet taps into something deeply compelling. Some will be put off by the (very) graphic sex scenes, the passivity of the main character, or the lack of much of a plot. However, for everyone else, although it certainly isn't multiplex fare, there's a hell of a lot to admire here.\r\n\r\nSet in Strasbourg, _Sauvage_ tells the story of L\u00e9o (an extraordinarily committed performance from relative newcomer F\u00e9lix Maritaud), a homeless, drug-addicted male prostitute, whose name, like those of his fellow sex workers, is never spoken in the film (the names come from the press kit). Surviving mainly by drinking from gutters and eating what he can steal and what he can find in bins, as the film begins, L\u00e9o is attending a doctor (Lionel Riou), revealing bruises, a split lip, a nasty cough, and stomach pains. Upon examining him, the doctor appears to begin sexually molesting him. However, all is not as it seems in the scene, which is a genius way to open the movie. It soon becomes clear that L\u00e9o is a little different from his fellow prostitutes; he's laidback, he seems to enjoy sleeping under the stars, he has no great desire to pursue a better life, he kisses his clients when he feels like it (unlike the others, who all have a no kissing rule), and he treats each sexual encounter as a moment of physical and psychological intimacy, rather than simply a monetary transaction. The episodic narrative follows L\u00e9o from one sexual encounter to the next, occasionally focusing on his relationship with gay-for-pay prostitute Ahd (\u00c9ric Bernard), with whom he is in love. Within this general framework, we see a wheelchair-bound man (Lucas Bl\u00e9ger) who can only get an erection when he pays for sex; an elderly book-seller (Jean-Pierre Bast\u00e9), who simply wants L\u00e9o to read to him, and who, upon finding out L\u00e9o can't read, is content for them to lie in bed holding one another; a heavily pierced couple (Nicholas Fernandez and Nicholas Chalumeau) who treat L\u00e9o like a piece of meat; a kindly fellow prostitute, Mihal (Nicholas Dibla), who seems romantically interested in L\u00e9o; a notoriously sadistic client known as \"The Pianist\" (Jean-Fran\u00e7ois-Charles Martin) about whom Ahd warns L\u00e9o; and a respectable middle-aged man, Claude (Philippe Ohrel), who has never had a homosexual experience. A truly beautiful scene occurs when L\u00e9o attends a female doctor (Marie Seux); treating him with respect and empathy, when she attempts to examine him, he hugs her, and they hold each other for a moment, in an embrace that has nothing to do with sexuality and everything to do with kindness and emotional support. It's a devastatingly tender moment, flawlessly written, shot, and acted.\r\n\r\nIn preparation for making the film, Vidal-Naquet joined an outreach charity as a way to meet young male prostitutes at the Bois de Boulogne (a well-known location for prostitution in Paris). Intending to go on only a few runs over the course of a couple of weeks, he ended up spending three years visiting the spot, and formed strong friendships with several of the men, all the while refining the script to make it as true to life as possible (all of L\u00e9o's sexual encounters in the film come from stories told to him by the actual sex workers). In writing the character of L\u00e9o, Vidal-Naquet was influenced by Agn\u00e8s Varda's _Sans toit ni loi_ (1985), in which Sandrine Bonnaire plays a young homeless woman without a past, and Stuart Rosenberg's _Cool Hand Luke_ (1967), in which Paul Newman plays a character who never loses hope despite enduring great hardships, and whose optimism proves to be his most resilient characteristic. He also had Maritaud watch films such as Amos Kollek's _Sue Lost in Manhattan_ (1998) and Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne's _Rosetta_ (1999). For the graphic sex scenes, Vidal-Naquet took inspiration from Paul Verhoeven's _Turks fruit_ (1973) and, bizarrely, _Showgirls_ (1995), explaining,\r\n\r\n> _I have always been impressed with the way Verhoeven directed his actors and managed to convey that sense of shamelessness and automatic freedom of the body._\r\n\r\nVidal-Naquet describes L\u00e9o as\r\n\r\n> _a solitary young man who hits the road and wanders from one encounter to the next, longing for love, driven by an unquenchable capacity for love that keeps him going, regardless of the violent world around him._\r\n\r\nThe film reveals nothing about L\u00e9o's background - where he comes from, how he became a prostitute, does he have any family - and many of the choices he makes prompt more questions than answers, with much of what he does tied to his notions of personal freedom. Even his final choice, which is undeniably selfish and ill-advised, is consistent with the psychology of the character as seen up to that point. He isn't especially interested in a life away from drugs and prostitution, and so he takes the violence, degradations, and humiliations, because every now and then he meets someone who provides him with a degree of transitory happiness. And that is his primary concern, rather than the practicalities about which his colleagues worry; when asked by the female doctor if he wants to quit drugs, he replies, \"_what for?_\", and when Mihal offers him a mobile phone, he seems genuinely bemused, asking, \"_who would I call?_\" Even his attitude to hygiene is questionable - we never once see him taking a shower, his clothes are perpetually filthy, he drinks from gutters and eats from bins, he has a litany of physical ailments, and on two occasions, other characters comment that he smells bad. Even the money he earns from selling himself doesn't seem to be especially important, as he appears to use it primarily for tattoos and drugs.\r\n\r\nL\u00e9o doesn't share in the detachment, coldness, or bitterness of his fellow prostitutes, all of whom find it bizarre that he's willing to kiss clients, and several of whom find it unprofessional. However, the important point is that L\u00e9o doesn't kiss on-demand, he does so only when it feels right. This in and of itself illustrates how different he is from the other prostitutes, and how selling himself is not exclusively monetary - he is searching for genuine affection, and he seems incapable of establishing the same boundaries between himself and his clients as the other sex workers live by. He gives much more of himself than them, in the hopes of establishing a genuine human connection with someone. Indeed, Ahd says at one point, \"_it's like you enjoy being a whore_\", which he doesn't deny.\r\n\r\nHis fellow prostitutes are healthier, cleaner, more financially independent, more aware of the dangers of their occupation, never allowing emotions to become involved. But L\u00e9o is far more tender than any of them, and for all the harshness of his life, there is something Emersonian about him. Indeed, for much of the film, he has a pseudo- transcendentalist soul - he is relatively free of the norms of society and its institutions; he is at peace in and with nature; he lives very much in the moment; he has almost no materialist needs whatsoever; he trusts completely in his own instincts, he never lets go of his hope of finding love. Ahd advises him to \"_find yourself an old man. A nice one. It's the best that can happen to us_\", and Ahd himself has a semi-regular wealthy sugar daddy (Jo\u00ebl Villy) who wants to make their arrangement permanent. L\u00e9o, however, wants more than that. This is why the scene with the female doctor is so beautiful and so heartbreaking - when she treats him with respect and shows genuine concern for his wellbeing, he instinctively grabs at the human connection, irrespective of her gender (she's actually the only female in the film). That she allows him to hold her speaks volumes for her understanding of who he is, and the scene is perhaps the one where L\u00e9o is most clearly laid bare.\r\n\r\nObviously, for a film of this nature to be in any way realistic, it must depict sexuality, and Vidal-Naquet doesn't hold back on that front. At the screening I attended, five people walked out within the first half-hour, by which time there had already been three graphic sex scenes (including a threesome with two prostitutes and a disabled man in a wheelchair). What's interesting about these scenes, however, is that they never lose their potency, irrespective of how many we see. I think the reason for this is how Vidal-Naquet presents them; far from filming them in a voyeuristic way or as titillation, they are instead presented dispassionately as something that happens to people in this line of work, as normal for L\u00e9o as taking drugs or sleeping rough - it's simply a part of his life.\r\n\r\nCinematographer Jacques Girault employs a pseudo-documentarian _cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9_ aesthetic; the entire film is shot handheld, with an occasional loss of focus, frequent awkward compositions, and even losing the subject momentarily in the frame before picking him up again. This has the effect of neither demonising sexuality as something perverted and dirty, nor valorising it as the most important part of a relationship. By depicting it as simply a part of L\u00e9o's life, Vidal-Naquet normalises it, not just in terms of it being sexual activity, but also in terms of it being homosexual and in terms of it being sex work. He certainly doesn't gloss over the problems of this kind of life, or the sexual perversions one may encounter (represented by L\u00e9o's experiences with the pierced couple and The Pianist), but he doesn't present sex work as, in and of itself, fundamentally immoral.\r\n\r\nInstead, he depicts both sides of the coin; the physical non-sexual intimacy with the elderly bookseller who simply wants someone to read to him and the demeaning threesome with the pierced couple who have L\u00e9o stand naked in front of them as they discuss how bad he smells, before roughly using a sex toy that would make even the ladies of LegalPorno.com winch. Indeed, Vidal-Naquet gets his point across about the highs and lows of sex work with a very simple edit - the film cuts from L\u00e9o lying peacefully in bed with the bookseller to giving a rough blowjob to a client in a car parked in an alley.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, as already stated, many will find the graphic sex scenes too much. Another issue is that L\u00e9o is an extremely passive character; he doesn't so much drive the plot as the plot depicts things that happen to him. Coupled with this, he doesn't have much of an arc, and at the end, he isn't overly different from the man we met at the beginning. With him being in every scene, almost every shot, the other prostitutes are very thinly sketched (even Ahd and Mihal), but this is by design. On the other hand, the depiction of Claude, the magnanimous and kindly middle-aged man who takes a liking to L\u00e9o and immediately opens his home to him, is open to criticism; in a film founded on realism, he is something of a _deus ex-machina_, arriving in L\u00e9o's life just as he reaches his lowest point.\r\n\r\nOn paper, _Sauvage_ should be a textbook case of misery porn, following as it does a homeless drug-addicted male prostitute and his often demeaning sexual encounters. However, Vidal-Naquet's non-judgemental depiction of L\u00e9o's occupation and _milieu_ allows the more optimistic elements of his personality to rise to the surface, even in the face of seemingly endless degradations. It's certainly not an easy watch, but amidst the depravity, Vidal-Naquet finds moments of tenderness (the bookseller, the female doctor, Mihal, Claude), moments which mean everything to L\u00e9o. Uninterested in titillation, the film depicts sexual activity as something that happens, without judgement or commentary. And by so doing, it avoids, for the most part, the clich\u00e9s so inherent to films dealing with prostitution. Neither condemning L\u00e9o's lifestyle nor valorising it, no matter how demeaning or brutal it becomes, he always seems to find a way to keep going. That may be interpreted as tragic, but that's not the way L\u00e9o looks at himself, nor is it the way Vidal-Naquet wants us to look at him.","id":"5d4232f4d8cc4a001333b595","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d4232f4d8cc4a001333b595","movie_id":518496}

Somehow, no other_ _rhythms in reggae seemed to swing as perfectly as a Studio One rhythm._\r\n\r\n- Victor Headley; _Yardie_ (1992)\r\n\r\n_Yardie_ is the directorial debut of Idris Elba, and is about as pedestrian a film as you're likely to see all year; a listless gangland-based drama composed of a litany of gangster-film clich\u00e9s. There are a couple of elements worth praising, and it's competently directed, but by and large, it's extremely shallow, containing nothing you haven't seen in half a dozen other films. I wish it wasn't so; I'm a big Elba fan (who isn't), but, let's face it, a lot of his post-Stringer Bell acting work has been poor, to say the least \u2013 Guy Ritchie's _RockNRolla_ (2008), David S. Goyer's _The Unborn_ (2009), Ridley Scott's _Prometheus_ (2012), Sam Miller's _No Good Deed_ (2014), James Watkins's _Bastille Day_ (2016), Nikolaj Arcel's _The Dark Tower_ (2017); hardly an impressive CV. Still though, for his first film in the director's chair, I was hopeful he might chose a project with a little more care than he seems to be choosing his acting roles. And whilst he certainly seems to have settled on something personal, a story with whose _milieu_ he is already familiar, the film is populated by generic characters, themes, and narrative beats; at best, it's fitfully interesting, at worst, it doesn't work at all, plodding along at its own imprecise pace, getting nowhere fast. And then it ends.\r\n\r\nBased on Victor Headley's 1992 novel of the same name, and adapted for the screen by Headley, Brock Norman Brock (_Bronson_) and Martin Stellman (_Quadrophenia_; _The Interpreter_), the film begins in Kingston, Jamaica in 1973, a town in the midst of a bloody gang-war. Sick of the violence, local man Jerry Dread (Everaldo Creary) decides to stage an impromptu block-party in the no man's land between each gang's territory (_d\u00e9tente_ by reggae, if you will). All is going well, with Jerry even coaxing the two rival kingpins up on stage to shake hands. However, a youth in the crowd shoots Jerry dead, leaving his kid brother, D, distraught. At the subsequent Nine-Nights, D refuses to bless Jerry's journey into the afterlife, which tradition says will prevent the spirit from being able to move on, and sure enough, shortly thereafter, D begins to imagine he is being watched by Jerry's ghost. Ten years later, D (Aml Ameen) has worked his way up the ranks of music producer\/drug lord King Fox (Sheldon Shepherd), who was also one of the men onstage when Jerry was killed. However, Fox regards D as too much of a \"_mad dog_\", and so packs him off to Hackney, London, with a kilo of coke to be delivered to Fox's London connection, Rico (Stephen Graham). D is only too happy to go, as his childhood sweetheart, Yvonne (Shantol Jackson) relocated to London several years earlier with their daughter, and they've been estranged ever since. However, upon meeting Rico, he and D rub each other up the wrong way, and D flees with the cocaine, later teaming up with a sound clash crew who know a Turk willing to sell D's drugs. Meanwhile, D attempts to reconnect with Yvonne and his daughter, learns Jerry's killer may be in London, and is unhappy to learn Fox is coming to the city to sort out the situation between D and Rico personally.\r\n\r\nThe term \"yardie\" has something of a double meaning; within the Jamaican diaspora, it tends to describe those who were actually born in Jamaica. However, outside the Caribbean, it tends to refer to organised Jamaican gangs operating on foreign soil, especially the UK. Coming from the Patois \"yard\", which can mean \"home\", the term carries both a hint of condemnation aimed at the crime gangs who swear they love their country whilst shaming it with their actions, but also a sense of national pride, a desire to establish a connective tissue with the motherland. And it's in relation to nationality and ethnic identity that _Yardie_ is at its strongest \u2013 the film does a truly excellent job of evoking not only a time and place, but a whole subculture.\r\n\r\nPretty much everything looks completely authentic, almost documentarian (it probably helps that Elba himself was born in Hackney, later working as a DJ, whilst most of the cast are either Jamaican or of Jamaican lineage. Even Stephen Graham's paternal grandfather was Jamaican). Similarly, the soundtrack isn't simply representative of monolithic 70s\/80s, but actually gives the film its rhythm, with Elba choosing songs of great cultural significance \u2013 tracks such as Lord Creator's \"Kingston Town\" (1970), The Isley Brothers' \"Work to Do\" (1972), Max Romeo & The Upsetters' \"War Ina Babylon\" (1976), Skip Marley's 2018 cover of his grandfather's \"Johnny Was\" (1976), Black Uhura's \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" (1979), and Grace Jones's \"My Jamaican Guy\" (1983). Speaking to the _Hollywood Reporter_ at Sundance, Elba says of the soundtrack,\r\n\r\n> _the music carries a message, and also gives a vibe. Especially in the 80s in London, we revisit the club scene there, and it was really important to me, because that's where I discovered myself as a DJ, it was really important to me that the audience feel like they have just left the club in those scenes._\r\n\r\nThis sense of authenticity is carried into an aspect of the film with which I'm sure a lot of people will have problems \u2013 the dialogue is delivered entirely in heavy Pathois, without any subtitles. Personally, I think this is an admirable decision; nothing takes you out of a film quicker than English subtitles for spoken English (I'm thinking of something like Neil Blomkamp's _Chappie_). And although there is no doubt that it's hard to understand some of what is said, and a few of the character beats are probably lost as a result, David Ehrlich's ludicrous assertion that \"_40% of the movie is unintelligible_\" in his damning _IndieWire_ review is absolute rubbish. He criticises the film for being \"_needlessly difficult_\" due to the lack of subtitles, apparently not considering that this is genuinely the accent with which these people speak, and we're quick to judge films that mangle dialects. It's really no different from seeing an English Renaissance play or reading Chaucer \u2013 once you acclimate yourself to it, there shouldn't be any major problems. According to Elba,\r\n\r\n> _I was super aware I was asking an audience that aren't familiar with the accent to really listen. But what's come from that is that people feel like they've just taken a real authentic journey into a place they didn't know too much about._\r\n\r\nIt's not just the aural design that is excellent \u2013 the visual tapestry really evokes place and culture too, as Elba does a fine job of indoctrinating the viewer into the cadences of the culture, capturing the period details of early 1980s Hackney with the eye of someone who lived there. This aspect of authenticity is matched in the props; according to production designer Damien Creagh almost nothing was custom made for the film, with the vast majority of props being working examples of the period. Of this sense of visual authenticity, speaking to _IndieWire_, Elba states,\r\n\r\n> _The main thing that I spoke to the entire cast about was authenticity, everyone from the lead down to the last extra. Authenticity of thought; my thing was always say, \"don't lie to the camera, be honest in the moment. If you're not feeling it, don't do it, because it will come across as a lie, and fake\"._\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, \"the film does a truly excellent job of evoking not only a time and place, but a whole subculture\" is about the only praise I can give, because the rest of the film is extremely poor. Where to begin? Firstly, we've seen this film before, dozens of times \u2013 the gangster with a heart of gold wrestling with his loyalty and his desire to go straight, with only the love of a good woman to help guide him \u2013 and there's not an original character in the mix, with every single one of the principal cast (with the possible exception of Rico) coming across like they've been assembled from a \"make your own\" movie clich\u00e9s modelling kit. The directionless plot also displays no real sense of dramatic intent, jumping from one thing to the next, often with little causality linking the two; it's more a collection of tentatively related scenes than a coherent narrative.\r\n\r\nThe use of voiceover is also troubling. Highly didactic and explanatory, it says nothing that can't be gleaned by simply watching the film. Voiceovers giving beat-by-beat summaries of a narrative (think the original cut of Ridley Scott's _Blade Runner_) are always a bad idea. The only style of voiceovers that work are the more esoteric kind used by Terrence Malick, or ones which set up a direct contrast with what we're seeing. This is neither.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, simply put, that the narrative is so much weaker than the milieu containing it. Certainly not a problem exclusive to this film (if you've seen anything Ridley Scott has done post-_Gladiator_ (2000), you're already familiar with this issue), but it's especially pronounced here because a) the narrative is so derivative, and b) the milieu is so strongly evoked. The film is too enamoured with the tropes of the gangster movie to work as a genre subversion, nor is it pulpy enough to be enjoyed for its excess, \u00e0 la something like Brian De Palma's _Scarface_ (1983) or Peter Medak's _Romeo is Bleeding_ (1993). It occupies this inoffensive, vanilla middle ground, not really doing a huge amount wrong, but not really doing a huge amount right either.","id":"5ce070f1c3a36823c51f98d4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ce070f1c3a36823c51f98d4","movie_id":420915}

Therefore its all of it and none at the same time. \r\n\r\nThe goofy jokes are pretty lame, which is why they are funny, you dont laugh with the writers, you laugh at them. \r\n\r\nThe action scenes are meh at best, \r\ncar chase : check\r\nmotorcycle : check\r\nridiculous (bad) cgi fight: check\r\nsure, watching Tom Hardy motorcross in San Francisco is quite fun, but its not really action. \r\n\r\nFinally, the horror; there are glimpses, glimmers of hope scattered around this movie. Little snippets of what could have been, but as soon as they appear they disappear. \r\n\r\nTwo scenes really stood out to me due to their potential. After quite a lot of buildup of Venom getting into the building (BY RUNNING UP IT), Eddie decides to take the lift down. Instead of having Eddie walk into the SWAT team, they should have been swarming the building crawling through the floors looking for him. Then, they could have had an ALIEN like hunting scene where Venom slowly takes out the task force one by one, in true horror movie fashion. \r\n\r\nThe other obvious horror scene could have been using the creepy little girl that delivers RIOT to the Musk wannabe, they could have homaged The Shining, they could have pulled an exorcist, they could have done a million things, but the little girl just has white pupils and a deep voice.\r\n\r\nThroughout the movie there are just continuous disappointments because you see what it is missing. \r\n\r\nInstead of the cheap love story and all the stupid overdone things they should have been ballsy with their movie. Yes the movie DID make 800+ million, however im sure it was going to do that anyway. Venom is probably one of the most badass characters in comic history, and Tom Hardy is Tom Hardy. \r\n\r\nI would have loved to see something along these lines:\r\n\r\nSymbiote hunts Eddie. \r\nSymbiote captures Eddie and they become Venom.\r\nVenom starts unleashing hell because he can, hunts SWAT etc. \r\nVenom goes after Musk wannabe and Kills him.\r\n\r\nThrow some more horror elements in there, and it would have made for a much more satisfactory watch. I have always adored Venom, and this movie had so much potential, but it was all for nothing. No rewatchability. Nothing worth remembering. Just a flick.\r\n\r\nIt was funny seeing Tom Hardy being a bit of a pussball, but even he cant help a crap script and an even worse film.","id":"5c4286b8925141214e0ab461","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c4286b8925141214e0ab461","movie_id":335983}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"It\u2019s school holidays here in France which means the kids are at my place which in turn means lot\u2019s of time in front of the screen. Last night it was Venom\u2019s turn to be plopped into my Blu-ray player.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I was a little disappointed. Sure it is a good movie and I did indeed enjoy it but not as much as I thought I would. According to the ratings it looked like the majority of the audience liked it a lot and I do like the character Venom. Sure the culture elite and politically correct idiots that Rotten Tomates use as \u201ccritics\u201d claimed it to be rotten but, for me, that\u2019s usually a good sign when it comes to my entertainment value from a movie.\r\n\r\nThe good things are that I found Venom, the creature, really cool. I liked his voice, his appearance and his no-nonsense attitude. The special effects and the action was very enjoyable to watch. Luckily that was my main reason for watching the movie. Actually, it is probably the main reason I want to watch any Marvel movie, especially lately given the poor quality of writers that Marvel has employed.\r\n\r\nI guess it is a plus as well that there was not too much politically correct, green or social preaching in it. I am sure those so inclined can find more than me if they go looking for it but most of the movie audience, at least not for this type of movie, probably could not care less.\r\n\r\nThe main reason I felt somewhat disappointed is that the main protagonist is really not someone I could feel like I would root for. He is such a despicable douche-bag. For starters he is a low life journalist with an overblown ego and disrespect of pretty much everything. The kind CNN would employ. Even when he\u2019s been infected by Venom he continues between being a worthless egoistic coward and just an asshole. Actually the only real difference between the him and the big bad guy is that the bad guy is a hundred times more intelligent. It\u2019s not until the very end scenes that Eddie develops a minimum of likability.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Venom is really the star of the movie. Both as a \u201cthing\u201d and as a character. He is a real bad-ass, quite funny and really everything that Eddie should have been as a character. He even develops more as a character than previously mentioned douche-bag.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a shame since otherwise this would have been a great movie. The story is simple but works well for this kind of movie. There are no silly twists and convoluted sub-plots. The main protagonist, as poor as he is, at least do not carry a lot of past history trying to explain God knows what and such stuff.\r\n\r\nIf the character of the main protagonist would have been more likable this would have been a great movie. Now it is \u201cjust\u201d good.","id":"5c6fb4d90e0a26239cd44402","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c6fb4d90e0a26239cd44402","movie_id":335983}

{"author":"gurteksingh","content":"Venom is a great comic adaptation. I really like what they did with the character and the story. I thought the film was done well. The special effects are pretty good. I thought the characters were cast well, and overall I just enjoyed it. The film is pretty dark and violent despite the PG-13 rating. It didn't have a lot of blood, but there was a bit here and there. Characters are mostly tossed around and beaten, but a lot of them are not shown dead. That being said, some characters are still killed on screen. People are experimented on. A few people are slashed and stabbed. Guns are used, but not frequently. It definitely pushed the PG-13 as far as it could. There is a lot of language throughout, including an f-bomb. There is also a lot of drinking. I definitely recommend this movie.

But it was__, when all was said and done, one of the coasts of a country that was a lifeboat, and that lifeboat was under siege by people who wanted to be taken on board. She thought to the southern shores of Italy and the boats that came up from the south, crammed with the desperate of North Africa striving to get into Europe. The vessels capsized under their human cargo; there were people in the water, their dream coming to a watery end. How could one turn one's face against all of that? What sort of person would one have to be to sail past?_\r\n\r\n- Alexander McCall Smith; _The Novel Habits of Happiness_ (2015)\r\n\r\nIn Homer's _Odyssey_, returning from the Trojan War, Odysseus and his men must pass through a narrow strait, one side of which is home to the six-headed sea monster Scylla, whilst the other is home to Charybdis, an underwater sea monster who causes a whirlpool at the surface capable of swallowing entire ships. Prior to reaching the straits, the goddess Circe advises Odysseus to sail closer to Scylla than Charybdis, telling him, \"better by far to lose six men and keep your ship than lose your entire crew\". Hoping to somehow outwit both monsters, Odysseus tells his crew about Charybdis, but not Scylla, and ultimately, although they avoid the whirlpool, Scylla eats six of his men.\r\n\r\nWritten by Wolfgang Fischer and Ika K\u00fcnzel, and directed by Fischer, _Styx_ has nothing to do with Greek mythology (despite its title), but it does present a similar dilemma to the one faced by Odysseus. However, whereas he had to weigh six guaranteed deaths against the possibility of everyone dying, in the film the choice is more clear-cut - a group of people in a boat will die unless you intervene; what do you do? And if the answer sounds obvious, what if the question is contextualised by explaining the people are African refugees trying to reach Europe illegally. And you've been explicitly ordered not to help them. Does this change anything? Should it change anything? These are the tough questions asked by _Styx_, a remarkably apolitical microcosm of white European indifference to the current refugee crisis. This isn't a white saviour narrative, it's not about a racist who realises that blacks are people too, or about a refugee proving valuable even in the face of hatred. It's a parable about a binary choice distilled down to its very essence. Functioning as both a stripped-back documentary-like depiction of reality _and_ an allegory for more existential issues, the film will probably frustrate those looking for something more dramatic, or those who dislike narratives which remain ambiguous on moral questions. However, for everyone else, this is an exceptionally well-mounted and brilliantly acted story about what can happen when the visor of indifference no longer shields our eyes from the truth.\r\n\r\nRike (an extraordinary Susanne Wolff) is an emergency doctor in Cologne, fulfilling a lifelong ambition to sail solo from Gibraltar to Ascension Island, a tiny South Atlantic volcanic island about half-way between West Africa and Brazil. A trip of over 5,000 kilometres, Rike is sailing on her 11-meter yacht, the Asa Gray, and her only connection to the outside world is the ship's radio. Longing to see the jungle designed by Charles Darwin and Joseph Dalton Hooker (as Rike describes it, \"wild, untouched nature that was actually planned\"), she is more than able to handle herself on the ocean, as she demonstrates during a storm between Cape Verde and Mauritania. However, the following morning, Rike finds herself a few hundred feet away from a damaged fishing trawler loaded with refugees, desperately calling for her assistance. As maritime law dictates, she alerts the coastguard, who promises to send help, but who warns her not to approach the trawler. Hours later, with no sign of rescue, Rike moves slightly closer in an effort to get some of her water to its dehydrated passengers, but several of the refugees jump into the water and attempt to swim to her. All but one drowns; a young boy (Gedion Oduor Weseka) whom she hauls onboard in a near-unconscious state. Tending to a nasty wound on his back, she sees from a wrist band that his name is Kingsley, and when he recovers, he uses what little English he has to explain that people on the trawler are sick and dying, and need help, including his elder sister. With the coastguard still promising help that doesn't seem to be coming, Rike is presented with a stark choice; defy the coastguard's orders and intervene, or do nothing.\r\n\r\nFilmed on the open sea on a working yacht (it probably helped that Wolff is an accomplished sailor), the only parts of the film shot in a controlled environment was the storm, which was shot in a tank in Malta. During the writing of the screenplay, Fischer consulted Sea Watch (a civil search and rescue operation in the Mediterranean), M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (an international medical organisation), Borderline Europe (who work on Europe's external borders to provide aid and advice to refugees), and MOAS (Migrant Offshore Aid Station, a Maltese group who provide aid to refugees across the globe). The film is named after the Styx, the river in Greek mythology that separated the human world and the Underworld. However, in a connotation that many critics seem to have missed, one can only cross Styx if one can pay Charon, the ferryman, for passage. If one cannot pay, one's soul must wander the shores for a hundred years. So, only those privileged enough to afford it can (legally) travel to the next life, an obvious comment on the economic plight of refugees.\r\n\r\nBefore looking at the film's politics, it's worth mentioning its extraordinary craft. It opens with a shot of Barbary macaques apparently in the wild, before a cut reveals they are living side by side with humans on Gibraltar's urbanised coastline. It's a nicely presented visual metaphor, setting the allegorical tone for what's to come; apart from the obvious Darwinian \"survival of the fittest\" allusion, it presents a jungle thriving right beside a city built by people, just as Rike plans to travel to a jungle built by people. The film then cuts to a car crash in Cologne. Within moments, a fleet of emergency vehicles are on the scene, one of whom is Rike. However, the scene does far more than introduce her character; here we have an almost immediate outpouring of aid for those in need, in stark contrast to what will happen on the ocean, where responsibility is shirked and rescue is never guaranteed. Again, it's a very simple scene, with the metaphorical connotations not in any way laboured or foregrounded.\r\n\r\nDirector of photography Benedict Neuenfels's work is exemplary throughout, imbuing the ocean with the most beautiful blue you can imagine. Prior to the encounter with the refugees, the film recalls the soothing minimalism of J.C. Chandor's All is Lost (2013), and it's difficult not to settle into the peacefulness which Rike herself so clearly enjoys. Later, the economy of the visual language is more taut, making important thematic and narrative points with very simple set-ups. For example, high elevation drone shots show the vastness of the ocean, and just how completely isolated Rike and the refugees are (James Cameron's Titanic (1997) features a similar shot for the same reason). These shots also speak to the film's dispassionate observational style that remains non-judgmental and almost entirely apolitical, with events presented in an informational documentarian manner, as if they are really happening. This is in direct contrast to Gianfranco Rosi's similarly themed 2016 documentary Fuocoammare, which presents real events as if staged and acted.\r\n\r\nThematically, Styx covers a lot of ground, without being too explicit about anything. For example, it's never mentioned that Rike's journey to a manmade forest is interrupted by a manmade conflict. Similarly, as an emergency physician, Rike knows the first rule of such circumstances: always ensure your own safety first. This is never spelt out, but it becomes important when she realises she can't sail over to the trawler and offload the refugees, as they would overwhelm the Asa Gray. Of course, the circumstances seem tailor-made for a white saviour narrative - a privileged white European comes to the aid of a group of imperilled African refugees, deifying bureaucratic inaction, and in the process teaches us all about the importance of compassion and not to take our privileges for granted. Even the storm scenes seem to be setting up for this, depicting Rike as capable and strong, someone who can handle herself in a crisis. Fischer, however, is not interested in such a story, and Rike is no more a hero than the average person on the street. Indeed, she doesn't have much in the way of a character arc; once she spots the refugees, she does relatively little except watch in horror, with her most salient characteristic being indecision. Quite opposite to the clich\u00e9d white saviour narrative this could have become, the longer Rike does nothing, the more she comes to embody European indecision and irresponsibility; however well-intentioned it may be, the \"someone else will do something\" attitude that allows us to be outraged without having to act.\r\n\r\nA crucial couple of scenes in this respect come either side of the storm. In the first, Rike is contacted by a nearby freighter who warns about the impending storm and tells her to give them a shout if she needs anything the following day. Bearing in mind that the freighter would have room for ten times as many people as are in the trawler, Rike contacts them, but the immediately uncomfortable radio operator tells her, \"our employer has a strict policy [of non-intervention] in such cases. I can't risk my job\", to which Rike asserts \"you are obliged to.\" But of course, he isn't obliged to, no more than she is. This exchange introduces a further element into the narrative - economic considerations. As the second scene of the film makes clear, in European cities, thousands of Euros and hundreds of people are immediately deployed to help car crash victims. Here in the ocean, however, when the lives of over one hundred are in danger, people bicker about economic bottom-lines and responsibility is passed from one group to the next, with no one willing (or able) take charge.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most extraordinary thing about the film, however, is how quiet it is on the refugee crisis itself. Fischer is not concerned with finger-wagging pieties or didactic moralising, he's interested only in showing us what happens, lifting the veil, letting us come to our own conclusions regarding the morality of it all. The refugee crisis as a global situation is never even mentioned, nor do we ever learn where the trawler has come from or where it was going; such details are incidental to the individuals in the film. And this is a key point; individuals are not responsible for making the crisis, but we are responsible for how that crisis is playing out. Kingsley himself is certainly a metonym for refugees in general, but he is also a terrified young boy to whom politics are irrelevant in the face of possibly having to watch his sister die.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, there are a couple, but they are relatively minor. For example, to a certain extent, the disembodied voice of the coastguard is something of a token villain (even if his warnings not to approach the trawler make perfect sense), and it wouldn't have taken a huge amount to have given him just a touch more in the way of compassion. The simple binary choice faced by Rike is also perhaps a little too binary; clear-cut in a philosophy textbook kind of way. And the relationship between Rike (privileged white European) and Kingsley (suffering African refugee) is a touch over-schematised. The biggest problem, however, and for some this won't be a problem at all, is the decided lack of thrills. I've seen a couple of people talk about how the film would have worked better if the last act had more of a rescue thriller vibe to it. I agree with that. Just like I think the last act of Frank Darabont's The Green Mile (1999) would have been much better had Tom Hanks staged a guard-led raid to break Michael Clarke Duncan out of prison.\r\n\r\nOkay, I'm being facetious, but the point is, had this turned into some kind of maritime action movie, it would have completely undermined everything it was trying to accomplish. Yes, the complete lack of anything resembling excitement will probably bother some, as will the inaction of the main character, but such lack of kinetics is much more akin to the reality Fischer is trying to depict, where seemingly unimportant events (such as Rike sunbathing) are given almost as much time as the more dramatic moments.\r\n\r\nTackling how the issue of indifference may not be as clear-cut as it seems on paper, Styx is a film that asks difficult moral questions, without providing much in the way of answers, avoiding didacticism, and for the most part, remaining apolitical. As Rike's journey to her own idea of paradise intersects the journey of migrants travelling to what they hope will prove to be their paradise, the film presents not a story about a white saviour, but a story about white indecision. Forcing the audience to weigh the same alternatives that Rike must weigh, Styx comes across as both heartfelt and non-judgemental. With the Asa Gray serving as a microcosm for white Europe's reaction to incoming refugees, and the attendant social, economic and political dilemmas, Fischer acknowledges that this crisis throws up exceptionally difficult questions. The answers to which are up to us as individuals and as a society.","id":"5d71dcd877c01f5371591970","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d71dcd877c01f5371591970","movie_id":500853}

Showing their career together at their pear would show what they were as a team and what they did together, but this angle illustrates who they are. It sweats the details. Coogan and Reilly are very convincing in their roles.\r\n\r\nThey still have ambitions that fuel an attempt at a comeback, but their ambition is clouded by the knowledge that they are past their prime. They enjoy the nostalgia and leftover love from their fans even while they try to rise above it. The movie is able to end on a high note even though they cannot achieve all of their goals. \r\n\r\nPerhaps what I like the most about this movie is the treatment of the stars' wives. As the agent character states, the two wives are also a sort of double act. On the surface they don't seem to like each other a lot, but we see moments of respect and fun between them, and they obviously both love their famous husbands very much. As I said above, Coogan and Reilly do a great job in this movie, but it would have been a lesser film without these two supporting characters.","id":"5e8a3f7917792c0015715abb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e8a3f7917792c0015715abb","movie_id":394741}

The airborne spores can be seen, and we are shown their deadly effect; most of the action takes place while wearing the suits which filter out those deadly spores. This film impressed me mostly for its realism; the suits were well-worn, the spacecraft were also, and much of their equipment had to be jury-rigged to be useful. \r\n\r\nThe actors did a great job; Cee (Sopie Thatcher) was a natural, and totally believable, and had good chemistry with Ezra (Pedro Pascal) who really carried the movie; he sometimes reminded me of Nathan Fillian in Firefly. I would've preferred a bit more background on their characters, and a few times I was unimpressed by their emotional reaction to certain events, but those are minor quibbles about an excellent film, which I urge all lovers of hard science-fiction to enjoy, as I certainly did!\r\n\r\nAs there are so very few real sci-fi movies to compare it with, I give this film 5\/5; it's excellent!","id":"5c5c8b12c3a3683a4689aeb5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c5c8b12c3a3683a4689aeb5","movie_id":506072}

This one did, but this is not why I'm giving it such a low rating. It earns it's low rating by failing on almost every technical, logical and entertainment level.\r\n\r\nHonestly there is so much to hassle about this movie I don't really know where to start.\r\n\r\nDespite tonnes of forced exposition the plot makes little to no sense. Characters do and say things for no reason, apart from faith, or an evil lack thereof. Essentially a father and son run and hide from an evil faithless government official who is about as threatening as a box of tissues. They encounter people with faith who help them, or people without faith who hinder them. There is no subtlety, christians are good, everyone else is bad. Every single character is a cliche you have seen somewhere else in a better film. There are no stakes, no tension, because god will intervene whenever anything bad happens.\r\n\r\nThe film is poorly shot, long tracking shots are juddery and jumpy because they don't have the equipment to properly film them. The old hiding behind a log when the soldier would clearly be able to see you pops up all to often. A sniper who can hit someone in the head in a moving vehicle, through the windshield front on, can't hit the passengers in the car because he's to the left of the vehicle. Yet somehow I guess the devil curved his bullet to go round to the front of the car to hit the driver? Sure, makes as much sense as the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nDialogue is forced and cheesy, badly delivered by people who really want to do a good job, but just don't have the skills to pull it off.\r\n\r\nOne of the most annoying aspects of the film, is Embry Johnson as Caleb. The dude is going through puberty, and his voice sounds like the acne covered nervous teen from The Simpsons who's voice is permanently breaking. He is so distracting and awful sounding, and can't act to boot. Just wait a few months for his voice to settle, or cast someone else.

{"author":"Key-Si","content":"\"Hide In The Light\" is your typical -young people go to an abandoned haunted place (in this case an orphanage) to get picked off by whatever one by one- and for what it was going for, this movie is actually quite fine. The Eric Robers makes a little cameo in this, shouldn't be the driving force to watch this though, because he's in it for about one minute only. But Jessie James is also a quite recognizable name by now. The acting here isn't great, but it works for the film and here and there there is really some fun to be had. My biggest gripe is the portrayal of the demon. Because it is not shown. Instead you get a CGI effect as if you'd be looking through a thick glass. Transparent, not scary at all and it looks just bad. 'Amanda' (KylieRae Condon) as the creepy kid was pretty good I must say. I liked her performance. This would almost be a good movie, if they wouldn't have used cheap effects like that. Even black smoke would have been much more convincing than what we've got here. Granted, when it comes to first time directors, Mikey McGregor is by far not the worst. But some more experience would have helped the film a lot! But all in all I liked it. And that already means something, because most of the films with that premise are films I didn't like. Yes, this was low budget as well, but I can appreciate the effort and as I already said, there were a few moments I really had fun with \"Hide In The Light\". The character building was also done quite well. Especially with so many characters the film managed to flesh out at least most of the important ones, which is rare with films of this particular sub-genre.","id":"5d63af25bc8abc532524e5d6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d63af25bc8abc532524e5d6","movie_id":549671}
{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Esoteric and poetic, but very singular; certainly not for everyone_**\r\n\r\n> _Imagine a star with a mass 10 times that of the sun. During most of its lifetime of about a billion years, the star will generate heat at its centre by converting hydrogen into helium. The energy released will create sufficient pressure to support the star against its own gravity, giving rise to an object with a radius about five times the radius of the sun. The escape velocity from the surface of such a star would be about 1,000 kilometres per second. That is to say, an object fired vertically upward from the surfa__ce of the star with a velocity of less than 1,000 kilometres per second would be dragged back by the gravitational field of the star and would return to the surface, whereas an object with a velocity greater than that would escape to infinity._\r\n\r\n> _When the star had exhausted its nuclear fuel, there would be nothing to maintain the outward pressure, and the star would begin to collapse because of its own gravity. As the star shrank, the gravitational field at the surface would become stronger and the escape velocity would increase. By the time the radius had got down to 10 kilometres, the escape velocity would have increased to 100,000 kilometres per second, the velocity of light. After that time any light emitted from the star would not be able to escape to infinity but would be dragged back by the gravitational field. According to the special theory of relativity, nothing can travel faster than light, so that if light cannot escape, nothing else can either. The result would be a black hole: a region of space-time from which it is not possible to escape._\r\n\r\n- Stephen Hawking; \"The Quantum Mechanics of Black Holes\"; _Scientific American_, 236:1 (January 1977), 34-40\r\n\r\n> _The thing's hollow - it goes on forever - and - oh my God! - it's full of stars!_\r\n\r\n- Arthur C. Clarke; _2001: A Space Odyssey_ (1968)\r\n\r\n>_If information were lost in black holes, we wouldn't be able to predict the future, because a black hole could emit any collection of particles. It could emit a working television set, or a leather-bound volume of the complete works of Shakespeare, though the chance of such exotic emissions is very low. It is much more likely to be thermal Radiation, like the glow from red hot metal. It might seem that it wouldn't matter very much if we couldn't predict what comes out of black holes. There aren't any black holes near us. But it is a matter of principle. If determinism breaks down with black holes, it could break down in other situations. There could be virtual black holes that appear as fluctuations out of the vacuum, absorb one set of particles, emit another, and disappear into the vacuum again. Even worse, if determinism breaks down, we can't be sure of our past history either. The history books and our memories could just be illusions. It is the past that tells us who we are. Without it, we lose our identity._\r\n\r\n>_It was therefore very important to determine whether information really was lost in black holes, or whether in principle, it could be recovered. Many people felt that information should not be lost, but no one could suggest a mechanism by which it could be preserved. The arguments went on for years. Finally, I found what I think is the answer. It depends on the idea of Richard Feynman, that there isn't a single history, but many different possible histories, each with their own probability. In this case, there are two kinds of history. In one, there is a black hole, into which particles can fall, but in the other kind, there is no black hole. The point is, that from the outside, one can't be certain whether there is a black hole, or not. So there is always a chance that there isn't a black hole. This possibility is enough to preserve the information, but the information is not returned in a very useful form. It is like burning an encyclopaedia. Information is not lost if you keep all the smoke and ashes, but it is difficult to read._\r\n\r\n>_What does this tell us about whether it is possible to fall in a black hole, and come out in another universe? The existence of alternative histories with black holes suggests this might be possible. The hole would need to be large, and if it was rotating, it might have a passage to another universe. But you couldn't come back to our universe._\r\n\r\n- Stephen Hawking; \"Black holes ain't as black as they are painted\"; BBC Reith Lecture (February 2, 2016)\r\n\r\nA science fiction thriller from Claire Denis? The uncompromising darling of French art house cinema, adored by critics and met with general puzzlement by audiences? And it's in English? And it stars the guy from _Twilight_? You have to be making this up.\r\n\r\nNot at all. However, as intriguing as that may sound, it's a deceptive overview. Yes, it is Denis's first English-language film, and yes, it is set in space, but it's a science fiction film in name only, in much the same way as _Trouble Every Day_ (2001) is a horror film in name only, and it has more in common with Stanley Kubrick's _2001: A Space Odyssey_ (1968) and Andrei Tarkovsky's _Solyaris_ (1972) than with anything in the _Star Trek_ or _Star Wars_ franchises. And just for the record, the guy from _Twilight_ has developed one of the most eclectic recent CVs of any actor in Hollywood. The long and short of it is that Denis has not sold out, and _High Life_ is as multiplex-friendly as anything in her _oeuvre_ (which is to say, not in the slightest). And although she's ostensibly working within genre parameters, the film covers many of her more familiar themes - the darker aspects of desire; the notion of being an outcast; parenthood; the inescapability of death; the beauty of the human body; the relationship between violence and sexuality. The presence of Robert Pattinson will probably draw in a lot of unsuspecting folks, who will have no idea what to make of Denis's slowly paced existential musings, resulting in a slew of asinine \"_worst film ever_\" reviews. But although it's not Denis's best (that remains either _Beau travail_ or _Les salauds_), it's a fascinatingly poetic and original film that is utterly uncategorisable - a space thriller about a mission collapsing in on itself; an angry ecological allegory positing that we don't have a huge amount of time left to save the planet; a study of what it is that defines our humanity; an analysis of the psychological ramifications of long-term incarceration; an erotic skin flick obsessed with bodily fluids; a metaphor for the perils of imperialism; a fable on the subject of paternity; a story about loneliness and grief; a look at the inherent contradiction in the fact that humanity is constantly reaching for the infinite whilst tied to an irreversibly decaying body; a literalisation of the premise that no amount of evolution, philosophy, or esotericism can ever change the fact that we're biological organisms controlled by our sexual yearnings and impulse to procreate - desire will always trump the social contract; we can place as much artificial limitation on our carnality as we want, but ultimately, desire will betray us.\r\n\r\nLike I say, very multiplex-friendly.\r\n\r\nDeep space. On an unnamed ship marked only with the number #7, Monte (Pattinson) lives alone with his baby daughter Willow (Scarlett Lindsey). However, this wasn't always the case, and as the film begins, Monte is releasing the bodies of his deceased crewmates into the void of space. How this situation came to pass is revealed via an achronological flashback narrative structure. At an unspecified point in the future, scientists came to pin their hopes for a sustainable energy source on the \"Penrose Process\" - a theory developed by Sir Roger Penrose whereby energy could be extracted from the area close to a black hole. Manning their ships with death row inmates to whom they have guaranteed pardons, the scientists neglect to inform the crew that they won't be returning to Earth. On Ship #7 are four men - Monte, Tcherny (Andr\u00e9 Benjamin), Chandra (Lars Eidinger), and Ettore (Ewan Mitchell) - and four women - Boyse (Mia Goth), Nansen (Agata Buzek), Mink (Claire Tran), and Elektra (Gloria Obianyo). Whilst Chandra is the designated captain, the _de facto_ leader is Dr. Dibs (an ethereal Juliette Binoche oozing uninhibited sexuality from every pore), a criminal herself, who is using the journey to conduct biological experiments on the crew - each day the men give her sperm samples in return for sleeping pills, and she attempts to artificially inseminate the females. Monte, however, refuses to comply, arguing that his chastity gives him strength. His obstinacy, of course, fascinates Dibs, who determines to get a sample from him by any means necessary. Meanwhile, all sexual activity between the crew is prohibited, although they are free to use \"The Box\", a room designed to facilitate masturbation, which all but Monte visit on a daily basis. However, as time passes, the isolation, the dawning realisation that it's a suicide mission, the increasingly invasive activities of Dibs, their past criminal predilections, and their unquenchable libidos start to take over some of the crew, with deadly consequences.\r\n\r\n_High Life_ was written in French by Denis and her regular writing partner Jean-Pol Fargeau in 2013, and translated into English by Geoff Cox. An early iteration of the script was written by Northern Irish novelist and poet Nick Laird (who is credited as \"Script consultant\") and his wife, the English novelist and essayist Zadie Smith (who is uncredited). Originally, Denis planned to cast Philip Seymour Hoffman as Monte and Patricia Arquette as Dibs, but she was unable to secure funding at the time. Prior to shooting in 2016, she, the film's cinematographer Yorick Le Saux, production designer Fran\u00e7ois-Renaud Labarthe, visual consultant \u00d3lafur Eliasson (who designed the film's unusual \"shoebox-shaped\" space-craft), and actors Pattinson and Binoche visited the European Space Agency Astronaut Centre in Cologne to look at the practicalities of deep space travel. Additionally, physicist and black-hole expert Aur\u00e9lien Barrau worked on the picture as scientific consultant.\r\n\r\n_High Life_ opens, very unexpectedly, with pseudo-Edenic shots of lush vegetation, before slowly revealing we're seeing a garden on a spaceship, surrounded by and subservient to technology. We then hear a baby crying on the intercom. This opening, mixing vegetation, technology, and biology signals both the film's tone and demonstrates the economy of Denis's visual language, telling us much of what we need to know about the upcoming film. In the film's press notes, Denis states,\r\n\r\n> _I was dead set on having that garden. How can you keep up the hope of return if Earth isn't part of the voyage? That earth is their Earth, the only thing that reminds them that they are earthlings, men and women of the Earth._\r\n\r\nDenis and Le Saux employ similarly precise storytelling tools in shooting everything on the spaceship on HD video, whereas the few scenes on Earth are shot on 16mm - this gives the space scenes a sleek polished sheen, whilst the Earth material looks grainy and gritty, more lived-in, setting up an instant visual contrast to mirror the thematic one. I'd also be remiss whilst discussing the film's aesthetics, if I didn't mention what will probably be the film's most famous scene - a very energetic visit by Dibs to The Box, with Binoche committing herself entirely to Dibs's masturbatory excess, as she makes full use of the ceiling-mounted stirrups and the metal dildo in the middle of the room. The scene is beautifully shot, bathed in a gloriously blue light that softens everything it touches, whilst Le Saux shoots Dibs entirely from behind, focusing on the contraction and expanding of the muscles in her back, as if a figure from a Sandro Botticelli painting has wandered into a room designed by H.R. Giger. Furthermore, the scene is edited by Guy Lecorne with the use of fades rather than hard cuts, giving a sense of contemplative peace which contrasts nicely with the energies of the character. And never has the human back looked so sensual and magnificent!\r\n\r\nThematically, rather unexpectedly, the film actually has a lot in common with Paul Schrader's _First Reformed_ (2017); both films deal with the looming end of existence; both examine the possibility of finding hope amidst the oncoming cataclysm; both see the human race as essentially not worth saving; both focus on a very spiritual character facing a crisis of faith - in _First Reformed_ that crisis concerns Fr. Toller's Catholicism, whereas in _High Life_ it's Monte's belief in the importance of self-discipline and chastity. Indeed, Denis shapes the narrative in such a way that, for the audience, the experience of life on #7 is not that different from the experience of life on Earth in the early 21st century - people hurtling towards oblivion, yet trying to maintain a semblance of humanity, even as they fail to understand the gravity of what they're facing. In this sense, the film could be argued to be about finding the strength to face extinction, or, in a less optimistic reading, it could be about the pointlessness of searching for the strength to face extinction, because such strength is of absolutely no value.\r\n\r\nOf course, on a more prosaic level, the film is obsessed with bodily functions and sexuality, with Monte adopting a very conservative ideology by refusing to give Dibs his sperm and electing not to use The Box. Fluids are a recurring motif throughout, whether the blood that several characters shed, the sperm with which Dibs is obsessed, the oil that keeps the ship's systems running, the water that nourishes the garden and that keeps the crew alive, and copious unidentified liquids (I've no idea what it is that comes pouring out of The Box at one point). Speaking of fluid, perhaps the film's most haunting image is a shot of one character lactating; her body producing nourishment for a baby she can't feed, as Dibs has taken it from her, the milk running down her body going to waste. Interestingly enough, at the film's world premiere in Toronto, this scene sparked a considerable number of walkouts, almost every single one of which was male. Make of that what you will.\r\n\r\nThe subject of fluids is introduced from the onset. One of the first things we hear Monte saying is telling Willow that even if it is recycled, one should never eat one's own faeces or drink one's own urine, as such behaviour is \"taboo\". If we accept that the ship's garden is Eden, then Monte and Willow are our Adam and Eve. Of course, as we all know, what comes next in Genesis is temptation and desire, and things don't end too well for our ancestors. Thus Monte's emphasis on taboo in this opening scene becomes ironic given that later in the film, he will come face to face with an even more controversial taboo.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, obviously, the film will be far too abstruse for some. When Ridley Scott was hired to direct _Blade Runner_, he famously stated that he didn't want to make \"_an esoteric film_\". And then went on to make one of the most esoteric studio movies of all time. Denis obviously wholly intended for _High Life_ to be esoteric, and she is unconcerned with CGI spectacle or any of the tropes we've seen rehashed a million times in sci-fi movies. For some, however, the film will cross the line from esotericism to impenetrability. Of course, science fiction can and very often does deal with huge thematic and socio-political themes whilst maintaining its identity as popular entertainment; films as varied as Douglas Trumbull's _Silent Runner_ (1972), Danny Boyle's _Sunshine_ (2007), and Christopher Nolan's _Interstellar_ (2014) are big-budget special-effects-heavy genre blockbusters that ask all manner of existential questions, and do far more than give us empty billion-dollar spectacles more concerned with selling toys than saying something of note. Denis, however, is more reluctant to give up the secrets of her picture. And for those more used to films that openly reveal themselves without the audience having to put in much effort, _High Life_ will prove too abstract.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, Denis's litany of themes does come across as a little haphazard, as she jumps around fairly randomly from ecological issues to sexual proclivities to what makes us human to extinction to loneliness. This results in something of a thematic pile-up, which, by definition, can feel like a bit of a dead-end. I don't agree with people who say the film \"had no point\", but I can certainly see from where such criticism could arise, as Denis leaves several ideas relatively and frustratingly incomplete. Another issue is that the journey of #7 is never presented in any way urgently, meaning there's rarely tension, as life on ship moves along at its own lethargic pace. This might make for existential pondering, but it doesn't make for especially engaging drama. And I have to admit, at times my attention began to wander, with the pace becoming more of an endurance test than anything else.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, _High Life_ is a fascinating film, equal parts poetic and prosaic; reaching for infinity, but never lifting its feet from the soil. Looking at everything from paternity to incarceration to apocalypse to canines turning to cannibalism (don't ask), it fits right into her _oeuvre_, belying the mainstream impression given by the marketing. Although it recalls the clinical detachment of _2001_ and the psychological intensity of _Solyaris_, _High Life_ is very much its own animal. Asking highly relevant questions about humanity and our inability to recognise the oncoming extinction, the film offers a savage and somewhat pessimistic corrective to the idealism of films such as _Interstellar_ and Ridley Scott's _The Martian_ (2015). Positing that mankind is a monster driven by its desires isn't going to earn Denis legions of new fans, but for those of us who were already on board, there's much to be relished here.","id":"5d76c9b412970c00129c26e2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d76c9b412970c00129c26e2","movie_id":376865}
{"author":"Gill-Man","content":"A dazzling sci-fi epic that holds nothing back in its entirety. Claire denis' vision is an unrelenting masterwork packed to the brim with nerve-shredding fear and and a pulse-punding gravitational pull that sucks in the viewer and never lets go until the very end.\r\n\r\nI found this film more of a meditation on what makes humanity's backbone so spontaneous; there are many plot points and elements that seem justified by the notion that humans are unpredictable creatures and as we evolve, we'll continue to be more and more focused on following through with our own morals. There's lots of brutality on display on this film and it all feels very contained until one moment near the film's middle that's very quiet and equally contained but that sends the entirety of the cast into chaos. It's almost a testament to the question of whether authority figures actually *do* something for prisoners or instead just make their rage build up further and further until it explodes harder than a dick in the Fuckbox.\r\n\r\nI think the best way its themes can be described is by a quote from the film itself: \"The sensation, moving backwards, even though we're moving forwards, getting further from what's getting nearer.\". The way it presents human evolution as moving forward literally but moving backward metaphorically is more than just smart: it's genius. But the film also tackles issues pertaining to erotic pleasure and abuse of that pleasure; the entire Fuckbox scene is just a nightmare on all levels and it made me want to just die from the shivers it sent down my spine.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend supporting this film it's playing near you, very few people will end up getting to experience it in theaters (i sure didn't) so please don't ensure that another beautiful masterpiece gets slept on!","id":"5cc8d8259251412ba10075a9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cc8d8259251412ba10075a9","movie_id":376865}

Even if you're writing a think piece against it, against this invasion of privacy, they'r__e literally still linking to it because they know it will garner clicks. This idea kept playing over and over in my head. We as a country, our lust for entertainment has sort of superseded our sense of self-preservation. Everything is spectacle. Everything is entertainment, whether it's shame, invasion of privacy, abuse, no matter what it is it's become almost a sporting event. It's like the new Roman Coliseum in a way. I find that to be quite troubling. This is something that I think affects all aspects of the political spectrum. It's not reserved for one or the other, it's truly American._\r\n\r\n- Sam Levinson; \"Sam Levinson on Creating Chaos in _Assassination Nation_\"; filmschoolrejects.com (September 26, 2018)\r\n\r\nCentred around a quartet of unapologetically (or perhaps unknowingly) shallow teen girls more concerned with getting likes on Instagram than decent grades, and culminating in an orgy of gender-demarcated violence, _Assassination Nation_ is one of those films that seems to set out to try to offend everyone \u2013 from the social justice warriors on the left to the second amendment fetishisers on the right, from Millennial snowflakes who have never known life without social media to Baby boomers who just can't get their head around why going viral is so important. And pretty much everyone in between. The satirical ire of writer\/director Sam Levinson's (son of Barry Levinson) second feature, however, is aimed more specifically at those who tend to see the proclivities of sexually \"aggressive\" (i.e., sexually confident) young women through misogyny-tinted glasses as the ruination of society (the type of insecure males who believe the term \"toxic masculinity\" is an oxymoron). Presumably inspired by the \"Sukeban\" [boss girl] phenomenon in Japan during the 70s and 80s, the film essentially depicts what might have happened if both the accused and the accusers during the Salem witch trials had had access to social media and assault rifles. Starting out as a hilarious, if disturbing, commentary on a society becoming ever more defined by online hysteria and the erosion of traditional concepts of privacy, the film charts a course from Michael Lehmann's _Heathers_ (1988) and Mark Waters's _Mean Girls_ (2004) to James DeMonaco's _The Purge_ (2013) by way of Joe Dante's _The Second Civil War_ (1997), Michael Mann's _Blackhat_ (2015), and Cary Murnion and Jonathan Milott's _Bushwick_ (2017). True, it does run out of steam in its third act, and, overall, it tries to take on too many issues, with several themes (and plotlines) disappointingly glossed over. Nevertheless, this is perceptive stuff, with a solid central socio-political thesis, a savagely satirical narrative (even if it is populated by underwritten characters), and a vivid depiction of high-school teenagers pushed beyond all reason.\r\n\r\nSet in a town called Salem in an undesignated state (it is NOT supposed to be Salem, Massachusetts, as so many reviews have claimed), Lily Colson (Odessa Young) is a fairly typical 18-year-old high-school senior. Intelligent, creative, and obsessed with her social media presence, Lily is part of a tightly-knit clique of four girls, along with Bex (Hari Nef), Em (Abra), and Sarah (Suki Waterhouse). Although Lily is ostensibly dating Mark (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd), unbeknownst to her friends, she is also involved in a sexting relationship with an older man, identified as \"Daddy\". Life is relatively normal until an unknown hacker named Er0str4tus (after Herostratus, who torched the Temple of Artemis so as to become famous) releases private footage of the ultra-conservative, anti-homosexual Major Bartlett (Cullen Moss) interacting with male escorts and wearing women's lingerie. Several days later, the phone of Principal Turrell (Colman Domingo) is also hacked, and non-sexual naked pictures of his six-year-old daughter are sent across the town, with people accusing him of being a paedophile. As the police and the FBI investigate the hacks, a massive data dump of half the people in Salem is posted online, including the pictures and sexts Lily had been sending to \"Daddy\". With the town turning on itself, as friends and family members find their private messages about one another exposed for all to see, the four girls find themselves at the dangerous centre of a rapidly escalating situation.\r\n\r\n_Assassination Nation_ made news in January 2018, when it was the biggest sale at the Sundance Film Festival, purchased by NEON for $10 million. However, when it went on wide release in North America in September, it flopped badly, taking only $1 million in its opening weekend, and finishing 15th at the box office. Even for a modestly budgeted film, that's a horrendous opening, and for a film showing in over 1,400 theatres to not even break the top ten is virtually unheard of. Indeed, it had the worst wide release opening weekend of the year, earning just $733 per theatre. This is a real shame, but perhaps it's not unexpected. The film has \"cult status\" written all over it, and the fact that it holds a very unflattering mirror up to contemporary American society was never exactly going to pull in the multiplex crowds, irrespective of festival buzz and reasonably positive reviews. That that mirror is satirical probably didn't help either. 31% of Americans believe that a second Civil War will happen within their lifetime, almost certainly race related, and I can't imagine people who think this way being especially receptive to the kind of satire seen in this film.\r\n\r\n_Assassination Nation_ works primarily, if not wholly, by way of exaggeration, as with so much great Juvenalian satire \u2013 from the writings of Decimus Iunius Iuvenalis himself to Jonathan Swift's mastering of the form in works such as \"A Modest Proposal For preventing the Children of Poor People From being a Burthen to Their Parents or Country, And For making them Beneficial to the Publick\" (1729) to modern novels such as Tom Wolfe's _The Bonfire of the Vanities_ (1987) and Bret Easton Ellis's _American Psycho_ (1991), onto films such as Oliver Stone's _Natural Born Killers_ (1994) and Barry Levinson's _Wag the Dog_ (1997). The _milieu_ of the film is not such as would be found in a piece of social realism, nor does it claim to be. Instead, it works to draw attention to various cultural aspects by way of hyperbole, embellishment, and outlandish exaggeration. Nowhere is this clearer than the film's very premise \u2013 all Er0str4tus has to do to destabilise Salem is let everyone know what everyone else is thinking. Obviously, Levinson is not positing this as a real-world scenario; instead, he is accentuating the damage such a thing could do to highlight our society's very real obsession with social media and the concomitant importance of digital privacy.\r\n\r\nPossible to either deride the film as the worst imaginable type of excess of #MeToo, or celebrate it as an insightful examination of the origins of a fempowerment created by those very forces which led to #MeToo in the first place, you know you're situated firmly in outrage culture when you hear characters refer to the LGBTQ community as the LGBTQQIAAP community. Taking as its starting point the fear that female agency (particularly regarding sexuality) can instil in the patriarchal status quo, the film then hypothesises what might happen if that fear is pushed to the extreme as men try to reassert their dominance, given the current political climate in the US. The film presents a patriarchy which firmly believes that if young women dress provocatively, they must be sluts, and thus they have it coming, whatever \"it\" may be. In this sense, Levinson addresses how previously frowned-upon right-wing and\/or misogynist views have gained a degree of social acceptability and mainstream visibility during Donald Trump's presidency, and although Trump is never mentioned by name, there are several allusions to him. For example, towards the end of the film, an armed militia group are shown wearing red #MAGA-style baseball hats, whilst Richter (Jeff Pope), a local policeman, calls the group \"_good people_,\" itself a trigger phrase in light of Trump's use of it to describe the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.\r\n\r\nHowever, the film is cognisant enough to acknowledge that racial disharmony, sexism, and toxic masculinity were not invented by Trump, positing instead that such views have long been a part of the American anthropological character, with Trump simply exacerbating and, in terms of far-right hate groups, legitimising such thinking. This has led to an American society more sharply demarcated along partisan lines than perhaps at any time since the Civil War, certainly any time since Vietnam. Speaking to Seventh Row, Suki Waterhouse states,\r\n\r\n> _right now, in America at least, we're in this sort of stand-off. And standoffs don't normally end well._\r\n\r\n_Assassination Nation_ is, in part, about what happens when this stand-off erupts.\r\n\r\nLevinson sets the tone immediately. The opening shot shows a camera moving along a suburban street, passing by idyllic white picket fences, _Blue Velvet_-style, with people performing mundane tasks such as emptying the trash and watering the lawn. Except everyone is wearing a mask of some kind. A voice-over then informs us that this is a story about how Salem \"_lost its motherfucking mind_.\" The audience is then warned that there are things in the upcoming film some may find objectionable, and a rapidly edited montage shows a series of quick clips, each one labelled with a requisite \"trigger warning\" \u2013 drug use, sexual content, toxic masculinity, homophobia, transphobia, guns, nationalism, racism, kidnapping, the male gaze, sexism, swearing, torture, violence, gore, weapons, and fragile male egos. This abrasive, confrontational, self-reflexive style continues for much of the film, which is purposely designed to confront, provoke, and challenge people, not only thematically, but aesthetically.\r\n\r\nOne particularly good example of this concerns the aforementioned male gaze. An early shot shows the four girls walking into school in slow motion as the camera starts at their feet and slowly pans up their bare legs before moving around behind them. You couldn't get a more textbook example of a cinematic male gaze. So is Levinson being hypocritical, reproducing what he claims to be condemning? Not at all. Towards the end of the film, the exact same shot is repeated, but in this instance, the girls are effectively going to war, and the male gaze is no longer an issue, something the film draws to the audience's attention by replicating the form of the earlier shot \u2013 in short, the male gaze is reproduced so as to later satirise and ridicule it. That a number of professional critics have completely missed this is staggering to me, although none go to quite such ridiculous extremes as the _Los Angeles Times_' Katie Walsh, who accuses Levinson and cinematographer Marcell R\u00e9v (_Feh\u00e9r Isten_; _Jupiter holdja_; _Paterno_) of taking \"_much delight in wringing every sexy moment out of attacking young women_.\" Which is precisely what the film doesn't do. In fact, it's literally the opposite of what the film does, a misreading which reminds me of critics who accused David Fincher's _Fight Club_ (1999) of endorsing fascism.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, the data dump and its effects are also well-rendered. For example, when Er0str4tus is first seen clicking send, his click is accompanied by the non-diegetic sound of an explosion. Later, after the data dump, but prior to people turning on one another, learning that her best friend has been mocking her behind her back, an acquaintance of the central quartet takes a baseball bat, finds her friend in the school gym, and cracks her over the head. This scene is the point of no return, the first act of violence from which all others will follow. The scene starts out normal enough, but soon the camera turns upside-down and we see the girl standing against an unrealistically large American flag. Turning the camera upside-down like this mid-shot and using the flag in this way indicates that something within the social fabric has fundamentally changed; there has been some kind of paradigm shift. Indeed, speaking of the American flag, it's a recurring motif throughout the film, but we rarely see it without a gun nearby, usually in the same shot. Make of that what you will. Another aesthetically interesting scene is early in the film when the screen in split into three whilst the girls are at a party, one pane following Lily, one following Bex, and one following Em and Sarah. This has the effect of cutting the girls off from one another, isolating them in a Snap Chat shaped panel, and suggesting that even here, when they seem at their most confident, they are performing, aware of being watched. Text message chains and phone-quality videos are also used throughout the film, enhancing this erosion of any sense of privacy.\r\n\r\nThe film's most aesthetically accomplished scene, however, is a five-minute single-take shot depicting a home invasion, with the camera remaining outside the house, following the action as it moves from window to window. It's a dazzling sequence that has the effect of positioning the audience as passive spectators. Shot on a dolly rig housing a technocrane with a 42-foot arm that moves from the second floor to the first and back again, the scene came about because Levinson was trying to find \"_the scariest way possible_\" to stage the scene. Designed to depict an event that \"_was continually in motion_,\" Levinson tells the _New York Times_,\r\n\r\n> _there was something very apropos about watching this horror unfold, and being helpless in relation to it._\r\n\r\nThis, of course, is one of the film's main themes \u2013 the idea of passively and emotionlessly watching videos of tragedies online.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of themes, one of the film's strengths, but also one of its weaknesses, is the sheer volume of issues with which it engages; misogyny, feminism, fempowerment, social media, sexual assault, #MeToo, bullying, gun culture, toxic masculinity, the male gaze, racism, gang mentality, digital privacy, desensitisation, mansplaining. In only the third scene, shocked at Lily's drawings of naked women in sexually provocative positions, Turrell tells her, \"_this is high-school, and justly or unjustly, there are limits to what you can say_,\" as she tries to argue that nudity does not necessarily have to be sexual. Adopting a feminist defence, she posits that her art is reflective of how difficult it is for women in a misogynistic selfie-obsessed social media-saturated culture, explaining,\r\n\r\n> _it's not about the nudity. It's about the thousands of naked selfies you took to get just one right._\r\n\r\nSomething which men (generally) don't have to worry about.\r\n\r\nArising from this are a plethora of other issues, some vital to the story Levinson is telling, some not so much. For example, firmly of the belief that privacy is a thing of the past, Lily claims that her generation accepts that their lives are for mass consumption, and all they can do are try to choose how they are consumed. But even that choice isn't a given. In relation to this, the film addresses the myriad ways that young girls are represented on social media, deconstructing and satirising the inherently misogynistic assumptions that underpin so many of our attitudes to online behaviour (if a guy shows off his washboard abs, it's no big deal, but if a woman shows off her cleavage, we must call the elders!!). Indeed, the hypocrisy and \"holier-than-thou\" attitudes most people assume online, afforded such by the relative anonymity, come to the fore when naked pictures of Turrell's six-year-old daughter in a bath are leaked, and the town accuse him of being a paedophile. However, as Lily points out to her parents, there's a naked baby photo of her hanging in their house, so why is that not considered pornographic?\r\n\r\nThe film also asks the question of why a woman, generally speaking, cannot dress provocatively without being labelled (by some) a slut, all-but asking to be sexually assaulted. Victim shaming is an especially hot topic here in Ireland at the moment because of a recent case in which the lawyer for a man accused of rape told jurors,\r\n\r\n> _you have to look at the way she was dressed. She was wearing a thong with a lace front,_\r\n\r\nleading to #ThisIsNotConsent trending on Twitter, protests in several cities, and women across the world sharing pictures of their underwear. The callousness and indifference of social media is addressed when the girls respond to pictures of Bartlett cross-dressing by laughing at his taste in lingerie. Another major issue in the film is, obviously, sexuality. For example, Bex is transgender (as is actress Hari Nef), and after she has sex with Diamond (Danny Ram\u00edrez), a fellow pupil, he casually asks her not to tell anyone, and then subsequently blanks her in school. Elsewhere, the girls are shocked to learn that Mark won't go down on Lily, with Sarah proclaiming, \"_men who don't go down are sociopaths_.\" Very possibly.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, because the film tries to deal with so much, many of the issues are raised only to be touched on once or twice, and then dropped. This has the side-effect of making the film seem a little thematically scattershot, and it would have worked far better if Levinson had threaded a core group through the narrative rather than jumping around as much as he does. Aside from dealing with too many themes, if the film has a defining flaw, it's that the last act essentially turns into _The Purge_, wherein the girls, as complicit as everyone else in the early part of the film, now turn into the leaders of a righteous avenging vigilante group facing off against the intolerance born of right-wing jingoism, a conflict drawn primarily along gender lines, although not exclusively (there are a few men on the girls' side, and vice versa). Of the violence, Levinson tells filmschoolrejects.com,\r\n\r\n> _it's real people imitating movie violence, in a way. It is informed by the symbolism of film violence._\r\n\r\nHari Nef tells Seventh Row,\r\n\r\n> _the context of all of this hate and all of this judgment cues up the violence. You see the source of the violence, and you see the multiple forces \u2014 discursively, psychologically, culturally \u2014 that lead up to that moment. Obviously, the violence is shocking to see, but the fact that it's going on is as American as cherry pie. It's what happens in this country to people, to women, who are deemed guilty of something egregious. The fact that we get to see it is shocking, but the fact that it goes on should be very familiar._\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it's a disappointingly simplistic _d\u00e9nouement_ given the complexity and thematic depth of the preceding narrative.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that the characters are underwritten across the board, with only Lily and Bex really getting any degree of interiority. Sarah barely registers as a character at all, Em is only marginally better, and none of the other characters are developed beyond their archetypal role \u2013 Reagan Hall (Bella Thorne), a self-obsessed cheerleader; Nick Mathers (Joel McHale), Em's neighbour with a secret to hide; Grace (Maude Apatow), Reagan's quiet and submissive best friend; Marty (Noah Galvin), a local computer nerd; Nance (Anika Noni Rose), Em's adopted mother with terrible taste in men; Chief Patterson (J.D. Evermore), Salem's clueless chief of police; Rose Mathers (Susan Misner), Nick's wife; Lawrence Colson (Joe Chrest), Lily's old-fashioned father; Rebecca Colson (Kathryn Erbe), Lily's even more old-fashioned mother; and Donny Colson (Caden Swain), Lily's desensitised younger brother.\r\n\r\nDepicting a cultural anxiety that is uniquely contemporary, _Assassination Nation_ is an unexpectedly smart film examining weighty topics of great importance to the socio-political moment, irrespective of your political affiliation. While it is immensely strong (both hilarious and disturbing) in its depiction of teenage gender politics, gun culture, political correctness, online behaviour etc, it falters when it comes to the dynamics of the narrative, setting up several strands which never pay off, and ending a little weakly. Nevertheless, the questions it raises are important ones, and they are asked very well. Levinson isn't interested in providing answers though. That, he suggests, is our job.","id":"5d17a5e9ca0e1700217008fa","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d17a5e9ca0e1700217008fa","movie_id":446101}

The films sees the generally well-meaning but highly dysfunctional Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), back to taking out bad guys as a contract player but also managing his relationship with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin).  When an unexpected event sends his life into a freefall, Deadpool tries to find a new purpose with the help of his X-Men associates from the last film who attempt to recruit him into their organization.\nHis first mission is to defuse an angry and destructive young mutant named Russell (Julian Dennison), which takes an unexpected turn and lands them both in serious trouble.\n\nOne would think that would be enough to cause some major life changes for Deadpool but thanks to the arrival of Cable (Josh Brolin), a cyborg soldier from the future; things are about to get much more complicated and intense.\nUndaunted, Deadpool opts to form his own league of heroes and aside from Domino (Zazie Beetz); they seem to be as unlucky or dysfunctional as their leader which makes for some very hysterical consequences.\n\nWhat follows is an action and laugh-laden adventure which brings even more of what made the first film such a success to the audience as the film takes the bawdy action of the first and ups the ante thanks in large part to an expanded budget and cast.\nMy biggest concern for the film was that with an expanded budget there would be too many characters and an attempt to do far too much with the film. That did play out at times in the beginning as for me, the first film worked so well as they had to let the characters rather than the action and effects carry it and the rapid-fire arrival of so many jokes and creative profanity made repeat viewing of the film necessary to catch everything.\n\nThis time out we get elaborate action and chase sequences as well as a much larger cast. At times it seemed as if this would possibly overshadow the characters and story but Reynolds and Director David Leith never let it cross that line.\nThey also go back to the core elements in the final third of the film which really allows the film to fully connect with the tone of the original film and brings the film home to a satisfying conclusion.  What really sold the film for me was the brilliant and very inspired extended scene during the credits which allows Deadpool to \u201cfix\u201d various issues which perfectly captures the irreverent character and the best aspects of the series where the cast is willing to make fun of themselves as well as the larger universe in which their characters exist.\n\nI cannot wait to see what comes next as \u201cDeadPool 2\u201d is another fun outing for the character and something very different from most comic based movies.\n\n4 stars out of 5","id":"5afa5a93925141414b005cf0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5afa5a93925141414b005cf0","movie_id":383498}

With _Destroyer_, she once again teams with writers Phil Hay (to whom she is married) and Matt Manfredi, having previously worked with the duo on _\u00c6on Flux_ and _The Invitation_. Partly a film noir along the lines of Robert Siodmak's _The Killers_ (1946) or John Huston's _The Asphalt Jungle_ (1950); partly an anti-hero narrative depicting someone taking the law into their own hands, \u00e0 la Don Siegel's _Dirty Harry_ (1971), Michael Winner's _Death Wish_ (1974), or Abel Ferrara's _Bad Lieutenant_ (1992); and partly a heist movie borrowing more than liberally from Michael Mann's _Heat_ (1995), _Destroyer_ is an unashamedly pulpy genre piece, confrontationally ugly and unapologetically nihilistic. It's the kind of film one might imagine were we to follow Det. Mills (Brad Pitt) after he opened the box at the end of David Fincher's _Se7en_ (1995), with crippling emotional trauma the protagonist's most salient characteristic. Of course, a damaged cop determined to settle one last score isn't exactly an original concept, and Destroyer never strays too far from the generic tropes seen in films such as Richard Fleischer's _The New Centurions_ (1972), William Friedkin's _To Live and Die in L.A._ (1985), and Oren Moverman's _Rampart_ (2011), or on TV shows such as _Miami Vice_ (1984-1990) and _The Shield_ (2002-2008). However, what it does bring to the table is that the archetypal \"he\" of such narratives is here a \"she\", with Kusama relying heavily on Nicole Kidman's startling warts-and-all performance to do most of the heavy lifting. Although the film does seem to be under the impression that it offers some portentous revelation about the nature of revenge and psychological torment, approaching every scene with an air of self-seriousness that can become grating, there are undeniably individual moments of great brilliance. And then there's that lead performance.\r\n\r\nThe film begins with burnt-out and psychologically damaged LAPD homicide detective Erin Bell (Kidman) awakening in her car looking decidedly worse for wear. Heading to the nearby scene of a John Doe murder, Bell is not welcomed by the other cops, who can't believe she still has a job. Upon examining the body, Bell notices a distinctive tattoo on the victim's neck. Telling the other cops she may know who the John Doe is, she leaves. Back at the station, she receives an unmarked envelope containing a $100 bill stained from a dye pack. Ascertaining that the bill is from a botched bank robbery committed years previously, Bell comes to believe that the leader of the crew, Silas (Toby Kebbell), who hasn't been heard from in almost 20 years, is back in the city. Determined to find him, dead or alive, she begins to work her way through the surviving members of the crew in an effort to locate him \u2013 Toby (James Jordan), who's terminally ill and has been released from prison on compassionate grounds; Arturo (Zach Villa) who has turned his life around and is offering pro bono legal services to immigrants; DiFranco (Bradley Whitford), who wasn't a member of the crew, but did launder money for them and acted as their fence; and Petra (the always-excellent Tatiana Maslany), Silas's girlfriend. Meanwhile, Bell is also trying to deal with her rebellious 16-year-old daughter, Shelby (Jade Pettyjohn), who is dating Jay (Beau Knapp), a man in his 20s. Running concurrently to the film's present, via a series of flashbacks, we learn that 17 years earlier, Bell and her then partner, Chris (Sebastian Stan), were given an undercover assignment to bust Silas and his crew. Posing as a couple, they successfully infiltrated the group, getting the same style of tattoos as seen on the John Doe. However, somewhere along the line, they fell in love for real, with subsequent events resulting in the damaged person Bell has become.\r\n\r\nAlthough Kusama doesn't explicitly foreground it, gender politics are an important aspect of the film. Much has been made of Kidman's physical transformation, although both Kusama and Kidman have argued that her appearance is not what the film is about, nor should it be critics' focus. Still though, we're not quite at a point where a woman altering her appearance for a role is unremarkable (when women do it, it's \"brave\"; when men do it, it's \"acting\"), and like Charlize Theron in Patty Jenkins's _Monster_ (2003), Kidman's commitment to the part can only be applauded. In terms of the type of character she's playing, much as did Caoilfhionn Dunne in Ciaran Creagh's little-seen Irish film _In View_ (2016), Kidman commits to Bell as an unlikable, violent, and psychologically ruined character, which in and of itself challenges conventional notions of what a female lead should be. It's undeniably fascinating seeing an actress (and a major one at that) get her teeth into the kind of gritty, embittered, and irredeemable character we usually see a man play, especially insofar as the film resists the urge to soften Bell or provide her with a clear road to redemption. In this sense, she has a lot in common with LT (Harvey Keitel) in _Bad Lieutenant_; much of what she does has just as good a chance of dragging her down further to hell as it does of lifting her up. But she's beyond caring about herself, concerned only with busting (and preferably killing) Silas. Of course, she's also a mother, and like so many male archetypes, she has not been there for her child. This aspect of her character in particular, compels the audience to ask questions of itself regarding how men and women are perceived on screen \u2013 is a woman neglecting a child more forgivable than a man doing so, or less; do we simply expect women to automatically be good mothers in ways we never consider in relation to men as fathers? What do our presuppositions about motherhood on screen say about us as individuals and as a society?\r\n\r\nKidman's commitment to the role of Bell produces a chameleonic performance that carries most of the film's weight. Never afraid to take risks (see Lars von Trier's _Dogville_, Robert Benton's _The Human Stain_, Jonathan Glazer's _Birth_, John Cameron Mitchell's _Rabbit Hole_, Lee Daniels's _The Paperboy_, Kim Farrant's _Strangerland_), Kidman completely immerses herself within Bell (who is both the destroyer of the title, and the destroyed). With Bell appearing in literally every scene, there's a sense of authenticity in Kidman's performance, almost as if this were a documentary, and Bell was a real person. It's haunting, disturbing, and heartbreaking all at once. Of course, the makeup design by Bill Corso (_How the Grinch Stole Christmas_; _Foxcatcher_; _Kong: Skull Island_), the hair design by Barbara Lorenz (_Last Days in the Desert_; _Nice Guys_; _La La Land_), and, to a lesser extent, Audrey Fisher's costume design all play their part in turning Kidman into this broken shell. The flashback structure is also important vis-\u00e0-vis the performance, as Kidman plays Bell very differently in these scenes \u2013 her hair is more kempt, her skin smoother (via some subtle de-ageing VFX), her eyes don't droop, her teeth have not yet turned yellow, her gait is more upright, she smiles a couple of times, her voice is more authoritative. This contrast is also true for Toby and Petra. In the flashback scenes, Toby has bleached blond hair, with a loudmouth, devil-may-care attitude, whilst Petra is wide-eyed, something of an innocent, not really taking anything too seriously. When we meet them in the present, however, Toby is literally dying, confined to bed and hooked up to machines to help him breathe, whilst Petra has undergone a similar transformation as Bell \u2013 her innocence is gone, replaced by cynicism, anger, and bad skin.\r\n\r\nAn especially good scene for Kidman (and for Pettyjohn) comes towards the end of the film. Bell and Shelby are in a diner, with Bell trying to scare some sense into her daughter, telling her that she has the potential to do something really good with her life. The dialogue then turns to Shelby explaining that when she was asked to talk about a happy memory with her mother, the only thing she could think of was getting lost in a forest in the middle of winter, with Bell carrying Shelby on her back. Shelby says, \"_I felt safe because I was with you_\". However, she then immediately turns it around, talking about how she realised something was wrong when she noticed Bell's shoes, which were not hiking boots, realising that they were completely lost, and prompting her to ask, \"_why are we even out here?_\" In the flashback, Bell has no answer. In the present, she sheds a couple of tears. But she still has no answer. It's a powerful scene for both actresses, probably the most emotional in the film.\r\n\r\nThematically, the film concerns itself with the long-lasting psychological effects of experiencing significant trauma. No one says Bell is suffering from PTSD, but she sure ticks a lot of the boxes, and rarely has a film been so pessimistic about peoples' ability to recover from emotional damage. DiFranco tells her, \"_you know what successful people do? They get over things_\", and in this sense, she is one of the least successful characters you'll ever see on screen. Her memories are a cancer which has taken over her body and soul, making her loathe herself, with her anguish subsuming every other facet of her being (she never even hints at a smile in the present day).\r\n\r\nAesthetically, Kusama's LA is as cynical as you're ever likely to see the city, and obviously owes a sizable debt to Michael Mann's tendency to depict urban centres so vibrantly as to virtually make them characters - the rain-slicked streets of night-time Chicago in _Thief_ (1981); the bright metropolis of LA in _Collateral_ (2004) and the much darker vision in _Heat_; the neon and humidity of Miami and the clutter and poverty of Port-au-Prince in _Miami Vice_ (2006); the teeming modernity of Hong Kong and the traditions and rituals of Jakarta in _Blackhat_ (2015). The LA seen in _Destroyer_ is a place of dried out waterways, burnt grass, a glaring sun, endless concrete that looks hot to touch, pollution, corruption, betrayal, graffiti, indiscriminate violence. Cinematographer Julie Kirkwood (_The Blackcoat's Daughter_; _I Am the Pretty Little Thing that Lives in the House_) shoots the present in washed-out anaemic hues, white, beige, brown, lots of sun spots and lens flares, whilst she shots the past with a more saturated palette giving the impression of comfortable warmth rather than stifling heat; a neat metaphorical representation of Bell's mindset. Combined with the nails-on-blackboard quality of the score, by composer Theodore Shapiro (_Blades of Glory_; _Tropic Thunder_; _The Secret Life of Walter Mitty_), which burrows under your skin, the cumulative aesthetic effect is one of great discomfit.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are problems. For the most part, the screenplay is unoriginal and by-the-numbers, and without the power of Kidman's performance, this would have been a straight-to-Blu-ray. Kusama also struggles to break free of the restraints of the genre, which is especially disappointing when you consider the depth of emotion she brought to the otherwise schlocky thriller, The Invitation. The script also seems to be holding something back, teasing the audience with the promise of a big reveal that will transpose Bell's story into something far more universal and esoteric. The first season of _True Detective_ (2014) employed this technique as well, but the difference is that when _True Detective_ pulled the trigger, the reveal was horrifying and worth the wait. In _Destroyer_, it's hard to be certain if there even was a reveal. The script is certainly aiming for profundity, but it's nowhere near as smart as it thinks it is. Along these lines, Kusama makes some very strange directorial choices. Look at the skateboarders near Bell's car in the opening scene, for example, shot chiaroscuro in extreme slow-motion not once, but twice. What exactly is their significance? Why does Kusama shoot them as if they are offering some kind of life-altering revelation? Are they supposed to act as a voiceless chorus? Are they a metaphor for something? The pacing can also be sluggish at times, lacking in urgency, and thus undermining the existential crisis at the heart of the film. This is especially true if you figure out the twist, which my colleague did in literally the second scene.\r\n\r\n_Destroyer_ is an average story elevated by the commitment of its leading actress and some laudable aesthetic choices. It's a cynical and humourless film noir aspiring to something more substantial, but never really accomplishing it. However, its unflinching depiction of devastating emotional trauma, presenting Bell as an open wound, slowly bleeding out, is brilliantly handled. The complete inverse of films which depict characters responding to tragedy with humour, optimism, and determination, _Destroyer_ is brutally nihilistic, giving us a character whose obsession is both keeping her alive and killing her. Although it will be far too lugubrious for some, the film has much to recommend it, not the least of which is that extraordinary performance at its centre.","id":"5d27f267be4b361ac49f4ba4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d27f267be4b361ac49f4ba4","movie_id":471507}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I have to say that I quite enjoyed this movie. Was there a lot of juvenile jokes? Oh yes. Was the characters sometimes over the top and silly? Yes again. Was the script and story anything to write home about? Of course not! Was there a lot of gratuitous violence? Hell yes! But then, this was pretty much what could be expected. Anyone offended or surprised by this should not really have picked this movie in the first place.\r\n\r\nDespite the fairly juvenile jokes, the sometime illogical script and the way over the top chop-chop-and-chop-some-more violence I had great fun watching this movie. I really enjoyed the action sequences a\u2019la Kill Bill, the special effects and yes, the jokes. Most of the time at least)\r\n\r\nEverything was so silly and over the top that it actually became funny. Each scene, taken by itself, would probably have been considered silly, or even bad, by me but stringed together in the context of the movie as a whole it just worked. For me at least.\r\n\r\nThe action sequences, CGI and everything that should be in a superhero movie was, in my mind, quite good. Also, despite not really being anything to write home about the story was quite adequate. Simple, straightforward and a lot better than the crap that a lot of the stuff that social and political correctness preaching writers at Marvel are spewing out these days.\r\n\r\nI definitely liked Cable as the hard hitting ass-kicking cyborg. When Domino was first introduced I was not impressed, even though she\u2019s hot. I mean, luck as a superpower? However, when she started to pull all these hilarious stunts with these incredibly unbelievable chains of events I quickly changed my mind. Oh, and I did like Deadpool of course. That goes without saying. If you do not like the main protagonist it is difficult to like the movie itself is it not?\r\n\r\nMost of the other characters were between okay and so so. The one character I never really liked was Firefist. He was never funny, just incredibly stupid and childish.\r\n\r\nThe team of fellow mutant \u201cwarriors\u201d that Deadpool pulled together? Well let\u2019s say that I am not that disappointed that they were somewhat \u201cexpendable\u201d but it looks like that was the whole point of it. When the first of them whammed into that bus I thought \u201cWhat the f\u2026?\u201d and then it just continued with one gory event following another. Nice touch with the blue blood by the way.

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"Burning singes its psychological character study with a thrillingly igneous mystery. The cosmic fires of the sun. Its radiance encapsulating our world with warmth and tenderness. The perfect distance for sustainability. Equilibrium. Its rich beating rays corrupting the impressionable youth, granting life in the most deciduous souls. The Sun sets. And much like its vanishing point, the resonance of its warmth dissipates, only leaving numbing bitterness.\r\n\r\nChang-Dong\u2019s adaptation of Murakami\u2019s \u2018Barn Burning\u2019 is an arresting piece of psychology. An ambiguous analysis perceiving the wealthy to emotionally manipulate the aspiring, culminating into a study on the human condition. A complex aura of social anatomisation that defies the genres that are seamlessly blended. A story not entirely based on the perspective of the naive Jongsu, who faces solitude due to his mother abandoning him and father incarcerated. Neither does it revolve around the suggestible Haemi and her eternal yearning for disappearance as she travels to Kenya. Nor the ominous Ben, arriving back with Haemi after her trip, confessing his hobby for frequently burning down greenhouses.\r\n\r\nThe enigmatic exploration comes from the gaps in between these surreptitious characters. The bonds they develop. Thematically, Burning is an endeavour in illustrating envy. The young envious of the rich. The lonely desirous of relationships. The insatiable hunger for perishing one\u2019s soul. A contemporary strand of human nature that is derived from Chang-Dong\u2019s acute screenplay. Substituting elongated conversations for hypnotising scenes of visual splendour, exercising his artistic flair for storytelling. Haemi, whilst enthused by marijuana, joyously dancing against the backdrop of the twilight sky in a one-take sequence. Not only does this depict her thirst for vanishment, as she sways to her claimed \u201cGreat Hunger\u201d dance, but her eternal solidarity as the Sun sets in front of her darkened silhouette.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Chang-Dong references the Sun throughout this ethereal piece, notably when Haemi invited Jongsu to her apartment. Its rays provide solace for her, but a shining memory for him. For the split second that the Sun reflects off Seoul Tower and through her quaint window, Jongsu habitually alters his psychology. The sheer power of its beauty has the ability to emotionally change the mind, and Chang-Dong poetically conveys that through showcasing the diamond sky. The cold pale blues complementing the warm pastel yellows, with much gratification for Kyung-pyo\u2019s cinematography. A battle for luminescence that likens itself to the internal conflict of subduing envy.\r\n\r\nChang-Dong alters the slow-burning pace for the second half, introducing elements of mystery that makes this feature his most thrilling yet. Questionable plot points become answered through perceptible descriptions that offer an open-ended interpretation. What actually happened to Haemi? Chang-Dong purposefully refuses to literarily conclude that question, invoking your mind to fill in the blanks. A simple yet captivating device that opens its arms to the audience, bringing them closer to the characters than ever before.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, this seamless transition offers several plot points concluding in a quick manner, in particular the final ten minutes. Chang-Dong had a tendency for continuing the story which should\u2019ve been finalised minutes beforehand, further losing the arresting power of Burning\u2019s thematic presence. Arguably, the conclusion offers a morality in fatherhood and how upbringing can alter justice, yet his insistence in clearly concluding the mystery was underwhelming. Offering a one-note ending. Juxtaposing the dimensionality of Ah-in, Jong-seo and Yeun\u2019s sensational performances throughout the runtime, and Mowg\u2019s multi-faceted score.\r\n\r\nBurning may not be the fiery inferno that viewers of traditional thrillers have come to expect. Far from it, in fact. Its purposeful slow-pace and meditative approach forces the audience to appreciate the finer details within the characters and environment. Offering allegories on classism and egalitarianism through an ambiguously visualised narrative that shines brightly amongst modern Korean cinema. Burning has its embers glowingly ferociously.","id":"5e207044f04d010013106936","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e207044f04d010013106936","movie_id":491584}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"_**A slow-burning mystery about economics, class, and sexual jealousy. And cats.**_\r\n\r\n> _For a long time, I've wanted to tell a story about young people, and in particular, the young people of this generation. Some of my past projects were named Project Rage. That was because it seems that today, people all over the world, regardless of their nationality, religion, and social status, are angry for different reasons. The rage of young people is a particularly pressing problem. The millennials living in Korea today will be the first generation that are worse off than their parents' generation._ _They feel that the future will not change significantly. Not able to find the object to direct their rage at, they feel a sense of debilitation. This film is about young people who feel impotent, with rage bottled up inside them._\r\n\r\n- Lee Chang-dong; \"_Burning_ Director Lee Chang-dong: Still Angry After All These Years\" (Patrick Frater); _Variety_ (December 3, 2018)\r\n\r\nA thriller about a missing person. An allegory of class division. A study of generational alienation. A fable about modern consumerism. A dramatisation of psychological breakdown and genetically inherited rage. An analysis of socio-economic disenfranchisement. A critique of toxic masculinity and its concomitant misogyny. A condemnation of middle-class gentrification. A threnody for a traditional Korea that's slowly being replaced by faceless cosmopolitanism. An extended rib on Schr\u00f6dinger's cat. The story of an impoverished novelist-wannabe, a yuppie pyromaniac, and the strange woman that brings them together, then tears them apart. _Beoning_ [_Burning_] is all of these. And none of them. This is a narrative fundamentally built on questions, very few of which are answered definitively.\r\n\r\nIn his first film in eight years, writer\/director Lee Chang-dong (_Oasis_; _Secret Sunshine_; _Poetry_) begins this protean narrative as an almost John Hughes-esque teen romance, before shifting gears into a story of sexual and economic jealousy, then morphing into the tale of a pseudo-film noir amateur sleuth, before finally allowing itself to visit the thriller territory that has lurked just outside the frame since the opening few scenes. Essentially, it's a psychological drama about three people. Although, it's possible that only one of those people is real. There are also two cats. Or maybe only one cat. It's a long journey (148 minutes), and, for some, the payoff will not be worth the length of time taken to get there. Others, more used to concrete black-and-white yes-and-no narratives, will be unimpressed with how steadfastly the film refuses to yield its secrets. For myself, it's a two-and-a-half-hour movie with only three characters of which to speak (real or not) that is intimately tied to a _milieu_ I'm completely unfamiliar with, yet it managed to hold my attention for almost the entire time. It has an undeniable ability to burrow under your skin very early on, so even though in the first two hours, there are literally only two major plot points, I was fully invested. And, man alive, is it tense. Lee's mastery of tone is quite something, keeping the viewer off-balance from the get-go, bestowing portentous significance upon the most inanimate and innocent of objects, only to later reveal that whilst we were trying to figure out the importance of item a, we missed the significance of item b. And although in the last half-hour, I did start to fidget a little, I thought the ending was wonderfully ambiguous (albeit, just a tad predictable). The acting is terrific, the cinematography superb, and you could certainly do worse than invest your time in this tantalising filmic Rorschach test.\r\n\r\nSet in contemporary South Korea, the film tells the story of Lee Jong-su (Yoo Ah-in), a shy and taciturn man in his late teens whose family home in Paju lies so close to the DMZ, that when the wind is blowing south, Communist propaganda can be heard. Having studied creative writing in college, Jong-su has aspirations to be a novelist but is having a hard time writing anything. In the meantime, he's trying to hold together the family's single-cow dairy farm, as his mother left with his sister many years previously, and his father, Lee Yong-seok (Choi Seung-ho), is currently standing trial for an unspecified altercation with a neighbour. Whilst working as a part-time delivery man in Seoul, Jong-su encounters Shin Hae-mi (an extraordinary debut performance from Jun Jong-seo). She claims they went to school together, although he doesn't remember her, which she attributes to the plastic surgery she has had in the intervening years. Developing a friendship, she invites him back to her apartment a few days later, explaining she will shortly be travelling to Africa, and asking him to feed her cat, Boil. He agrees, and the two have sex. Captivated, Jong-su happily feeds Boil, and even though every time he comes to the apartment, the cat is nowhere to be seen, the food and water are disappearing, so Jong-su thinks little of it, spending his time there masturbating and thinking of Hae-mi. A few weeks later, she calls and asks if he can pick her up at the airport. However, to his confusion, she brings with her Ben (Steven Yeun, performing under his birth-name, Yeun Sang-yeop), a confidant, irritatingly polite, and extremely wealthy young man whose swanky Gangnam District pad is everything Jong-su's ramshackle farm is not. When asked what he does for a living, Ben cryptically responds,\r\n\r\n> _to put it simply, I play. Nowadays, there is no distinction between working and playing._\r\n\r\nThe trio develop an odd relationship, with Hae-mi at times appearing to be dating both men, and at others, neither; Ben doesn't seem to regard their set-up as unusual, and Jong-su is too withdrawn and lacking in confidence to seek clarification. One evening, as the trio smoke weed at Jong-su's farm, Hae-mi recalls falling into a nearby well. However, not only does Jong-su not remember the incident, but is also unaware of any wells in the area. When Hae-mi falls asleep, Jong-su admits to Ben that he loves her, and Ben tells him about his strange hobby of burning greenhouses. Despite himself, Jong-su is fascinated. A few days later, however, Hae-mi is nowhere to be found; her apartment cleaned and emptied, her phone disconnected. Jong-su, suspecting Ben to be involved, sets out to find her.\r\n\r\nAdapted from Haruki Murakami's (very) short story \"Barn Burning\", published in _The New Yorker_ in 1983, and later collected in the 1993 anthology, _Z\u014d no sh\u014dmets_u [_The Elephant Vanishes_], _Beoning_ (the first Korean film to make it onto the shortlist for Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars, although it failed to secure one of the final five nominations) was written for the screen by the director and Oh Jung-mi (in her feature debut). The film differs from Murakami's story in a number of important ways. For example, the setting is transposed from Japan to South Korea, and the targets of Ben's pyromania changed from barns to greenhouses. In the story, Jong-su is in his late-twenties and married, and his relationship with Hae-mi is chaste. He is also less developed as a character; for example, his parents aren't referenced. The most significant difference, however, is that Murakami's story ends almost immediately upon Hae-mi going missing, something which happens with over 60 minutes left in the film. The story itself was loosely inspired by William Faulkner's 1939 short story of the same name, something obliquely referenced in the film insofar as Faulkner is Lee's favourite author, and Ben is seen reading a Faulkner anthology. This literary provenance is important, as all three texts deal with class division, economic jealousy, and vengeance; a common thread is a male \"have-not\" growing envious of a \"have\", and deciding to take action against what he perceives as an unfair distribution of wealth.\r\n\r\n_Beoning_ is masterfully constructed upon a foundation of questions, only a very few of which are answered. If you accept this from the get-go, you'll be much more predisposed to enjoying the film on its own terms. Indeed, ambiguity is not solely reserved for the big questions, such as why does Jong-su not remember Hae-mi from school; what happens to Hae-mi; what does Ben do for a living; is his admission that he has never cried evidence of sociopathy; does he really burn down greenhouses. There's a whole host of smaller mysteries running alongside them - why does Hae-mi seem to rig a raffle so that Jong-su wins; what exactly did Jong-su's father do; who is calling his home in the middle of the night and hanging up; why does he stare at his father's knives the way he does; where is his sister; does Boil exist; is Ben's rescue cat the same cat as the never-seen Boil; did Hae-mi really fall down a well? Although some (or more) of these questions remain unanswered, there are certainly clues scattered throughout (I'd imagine it's a film that'd reward a second look), but your interpretation of those clues may very well differ entirely from mine (looking around online, I've seen at least five different readings of the final scene alone).\r\n\r\nThematically, the film covers a plethora of issues; toxic masculinity, alpha and beta males, economics and consumerism, class, the place of women in Korean society, sexual jealousy, the death of a bucolical way of life, working-class privations, faceless capitalism, the price of success, hope, writer's block. Of course, some are more foregrounded than others, with economics in particular emphasised. For example, the film cuts from a scene of the trio at a swanky nightclub (into which Ben has ensured they could go) to a scene of Jong-su alone, mucking out the cow stable. The contrast between the lifestyles of the two men couldn't be clearer; the casual comfort of the playboy and the stressful privations of the farmer, with Lee making a generalised point about the disenfranchisement of Korea's working-class youth. Jong-su belongs to a generation of working-class people who will be economically worse off than their parents were at the same age, whilst the gap between the middle-class and the working class has grown wider than ever. The Korea of the film is very much a place of castes, hierarchies of privilege and social standing, with Jong-su and Ben on the opposite end of every spectrum; when Ben is compared to Jay Gatsby, Jong-su sullenly opines, \"_there are so many Gatsbys in Korea_\". In another scene, a clip is shown of Donald Trump rallying his blue-collar base, and again, the point is clear; Trump, a member of the elite, born into wealth and privilege, exploiting for his own gain the fears and insecurities of the people who, economically speaking, are completely divorced from his world-view.\r\n\r\nThe film also engages significantly with gender politics. One of the things that so captivates Jong-su about Hae-mi is her provocative behaviour. Yet later, when she dances topless outside his house, he is disgusted, telling Ben, \"_only a whore acts like that_.\" It's a succinct summary of a societal double-standard; men can behave how they wish, but women must conform to arbitrary expectations. It could be argued that because the film fails the Bechdel test, Hae-mi functions primarily to further Jong-su and Ben's arcs, and is devoid of any real agency herself. An alternative reading, however, is that she is poorly sketched as a character so as to represent a patriarchal society in which women are seen as less complex than men. For the most part, _Beoning_ avoids didacticism on this issue, but to suggest that Hae-mi is simply a badly written character seems to me to be a very superficial interpretation of a film with great depth.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is also the possibility that Hae-mi doesn't actually exist, and in this sense, the fact that she is presented in such sexualised terms is because she is literally a male's fantasy, a sexual obsession born in the disturbed mind of an unreliable narrator. The film is told exclusively from Jong-su's perspective, he is in every scene, and the narrative never shifts to another focal character or to an omniscient viewpoint. With this in mind, everything we see is filtered through his ideological outlook; if he attaches significance to an object, the audience is invited to do likewise. Lee masterfully handles this tricky structural device, placing the audience directly into the same (possibly paranoid) headspace as the character. So, for example, when Jong-su sees Ben yawning as Hae-mi is recreating a dance she learned in Kenya, the yawn becomes immensely sinister, because that's how Jong-su interprets it. In this sense, if one theorises that Hae-mi is, in fact, a figment of Jong-su's imagination - an idealisation of a beautiful woman who wants him - then Ben must also originate in Jong-su's mind, functioning as the inverse to Hae-mi; a personification of everything to which Jong-su aspires but is unable to attain. The fact that Lee leaves this tantalising possibility on the table whilst still managing to analyse social-realist topics such as economics and class, is a testament to his extraordinary control over the material. Indeed, the natural light, shallow focus, and handheld nature of the cinematography by Hong Kyung-Pyo (_Taegukgi Hwinallimyeo_; _Gokseong_; _Snowpiercer_) initially suggests a gritty realism, whereas the narrative operates on a far more esoteric level.\r\n\r\nOne of the most salient motifs, if not necessarily a theme unto itself, is that of disappearance, with references scattered throughout the film - Hae-mi notes that her house in Paju is gone, as is the well she fell into; Jong-su recollects how after his mother left, his father burnt her clothes; when Ben tells Jong-su about his greenhouse hobby, he states, \"_you can make it disappear as if it never even existed_\"; Hae-mi literally says she wants to disappear; when Jong-su asks Ben if it's possible Hae-mi has gone on another trip, Ben says, \"_maybe she disappeared like a puff of smoke_\". The most important scene in this sense is an early one. Explaining that she's learning pantomime, Hae-mi proceeds to mime peeling and eating a tangerine, telling Jong-su the trick isn't to pretend the tangerine is really there, but to\r\n\r\n> _forget it doesn't exist. You forget that the tangerine is not there. That's all. The important thing is that you have to really want it._\r\n\r\nThis challenge to perception is crucial not just in how Jong-su becomes convinced Hae-mi has met foul play despite the lack of evidence, it also provides a clue for the audience as to how best to parse the film itself.\r\n\r\nFrom an aesthetic point of view, especially notable is the production design by Lee's regular designer Shin Jeon-hee, with the residences of each of the main characters nicely mirroring their standing - Jung-su's farm is dilapidated, dark, dreary, just like the sullen young man himself; Hae-mi's digs are tiny, cramped, packed to the ceiling with trinkets and books, personalised in every way, just like Hae-mi herself, bursting with personality; Ben's huge apartment is spacious, full of light, vibrant, with minimalist furniture, not dissimilar to Patrick Bateman's apartment in _American Psycho_ (book and film). The use of Miles Davis's jazz score from Louise Malle's _Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud_ [_Elevator to the Gallows_] (1958) is also very telling. Used during a key scene that functions as a bifurcation between the two halves of the film (before and after Hae-Mi disappears), the fatalistic nature of Malle's film is subtly referenced, indicating that the narrative is about to take a dark turn. It's a brilliant choice by Lee and his composer, Lee Sung-hyun (aka. Mowg), and further evidence of Lee's extraordinary control of the material.\r\n\r\nOf course, for all that praise, there are a few problems. For one, it's a little too long, and there are occasions when the narrative seems somewhat desultory. I would imagine that a lot of people will dislike the ambiguity and lack of concrete answers. Personally, I loved this aspect of the film and thought Lee handled it magnificently, but it certainly isn't for everyone. A minor issue is that as protagonists go, Jong-su is extremely passive, a character to whom things happen rather than the narrative's driving force. Again, some people will dislike this aspect, but I think it's important that Jong-su is seen as passive, especially in relation to the final scene. Of that scene, several colleagues of mine found it disappointingly familiar, something seen in any number of standard genre pieces. I disagree with that, and I think the scene benefits from a comparison with how Michael Haneke often ends his films, which slowly build from a whisper before suddenly releasing a raging scream; think the murder of the family in _Funny Games_ (1997), Madij's (Maurice B\u00e9nichou) suicide in _Cach\u00e9_ (2005), or Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) wheeling himself into the ocean in _Happy End_ (2017). Nevertheless, I can see where the criticism is coming from, as the final scene does conform fairly neatly to the rubric for a quotidian thriller.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I found _Beoning_ to be a haunting film, one which I couldn't get out of head for days, and I'm keen to see it again. Lee's masterful control of tone is extraordinary, balancing a plethora of themes within a half-social-realist\/half-magic-realist _milieu_. As good an exercise in cinematic suggestiveness as you're likely to see outside the likes of David Lynch, Terrence Malick, or Guy Maddin, Lee subtly alters mood so as to manipulate, push, prod, guide, and fool the audience, playing us as if he were a puppet master and we his playthings. The film is such that everything on screen, every word spoken, every background detail could be important. Or not. Fiercely intelligent, deeply nuanced, complexly layered, it's a film that rewards concentration. The three leads are superb, the aesthetics laudable, the script excellent. It is, simply put, the finely crafted work of a distinct and relevant _auteur_, the kind of film that could no longer be made in mainstream Hollywood.","id":"5d2bbe2ab84f94001149540a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d2bbe2ab84f94001149540a","movie_id":491584}

However, whereas _Abrazo_ depicted an Amazonian civilisation corrupted by the West, _P\u00e1jaros_ deals with the Way\u00fau people of the Guajira Peninsula in northern Colombia, whose traditions and way of life are decimated by the marijuana trade during the 1970s. Written by Maria Camila Arias and Jacques Toulemonde Vidal from a story by Cristina Gallego, and directed by Gallego and Ciro Guerra (the married couple who produced and directed _Abrazo_, respectively, and who got divorced during the filming of _P\u00e1jaros_), the film spans a 13-year period from 1968 to 1981, during which time the importance of practising sacred rituals is replaced with stories and myths about the importance of practising sacred rituals.\r\n\r\nThematically focused on the clash between ancient tradition and modern greed, the film is deeply respectful of the Way\u00fau, with Gallego and Guerra clearly troubled by the cultural losses concomitant with monetary prosperity. In this sense, the film is partly an ethnographic study that tasks itself with preserving as much as it can of Way\u00fau tradition, and partly a genre film depicting the rise and fall of a drug kingpin _\u00e1 la_ Brian de Palma's _Scarface_ (1983). Allowing genre to inform anthropology and anthropology to enrich genre, _P\u00e1jaros_ strikes a broadly successful balance throughout, resulting in a film that consistently depicts familiar genre tropes in a manner which audiences will find unique, especially those whose only familiarity with this _milieu_ comes from shows like _Drug Wars_ (1990-1992) and _Narcos_ (2015-2017), and Americentrist films such as Ted Demme's _Blow_ (2001), Brad Furman's _The Infiltrator_ (2016), and Doug Liman's _American Made_ (2017). On paper, it could be dismissed as just another gangster film, and although their adherence to the genre template does occasionally work against the story they're trying to tell, Gallego and Guerra have made a beautifully nuanced, aesthetically exceptional, and deeply lamentative film.\r\n\r\nLoosely based on a true story, and divided into five sections - \"Canto I: Wild Grass\" (1968), \"Canto II: The Graves\" (1971), \"Canto III: Prosperity\" (1979), \"Canto IV: The War\" (1980), and \"Canto V: Limbo\" (1981) - _P\u00e1jaros_ opens in a Way\u00fau village in 1968, with a ceremony celebrating the coming of age of Zaida Pushaina (Natalia Reyes). Under the tutelage of her mother \u00darsula (Carmi\u00f1a Mart\u00ednez), Zaida has spent the last year in confinement, as is Way\u00fau tradition, learning handicrafts such as knitting and weaving. The ceremony also doubles as a courtship ritual, with Rapayet (Jos\u00e9 Acosta) making a claim on Zaida. However, as a small trader of coffee and liquor, he is considered Zaida's social inferior, and was only at the ceremony because his uncle Peregrino (Jos\u00e9 Vicente Cote) is a \"_p\u00fctchip\u00fc'\u00fc_\" [word messenger]; a vital figure in Way\u00fau culture who objectively mediates between disputing parties. Hoping to put Rapayet off her daughter, \u00darsula assigns him a dowry far beyond his means - thirty goats, twenty cows, two sacred necklaces, and two decorative mules. Desperate to marry Zaida, however, Rapayet seizes on something suggested by his business partner, Mois\u00e9s (Jhon Narv\u00e1ez), a non-Way\u00fau who has pointed out that the local American Peace Corp are looking for someone to buy weed from to bring it back to the US. Selling them the marijuana grown on the remote and heavily-guarded farm owned by his cousin An\u00edbal (Juan Bautista Mart\u00ednez), Rapayet is not especially bothered that such illegal trade is frowned upon by the Way\u00fau, and he quickly makes enough money to secure the dowry, marrying Zaida, and eagerly embracing his new-found _parvenu_ status within the community. By the time we reach Canto II in 1971, Rapayet and the increasingly hot-headed and reckless Mois\u00e9s are working with a large importer\/exporter, flying planeloads of weed across the border, and making so much money they have to weigh it rather than count it. However, as time passes, and the business becomes bigger and bigger, the Way\u00fau begin to resent the presence of so many \"_alijuna_\" [outsiders] who have no respect for their traditions or culture. Working as his advisor, \u00darsula warns Rapayet to tread carefully, but as the profit continues to escalate, so too do the tensions between the various players, compounded by \u00darsula's cruel and uncontrollable son Leon\u00eddas (Greider Meza), who has grown up amidst corruption, decadence, and amorality, and who has no time for Way\u00fau tradition. When he commits a hideous crime, verbal disagreements quickly turn into tit-for-tat violence, and that violence threatens a war that could destroy the Way\u00fau entirely.\r\n\r\nHistorically, _P\u00e1jaros_ touches on four periods of huge national significance in Colombia; it begins ten years after _La Violencia_ [1948-1958], a civil war fought between the _Partido Conservador Colombiano_ [Colombian Conservative Party] and the _Partido Liberal Colombiano_ [Colombian Liberal Party], and four years after the commencement of the \"Colombian Conflict\", an unnamed low-intensity civil war fought between multiple groups that is ongoing today; Canto III, Canto IV, and Canto V are set during the years of the _Bonanza Marimbera_ [1975-1985], when drug trafficking first soared; and the film ends just prior to the ascension of Pablo Escobar in 1982. That _P\u00e1jaros_ is aiming for a grand, folkloric tale of national significance, along the same lines as more traditional Colombian myths such as _La Llorona_ or _El Mohan_, is seen in the fact that it both begins and ends with a blind bard (Sergio Coen) narrating the events; telling us this is a story of \"_love and desolation, wealth and pain_\" and it depicts \"_how a great family destroyed itself_\". Taken directly from the Homeric tradition, the presence of this figure immediately indicates the kind of story this is. Structurally and in terms of characterisation, the film evokes Francis Ford Coppola's _The Godfather_ (1972) - it opens with a prolonged celebration, and regularly features scenes of people eating, as well as social events; Rapayet is a Michael Corleone figure, a good man corrupted by his own success; Mois\u00e9s is a mixture of the sybaritism of Fredo and the volatile unpredictability of Sonny; \u00darsula recalls the scepticism of Kay Adams and the wisdom of Carmela; An\u00edbal is Virgil Sollozzo, antagonistic and convinced of the strength of his position; Leon\u00eddas is Carlo Rizzi, unconcerned with honour or tradition, who looks down on everyone around him. Additionally, the _d\u00e9nouement_ unmistakably has something of a _Scarface_ vibe about it.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, although not as striking as the extraordinary _El abrazo de la serpiente_, _P\u00e1jaros_ still looks fantastic. Cinematographer David Gallego really captures the colourful essence of the Way\u00fau with his rich and textured photography and striking compositions. He also does a fantastic job in his depiction of the vast openness of the desert, with exquisitely composed shots that make full use of the 2.35:1 format. Characters are often dwarfed by the immensity of the desert background, as if their transient existence is insignificant in the face of nature, which, of course, it is. In terms of performances, Carmi\u00f1a Mart\u00ednez is the standout. Born in Guajira and with Way\u00fau roots, she plays \u00darsula with an extraordinary degree of depth and gravitas, as someone used to being in a position of authority, and not having that authority questioned. However, even she realises she is out of her depth in Rapayet's drug smuggling, and Mart\u00ednez taps into the similarities between \u00darsula and the queen in any number of Greek tragedies, someone whose beliefs are grounded in ethics, but who is on a preordained path of tragedy from which she cannot escape. And just as the gods were indifferent to the suffering of Euripides's Medea and Sophocles's Electra, so too are the deities of the Way\u00fau.\r\n\r\nThroughout the film, the economy of Gallego and Guerra's visual language is striking. For example, early on, Rapayet, Zaida, and \u00darsula are all shown living in small thatched huts made of stone and wood. Later, however, they live in in a heavily guarded sprawling modernist mansion in the middle of the desert, where anyone approaching the house can be seen for miles off. For them, the house symbolises their success. For the audience, however, it's a symbol of the crass absurdity of their opulence. Another example is that, initially, we see Rapayet and Mois\u00e9s using only one plane to carry their weed, but later, there is a fleet of planes at their command, telling us in one shot how much the scale of their operation has increased. Tied into this is that in the early parts of the film, people trade and negotiate via goats, but by the half-way point, people are paying one another with crates of automatic weapons.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of aesthetics, although they remain within the parameters of the crime drama, depicting the rise and fall of a gangster, Guerra and Gallego are more concerned with the impact of the drug trade on the Way\u00fau than the drug trade itself. Uninterested in going into detail about the logistics of Rapayet's operation, there's no montage of planes being loaded with hemp, no tension-filled scenes of interfering law enforcement, no scenes of excessive hedonism based on the spoils of the trade (although Mois\u00e9s does like a good party). Instead, they use the genre template as a platform from which to examine the clash between the ancient local traditions of the Way\u00fau and the ubiquitous and corruptive nature of monetary accruement as found in the twentieth-century world at large. The Way\u00fau are proud of how deep their customs run and how long they have maintained them, pointing out they've survived encounters with the English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch, and various modern-day Colombian governments. However, their nonconformist and isolationist ideology has never faced anything as insidious as the avarice introduced by Rapayet.\r\n\r\nJust how corruptive it is, is seen in Leon\u00eddas, a boy who takes wealth for granted and who has never wanted for anything. Thus, he has no respect for anything or anyone - his very soul is built on Mammonism and everything he does is based on entitlement, with the culture of the Way\u00fau powerless to combat such a person. In perhaps the film's most disturbing scene, after being chastised for his behaviour by Rapayet, Leon\u00eddas \"proves\" his manhood by telling a poor man that if he eats a piece of dog faeces, he will give him a wad of bills. At first, the man refuses, but temptation takes over, and he forces himself to eat the excrement, as Leon\u00eddas looks on and laughs, subsequently throwing the money at the vomiting man. Nothing in Way\u00fau history has ever prepared them for this level of barbarism.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, much as was _Abrazo_, where indigenous cultures were corrupted by (often well-meaning) western explorers and missionaries, _P\u00e1jaros_ is fundamentally about the clash between tradition and modernity; an exchange-based economy built upon codes of honour and reciprocity destroyed by greed, materialism, and an ever-escalating series of violent reprisals and deepening mistrust. In depicting the society before the birth of the drug trade, however, Gallego and Guerra are trying to reclaim Colombia's history for Colombians. The _Bonanza Marimbera_ and the years of Pablo Escobar are all a lot of people know about the country, with their knowledge coming from films made almost exclusively by non-Colombians for non-Colombians. In interviews, the directors have expressed distaste with the glorification of Escobar, the fact that he has been turned into a folk hero of sorts; Gallego has spoken about how it pains her to see people come to the country wearing t-shirts with Escobar's face on them, whilst even Escobar's own son has spoken out against _Narcos_, arguing the show glamorises the drug trade. Gallego and Guerra argue that an entire generation of indigenous people have been forgotten about, a people who were laid waste by the years of excess during the _Bonanza_ and the horrific violence of the Escobar years.\r\n\r\nTrying to commit as much of the Way\u00fau culture as they can to film in an effort to preserve it, they are thus performing an anthropological service; the film is about the importance of cultural memory, but so too is it a part of that memory. Throughout, we are immersed in Way\u00fau culture, and Gallego and Guerra don't need to go into detail about the ins and outs of dream analysis, the complex systems of hegemony and protocol, the exchange-based economy, or the specifics of why one necklace is sacred but another is not. We're shown enough to understand how these people live - the centrality of family, the respect for the natural world, the reverence for the dead, the significance of communal ritual, the importance of ancient customs and superstitions. Above all, however, their primary value in all things is honour, which is why Rapayet getting involved in drug smuggling is so controversial for the village. Indeed, at one point he is told, \"_you no longer act as Way\u00fau, you act like alijuna_\"; one of the deepest insults imaginable in this _milieu_, driving home that, yes, he may be making money, but he has lost his cultural soul in the process.\r\n\r\nThe film makes its intentions known in the opening scene, which is built around Zaida's ceremony, just as _The Godfather_ indicates its main focus with the opening depiction of a wedding. Without any dialogue, the scene establishes the socio-political centrality of ritual in Way\u00fau society and introduces us to the social hierarchies and spiritual beliefs. This opening scene is contrasted with a later scene depicting a \"_second burial_\"; a custom where a casket is unearthed and opened, and the bones of the deceased cleaned and reburied. In this scene, although the importance of the ritual is just as paramount as in the opening, unlike in that scene, this ritual is surrounded by men armed with machine guns; a brilliant bit of cinematic shorthand to show us how much has changed. In another example, after doing something to anger a rival clan, Leon\u00eddas is hidden away in a hut, and \u00darsula performs a protective incantation. Leon\u00eddas, however, is unimpressed, saying he'd be happier if he was surrounded by men with guns. Elsewhere, a motif running through the film is the threat of a locust infestation, and when violence inevitably erupts, it's presented like a plague on the land, something that cannot be contained and that will blight all it touches.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, there are a few. For one, Rapayet is an extremely stoic character, about as forceful as Fredo Corleone, and very vaguely defined. In this sense, he doesn't really come across as a person with an interiority, so rather than being someone who pursues things, he is someone to whom things happen, a cypher at the mercy of what the writers need him to be at any given moment. Because of this, he doesn't really have much of an arc - he's essentially the same person as a drug lord as he was when he traded coffee and liquor. Along these lines, Zaida fares even worse. Despite the opening scene suggesting her centrality to the narrative, once she and Rapayet are married, she essentially becomes a background extra, having next-to-nothing to do as Rapayet and \u00darsula dominate proceedings. Additionally, at times, the demands of the genre do impinge somewhat on the narrative, with an action scene late in the film feeling out of place (although to be fair, the way it's shot makes up for the scene itself feeling fairly rote).\r\n\r\nThese few issues notwithstanding, _P\u00e1jaros de verano_ is an exceptional film, and, off the top of my head, I can't think of another movie which captured the clash between the old and new worlds quite as powerfully, with the possible exception of Terrence Malick's _The New World_ (2005). A melancholy corrective to Fernando Le\u00f3n de Aranoa's _Loving Pablo_ (2017), P\u00e1jaros tells a story of a traditional culture decimated by greed. Making a powerful statement about what has been lost, by and large, Gallego and Guerra handle the integration of ethnographic study and genre film very well, with the movie as a whole serving as an excellent example of how talented filmmakers can use genre to serve their own thematic ends without necessarily making a genre film. Neither a thriller with some local details thrown on top nor a documentary with a manufactured dramatic structure, _P\u00e1jaros_ is compelling and heartfelt throughout. The film's sense of detail, its cultural specificity, and the tragic inevitability of the story it tells serve to fuse the socio-political, the ethnographic, and the thriller into a whole that is unlike any drug film you're likely to see.","id":"5d76cf8551f99a001083fb43","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d76cf8551f99a001083fb43","movie_id":438146}

It unfortunately lacks the finality that the original had but still proves to be an effective entry in a franchise known for its inconsistency in quality.\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t call myself a fan of the franchise but I am a fan of the original film and this sequel transfers the formula made famous by said film pretty well to a Generation Z audience. There are plenty of callbacks to the first entry (one of the victims even being a babysitter) and they all work incredibly well.\r\n\r\nThere unfortunately isn\u2019t that much tension. Most, if not all of the scares are executed brilliantly but the fights between Michael Myers and his victims are pretty disappointing. The gore is awesome; can\u2019t really complain much about that.\r\n\r\nSubplots are handled poorly; despite already being in motion, they end pretty quickly which is a letdown. Writing is fine..good, not great. Humor is handled well though. Serviceable to fans new and old. It\u2019s evident that Blumhouse knows how to make horror movies and that\u2019s the big takeaway here.\r\n\r\nThe new score is brilliant.

Of course Michael escapes and it\u2019s only a matter of time before the 2 meet. Strode\u2019s doomsday prepper storyline is a bit far-fetched but that doesn\u2019t make it less entertaining. Jamie Lee Curtis makes a triumphant return as Laurie Strode. It also marks the return of Nick Castle as Michael Myers. And Myers lives up to his reputation. His killings are more brutal than ever.\r\n\r\nDirector David Gordon Green executes it almost perfectly. A lot of killings happen offscreen but you get to see the horror afterwards. And there\u2019s of course the delicious tracking shot where Myers returns to Haddonfield. The camera follows him through a suburban home where he slaughters someone. The camera follows him back onto the street and into the next house to kill again. Michael\u2019s introduction in the psych ward is also pretty memorable when all the psychos start to go\u2026 psycho. After that sequence we get the opening credits with the iconic theme. Brilliant.\r\n\r\nCredit has to go to writer Danny McBride. He respects the original, as is obvious in the countless references (Laurie standing in front of the window, Michael missing an eye) but isn\u2019t afraid to give it a spin. Who\u2019s hunting who? There\u2019s also the humor he brings to the story. And it works (the babysitting scene).\r\n\r\nOf course it\u2019s not all great. At times \u2018Halloween\u2019 falls victim to several genre tropes (girl falling when chased, questionable decisions). And although Strode\u2019s been preparing for 40 years she doesn\u2019t do a top notch job.\r\nThe biggest letdown was the character of Dr. Sartain (Haluk Bilginer). He\u2019s a poor man\u2019s Dr. Loomis whose role is too expanded.\r\n\r\nAll in all David Gordon Green and Danny McBride finally make up for 40 years of mediocrity and less (Halloween: Resurrection says boo).

The Artemis is not your typical hotel as it provides emergency medical services to members who engage in criminal activities.\r\n\r\nThe Nurse (Jodie Foster) runs the facility and with the help of her massive Orderly Everest (Dave Bautista), they ensure that only members get admitted and follow the rules as well as receive state of the art care while in the facility.\r\n Guests at the facility are giving names based on the suite in which they are assigned which involve geographical locales and there are a very strict set of rules they must follow such as no guns, bombs, killing other guests, and so on.\r\nThe Hotel Artemis is not a simple stitch and bandage facility as they offer advanced medical services such as Nanites, replacement organ printing, robotic A.I. medical treatment and other services which in 2018 seem like Science Fiction.\r\nEnter Waikiki (Sterling K. Brown), who has tried to leave his criminal past behind him yet was savvy enough to keep paying his membership fees at the Artemis all the while. He and his brother have been injured in a heist and with the city under a deadly riot, they make their way to the Artemis to get treatment and hide out from the chaos outside.\r\n\r\nThanks to their services, the hotel is rarely empty and an Arms Dealer named Acapulco (Charlie Day), and an assassin named Nice (Sofia Boutella), are also in residence. The fact that Nice and Waikiki have a past association makes things a bit interesting as guests are always mindful of those around them even though the strict rules of membership exist to ward off any threats or danger to the guests or staff.\r\nComplications arise when the near capacity hotel is informed that the Wolf King of L.A. (Jeff Goldblum) is en- route. The Nurse opts to follow the rules of first come first served and in doing so enrages his son (Zachary Quinto), who decided to barricade the Hotel to make sure nobody gets in before his father, who incidentally owns the facility.\r\n\r\nAs if this was not enough of a complication, a police officer from troubled past of The Nurse arrives begging for help which sets a very dangerous chain of events into motion.\r\n\r\nThe film is a very fresh and entertaining story filled with interesting characters, strong performances, and just enough action to keep the film moving along but yet keeping the focus as a character based drama.\r\n\r\nFirst time Director Drew Pearce gets the most of his cast and has used his script to create a very entertaining and unique film that is well worth a watch. It is so nice to see Jodie Foster showing us once again that she is one of the most gifted actresses of our time as the two-time Oscar winner goes all in to portray a very damaged and troubled character who for what she lacks in glamour; more than makes up for with a determined strength.\r\n\r\nI hope this film is a success as I would love to see more stories from the Hotel as I really enjoyed the film from start to finish.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5","id":"5b193fe30e0a261f8d0073fd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b193fe30e0a261f8d0073fd","movie_id":406761}

Which I can see Kanye doing solely because of loyalty to Damon Dash who was the man who made him a star (and because Dash's finances has gone downhill and he felt bad).\r\n\r\nThe 2nd reason is the fact that Stacey Dash (Damon Dash's cousin) have made statements that Damon Dash (the director and star of the film) was not allowed to use her name to sell the film (which he of course did anyway). She's only in it for a quick cameo but the movie advertised her as being a signifant character in the film (she's definitly not).\r\n\r\nNot the first time Damon Dash made that move with her, PAPER SOLDIERS also had her all over the poster etc even though she was only in it for about 9 minutes (which still is 7 and a half more minutes than she is in this one).\r\n\r\nAnyway enough about that, the actual movie is very much in the same line as the STATE PROPERTY movies but with even less plot. Gritty and unapologetical it plays almost more like a rulebook for those who wish to lead the life of crime than an actual movie at times, with tons of 'words of wisdom' (it's intended as such at least) in voiceover of why though shalt not snitch and why murder is sometimes a necessity etc when you're 'in the life'.\r\n\r\nDamon Dash has the lead (of sorts, I say of sorts because as the movie goes on his role is less and less significant to the story which is a unique way to tell a story I suppose) but the leadroles are kind of fluid tbh, one minute all focus can be on one guy and what he's doing to elevate his power in the game and then it switches to someone else. It's kind of messy really.\r\n\r\nThere is a crew in the film which is refered to as being 'young and wild' one of which is played by rapper Cam'ron which is an interesting casting choice being that he passed 40 a couple years ago and the other people in his crew are close to the same age as well.\r\n\r\nAnyway the first STATE PROPERTY I recall being said that it glorified murder, partly because while the murders were pictured on screen they'd play rap-music well in this film they stay way clear of that, instead in every murder scene they play classical or opera music. I lost count how many slowmotion classic music\/opera music murder scenes there was in this but there's alot.\r\n\r\nAnyway, while I was ocassionally entertained by the film it's not particulary good and it severly lacks in all aspects of filmmaking.","id":"5c0fe2ce0e0a2638b80e2254","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c0fe2ce0e0a2638b80e2254","movie_id":492684}

I really wanted this thing where all the way through_ _the film, we are led to believe by the media in the movie and by the way some of the characters talk about it, that we're safe in here in the place that we pay for, and the trouble is this kind of faceless, multi ethnic mob on the outside, and that actually we always think the problem is on the outside, but really, the problem is on the inside. That's absolutely what the point of_ Artemis _is; we kind of demonise the outside world, but the real demons are our own._\r\n\r\n- Drew Pearce; \"_Hotel Artemis_ Director Drew Pearce on Making His Personal Genre Movie, His Influences, and More\" (Jack Giroux); _Slash Film_ (June 7, 2018)\r\n\r\n_Hotel Artemis_ is a film which doesn't do a great deal wrong. However, it is also a film which doesn't do a great deal right. It just kind of hangs in mid-air, with clich\u00e9d characters acting in clich\u00e9d ways and having clich\u00e9d conversations. And then it ends. It's not actually _about_ anything. It's also predictable, with precious little substance. It looks pretty though.\r\n\r\nIn 2028, riots are tearing Los Angeles apart. The film takes place primarily in the eponymous Hotel Artemis, a secret hospital for criminals in the heart of the city. The motley crew of characters, many of whom are known only by the name of the room in which they're staying, include Waikiki (Sterling K. Brown) and his brother Honolulu (Brian Tyree Henry), bank robbers who have been involved in a shootout with police; Nice (Sofia Boutella), an assassin who \"_only kills important people_\", and just so happens to be Waikiki's ex-girlfriend; and Acapulco (a spectacularly miscast Charlie Day), a weapons dealer and all round weasel. Also present are The Wolf King (Jeff Goldblum), Los Angeles's most feared gangster, who also finances the hospital, his incompetent son, Crosby (an underutilised Zachery Quinto), and Morgan (Jenny Slate), a cop injured in the riots. The hospital is run by \"Nurse\" (Jodie Foster), an agoraphobic alcoholic haunted by visions of her past, with porter duties handled by Everest (Dave Bautista). The hospital functions because all guests must adhere to a rigid set of rules (the first of which is \"_don't kill the other patients_\") and a strict no weapons policy.\r\n\r\nSounds pretty interesting doesn't it? It's not. The dialogue is awful, the narrative beats can be seen coming a mile away, and the characters are all archetypes, with only Nurse really fleshed out to any degree. There's the loud-mouth snivelling weapons dealer, the gorgeous but oh-so-deadly assassin, the criminal kingpin and his screw-up son who just wants to be like dad, the skilled bank robber who spends most of his time trying to get himself out of the trouble caused by his unreliable brother, and the tough-as-old-boots medical professional who just wants to help people when in actual fact, she's beyond help herself. The premise may be reasonably interesting, but, in his debut feature, writer\/director Drew Pearce undermines it by populating the _milieu_ with cardboard cut-outs instead of characters. True, most of the actors give it their all (Bautista in particular gives a performance far superior to the material with which he has to work), but there's just no substance here, no depth. There are simply too many clich\u00e9s at every level to be able to overlook them.\r\n\r\nYes, it's an original(ish) idea made with a small(ish) budget, which is exactly what we need more of these days, when every second film is a CGI-infested remake, comic book adaptation, or sequel (or a CGI-infested remake of a sequel to a comic book adaptation). However, an original idea is all very well and good, but it can only take you so far; the execution has to be there as well, and this is where _Hotel Artemis_ falls down. It's simply not an especially well-made film. Pearce does a reasonably good job with the directorial side of things, as aesthetically, the hotel is really intriguing, with a nice use of primary colours and a well-conceived juxtaposition of modern technology and 3D printers with retro d\u00e9cor and secret passages. In terms of plot, however, there's just nothing to latch onto or get your teeth into. None of the characters really do or say anything very interesting, and a half-hour into the film, as it became increasingly apparent that none of them were going to be developed to any great degree, I just stopped caring.","id":"5cd9fc63c3a3683c67c4054a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cd9fc63c3a3683c67c4054a","movie_id":406761}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Palpably tense and thematically complex, this is deeply uncomfortable viewing, with a graphic but wholly justified rape scene_**\r\n\r\n> _Women quickly learn that rape is a crime only in theory; in practice the standard for what constitutes rape is set not at the level of women's experience of violation but just above the level of coercion acceptable to men._\r\n\r\n- Judith Lewis Herman; _Trauma and Recovery: the aftermath of violence - from domestic abuse to political terror_ (1992)\r\n\r\n> _The relationship is certainly abusive but I mean that's a greyscale.

He has too many things that she needs, not just material things but the allure of power and he's got a family. To me, it's very much about her needing that family and needing that togetherness. They're a lot of fun and silly and stupid and fun which is what people need, so that was a very important aspect of it to me. It's not Michael she's going for, it's the whole package. In my mind she's a very lonely girl, so if she left there'd really be nowhere for her to go and I don't think most people are capable of taking that decision of going from something to nothing. I think people will go a long way to stay accepted within a group. I mean, we are social animals. We will do whatever it takes to be loved by the group not just the leader._\r\n\r\n- Isabella Ekl\u00f6f; \"Isabella Ekl\u00f6f talks about her film, _Holiday_\" (Addy Fong); _Something You Said_ (June 12, 2018)\r\n\r\nA film I've always admired is David Cronenberg's _A History of Violence_ (2005), which features two graphic sex scenes between Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) and his wife Edie (Maria Bello). The first is a beautifully shot scene of two people madly in love, who still find one another a turn on; it's tender, gentle, playful, and incredibly erotic (it's also the first film ever to depict a married couple engaged in a 69). The second takes place after their comfortable life has imploded because of his past deeds, and it's brutally rough, void of any tenderness or affection; just two people fucking for the hell of it on a staircase with no carpet. I mention this because, in these two scenes, the themes of the entire film are spelt out perfectly, encapsulating as they do how catastrophically wrong things have gone and the degree to which their love for one another has been compromised. So if ever there was a film with thematically justified sex scenes, it was here. In the same sense, explicit but vital rape scenes can be found in films such as Gaspar No\u00e9's _Irr\u00e9versible_ (2002), Lukas Moodysson's _Lilja 4-Ever_ (2002), and Ulrich Seidl's _Import\/Export_ (2007). And now so too _Holiday_. Director Isabella Ekl\u00f6f's debut film, _Holiday_ features an explicitly graphic rape scene that pushes all kinds of boundaries, and that will prove too much for some. No doubt it will be labelled gratuitous, exploitive, and voyeuristic, (accompanied by the usual asinine and reductive claims of \"worst film ever\"), when in actual fact it's the opposite - a narratively crucial and thematically essential provocation.\r\n\r\nTelling the familiar story of a sybaritic gangster's moll who realises she's in a bad situation, _Holiday_ delights in upending generic norms. In this sense, it's thematically similar, although tonally different, to Coralie Fargeat's mesmerising rape\/revenge thriller, _Revenge_ (2017), which tackles all manner of androcentric tropes, subverting some, inverting others. Ekl\u00f6f has cited both No\u00e9 and Seidl as influences, and as in many of their films, it's difficult to tell whether she's trying to convey a point about an inherently aggressive, territorial, and amoral human condition, or if she is just daring the audience to be offended. Co-written by Ekl\u00f6f and Johanne Algren, the film is cold and hard, clinically detached from both its subjects and the _milieu_ which they inhabitant. But is it a post-#MeToo narrative or an exploitative recreation of the male gaze and a validation of the worst imaginable elements of toxic masculinity (and toxic femininity)? And, yes, there are some problems \u2013 the eschewing of narrative momentum and conventional character arcs, the lack of interest in eliciting pathos \u2013 but this is an impressive debut feature. The rape scene will limit its exposure beyond the festival circuit, but irrespective of that, we will definitely be hearing more from Ekl\u00f6f in the future.\r\n\r\nThe film is very light on plot, but essentially it tells the story of Sascha (Victoria Carmen Sonne), a young woman holidaying with her much older boyfriend, successful drug trafficker Michael (an intimidating Lai Yde), and a group of his employees at a villa in Bodrum in the Turkish Riviera. Shortly after arriving, she meets Thomas (Thijs R\u00f6mer), a Dutch tourist who is clearly smitten with her, and with whom she enjoys flirting, and soon they're hanging out together. Throughout this time, however, Sascha never mentions that she has a boyfriend, nor that he is a violent drug dealer who is used to people doing exactly what he wants.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, _Holiday_ reminded me quite a bit of Coralie Fargeat's _Revenge_. Both are the first feature of a young female filmmaker, both play with genderised tropes, both turn androcentric paradigms on their head, both feature graphic explosions of violence, both are set in an almost exclusively male _milieu_ where aggression and dominance is central, and both are highly confrontational (in _Revenge_, Fargeat made the audience complicit with the male gaze by visually commodifying the body of the only women in the film (Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz), whilst in _Holiday_, Ekl\u00f6f forces the audience into the position of a passive, detached witness to a horrific rape). Thematically, the films are also connected, albeit by way of inversion - _Revenge_ is about a woman fighting back against the men who have exploited and abused her; _Holiday_ is at least partly about a woman who is either unable or unwilling to engage in such a fight.\r\n\r\nIn terms of that rape scene, filmed in a single shot at a removed, dispassionate distance using a stationary camera, one does have to parse whether Ekl\u00f6f is saying something about male-on-female violence and sexual violation, or does the scene play out as fetishization of the very things she seems to be condemning \u2013 treating Sascha's body in much the same objectifying manner as Michael does, something to be used as one sees fit. Is the scene redolent of a wider commentary on the behaviour it depicts, or, in its anti-glamour aesthetic, is it simply cold observation of man's cruelty unto (wo)man? \r\n\r\nCertainly, the rape scene is pivotal to the film, with Ekl\u00f6f presenting Sascha as someone who internalises the violence done to her, as do so many victims of abuse. Two key scenes in this respect come immediately before and immediately after the rape. When one of Michael's employees, Musse (Adam Ild Rohweder), returns from a drug deal to tell Michael the buyer never turned up, Michael is furious, telling Musse the police could have been watching and followed him back to the villa. He and his other employees then proceed to viciously beat Musse for his stupidity. The rape happens next, and in the following scene, we see Musse, desperate to work his way back into the group's good graces, handing out expensive gifts, his face still bearing the marks of his beating. The point is clear; just as Musse becomes _more_ loyal after a sharp and violent reprimand, so too does Sascha seem to slide more and more into her role as sexual plaything for Michael.\r\n\r\nThe rape scene is also important insofar as it's an excellent example of showing rather than telling. At one point during the scene, which takes place in the villa's living room in broad daylight, someone appears at the top of the frame, coming down the stairs, although we only see their legs as they stop and quietly retreat. This character, whoever it is, is thus presented as doing something that Ekl\u00f6f refuses to allow the audience to do \u2013 close our eyes to the horror of what we're witnessing, pretend it isn't happening. This speaks to a societal instinct to evade that which causes repulsion, with Ekl\u00f6f suggesting we must be better than that, that closing one's eyes to suffering and violence doesn't mean that suffering and violence go away. This is partly why the scene can't be dismissed as exploitative or gratuitous, an empty and meaningless attempt to shock. There is so much more to it than that.\r\n\r\nOf course, although Sascha is blameless when it comes to the rape, in other ways, she's complicit with her own exploitation, and there are elements of toxic femininity in how she plays Michael and Thomas off against one another. She has ample opportunity to tell Thomas about Michael, but she never does so, despite knowing how violent and dangerous Michael can be. At the same time, the parameters of her relationship with Michael are never defined, and she seems to feel that stepping out with Thomas is perfectly acceptable. Crucially, she's more concerned with accruing materialistic trappings than with the sacrifices she must make and the humiliations she must endure in order to accrue them. This is not really a story about a woman too beaten down to try to leave, it's a story about a woman who knows that if she leaves, she will lose her meal ticket, and that seems to be something she's not willing to do. In this sense, the film is partly a critique of consumerism and materialism. Important here is that Michael's group represent the worst kind of vacuous sybaritism - lowlife classless scumbags with no interest in anything other than their own wealth, and with nothing to say about anything beyond that wealth.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, the film is masterfully controlled. Perhaps too controlled. For around an hour, next-to-nothing of consequence happens; we are simply presented with the loutish behaviour of Michael's group (eating, drinking, sunbathing, sleeping, and doing drugs) and the blossoming relationship between Sascha and Thomas, but there's very little in the way of what you would call drama. There is method in Ekl\u00f6f's restraint, however, with the narrative somnolence in the first half of the film meaning that when it comes, the rape scene hits with even more force.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, however, the lack of incident in the first hour will drive some people around the bend, but for me, everything is so tense, it doesn't matter that little of note happens, as rarely has a film put me on edge quite like this one. The tendency to defamiliarise the mundane and render it unsettling is introduced in the opening shot, which sees Sascha walking through a seemingly empty airport, the sound of her high-heels reverberating throughout the building. There's nothing remotely threatening about the scene, but it's just off-centre enough to instil trepidation, and this tone is maintained fairly consistently throughout. A karaoke session, in particular, is almost unbearably taut as we wait for an explosion of violence that may or may not come \u2013 will Michael kill Musse, will he kill Sascha, will he drag in Thomas's body, will something else horrific happen, will none of these things happen? Here, and elsewhere, Ekl\u00f6f plays with and manipulates audience expectation, especially genre conditioning; we're used to seeing things kick off in films about drug dealers, so we expect the same from _Holiday_.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, the lack of forward momentum in the first hour will lead some to find the film boring or \"pointless\", whilst the lack of character arcs will see others accuse it of being underwritten. Some people will also see the rape scene as unnecessarily brutal and degrading, whilst the oppressive tone and all-round uncomfortable atmosphere will simply prove unattractive to many. And although all of these issues are by design, it has to be said that Ekl\u00f6f does push non-incident slightly past breaking point, and her refusal to develop the characters does make it difficult to empathise with anyone. This is especially troublesome with Sascha herself, as she is, for all intents and purposes, hollow, so when the rape comes, we're horrified by its brutality, but we don't necessarily view it emotionally.\r\n\r\nThese problems notwithstanding, _Holiday_ is a hugely impressive first feature. Essentially about a woman who can adapt to anything so long as she has a new pair of shoes and a credit card, it's bleak, despairing, uncomfortable, and difficult to watch, but it's also masterfully constructed and thematically complex. Presenting the group's _milieu_ with the detachment of a nature documentary, we witness the physical violence and psychological brutality that's endemic to this particular world.

I think of them as \"slice of life\" tales. The story is taken up at a certain point and we follow along with her life with ups and downs until the script jumps out of her life. This is a subtle way of telling a story, perhaps too subtle if you are watching with friends or not in the mood for it. It is like that line from The Big Chill where the William Hurt character explains about art, that you have to let it flow over you.\r\n\r\nWatching it closely reveals subtleties, such as when Gloria stops singing in her car, and then has to reclaim her joy. I will admit that sometimes the movie focuses on something too mundane, like her brushing her teeth, or that it leaves out too much, such as what happens to her at the Las Vegas hotel when she is on her own. If you haven't yet watched this movie, be patient and pay attention. There is a story worth watching here, even without violence, explosions or temper tantrums.","id":"5e873aa266e4690012a77126","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e873aa266e4690012a77126","movie_id":491473}
{"author":"Bhargavi Chandrashekar","content":"Chapter 1 sets the stage for a Macro level showdown in Chapter 2.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s Passion? To work or put efforts on something repeatedly until you get it absolutely right, which one loves and holds close to the heart without getting distracted even for a second. In one of the interviews Prashant Neel, the Director had said that he has watched KGF more than 150 times while editing. He wanted to make his KGF, a near perfect craft. While shooting, Bhuvan Gowda, the cinematographer used to carry around 40kgs of the camera and its accessories on top while canning the sequences in windy and dusty region. The gigantic sets used to come down crashing after heavy wind and rains yet the Art Director, Shivakumar used to go back in erecting the same sets as they stood earlier. Yash, used to give multiple retakes with no sign of fatigue or feeling bored in that dust bowl.\r\n\r\nKGF will be made in two chapters. The chapter 1 is out and at the outset, it traces with pre-historical chronology world of events letting the audience know the importance of owning Gold and the battles for it. The chapter 1 deals with micro level of unorganized crime, Mafia and underworld. The Chapter 1 depicts about the greed and the race for one-up man-ship within many characters in getting the control of Goldmine, KGF. To enter into the Macro level of an orbit of world crime syndicate, one has to clear his way at the micro level. The dirt has to be cleaned to make way to the top. The chapter 1 ends at the doorstep of Chapter 2, which is meant to open for the Triangular battle between International mafia (for Gold), The interruption of India\u2019s Govt and Rocky (who valorously emerges out of KGF slavery, as a Messiah)\r\n\r\nThe film is narrated through the author\u2019s (Played by Anantnag) First hand experience to a News Editor (Played by Malvika Avinash) As his book gets banned by the Central Govt. He traces the journey of rocky from his birth to establishing himself as the feared crime lord from Mumbai docks to Bangalore to finally his destined place KGF. The mother sentiment is well crafted and placed appropriately throughout the film. Though the story line is predictable and replicates Ugramm template. In KGF also just like Ugramm, many characters get introduced and thus challenges one\u2019s memory to remember the count of characters. Yash\u2019s introduction in an elaborated action sequence keeps everyone engaged and makes glued to the screen. KGF falters at few places in the first half. Yash-Srinidhi scenes could have been better. The army of supporting characters may be revealed more in the Chapter 2. It\u2019s the second half, which meets the expectation and ends with retaliating climax, leaving multiple threads open only to be tied later in Chapter 2 on another day.\r\n\r\nKGF, from start to finish, is full of high octane action sequences, The dialogues are sharp and effective, Music is average, but gets compensated through an outrageous BGM (some influence from the soundtrack of Hams Zimmer\u2019s \u201cThe Oil\u201d(Dunkirk).\r\n\r\nOn Technical front: The captain of KGF mines, Prashant Neel, the Director should take a bow for bringing his vision on screen. Editing is very sharp, multiple scenes are played parallel and also intellectually blurred at few places to showcase that the character had no idea about the things to come. Ravi Basrur\u2019s music is a downer, but his BGM raises the milieu in all the sequences. The cinematography by Bhuvan Gowda is top-notch and world class (he will get all the awards if nominated functions PAN India level in 2019). The never say die attitude of Art Director Shivakumar should get all the accolades for erecting such massive sets of mines, in the midst of the dust bowls. KGF has used 90% of sets and just 10% of VFX for filming. KGF- Chapter 1 sets the stage for a macro-level showdown in chapter 2.","id":"5def3e56dc86470011c75214","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5def3e56dc86470011c75214","movie_id":564147}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Clearly comes from a place of respect, but it's emotionally unengaging and rather dull_**\r\n\r\n> _Congress should oppose any effort to put gay and lesbian relationships on an equal legal status with heterosexual marriage. Congress should oppose any effort to recognize homosexual's_ [sic] _as a \"discreet_ [sic] _and insular minority\" entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities.

Resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior._\r\n\r\n\u2013 Mike Pence (current Vice President of the United States); Campaign statement when running for Congress, 2001\r\n\r\n_Boy Erased_ is one of those films it seems almost churlish to criticise for its formal aspects, given that it obviously comes from a place of deep respect, has genuinely laudable intentions (albeit with one eye on award season), and says something undeniably important and just. Written and directed by Joel Edgerton (who also stars and produces), the film is based on Garrard Conley's _Boy Erased: A Memoir of Identity, Faith, and Family_ (2016), the true story of his experiences with conversation therapy in Arkansas in 2004. In a political climate where progressive thinking seems to be backsliding more and more, given the regressive beliefs of many of those in power, one should celebrate a film which highlights the barbaric concept of enforcing heteronormative social mores by way of psychological, and often physical, abuse. However, simply because a film has good intentions, it doesn't necessarily follow that it's a good film, and _Boy Erased_ is such an example; a film whose aims can be praised, but whose flaws cannot be ignored. Whereas Desiree Akhavan's recent _The Miseducation of Cameron Post_ approached similar subject matter from a perspective of irreverence and satire, _Boy Erased_ is far more sincere. And because of its self-seriousness and its insistence on keeping the audience emotionally distanced from the characters, it remains underwhelming, never getting anywhere near the kind of emotional highs and lows one might anticipate from such inherently sensitive material. It's a topical and morally laudable film, unquestionably. One wishes it were simply better than it is.\r\n\r\nSet in 2004, the film begins as 19-year-old Jared Eamons (Lucas Hedges) attends his first day at Love in Action, a conversion therapy program in Arkansas. The son of Southern Baptist preacher and car salesman Marshall (Russell Crowe) and his wife Nancy (Nicole Kidman), Jared is initially looking forward to the program, keen to be purged of his homosexual impulses. Run by Victor Sykes (Edgerton), the program is based on the concept that homosexuality is a choice influenced by poor parenting and moral abnormalities in a person's extended family, and thus Sykes has students draw a family tree indicating such things as drug or alcohol addiction, use of pornography, criminal convictions etc. Students must also sign a waiver declaring that they won't speak with anyone about what occurs during therapy. Other students include Jon (Xavier Dolan), who is so fanatically devoted to conversion, he refuses to even touch other men, although he turns up every day with fresh bruises; Gary (Troye Sivan), who has made peace with his homosexuality, and plans to pretend to be straight until he can leave; and Cameron (Britton Sear), a timid aspiring footballer. Meanwhile, Nancy rents a nearby motel room where she and Jared will stay for the duration of the program. However, Jared soon learns from Jon and Gary that there is no specific end-point for the therapy, and if he fails to convince Sykes that he is straight, he may be required to move onto the campus full-time. The backstory of how he came to be signed up to the program then unfolds achronologically, intercutting his increasingly unsettling time at Love in Action with such incidents as his awkward first sexual encounter with his ex-girlfriend, Chloe (Madelyn Cline); his first homosexual experience at college, with his running-partner, Henry (Joe Alwyn); a non-sexual relationship with a fellow college student, Xavier (Th\u00e9odore Pellerin); how his parents found out about his homosexuality; and Marshall's decision, taken in consultation with two church elders, to send Jared to therapy.\r\n\r\nI'm a heterosexual male from a country where conversion therapy isn't really a thing; there is only one conversion therapy program in Ireland, and, as of January 2019, a bill to outlaw such therapy is passing through the Oireachtas. Given my very limited exposure to the subject, I was more than a little surprised to learn that in the US, only 15 states (plus Washington, DC) have legislated against the practice, and in the remaining 35, it's perfectly legal. To be honest, I can't even get my head around the fact that some people won't accept homosexuality amongst their family or friends, so the concept of parents knowingly exposing their children to psychological abuse so as to \"pray away the gay\", and doing so within the scope of the law, is completely beyond the realm of comprehension. That such things still happen in a modern so-called civilised western society is both deeply disturbing and incredibly upsetting, and it is this world into which _Boy Erased_ offers a window.\r\n\r\nOnce Jared is installed at Love in Action, it isn't long before Sykes begins to preach \"_you cannot be born homosexual. It's a choice_\" and \"_God will not love you the way that you are_\". At the same time, the students are tutored in \"_masculine_\" physicality (don't cross your legs when seated, don't slouch, always shake hands firmly), discouraged from anything that deviates from heteronormative behaviour (Jared has pages from a notebook of short stories torn out and discarded), and advised on what not to read (when Sykes learns Jared's college course includes such titles as Oscar Wilde's _The Picture of Dorian Gray_ (1890) and Vladimir Nabokov's _Lolita_ (1955), he suggests that Jared shouldn't return to his studies, committing instead to Love in Action full-time).\r\n\r\nHowever, the film is not confined to the program, also offering an examination of some of the attitudes of fundamentalist religiosity toward sexuality. Significantly, when Marshall learns that Jared is planning on spending the night with Chloe, he is quite proud of his son, although both Marshall and Nancy already assume that Jared and Chloe will be getting married in the not-too-distant future. Although the film admirably resists the urge to vilify Marshall or Nancy, even Love in Action itself, Edgerton is unequivocal in condemning a system that compartmentalises anything with which it disagrees as \"_taboo_\", thereby retarding any kind of discussion. Love in Action is predicated on making young people feel guilty regarding the \"sin\" of their sexual practices and\/or impulses, whilst at the same time reinforcing the infallibility of church doctrine. This instils a deep-rooted sense of torment for young men and women who are already confused about what they are feeling - if a person's predilections are directly in contradistinction to church dogma, then such predilections must obviously be immoral and against God; the irreconcilability of innate homosexual desire with the fact that such homosexuality is a sin.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with voiceover narration over home video footage of Jared as a baby, immediately setting him up as the focal character, and inculcating us into his world. Indeed, Jared appears in every scene, although, strangely, voiceover is never employed again, rendering this initial use stylistically isolated. Visually, the film is drab and unimaginative, but deliberately so. This blandness may initially seem disappointing, given that Edgerton's 2015 directorial debut, _The Gift_, was visually impressive. However, in _Boy Erased_ the design is intended to mirror the interior of Love in Action - a place of functionality over aesthetic nuance, a place where neutralising colours are used to enforce reserve and restraint at the expense of vitality. If anything, Edgerton is too successful with this mirroring, as the insipidness of the Love in Action scenes often bleeds into the scenes outside the program. Had Edgerton, cinematographer Eduard Grau (_A Single Man_; _Buried_; _Suite Fran\u00e7aise_), and production designer Chad Keith (_Take Shelter_; _Midnight Special_; _Leave No Trace_) showed a little more _panache_ when depicting the outside world, such scenes would have been far more thematically impactful, as their visual differentiation would have served the central tenets of the film.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the acting, as Jared, Lucas Hedges has a difficult task, playing a character that becomes increasingly withdrawn and emotionally shut down as the film progresses. From the very beginning, Jared is somewhat distant, making it difficult to determine if his muted emotions are part of Hedges's performance or a weakness in that performance. For example, is his inherent lack of fear a component of the character, or is Hedges simply not tapping into the necessary emotions? That this might be the case can be seen if one compares his performance to that of Xavier Dolan as Jon, who exudes desperation and existential panic every second he's on screen. Of course, Jared is very much a passive character, with only one notable example of him asserting his own agency and breaking through the emotional paralysis which has stifled the character (and the actor). When this scene does come, it's quite powerful, with Hedges playing it in such a way as to suggest the release of long-gestating pressure. On the other hand, in a scene where he screams and throws rocks at a glass-encased picture of a male model, the performance comes across as a performance and doesn't ring emotionally true. As a whole, I felt that Hedges played Jared pretty much identically to how he played Patrick in Kenneth Lonergan's _Manchester by the Sea_ (2016).\r\n\r\nKidman plays Nancy as a woman who very much subscribes to the notion that the man is the head of the household, accepting Marshall's decision to send Jared to therapy without openly questioning him. However, it's obvious from the start that she's not entirely comfortable. Later, as she starts to learn some of what is going on behind the closed doors of Love in Action, her attitude becomes more and more adversarial. She has a particularly good scene where she finally persuades Jared to allow her to read Love in Action's manifesto, and is equal parts shocked by the content and amused by the spelling mistakes (she finds one particular reference to \"_Almighty Dog_\" especially funny and especially worrying). Kidman plays the scene with a mixture of horror, amusement, and a desire to step in and protect her child, and she modulates these conflicting emotions perfectly.\r\n\r\nAs for Marshall, instead of him being the token villain of the piece, Crowe plays him as fundamentally conflicted. He loves his son deeply and is devastated by what has happened, so he never goes the clich\u00e9d route of condemning him from the pulpit and casting him into eternal hellfire. Marshall genuinely wants to help Jared, and even more so, he wants to understand, but is prevented from doing so by a lifetime of faith and his absolute conviction of his own moral certitude. Despite the character's flaws, Crowe's quiet and restrained performance elicits a degree of sympathy for a man who is clearly out of his depth, unable to overcome the indoctrination which is now making a relationship with his son an impossibility. As Sykes, Edgerton gives an almost robotic performance, playing the character as a regimental fundamentalist. A man without any peripheral vision in terms of morality and devotion to God, he is the kind of person who not only refuses to accept opinions that are in contradistinction to his own, but who is unable to even get his head around the fact that such opinions exist at all.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite the strong performances from both Kidman and Crowe, the film fails to depict the texture and nuances of the family dynamic. All three family members are, to a certain extent, types rather than fully fleshed out individuals. Along the same lines, none of the Love in Action students are granted any kind of arc or personality beyond that of the archetype they represent. Jon, Gary, and Cameron are all sketches of characters we've seen time and again in this kind of pseudo-prison narrative, and the film often falls back on generic tropes - hypocritical authority figures; a sadistic authority figure who is abusive beyond the parameters of the program (played by Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers); the \"inmate\" on the verge of complete psychological breakdown (think Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) from Stanley Kubrick's _Full Metal Jacket_); the focal character resisting the mandates of the institution (think McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) in Milo\u0161 Forman's _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_ or Dufresne (Tim Robbins) in Frank Darabont's _The Shawshank Redemption_). Regarding Sykes, a postscript describing his own sexual preference casts his character in a completely different light, and would have made for fascinating material had it been incorporated into the narrative. Granted, this is Jared's story, not Sykes's, but that doesn't change the fact that more information on his background (especially given what the postscript reveals) would have been very welcome.\r\n\r\nIt's also somewhat problematic that the only homosexual sexual activity depicted in the film is a rape. It's a powerful scene in and of itself, brilliantly shot in a single static take which forces the viewer to watch what is happening unmediated by editing or blocking. However, it's unsettling that Edgerton never shows us any consensual and pleasurable homosexual content. True, the film is not about sexual activity, so to only show one scene of such activity is fair enough in theory. But it remains problematic that the only time we see a homosexual character acting on their impulses is a rape scene. What is one supposed to take from that? Presumably, the scene is supposed to balance against the scene where Jared spends the night with Xavier without becoming physical. However, this scene is given far less time than the rape, and the character who rapes Jared is given far more characterisation than Xavier, creating a noticeable imbalance.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that, as a whole, it's an extremely cold film, remaining always distanced, either unwilling or unable to really get into the fear and psychological trauma inflicted upon the attendees of programs such as Love in Action. Perhaps Edgerton was trying to avoid exploitative or manipulative emotion, but whatever the case, he has made a film that is itself emotionless, undercutting the harrowing story it tells by always keeping the audience one or two steps removed. Jared, in particular, is never depicted with anything resembling emotional specificity. We never feel his torment or loneliness, with his character depicted only to the extent necessary to drive the plot, and far too distanced for him to emotionally impact the audience.\r\n\r\n_Boy Erased_ is a laudable film dealing with an important subject, but it's also quite a poor film, with a disjointed narrative and paper-thin characters, redeemed only by fine performances from Kidman and Crowe. The biggest problem is that it insists on pushing the audience away, presenting the story clinically rather than emotionally, a dispassionate reportage rather than an angry denunciation. Edgerton's even-handedness is to be commended, as is his refusal to cast the parents, or even Love in Action itself, as the villains, and his avoidance of emotional manipulation is praiseworthy up to a point. However, there comes a moment in the film where you realise that you're as close to these characters as you're going to get, yet they have still only been summarised. The film will probably go on to be an important document in the ongoing attempt to eradicate this cruel practice. It will probably open the eyes of a lot of people who didn't know much about this subject. It is well-intentioned, and comes from a place of compassion and respect. It's just not an especially good film.","id":"5d31b1802f8d095259d6d5b8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d31b1802f8d095259d6d5b8","movie_id":472451}

Superbly acted and directed, there are, of course, a few problems; a subplot that feels disconnected from the main narrative, a ridiculous coincidence (the likes of which only ever happens in films), a twist you can see a mile away, and a pronounced moral ambiguity which is extremely difficult to parse. Nevertheless, this is unique filmmaking, which raises all manner of questions about how we act towards others, a crucial theme in a political arena which has seen an unprecedented growth in casual racism and xenophobic hatred.\r\n\r\nTina (a superb Eva Melander, acting under heavy prosthetics) is a customs officer with the ability to smell guilt, which makes her exceptionally good at her job. Suffering from deformities that give her a somewhat Neanderthal-like appearance, she lives an isolated life with her boyfriend Roland (J\u00f6rgen Thorsson), who is more interested in his pet Rottweilers that he is Tina. Unable to have sex because it hurts her too much, she and Roland sleep in separate beds. As the film begins, Tina intercepts a man (Viktor \u00c5kerblom-Nilsson) carrying child pornography on his SIM card. It transpires that the police have been attempting to crack a prolific child porn ring for several months without any luck, and needing all the help she can get, the lead detective, Agneta (Ann Petr\u00e9n), asks Tina to assist on the case. Meanwhile, Tina is shocked to encounter Vore (an extraordinarily physical performance by Eero Milonoff), who has the same deformities as herself. Although she smells something on him, she isn't sure what it is, and she lets him through customs. A few days later, he passes through again, this time volunteering to be searched. Her colleague, Robert (Andreas Kundler), conducts the body search, but quickly discovers that Vore has a vagina. When he tells Tina that Vore also has a large scar on his back, at the base of his spine, she is shocked, as she too has such a scar. She visits her father, Birger (Sten Ljunggren), who is suffering from early stage dementia, to ask about her scar, which he says she got from a fall when she was three. Intrigued by Vore, Tina meets up with him and offers to let him stay in her guest house, much to Roland's chagrin. Back on the trail of the child porn ring, Tina is able to identify the apartment in which the filming is taking place, and although they bust those in the apartment, they are unable to find anything on who may be trafficking the children. Meanwhile, back at Tina's house, she and Vore begin to grow closer, until a fierce thunderstorm brings them together in ways they never expected.\r\n\r\nGiven the fantastical elements of the plot, one of the most interesting things about _Gr\u00e4ns_ is how grounded in realism the aesthetic is. According to Abbasi, the\r\n\r\n> _story is stylised, it's not realism; there are other elements, and it's elevated. So we thought instead of going with that, with stylised shots or framing that kind of signals something_ special _is going on, we tried to go the_ other _way. Instead of going with the magical, we went with the realism in our cinematic language, which I think was the right thing to do because it kind of anchors the realism. Because if it wasn't_ real_, you probably wouldn't care about Tina._\r\n\r\nAbbasi has a point here - one of the strongest elements of the film is how emotionally engaging and relatable Tina's arc is; the events are fantastical in places, but the emotions are very much grounded in the everyday - loneliness, shyness, fear, love, disgust etc. The magic realist aesthetic allows the more unusual elements to exist without seeming (too) ridiculous, whilst also establishing that the world of the film is essentially the real world, just with some garnish added (in a strange way, it actually reminded me of Phil Alden Robinson's _Field of Dreams_ (1989), a film set in a realistic _milieu_ that also features, without commentary or explanation, ghosts, communication with the afterlife, and time travel).\r\n\r\nAbbasi does set up a contrast, however, between the scenes in the forest which surrounds Tina's home and the rest of the locations. The forest is presented as a somewhat magical place from the start - it is where Tina is most comfortable (an early scene in which she chills with a gigantic moose is both illustrative of her psychology and extremely beautiful), where she goes when life starts to overwhelm her, often taking her shoes off so as to feel better connected to the natural world. Later, the forest is where Tina and Vore spend a lot of their time, where they give in to their attraction to one another (in what is easily the most bizarre sex scene outside a Lizzy Borden film you're likely to see all year), and where they explore their history. Whilst everything else is filmed with a cold palette dominated by grey and washed out light blues and greens, with relatively unattractive locations, the forest is presented very differently - the colours are richer and deeper; the design elements are more imaginative; the camera work is more fluid; even the sound design is different, heightening the crunch of feet on the forest floor, the scurrying of insects, the wind blowing through the trees, the crash of water at a small waterfall, suggesting the whole place is vibrant and alive, in stark contrast to the cold stolid concrete and steel world seen elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThematically, _Gr\u00e4ns_ functions as both a straightforward narrative about loneliness and morality _and_ as a political allegory about the Other, belonging, tribalism, hatred based on difference. The opening scene establishes Tina as the emotional lynchpin of the story, showing both her kindness and her attraction to the animal world, as she gently handles a bug, before carefully placing it back into the grass. This theme continues throughout the film - there's the aforementioned scene with the moose, a scene with a fox at Tina's window in the middle of the night, a scene in which she is rushing her neighbour to hospital to give birth and stops to let a family of deer cross the road. These scenes are shot by cinematographer Nadim Carlsen with a sense of wonder, and an almost ethereal quality that wouldn't have been out of place in something like Ridley Scott's _Legend_ (1985) or Rob Reiner's _The Princess Bride_ (1987). It's as far removed from the mundanity of the customs desk or the brutality of the child porn ring as you can imagine. This is also reflected in the sex scene, which Abbasi and Carlsen shoot in such a way as to imply that Tina and Vore attain an emotional and spiritual transcendence far removed from the commonplaceness of an orgasm. The fact that immediately afterwards, as they lie side by side in the forest, he tells her the history of their \"species\", solidifies the role the forest plays in the themes of the film, as their bond serves to deconstruct societal norms.\r\n\r\nFor all her closeness to animals, however, Tina is just as distant from humans; she has a good relationship with her father, with Robert, and with a young couple who live nearby (Tomas \u00c5hnstrand and Josefin Neld\u00e9n), but her relationship with Roland is dysfunctional at best, and she's desperately lonely, in a society that shuns based on appearance. Indeed, one of the most salient themes in the film is the question of how we treat the Other, people who don't fit into our definition of normal, or whom we don't understand. Vore himself is introduced as something of a rebel against social norms; whereas Tina is ashamed of and tries to hide her differences from everyone else, he is proud of and leans into his - seen most clearly at a buffet, where he takes all the smoked salmon, and then hungrily eats it with little concern for social etiquette (or buffet etiquette).\r\n\r\nThe film also touches on issues such as what gives us our humanity, suggesting that in a world populated by humans lacking in humanity (seen most clearly in the child pornographers), maybe Tina and Vore are the most human characters, or certainly the most humane. Tied to this is the notion of finding one's tribe, and what kind of sacrifices and subversions of one's moral code, if any, are acceptable in that search. However, the film is also interested in the audience's morality as well as that of the characters'. In short, it ends in an extremely morally ambiguous manner, and, to be honest, I found it very difficult to parse what Abbasi (or Lindqvist) is trying to say with it. I don't want to give any spoilers, but in essence, Tina is forced to make decisions based on her own morality, at the expense of her emotional instincts, whilst Vore must attempt to justify something horrific (actually several things horrific) by way of arguing that humans have always persecuted beings like them. I'm not sure if the film had a happy ending or not, and although I got most of the symbolism and the allegories and the socio-political critiques, I've rarely come out of a movie with such a pronounced case of \"what was the director trying to say with that?\"\r\n\r\nElsewhere, the whole child porn subplot is troubling from a narrative point of view. For starters, it's not very convincing in its concrete details (for example, Tina is allowed sit in on a suspect interrogation), whilst the idea of a couple running a child porn ring from their apartment seems a little unlikely. Additionally, for the most part, the subplot serves to do little but detract from the main plot. I get that it's there to show us Tina's abilities and her moral code, but too much time is given to it without it being made to seem in any way urgent or important. And when it is finally integrated into the main narrative, it does so with a plot twist so telegraphed, if you don't see it coming, you've never seen a thriller before. Also, when we learn how the two plots connect, and when we backtrack in our mind to the start of the film, we find that the entire house of cards relied on a monumental coincidence which none of the characters could possibly have predicted, which cheapens both plot strands.\r\n\r\nThese missteps aside, _Gr\u00e4ns_ defies and subverts genre at every turn, remaining impossible to classify. Positing a message about how being different isn't that bad when you still have your morals and self-respect, it also suggests to those of us that consider ourselves normal, that we shouldn't be so quick to judge the Other, whether that Other is physically different, of a different ethnicity, a different religion etc. Exposing the layers upon which our society is built, the film is unafraid to suggest that hypocrisy and exclusion are major facets of Western civilisation. At a time when there are increasing calls for closed borders, increasingly irrational fear of the Other as represented by normal men and women who practice Islam, and increasingly jingoist and xenophobic hatred of anything not perfectly in line with established societal norms, the fact that Tina wants to integrate into normal society, but is essentially prevented from doing so, speaks volumes for our social ethos. The plot does go off the rails in the third act, and the morality of the _d\u00e9nouement_ is a little questionable, but this is still a fine piece of work with a lot on its mind.","id":"5d48d1ee028f14001400b495","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d48d1ee028f14001400b495","movie_id":517839}

I love the entire spectrum of hotels, b__ecause for a creative person, it's about trying on a new life. For the El Royale, I liked this idea of a hotel that had a shadier side to it._\r\n\r\n- Drew Goddard; \"Exclusive _Bad Times At The El Royale_ Interview With Drew Goddard\" (Simon Gallagher); _WhatCulture_ (October 9, 2018)\r\n\r\nFollowing the genre-bending, utterly insane, and extremely funny _The Cabin in the Woods_ (2011), _Bad Times at the El Royale_ is the second feature from writer\/director Drew Goddard, who has also accrued writing credits for Matt Reeves's _Cloverfield_ (2008), Marc Foster's _World War Z_ (2013), and Ridley Scott's _The Martian_ (2015), as well as TV shows such as _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ (1996-2003), _Angel_ (1999-2004), _Alias_ (2001-2006), and _Lost_ (2004-2010). In short, he has an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9. As it stands in relation to _Cabin_, _Bad Times_ is a similarly stylised cine-literate genre mash-up. However, whereas in _Cabin_, the twist upon twist upon twist had a cumulative effect, with the story getting better the longer it went on and the weirder things got, in _Bad Times_ it's a case of ever diminishing returns. By the time we reach the end of the lengthy 141-minute runtime (more on that later), with everything and everyone shoehorned into neatly explained niches, the film has been shorn of its vitality, leaving one with an overriding impression of \"meh\". If _Cabin_ was a genuinely new spin on a clich\u00e9d old story, playing with and subverting genre at every turn, _Bad Times_ is singularly unable to free itself from the most oppressively derivative of its generic constraints.\r\n\r\nSet in 1969, the film takes place almost entirely in the titular El Royale Hotel (actually a motel, and obviously inspired by the Cal Neva Lodge & Casino), a once popular but now fading novelty spot situated half in Nevada and half in California, with a line literally running down the centre of the property to delineate the border. To say too much about the plot or characters would be to ruin some of the twists (which is ultimately all the film really has going for it), but the basic set-up is that over the course of one night, seven people will encounter one another but not all seven will leave. There's Fr. Daniel Flynn (Jeff Bridges), a Catholic priest on the way to see his brother; Darlene Sweet (Cynthia Erivo), a singer travelling to a job she doesn't want; Emily (Dakota Johnson), an intensely private woman who wants nothing to do with any of the others; Laramie Seymour Sullivan (Jon Hamm), a slick vacuum cleaner salesman; Rose (Cailee Spaeny), who appears to be Emily's kidnap victim; Billy Lee (Chris Hemsworth), a cult leader obviously based on Charles Manson; and Miles Miller (Lewis Pullman), the motel's receptionist\/bellhop\/maid\/barman\/manager. As the night wears on, it becomes apparent that not only are few of these people who they claim to be, but the motel itself is hiding its own dark secrets.\r\n\r\nIf that set-up reminds you a little of James Mangold's _Identity_ (2003), you're not completely off course. _Bad Times_ shares very similar DNA, at least up to the point where _Identity_ goes totally batshit crazy; both are set in an out-of-the-way motel where a group of strangers are trapped overnight, and all, or some of them aren't who they appear, with the audience slowly filled in on their backstories via flashbacks. However, whereas _Identity_ failed because the last half-hour is patently ridiculous, completely undermining the excellent build-up of tension and mystery, _Bad Times_ has the exact opposite problem \u2013 the conclusion is decidedly underwhelming, failing to build on an excellent set-up, with the last twenty minutes or so lapsing into utter mundanity, and, most unforgivably for a mystery film, twists for twist's sake. The structure also somewhat recalls _Lost_ (a disparate group of strangers forced together at a mysterious location filled with secrets, whilst a flashback-heavy narrative fills us in on who these people are), and, perhaps more obviously, the high-concept, perspective-shifting, often achronological _Pulp Fiction_ (1994) imitators of the late 90s; films such as John Herzfeld's _2 Days in the Valley_ (1996), Peter O'Fallon's _Suicide Kings_ (1998), and Troy Duffy's _The Boondock Saints_ (1999).\r\n\r\nTo start on a positive note though, _Bad Times_ looks terrific \u2013 as you would expect from veteran cinematographer Seamus McGarvey (_The Hours_; _We Need to Talk About Kevin_; _Nocturnal Animals_), the photography is faultless, whilst the production design by Martin Whist (_Down with Love_; _Devil_; _Super 8_) and the art direction by Michael Diner (_Firewall_; _Night at the Museum_; _Redacted_) are superb, with the ultra tacky period detail dripping off the screen. Directorally, Goddard also has his moments with some eye-catching compositions, locked-off cameras, POV shots, and lengthy single-take Steadicam sequences. However, it's in relation to this last point where one of the film's most immediate problems is to be found \u2013 the solid directorial work is completely out of step with the vapid writing, as if a screenplay intended for Michael Bay ended up being directed by Michael Mann (although Goddard is certainly no Mann). The barely-there storyline seems to be nothing other than a hangar onto which to drape a tone and style, rather than generating that style.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in relation to this disparity between style and story, the film's second strongest sequence is the opening scene. Shot entirely from a fixed camera position, and looking for all the world like a stage play, the scene is completely wordless, and charts the course of several hours in one of the motel rooms, as a man whose face we never clearly see checks in, moves all of the furniture to one side of the room, pulls up the floorboards, hides a bag under them, places them back, puts all the furniture back, relaxes for a while, and is promptly shot dead. The scene is a masterclass in slow-burning tension \u2013 we know something bad is going to happen, but Goddard refuses to pull the trigger prematurely, so when the violence does erupt, it's a pseudo-cathartic moment for the audience (incidentally, the film's best sequence is similarly abstract, slowly plotted, and mostly _sans_ dialogue, but as it involves the discovery of an important and unexpected location within the motel, to say any more would be a spoiler). The problem is that the heavily stylised and brilliantly directed opening is so good, it spoils the audience, establishing a tone to which the rest of the film mostly fails to live up.\r\n\r\nIn direct contrast to the opening, the ending is both narratively and directorally formulaic, predicable, and trite, with the least compelling and well fleshed out character taking centre stage, mano-a-mano good guy\/bad guy dialogue aplenty, and even a ludicrous shoot-out. The whole things smacks of \"been there, seen that a million times.\" Additionally, whereas the opening is effortlessly enthralling and distinctive, as the film lumbers on, and Goddard begins to run out of directorial tricks, there are sequences which scream \"look how cool I am.\" For example, Billy Lee whirling toward the camera, eating pie, shirt agape, hair soaking wet, dancing to the sounds of Deep Purple's cover of \"Hush\" (1968) is so desperate to become iconic that it instead comes across as self-parody.\r\n\r\nAnother significant problem is that the characters all feel like generic archetypes ripped out of other films, with none giving the impression of being a real-person, with their own agency and interiority. They are, in essence, walking plot-points. The script is also exceptionally weak in how it handles exposition (of which there is a significant amount). There seems to have been little attempt to organically introduce heavily expositional scenes, or integrate them with the surrounding material. Instead, on several occasions, the plot literally stops whilst characters explain things to one another. A particularly bad example of this is when Flynn and Sweet arrive at the motel reception. Sullivan is already there, and begins to tell them the inner workings of the establishment, having stayed there numerous times in the past. Then Miller turns up, and begins to recite a rehearsed sales pitch. Simply trading exposition from one character to another doesn't mean it's not exposition \u2013 the scene is painfully slow, dull, and pointless, telling us precious little that we actually need to know. Indeed the entire issue of the motel being bi-state is strangely pointless. Aside from the novelty value, it is never factored into the narrative, and one wonders why Goddard set the film in such a specific location if he had no plans to use that specificity thematically.\r\n\r\nA final problem which must be discussed is that 141-minute runtime. Padded, and massively self-indulgent, there is enough narrative content to barely fill a 90-minute duration. One of the most egregious missteps in this respect is Goddard's tendency to ponderously play out the same scene from multiple points of view, but in such a way as to give the audience only a smidgeon of additional information, so by the third time we're seeing a scene (which was too long even the first time around), it becomes an endurance test. Also, with this runtime and so little content, needless to say, the bottom falls out of the film entirely during the middle section, as things become unrelentingly slow and contrived. Goddard seems to equate curiosity about who the characters are with filmic suspense, meaning things take a decided turn for the mundane long before the underwhelming _d\u00e9nouement_. The interesting set-up earns him a fair bit of wiggle room in relation to this, but he abuses it, pushing the audience far beyond the point where they simply give up caring about anything on screen. And when he finally does get around to wrapping things up, the last few twists are nowhere near enough of a reward. Personally, I was left feeling that the mysteries were more rewarding than the explanations.\r\n\r\nPart 1930s-style pulp fiction, part 1940s and 50s-style film noir, and part 1960s-style paranoid thriller, the film flirts with a few themes (redemption, forgiveness, karma, political corruption, the seductive nature of power), but none get off the starting grid, and ultimately, _Bad Times_ isn't really _about_ anything. Hyper self-aware, and attempting to both subvert and celebrate generic conventions, Goddard seems to think he has a bonafide epic on his hands, a portent piece of celluloid mastery which samples the best of hard-boiled crime fiction, and imparts valuable lessons in the process. He doesn't. It's more self-indulgent folly than paean of universal truth. And it's painfully dull.","id":"5cf59368c3a3685c0823747f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cf59368c3a3685c0823747f","movie_id":446021}

Drew Goddard knew how to make a wonderous and exciting thriller through its magnificent casting and so much more. All these trailers set high expectations which made me worry a little bit as I don\u2019t like getting myself too excited for movies because sometimes, I get very disappointed.

Songs like This Old Heart Of Mine by The Isley Brothers, which was featured in the trailer and sung incredibly well by Cynthia Erivo, and Can\u2019t Take My Eyes Off You by Frankie Valli just fit in the most perfect ways. Movies like _Baby Driver_ and _Shaun Of The Dead_, both coincidentally directed by Edgar Wright, wouldn\u2019t have been what it was without its soundtrack, and it\u2019s unfortunate to say that _Bad Times At The El Royale_ would have suffered a bit without the \u201860s music. \r\n\r\nFortunately, nothing disappointed me at all with this movie because the height of intensity was just there without doing to much to establish it. Jon Hamm was most of the reason, along with Chris Hemsworth, that really helped make this such a great film. Drew Goddard produced beautiful camerawork and outstanding set design. It is truly one of the most brilliant films ever created and I\u2019ve only ever been astounded this much by _Searching_ as I kept feeling like I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen. And honestly, I didn\u2019t. But the big thing that would keep certain audiences away is the level of gore that I\u2019ve only ever seen in Tarantino films and _Brawl In Cell Block 99_. _Bad Times At The El Royale_ is a lot like Tarantino\u2019s _The Hateful Eight_ but it was done 10x better. Everything just seemed to click with me throughout the long runtime and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t give this a miss.\r\n\r\n_Bad Times At The El Royale_ is wonderful with unpredictable plot twists, exceptional casting and chemistry, a smartly written script and high intensity levels. I expect to see a lot of Oscar nominations for this movie as it deserves a lot of recognition whether it be surprising performances from the likes of Dakota Johnson and Lewis Pullman or fantastic costumes and design. _Bad Times At The El Royale_ just clicked with me 100% and could not lose my attention from the second I saw Nick Offerman walk into his hotel room. I paid attention to every second and enjoyed it so _Bad Times At The El Royale_ deserves a thrilling 10\/10.","id":"5c36f3df925141531224dfc0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c36f3df925141531224dfc0","movie_id":446021}
{"author":"Gimly","content":"Okay, so I'm about to totally rail on _Batman Ninja_, but before I do that, I wanted to open it up with the following disclaimer: I thought multiple times throughout watching this \"I wonder if this could be the sort of thing that's fun if you watched it in a group setting?\". Personally, I watched it by myself, on a bad day, bedridden, feeling very, very unwell. And that's the experience I'm reviewing.\r\n\r\nMovies don't have to be grounded to be good. They don't have to be be standardised to be good. They don't even have to make sense to be good. Sometimes a movie is just silly fun and everything else is moot. But most of the time, the better a movie is (ie. The more you as the individual viewer are appreciating your experience) the more nonsense you are willing to forgive. It's easier to suspend disbelief, even a great big fat disbelief, if everything else in the movie is working. If not everything is working, but you're only called upon to accept a small amount of ridiculousness, then that will generally fly. But in some movies... In some movies, there is absolutely nothing that is working, and yet those same movies will ask you for the biggest, fattest suspension of disbelief of them all. _Batman Ninja_, is one of **those** movies.\r\n\r\nI could probably pick any one aspect I disliked about _Batman Ninja_ and write a full length review based on that single issue, but I generally try to keep these things pretty short, so rather than get into the plot, the deviation from source, the character choices, the dubbing, the animation style, the sexism, the science, the lapses in logic, the design choices, the dialogue, the nonsense, the inconsistencies within its own defined setting, the fact I was so bored at one point I literally fell asleep, or any number of the problems I've either blocked out or to list would require spoilers, I'll skip over all of that and simply say: This is the worst Batman movie I've ever seen.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605 - Of no value.

In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves._\r\n\r\n- Carl Sagan; _Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space_ (1997)\r\n\r\nThe transitory nature of human existence, especially when set against the infinity of space and time, has served as the inspiration for countless science-fiction narratives in all mediums. Only becoming more relevant as the years go by and we find ourselves in the midst of an increasingly certain man-made extinction event, such narratives usually take one of two overarching forms \u2013 they depict our inability to do anything to prevent extinction or they depict our use of technology to avoid extinction (often in the form of going to another planet). An example that falls into both categories is Harry Martinson's epic poem, _Aniara: en revy om m\u00e4nniskan i tid och rum_ [trans. _Aniara: fragments of time and space_] (1956), which is essentially about the crippling contemplation of meaninglessness that consumes the passengers of a vast spaceship (the eponymous _Aniara_) set adrift in the eternal void of space, with little hope of rescue. An adaptation of the poem, _Aniara_ is the debut feature film from writers\/directors Pella K\u00e5german and Hugo Lilja, and is an exceptionally ambitious film that is also exceptionally well made. With its measured pacing, existential musings, limited cast of characters, open-ended narrative, and stylised visual design, it's about as far from multiplex fare as you can get - _Star Wars_ it most certainly is not. Indeed, it owes more to esoteric films such as Stanley Kubrick's _2001: A Space Odyssey_ (1968), Andrei Tarkovsky's _Solyaris_ (1972), Danny Boyle's _Sunshine_ (2007), and Claire Denis's _High Life_ (2018) than it does to the escapist action-packed science fiction films of mainstream Hollywood. And yes, the characters are a little underdeveloped, with only a couple getting much of an arc, and yes, the science isn't exactly kosher, but irrespective of that, this is a provocative, morally complex, and existentially challenging film that I thoroughly enjoyed, from its low-key opening to its chillingly effective _d\u00e9nouement_.\r\n\r\nSet at an unspecified point in the future, the Earth has reached a point of irreversible decay. However, there is an escape route insofar as humanity has colonised Mars. The _Aniara_ is a massive vessel (4,750 meters long and 891 meters wide) that takes passengers on the three-week trip from a docking station on the moon to the red planet. As the film begins, we meet the unnamed protagonist (Emelie Jonsson). An employee on the _Aniara_, she is in charge of MIMA, hence her \"Mimarobe\" job title (MR for short). A kind of holodeck-like technology, the semi-sentient MIMA can scan people's thoughts and memories, and allow them to experience whatever is best suited for their psyche (for example, we see MR exploring a vibrant forest). MIMA isn't especially popular amongst the ship's massive contingent of passengers, who are kept busy with the 21 restaurants, and multiple superstores, gyms, bowling alleys, spas, and nightclubs. The _Aniara_ is, in effect, a mobile city. A week into the voyage, however, the ship encounters space debris, and Captain Chefone (Arvin Kananian) alters course to avoid impact. Despite this, a screw pierces the hull, causing a cascade reaction in the ship's reactor, and forcing Chefone to eject the nuclear core. However, the _Aniara_ is now off-course, and without the core, the crew have no way of turning her around or returning to their original heading, leaving them drifting into the darkness of space. Chefone assures the passengers that all they need to get back on course is to slingshot around a planet with a strong enough gravitational pull, but he does warn that it could be up to two years before they find such a planet. MR's astronomer roommate (Anneli Martini), however, scoffs at this notion, saying the chances of finding such a planet are infinitesimal. And so, as months turn into years, with no hope of rescue, the social contract starts to break down, and as people find themselves unable to face reality, MIMA becomes essential for their mental well-being. However, MIMA wasn't designed to be exposed to so many negative emotions for such a prolonged time, and soon she starts to show signs of failing, threatening to plunge the already despairing passengers into total anarchy.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, _Aniara_ was written in 1956 by Swedish Nobel laureate Harry Martinson. The title is derived from the Ancient Greek word \"\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2\" [aniar\u00f3s], meaning \"despairing\" or \"tedious\". It's a long poem, 103 cantos, the first 29 of which had been published in Martinson's 1953 collection _Cikada_, under the title _S\u00e5ngen om Doris och MIMA_ [trans. _The Song of Doris and MIMA_]. The poem, which is more allegorical than the film, its style more rooted in symbolism and metaphor, was written, at least in part, as a reaction to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (in the poem, it's not space debris that hits the Aniara, but an asteroid named \"Hondo\", the historical name for Honsh\u016b, Japan's main island, on which Hiroshima is located). Other influences include the still-in-its-infancy Cold War, Walter Baade's doubling of the estimated distance from the Milky Way to Andromeda in 1953, and the brutal Soviet suppression of the 1956 Hungarian revolution.\r\n\r\nThe film adaptation is divided into nine chapters, which work to mark the passage of time. So, for example, the first three chapters are \"Hour 1: Routine Voyage\", \"Week 3: Without a Map\" and \"Year 3: The Yurg\". The titles of some of the later chapters contain pseudo-spoilers, so I won't mention them here, but although the penultimate chapter is chilling enough in its implications, when the title of the last chapter appeared on screen, I was so sure I'd misread it that I had to ask my friend for confirmation. Turned out I'd read it just fine. In short, this last title contains all the existential dread and mind-bending contemplation of infinity that you could ever want. And it's an absolutely haunting way to end the film.\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to the themes. Much as is the case with the poem, the film looks at issues such as the possibility that we have already irreparably damaged the planet, the impermanence of human existence, and the sense of meaninglessness that can result when mankind is faced with the eternity of time and space. In relation to this last point, the film spends a good deal of time on the idea that human civilisation is essentially a construct used to shield us from the bleak reality that we are utterly insignificant creatures, and when that construct is removed, we revert to barbarism. Like I said, your typical multiplex stuff.\r\n\r\nOne of the film's most interesting themes, however, concerns MIMA. Initially introduced as a glorified holodeck with a few lights on a ceiling, we soon learn that MIMA is semi-sentient and can experience emotions. At first, no one really avails of her, but when it starts to look as if the voyage will stretch on for years, she becomes the most important amenity on the _Aniara_, the only thing between some people and complete mental breakdown. The most interesting element of MIMA is how K\u00e5german and Lilja depict her as half-mind control, half-narcotic. For example, it doesn't take long for people to become dependent on her services, with large queues forming, and people at the back of the line trying to bribe MR into getting them in early. Then, when MR hires another employee, she explains that she'll need to \"_teach them to resist the images_\", recalling the way people who work in pharmaceutical factories are randomly drug-tested to ensure they're not sampling the product. That's the narcotic element. At the same time, when a passenger proves unable to handle reality and becomes violent, he is forced to experience MIMA against his will and is instantly placated, essentially rendered unconscious. That's the mind-control element.\r\n\r\nIn the poem, one of the major themes is the importance of art, which is symbolised by MIMA, with Martinson examining what might happen when art is no longer capable of interpreting reality for us \u2013 what does a human society without any kind of artistic output look like, how does it work, something represented in the poem by MIMA's malfunction. In depicting such a situation, Martinson emphasises aspects such as hedonism, fertility cults, education, routine, and totalitarianism. Ultimately, however, nothing can replace the vital role that art plays in shaping our understanding of existence, nor its intrinsic importance for the maintenance of the human condition. The film doesn't really reproduce this aspect of the poem (as I said, it's less allegorical), but it does examine how people flock to MIMA more and more as the escapist experience becomes increasingly crucial to life on ship. And as in the poem, MIMA soon proves reluctant to continue processing the never-ending onrush of negative emotions, with the passengers' sense of pointlessness and despair becoming overwhelming, to the point that she tells MR, in a surprisingly moving scene, \"_I want peace_\". HAL 9000 she is not; he'd have been able to suck it up.\r\n\r\nLike in Martinson, the film also deals with topics such as religious cults, riots, and suicide; mankind reduced to its basest elements \u2013 violence, sexuality, control. An especially interesting scene occurs when MR pitches her idea for a \"beam-screen\" to Chefone; essentially, a massive projection which would beam to the outside of the Aniara, visible from its windows, and hence allowing the passengers to experience images of pre-destruction Earth. At this point, MR is working as a teacher, and Chefone refuses her request, telling her to focus on educating the children, in the hopes that one of them might be able to figure out how to turn the ship around. And if that doesn't speak to parents' tendencies to foster their own aspirations onto their children, I don't know what does. It's also typical of how the film handles many of its themes \u2013 presenting them in low-key moments wherein issues are raised but not necessarily dwelt upon, meaning the audience must do some of the leg work.\r\n\r\nAnother theme, of course, and this one not in any way unique to this film, is mankind's destruction of Earth. Whereas once, science fiction narratives focused on nuclear warfare as humanity's probable extinction event, in recent times, global warming and ecological disaster have become far more pervasive. Indeed, Martinson himself was something of a pioneer in this field, positing that we were destroying the planet long before climate change had entered the zeitgeist. In relation to this, the possibility that we may colonise other worlds is now seen not as something to facilitate exploration, but to facilitate survival. Of course, this is rendered all the more terrifying because it's not something only found in the realm of fiction - the planet _is_ dying; the polar ice caps _are_ disappearing, and with them, the future of our species. But when you have a US president who ignores the scientific evidence of his own people, routinely rolls back Obama-era environmental protections, and continually confuses weather and climate, the possibility of our changing course seems rather remote, just like the _Aniara_. And if we can no longer live on Earth, our only hope will be to inhabit somewhere else (presumably so we can destroy there too). This theme is never examined explicitly \u2013 we never learn the year in which the film is set, whether or not Earth has already died and is entirely uninhabitable or is simply on the way, nor what exactly it was that finally sent us into the cosmos \u2013 but it's touched on obliquely throughout. For example, many characters have facial burns. No explanation is ever given for this, but the implication is that they received their injuries on Earth, which, one imagines, has become unbearably hot. It's another good example of how the film subtly engages with themes without necessarily foregrounding them.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, as time goes by, and the proto-civilisation on the _Aniara_ becomes more and more tenuous, we see a multitude of issues emerging. Chefone, for example, once consumed with fear of mutiny, finds himself revelling in his position of power, essentially establishing a police state in which he isn't above murder. At the same time, religious cults start to spring up, one founded by a woman (Jennie Silfverhjelm) who is first shown as unable to handle the fact that she was going to miss her son's birthday on Mars. Even level-headed characters such as the astronomer or the tough-as-nails navigator, Isagel (Bianca Cruzeiro) start to lose their grip, becoming increasingly unable to stave off the encroaching malaise born from the hopelessness of their situation and the meaninglessness of their existence, with the astronomer voicing one of the most important lines in the film when she tells MR, \"_everything we do is peripheral_\". Uplifting stuff!\r\n\r\nMoving away from thematic concerns, the film's aesthetic is absolutely gorgeous, exceptionally accomplished for a first feature. Made with a relatively small budget, the CGI is basic but highly effective; K\u00e5german and Lilja don't try anything too complex, anything that would be beyond them given the fiscal restraints, but what CGI that they do employ works exceptionally well. The opening scene, for example, is simple enough \u2013 a massive elevator taking passengers from Earth to the _Aniara_, which is moored at the lunar docking station. There's nothing terribly complex or grandiose, but the scenes do exactly what they're supposed to do; tell us that humanity is fleeing the Earth and that technology has become vitally important to our survival as a species. For the _Aniara_ interiors, to save money, rather than building elaborate original sets, much of the film was shot in existing shopping malls and on Scandinavian Ferries, which makes sense, as the _Aniara_ is essentially a giant shopping mall\/hotel, not unlike a luxury cruise ship. For the sets that were built from scratch, they are matched seamlessly to the location work, with the sleek minimalist post-modern (one might even say Ikea-like) style of Linn\u00e9a Pettersson and Maja-Stina \u00c5sberg's production design working well to suggest rigid functionality \u2013 the _Aniara_ wasn't built for extended occupancy, and the no-frills design of the dorm rooms and the MIMA room really drive this home.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, perhaps the most significant is the lack of character arcs (although this is also true of the poem). Aside from MR, Isagel, Chefone, and the Astronomer, there are no characters worth mentioning, and even their arcs are fairly rudimentary. This is felt most in the lack of disparate viewpoints on the _Aniara_; pretty much everything is focalised by MR, so it would have been interesting to meet characters with distinct beliefs, backgrounds, and denominations (although, having said that, the poem has no such characters, and to turn the film into some kind of universal microcosm wherein all Mankind must be represented may very well have betrayed its central themes). Does this leave the viewer with no characters with whom to empathise? Yes, to a certain extent it does, but this is by design rather than a flaw in the filmmaking; the film isn't asking us to fall in love with a cast of well-rounded characters, it's asking us to engage with it at an esoteric level, and the people depicted therein facilitate such engagement. Along the same lines, I've seen some reviewers say the film is lifeless, that it's too cold and detached. I'd agree that it's detached, but again, this is by design. However, I certainly didn't find it lifeless, quite the contrary in fact, with life on ship depicted vibrantly. It certainly asks a lot of the audience, much more than most science fiction, but to equate a lack of vitality on the ship with a lifelessness in the filmmaking is to parse the film on the most superficial of terms. Rather, the tone is precisely what it needs to be to carry its themes.\r\n\r\nI will concede, however, that the science has some issues. Why, for example, would a ship the size of the _Aniara_ be used as a short-distance transport vessel? It's mentioned several times that the ship wasn't built for long-term habitation, but one wonders why. Why are there so many amenities, why is the power that maintains life-support self-regulating, why are the algae farms designed to produce food indefinitely if the ship's only intended use was to make the six-week round trip between the moon and Mars? And the practical nature of the sheer size of the Aniara throws up its own problems. The filmmakers get around the issue of the immense escape velocity that would be required for a vessel this large to leave Earth's gravitational pull by having the docking station on the moon - to enter orbit from the surface of the Earth, escape velocity must reach 7 miles per second (just over 25,000 miles per hour). However, a ship the size of the Aniara would never be capable of reaching such speeds from a stationary position on the planet's surface. So that's fair enough, with the implication being that the ship was built on-site at the lunar docking station. What is a problem, however, is that Mars is (on average) 140 million miles from Earth, so for the Aniara to complete the journey in three weeks, it would need to be travelling at an average velocity of 277,777 miles per hour (to put this into perspective, the speed of sound is only 767.3 miles per hour). If we assume that the ship is travelling at such a speed (and we must, given the distance and time constraints), the power needed to slow the vessel down upon reaching Mars space is virtually unfathomable. Newton's second law of motion states that \"_for a constant mass, force equals mass times acceleration_\"; in short, the greater the mass and the greater the speed, the more force it takes to slow down. So using a ship the size of the _Aniara_ in the way in which the film does is not only impractical, it's virtually impossible, irrespective of advances in technology.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, for me, the surrounding film is so accomplished, I can easily forgive the scientific inconsistencies (and if you've ever sat through a _Star Wars_ film, so can you). Even something as exhaustively researched as Christoper Nolan's _Interstellar_ (2014) is riddled with scientific implausibilities and plot holes, but that doesn't mean it's not a great film. The same goes for _Aniara_ (and if you're thinking it's sacrilegious to compare _Aniara_ to _Interstellar_, I'll do you one better; I enjoyed _Aniara_ more, especially in the days after I saw it, as it continued to linger in my consciousness in a way _Interstellar_ did not). As aesthetically impressive as it is morally complex, as esoterically fascinating as it is unrelentingly despairing, this is a hugely impressive debut film. Equal parts haunting and provocative, the picture it paints of a humanity pushed to extremes and faced with its own extinction isn't a pretty one, but it is an urgent and a relevant one, as we hurtle towards an extinction brought about by our own actions, rapidly approaching the point where, like the _Aniara_, we will no longer have the capacity to turn around. And when we reach that point, the only things in our collective future will be the all-encompassing frigidity, indifferent darkness, and deafening silence of the infinite.","id":"5d9d156af96a39001bf6bc7a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d9d156af96a39001bf6bc7a","movie_id":496743}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I did indeed enjoy this movie\u2026somewhat. However I cannot say that I was overly impressed.\r\n\r\nThe story was okay. I would not expect a deep and thought provoking story from a super hero movie nor would I want it. It served as a decent enough vehicle for moving things forward.\r\n\r\nMost of the actors did a good enough job of the role they were given which in some cases was pretty much mission impossible given some of the overly silly characters in the movie. In particular I got tired of Luis almost before the first scenes he was in had finished. He was just so silly that you started to wonder what age the target audience was. Jimmy Woo was not far behind.\r\n\r\nI think this leads to my main gripe with the movie. I expected a super hero movie but what I got was a fairly lame comedy with super heroes in it. It was just too much comic elements in it for me. I could probably have liked it if the jokes were somewhat intelligent but, for me, they were not. They alternated between overly silly and stupid characters, slap-stick and simple fall-on-your ass jokes.\r\n\r\nWhat about the bad guy? Well, first off, there was not really a distinct bad guy but a hole bunch of them. Unfortunately none of them had any real bad guy charisma. I assume that Sonny was supposed to be the main bad guy and he certainly had enough evil lunatic air about him to fit that but again\u2026too silly. Then we have the lame Jimmy Woo who was just annoying. The Ghost was probably the best one but then she was not really a bad guy was she?\r\n\r\nI did like most of the action and the special effects though. The playing around with shrinking and returning to normal size, or greater, was both cool and funny. This shrinking business is of course a difficult theme to work with from a science and logic point of view. For instance, if you shrink a car to the size of a toy car it still weighs like a full size one and you cannot just pick it up. And what about the lab popping up and down all the time? Why weren\u2019t everything shaken to bits inside when they started to run around with it? And don\u2019t get me started about electricity and plumbing. But then, in this kind of movie I would say just just have to turn off that part of your brain. It made for some cool scenes after all.\r\n\r\nI also did like that the story was more of a down to Earth story. No overall galactic plot, no snapping of fingers to make\u2026well you know what. Okay, there was the post credit scenes which was a bit of an annoying tie in. Perhaps best of all though, I could not really feel much SJW or other form of politically correct preaching being showed down my throat. Today that is a great plus for any movie.\r\n\r\nSo, to sum up, I did enjoy it but it was not great and I was indeed a little bit disappointed at the end.","id":"5bfa580592514104cc022459","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bfa580592514104cc022459","movie_id":363088}

{"author":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","content":"\u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp\u201d is a really weird Marvel movie.\r\n\r\nLike its pint-sized superhero, the film doesn\u2019t quite fit in with the typical MCU big screen canon and is a laid back yet thoroughly forgettable entry into the fatigued superhero genre. The story doesn\u2019t try to tie too much together (save for a mid-credits scene), there\u2019s not an over-dependence on rambunctious CGI effects, and the attempts at humor feel oddly forced (I\u2019d estimate only 30% of the jokes land successfully). Despite the lame title characters and the ever-likeable Paul Rudd\u2018s offhand charisma, this film gives the impression that it\u2019s an average C student trying desperately to overcome underdog status and achieve a place on the honor roll.\r\n\r\nThe best part of the film besides Rudd (he makes this one, just like every movie he\u2019s cast in, impossible not to enjoy at least a little), are the special effects. Sure, they\u2019re all computer generated, but they\u2019re some of the most creative since 2016\u2019s \u201cDoctor Strange.\u201d The worst part of the film is its contrived humor. It\u2019s stiff, often cringe-worthy, and sticks out like a sore thumb as it grows increasingly desperate. The film\u2019s multiple writers couldn\u2019t have helped things, and the barrage of thoughtless, lazy jokes quickly wore me down.\r\n\r\nAlso lacking is suspense and a viable antagonist. There\u2019s the oddly disturbing Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), a woman who is living in unbearable pain and appears to be a formidable foe for Ant-Man (Rudd), The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). But then she suddenly finds her heart and the evil disappears. The same goes for Dr. Foster (Laurence Fishburne), a professor who also has a near immediate change of heart. The thin rescue mission premise of extracting Hank\u2019s wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) from the Quantum Realm after being trapped there for the last 30 years also means there\u2019s not too much else to root for.\r\n\r\nThe quantum rules change on a whim to fit the action sequences, with a sometimes shrinking and sometimes growing super suit. And cars. And buildings. The exposition dialogue is long-winded and repetitive, and the ill-advised \u201ccomic\u201d relief from Michael Pe\u00f1a is not snarky enough to feel fresh or new (see \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201c).\r\n\r\nThis is a shallow, pointless film that becomes an exhausting bore.","id":"5e7d5602eec4f34267aa0368","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e7d5602eec4f34267aa0368","movie_id":363088}

Unfortunately, Garland sometimes delays the story too much and then waits in vain until Garland comes to the point.

In fact, much more than that. I've seen a great many people go under because of this dilemma. Every Negro in America is in one way or another menaced by it. One is born in a white country, a white Protestant Puritan country, where one was once a slave, w__here all standards and all the images, when you open your eyes on the world, everything you see, none of it applies to you. You go to white movies and, like everybody else, you fall in love with Joan Crawford, and you root for the good guys who are killing off the Indians. It comes as a great psychological collision when you realise all of these things are really metaphors for your oppression, and will lead into a kind of psychological warfare in which you may perish._\r\n>\r\n>[\u2026]\r\n>\r\n>_All you are ever told in this country about being black is that it is a terrible, terrible thing to be. Now, in order to survive this, you have to really dig down into yourself and re-create yourself, really, according to no image which yet exists in America.

In the days when people called me \"Boy\", those days haven't passed except that I didn't answer then and I don't answer now. To be a Negro in this country is really - Ralph Ellison has said it very well - never to be_ looked at_. What white people see when they look at you is not visible. What they_ do see_, when they_ do _look at you is what they have invested you with. What they have invested you with is all the agony, and pain, and the danger, and the passion, and the torment - you know, sin, death, and hell - of which everyone in this country is terrified. As a Negro, you represent a level of experience which Americans deny. This may sound mystical, but I think it is proven in great relief in the South. Consider the extraordinary price, the absolutely prohibitive price, the South has paid to keep the Negro in his place; and it has not succeeded in doing that, but has succeeded in having what is almost certainly the most bewildered, demoralised white population in the Western world. On another level, you can see in the life of the country, not only in the South, what a terrible price the country has paid for this effort to keep a distance between themselves and black people. In the same way, for example, it is very difficult - it is hazardous, psychologically, personally hazardous - for a Negro in the country really to hate white people. He is too involved with them, not only socially but historically. No matter who says what, in fact, Negroes and whites in this country are related to each other. Half of the black families in the South are related, you know, to the judges and the lawyers and the white families of the South. They are cousins, and kissing cousins at that. Now, this is a terrible depth of involvement. It is easy for an African to hate the invader and drive him out of Africa, but it is very difficult for an American Negro to do this. He obviously can't do this to white people; there's no place to drive them. This is a country that belongs equally to us both. One has got to live together here or else there won't be any country._\r\n\r\n- James Baldwin speaking with Studs Terkel; _The Studs Terkel Program_, 98.7 WFMT Chicago (July 15, 1961)\r\n\r\nBased on James Baldwin's 1974 novel of the same name, _If Beale Street Could Talk_ is really two stories in one; there's the love story at the narrative's core, giving the film much of its tonal qualities, and on the surface, there's the socio-political protest about racial injustice and inequality, which provides most of the main plot points. At a quick glance, this should be a masterpiece - there's the foundation of James Baldwin, arguably the most significant African-American author of all time, and this is the first English-language adaptation of one of his novels; there's writer\/director Barry Jenkins, fresh off _Moonlight_ winning the 2017 Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay; there's a theme that is (sadly) almost as pertinent now as it was in 1974; there's the vibrant cinematography by James Laxton (_Tusk_), with its lush colours and lyrical compositions; there's a bevvy of hugely talented actors; there's the absorbing and melancholy score by Nicholas Britell (_The Big Short_). This should have been a home run. However, although I found it aesthetically faultless, much like _Moonlight_, I felt the totality was considerably less than the sum of its exceptional parts. Jenkins fails to do justice to either of the narratives running concurrently through the film, with both feeling incomplete, like a pencil-sketch rather than a painting. The biggest problem, however, is the somnolent love story. Employing a Terrence Malick-esque esoteric voiceover, Jenkins lifts entire passages directly from Baldwin. However, what reads beautifully in the novel is badly out of place in the film, even in voiceover, and has the effect of rendering the two central characters completely unrealistic, with their love for one another idealised to such an extent as to become ridiculous. And much like Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski's _Zimna Wojna_ (2018), I found _If Beale Street Could Talk_ as formally beautiful as it is emotionally unengaging.\r\n\r\nNew York, 1974; 19-year old Clementine \"Tish\" Rivers (Kiki Layne) and 22-year old Alonzo \"Fonny\" Hunt (Stephan James), who have known one another since they were children, have fallen in love, and are planning to get married and raise a family. Fonny has quit his job working for a furniture manufacturer, hoping instead to make it as a sculptor. However, when he is accused of rape, the victim mistakenly identifies him in a line-up, and he is charged and detained. Awaiting his trial, Tish visits him in jail, telling him she is pregnant. Ecstatic at the news, Fonny says he can't be in prison when the baby is born, and so Tish and her family determine to do anything it takes to get him out as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWith this as the central framework, the story is told in a non-linear style, jumping back and forth from one time period to another, which has an important thematic effect that I'll discuss below. Although Tish and Fonny are very much the centre of the narrative, we also meet a host of characters on the periphery of their relationship. There's Sharon (an absolutely exceptional Regina King), Tish's gentle mother; Ernestine (Teyonah Parris), Tish's acerbic but loving sister; Joseph (an excellent Colman Domingo), Tish's laidback father; Frank (Michael Beach), Fonny's practical father; Mrs. Hunt (Aunjanue Ellis), Fonny's deeply religious mother, who disapproves of the relationship between Fonny and Tish; Adrienne (Ebony Obsidian) and Sheila (Dominique Thorne), Fonny's sisters, who support their mother in everything; Levy (Dave Franco), a kindly Jewish landlord, who rents Fonny and Tish a space in a warehouse being turned into apartments at a reduced rate, because he enjoys seeing couples in love; Officer Bell (Ed Skrein), a racist cop who falsely says he saw Fonny running from the scene of the rape; Victoria Rogers (a superb (and unrecognisable) Emily Rios), the rape victim, who identifies Fonny in a line-up, with a little prompting from Bell, and then flees to Puerto Rico, delaying the trial; Daniel Carty (a heartbreaking Brian Tyree Henry), an old friend of Fonny's who could provide a solid alibi for the night of the rape, but whose testimony is ignored by the courts because he is an ex-con, having recently been released from a two year bit for stealing a car (which he denies doing, pointing out that he can't drive); Hayward (Finn Whittrock), Fonny's lawyer; Pedrocito (Diego Luna), a friend of Fonny's who works as a waiter at an upscale restaurant; and Pietro Alvarez (the always superb but criminally underused Pedro Pascal), with whom Victoria is staying in Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nThe title of the novel (and film) is a reference to W.C. Handy's 1917 song, \"Beale Street Blues\", about Beale Avenue in Downtown Memphis (later renamed Beale Street, partially because of the popularity of the song). A mecca of African-American culture, particularly music, in the early 20th century, Beale Street is considered the birth place of Memphis blues, with artists such as Lizzie Douglas (aka Memphis Minnie), Louis Armstrong, McKinley Morganfield (aka Muddy Waters), and B.B. King regularly performing in the many clubs on the street. In 1934, George Washington Lee wrote _Beale Street: Where the Blues Began_, becoming the first African-American writer to be advertised in the Book-of-the-Month Club News. In 1977, Beale Street was officially declared the \"Home of the Blues\" by an act of Congress.\r\n\r\n_If Beale Street Could Talk_ prominently features a voiceover narration spoken by Tish. Mainly in the present tense, the _Erz\u00e4hlzeit_ (time of narrating) is an unspecified point in the future, looking back at the events depicted in the film. A lot of the voiceover is lifted either directly from the novel or is a very close paraphrase. For example, in the novel, Tish states,\r\n\r\n> _Fonny had found something that he could do, that he wanted to do, and this saved him from the death that was waiting to overtake the children of our age. Though the death took many forms, though people died early in many different ways, the death itself was very simple and the cause was simple, too: as simple as a plague._\r\n\r\nIn the film, Tish says,\r\n\r\n> _you see, he had found something that he wanted to do. And this saved him from the death that awaited the children of our age. And though it took many forms, the death itself was very simple. The cause was simple, too._\r\n\r\nUsing a voiceover with such eloquent statements, however, creates a significant problem (more on this in a moment).\r\n\r\nAesthetically, much like _Moonlight_, _If Beale Street Could Talk_ looks amazing. From Laxton's vibrant cinematography to the colour coordinated costume design by Caroline Eselin (_Monster's Ball_; _The Paperboy_) - just look at all the yellow in the opening scene, in both the photography and the wardrobe - everything we see rings true, like a Jack Garofalo photograph come to life. Even more visually lyrical than _Moonlight_, the saturated colour palette of _Beale Street_ recalls Douglas Sirk's Technicolour-soaked melodramas, such as _All That Heaven Allows_ (1955) and _Written in the Wind_ (1956). Jenkins has been very open about his admiration for filmmakers such as Sirk, Claire Denis (_Beau Travail_; _Un beau soleil int\u00e9rieur_) and Hou Hsiao-hsien (_A Time to Live, a Time to Die_; _A City of Sadness_). However, he is most clearly indebted to Wong Kar-wai (_Days of Being Wild_; _In the Mood for Love_; _2046_); seen in Beale Street's non-linear narrative and relatively slight plot, its poetic tone, the centrality of music, and its tendency to use visuals rather than dialogue to convey thematic points (although Jenkins is nowhere near as formally experimental as Wong).\r\n\r\nAs in both _Medicine for Melancholy_ (2008) and _Moonlight_, Jenkins occasionally has characters speak directly to camera. They're not breaking the fourth wall, however. Such scenes are dialogue scenes, with two characters speaking to one another, so when one speaks directly to camera, it's if the camera is between the two of them. It's a technique that was used most famously (and effectively) in Jonathan Demme's _The Silence of the Lambs_ (1991), where each character looked directly into camera when speaking to Clarisse Starling (Jodie Foster), whereas she always looked just slightly off-camera, setting up a fascinating visual contrast which encourages us to identify with her, as we are presented with her POV, but not that of any of the other characters. _Beale Street_ doesn't do anything as interesting or subtle with the technique, but Jenkins's tendency to use it during moments of heightened emotion does have the effect of suturing the audience into the _milieu_ of the film; we know the characters aren't speaking to us, but it seems like they are.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the use of a non-linear narrative structure has an important thematic effect. We know from the second scene that Fonny is in jail, meaning that as we watch Tish and Fonny planning their future, renting an apartment, having sex for the first time etc, there's a permanent shadow over everything we see; we know that things go wrong, because we know much more than the characters do. For the most part, this contributes to the tone of the film, thus justifying itself. However, Jenkins overuses the technique, jumping back and forth unnecessarily, without adding anything to the story. An editor once told me that the worst thing someone could say to him about his work is, \"I really noticed your editing\". That's because, unless you're talking about a film where the editing itself is literally part of the narrative, such as Oliver Stone's _Natural Born Killers_ (1994) or David Fincher's _Fight Club_ (1999), film editing should be invisible, with the audience never asking questions like, \"_what was the significance of that edit?_\" In _Beale Street_, Joi McMillon and Nat Sanders's editing itself is fine when we're within a scene; it's more the way Jenkins links scenes and chops up the story that draws attention to itself. I understand why the film is told out of sequence, but I don't understand why it's told out of sequence to such an extent. Compare this with Sean Penn's exceptionally underrated _The Pledge_ (2001). For the most part, it's a linear narrative, except that the first scene shows us the protagonist, Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) as a broken-down alcoholic. The rest of the film takes place prior to this scene, so when we see Nicholson fall in love with Lori (Robin Wright) and spend a blissful Christmas with her and her daughter, we know that something terrible is coming, knowledge that casts a shadow over the entire film. Penn accomplishes this with a single scene, right at the start of the film. _Beale Street_, on the other hand, jumps all over the place, never settling into a standardised rhythm, with the cumulative effect becoming one of distraction rather than immersion.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to the film's most significant problem - the love story at its centre just didn't work for me. This is partly because of the emotional distance Jenkins maintains, but it's primarily because Fonny and Tish don't seem like real people, not in the way they gaze into one another's eyes as if they are seeing each other for the first time, not in the way they speak to one another as if every syllable is of earth-shattering portentousness; not in the way that everything they say is spoken with a cloying (and ultimately irritating) sanctity. They rarely sound like real people; instead, they adopt the eloquence of James Baldwin. In lifting sections directly from the novel, Jenkins has failed to consider the differing demands of the medium - what works on the page, doesn't necessarily work on the screen, and the reproduction of Baldwin's rich and lugubrious prose is simply unrealistic, with the delivery sounding stilted and awkward, and, most egregiously, far beyond the lexicon of the characters. This is especially apparent in Tish, whose expressive voiceover is far beyond anything we see of her character in the film itself.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, they don't come across as people with their own interiority and psychological verisimilitude, instead functioning as cogs in the machinations of Jenkins's thematic concerns. Tish, in particular, feels like a cypher, because of her dual role as a young girl trying to get her man out of jail, and a sage-like observer of institutionalised racism in the US. Fonny too has an important dual role - that of a young man falsely imprisoned, and that of a tragic figure standing in for the millions of African-Americans unjustly imprisoned throughout history. Jenkins doubles down on this point by intercutting the film with black-and-white photographs of chain-gangs and police brutality; amongst others, we see Henry Smith, Jesse Washington, Will Brown, Emmett Till, and the Freedom Summer Murders. The point is clear; Fonny is a grand representative of the crimes committed against Africa-Americans in the US. However, his character never attains the kind of grandeur such a representative must, by definition, possess.\r\n\r\nThere are also some smaller problems worth noting. For example, in voiceover, Tish says,\r\n\r\n> _New York must be the ugliest and the dirtiest city in the world. If any place is worse, it's got to be so close to hell that you can smell the people frying._\r\n\r\nEvocative words taken directly from the novel, but the New York of the film is anything but ugly; it's picture-postcard perfect, with the streets curiously deserted. Oftentimes Tish's narration simply describes something we can see for ourselves, whereas elsewhere, Jenkins doesn't seem to trust the audience to understand his meaning, so he'll emphasise it to be sure. A good example is Levy, the Jewish landlord. Lest the audience not understand the significance of his Jewishness, there's a shot from beyond with his skullcap prominent in the frame. It's just overkill.\r\n\r\nAnother problem concerns the depiction of Bell, the racist cop who frames Fonny. Played as a leering pantomime villain, with bad hair, bad teeth, and bad skin, he's obviously a metaphor for the ugliness of racism, but he's so completely over the top, it rips you right out of the film. He'd be more at home in a video game than a socially conscious exploration of the challenges facing African-Americans in the US. On the other hand, Regina King's portrayal of Sharon is exceptional, and completely worth her Oscar win for Best Supporting Actress. King has been giving superb under-the-radar performances for a while now, particularly on TV, in shows such as _Southland_ (2009-2013), _American Crime_ (2015-2017), and _Seven Seconds_ (2018). However, if you really want to see what an acting powerhouse she is, she's never been better than she was in the second season of Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta's criminally underrated _The Leftovers_ (2014-2017), and she brings much of the silent depth with which she portrayed Erika Murphy in that show to _Beale Street_. The scene where she heads to Puerto Rico to try to persuade Victoria that Fonny didn't rape her is one of the most harrowing things you'll see on screen all year, with King conveying her emotional state primarily by her facial gestures (Rios is also superb in this scene, which is probably the best in the film).\r\n\r\n_Beale Street_ is an undeniably beautiful film that depicts the love between two astonishingly attractive people; it's worth noting that in the novel, Fonny is described as having\r\n\r\n> _skin just like raw potato, wet potato rinds and eyes like a Chinaman and all that nappy hair and them thick lips. And so bow-legged he had bunions on his ankle bones; and the way his behind stuck out, his mother must have been a gorilla._\r\n\r\nThis most certainly does not describe Stephan James. Lacking the raw emotion of Baldwin's novel, Jenkins's interpretation turns Fonny and Tish into a Ken and Barbie-esque couple, undermining Baldwin's depiction of them as very much existing in the realistic _milieu_ seen throughout the novel. Taking a meditative approach to the material, Jenkins's adaptation never rings true. Whereas Baldwin's Tish and Fonny are flawed, contradictory, and, most importantly, relatable, Jenkins's protagonists are too-perfect-to-be-real, with every agonisingly serious pronouncement they make to one another pushing them further and further from connecting with the audience on an emotional level.","id":"5d3389166a300b1834ac8552","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d3389166a300b1834ac8552","movie_id":465914}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Cover Version 2\r\n\r\nIt was 1993 when Jurassic Park was unleashed upon the film loving public, spawning a blockbuster franchise and pop culture thunders in the process. Sadly we now find ourselves suffering cover versions of what was once a great and thought provoking premise with high octane thrills into the bargain.\r\n\r\nI guess once they started personalising the Velociraptors, making one of them a friend of man, it was the beginning of the end. But we accepted it - sort of - jumping into 2015's Jurassic World with carefree abandon. More dino carnage we wanted, a bright cast fronted by the ever likable Chris Pratt and Bryce Howard drew us in, but it was merely ok, a franchise entry that was just a quick fix but nothing more. But of course box office talks and the franchise lumbers on to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom...\r\n\r\nPlot returns to Isla Nublar which along with all the dinosaur inhabitants is about to be vanished from the planet by the mother of all volcanoes. Cue mankind jostling over whether to save a species that was once extinct whilst others have nefarious motives for financial gain.\r\n\r\nOff we go then, stock characters that are over familiar are performed by different actors but go through motions we have witnessed before, whilst the writing strains for a sort of human empathy factor that never hits the mark. There is nothing remotely fresh (well Howard has at least changed her footwear to something more credible) or exciting on offer here, it's a tired cash cow that's in dire need of extinction itself.\r\n\r\nNaturally another instalment will come along, and naturally it will make money, with myself and the other millions of Jurassic zombies filing in to view what we hope will be a return to the heady days back in 1993. But it's most likely a forlorn hope, so maybe, just maybe, it should be enough now, enough?  5\/10","id":"5c961f6bc3a3682e5ff54f83","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c961f6bc3a3682e5ff54f83","movie_id":351286}

{"author":"Sheldon Nylander","content":"Brain hurt. Me no likey. Err...umm...ahem.\r\n\r\nThis is a movie that really stretches it as far as believability, logic, or even physics.\r\n\r\nFirst, just a quick note: The trailer makes it seem like the movie spends its time on an island about to blow up. Less than half the movie is that. So, if you're looking for a long drawn out volcanic eruption, look elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe heroes are annoying and dumb caricatures, from the techie who's afraid of everything to the wisecracking animal wrangler (in fairness, this is Chris Pratt's character from the previous film, but still). The villains are short-sighted, moustache-twirling dolts who never seem to remember to watch behind them, especially in dangerous scenarios. And why was Jeff Goldblum even in this movie? He serves no purpose to the story. None at all. He's there for them to say, \"See! We have someone from the older movies, so it ties together.\" That's literally all he's there to do for his two minutes of screen time.\r\n\r\nIt's the same plot as every other Jurassic Park\/World film. Let's create\/genetically engineer dinosaurs. What could possibly go wrong? Even the supposed \"plot twist\" could be figured out from the very beginning of the film. Basic physics don't even apply, such as the impossible truck jump at one point. I swear I could feel my brain leaking out of my ears while watching this.\r\n\r\nThis film honestly makes me somewhat relieved that Colin Trevorrow got removed from Star Wars Episode IX. Unfortunately, the way this movie ends basically guarantees that there's going to be another one. Although it begs the question about what happened to Jurassic Park III since it ends in a similar way. Is that film even supposed to be canon anymore?\r\n\r\nJust don't bother. Even if you love the dinosaur special effects of previous films, there's really not much here that you didn't see before, and some of it is actually pretty bad and unbelievable for a film from 2018. Just don't bother.","id":"5d86b0565a469000299b4892","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d86b0565a469000299b4892","movie_id":351286}

The plan is to relocate the dinosaurs to a new island sanctuary, but that\u2019s not the way it works out.\r\n\r\nMy title blurb pretty much says it all for this fifth film in the franchise. I mention Indiana Jones because the movie has a \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d (1981) vibe more so than the other movies. The reference to Dracula\u2019s castle is due to the fact that the entire second half takes place at a cool, gothic chateau in Northern California and there\u2019s a scene with a genetically-enhanced raptor acting like Dracula.\r\n\r\nCurvy Bryce is just stunning throughout and easily blows away any other woman in the series.

Thus I was so thrilled by the first Jurassic Park movie, which I thought then, and still think today, is a great movie. Sadly the following movies have been a mixed bag to say the least.\r\n\r\nThis movie falls in the \u201cthat was disappointing\u201d category I am afraid. It is obviously that however wrote the story was a lazy bugger that simply rehashed old bits and standard Hollywood cheap concepts and then added some frustrating preaching to it.\r\n\r\nThe two scenes, one at the beginning and one in the end, where Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) was just sitting and ranting on and on was enough by itself to drag down the movie a star or two. We get it, however wrote that crap do not like gene science. Then go and write a piece in a science journal or something. Oh wait, it would not have been excepted since there was no science in it, just ranting mixed up with poorly hidden religious beliefs. So instead you had to go and ruin a movie which was meant to simply entertain.\r\n\r\nThe we have the rest of the story. The best, or should I say the kindest, word for describing it would be \u201cpredictable\u201d. How many times are we going to do the big company captures animals for profit story? At least try to put some intelligence in the plot if you have to rehash it over and over again. It has even been done before in the same franchise for Christ sake!\r\n\r\nI would lie if I did not say that I found, at least, some entertainment watching the movie though. But pretty much all of it came from watching the scenery and the special effects. They at least were pretty good. But then I do like big monsters stomping around wreaking havoc and eating people, especially when it is the bad guys.\r\n\r\nThere were some parts that was rather funny. I think Christ Pratt, and most of the other actors as well for that matter, did a fairly good job out of the lousy script. The idea of using a Stygimoloch to break free was quite cool and the havoc he wreaked somewhat funny. The part where Wheatley stop in the middle of all the chaos to extract a tooth as a bloody trophy was just silly though.\r\n\r\nThe end scenes was just frustrating. However wrote that ought to be shot. A few dinosaurs escape and then the conclusion is that humanity have to live side by side with dinosaurs from then one. What a load of rubbish!\r\n\r\nSadly, despite the genre being a favorite of mine and the special effects being pretty good, this film did not make it for me due to the unintelligent and lazy script.","id":"5bdc66dac3a368403200f453","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bdc66dac3a368403200f453","movie_id":351286}

Charlie also says \u201cforget about \u2018Doctor Who\u2019, I can be a credible talent by portraying a notorious serial killer with a bushy beard and questionable accent\u201d. What Charlie forgot to say though was \u201cit\u2019s still an ill-mannered interpretation of events that rarely conveys humanisation within its real-life human characters\u201d. For a year that had approximately three feature-length titles depicting the murder of Sharon Tate, Harron\u2019s meticulous angle is the most welcomed approach. Purely focusing on the \u201cfamily\u201d and how Manson brainwashed them into believing his own radical fantasy, the story hones in on a psychologist assisting three female followers in realising the reality of their heinous actions.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the narrative written by Turner is constructed through the tired structure of flashbacks, whilst holding an ounce of gravitas. And I can visibly touch the intangible perspective that Turner aimed for. Almost tasting its ingenuity. Proposing a psychological position of events that have been retold repeatedly within cinema, by targeting the process of curing indoctrination. Yes, Sharon Tate and other rich folk get slashed, stabbed and butchered. However, instead of showcasing those murders for the sake of fulfilling the sadism of viewers, it holds intentions. Crucial events in the escalation of Manson\u2019s brainwashing capabilities, puppeteering his female marionettes. Producing credible grounds for psychological analysis.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental issue though, is that the analysis and exploration of this psychosis is incredibly shallow. A noticeable absence of gradual cognitive dynamics between protagonist Leslie (aptly named Lulu by Manson) and her new leader. Manson\u2019s omnipotent stance is addressed immediately with no real progressive foundations. An impressionable Leslie is recruited and just happens to follow Manson\u2019s orders without hesitation. That inner moral conflict between everything she once knew and all that she relinquished was missing. Occasionally, her abrupt pauses and glistening eyes, which were portrayed eloquently by Murray, illustrated indications of self-questioning. Yet somehow felt forced, juxtaposing her initial stance when recruited.\r\n\r\nFortunately their incarceration at the institution meant that their ideals and beliefs could be interrogated, likening Manson\u2019s infectious faith to an extreme Christian denomination. Although not as much of the runtime was expended on this acute angle that would\u2019ve made for a more engaging psychological drama. A shame really as it wastes the talent of Wever. Smith offered a credible portrayal of the eponymous murderer, yet personally was unable to break away from his usual quirks cemented in his stint on \u2018Doctor Who\u2019. The whole talking to inanimate objects and nonsensical splurges about nothing. It must be infuriatingly difficult for him, but he did a decent job by showcasing his versatility. Even if his Northamptonshire accent popped in to say \u201calright mate?\u201d from time to time.\r\n\r\nOverall, a frustrating biographical film, I must say. The approach to the \u201cfamily\u201d was, dare I say, near-perfect. However the absence of emotional, psychological and structural depth resulted in a middling drama that simply retold events, rather than powering them. Charlie said \u201cjump!\u201d but Harron and Turner were unable to reach his intended height. Missed opportunity to title this \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels\u201d though...","id":"5e20669a0102c900133c4d05","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e20669a0102c900133c4d05","movie_id":471859}

But it's also about two people who are very strong individuals, and very attractive. My father was an old-fashioned guy who said a woman has to fit in, and my mother just didn't at all. Their story had betrayal, and separations, getting together again, having a baby, then divorcing and really falling out horribly, then leaving the country separately. My father escaped. My mom married an English guy in order to leave Poland, with me_ _in tow, when I was 14. But then my parents met abroad again a couple of years later and fell in love, and decided they wanted to be together. They dumped their spouses and got married, and ended up living together in Germany, in exile. Then they quarrelled, and she had an affair with some other guy, much younger. But they ended up together because they were both tired, too tired to fight after 40 years of this stuff._\r\n\r\n>_My mother was a ballerina in the first half of her life and she screwed up her back. She had scoliosis, which she didn't look after, and then she had three operations that went wrong. She was in corsets, and there was morphine. My father had three heart attacks; he was a heavy smoker and drinker. They were quite young when they died, 57 and 67, but they died together in a not dissimilar fashion to what you see in the film. Just before they died they were, for two or three years, the happiest couple. They came to realise they had nothing but each other. The countries change. The boyfriends, girlfriends, wives change. Politics change. But they realized that the only thing in the world is her, is him._\r\n\r\n>_It's the mother of all love stories in a way. But it didn't seem like a love story throughout. It felt like a really bad marriage. God forbid you have such a love story. You'd rather have just a normal relationship. In this stable place. In one country, ideally._\r\n\r\n- Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski; \"\"I wanted to make it a beautiful disaster\": Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski on his new film _Cold War_\" (Alissa Wilkinson); _Vox_ (December 21, 2018)\r\n\r\nReading around some of the reviews of _Zimna wojna_ [_Cold War_], I recognise that this should have been a film I liked, loved even, as so much of what these critics are praising are exactly the kinds of things I myself often look for in a film, and I genuinely wish I had been able to get what people like _The Guardian_'s Peter Bradshaw or the _Los Angeles Times_'s Justin Cheng have gotten from it. It's one of the best-reviewed films of the year (94% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes at the time of writing), and I freely acknowledge there's a huge amount to praise here, with elements of the visual design borderline genius. However, all the aesthetic brilliance in the world doesn't hide what, for me, is its single greatest flaw - it just left me utterly cold; I didn't care about the two main characters, and I didn't buy their relationship. Yes, I'm aware that emotional detachment is exactly what it was going for, and it's probably unfair to criticise a film for successfully doing what it intended to do, but when it ended, all I could think was \"meh.\" Now, I know what you're thinking, because I've thought it myself in relation to any number of user reviews for any number of films \u2013 you're probably already formulating your \"_go back to Michael Bay_\" comments, and I can't say I blame you. But, whilst I can certainly appreciate much of what is on offer, and understand why critics have loved it, the end result for me was one of indifference. Although, to be fair, that may say more about myself than the film.\r\n\r\nWritten by Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski (_My Summer of Love_; _The Woman in the Fifth_; _Ida_), Janusz G\u0142owacki (_Wa\u0142\u0119sa. Cz\u0142owiek z nadziei_), and Piotr Borkowski (_Lek wysokosci_), and directed by Pawlikowski, who loosely based the story on events in his parents' lives, to whom the film is also dedicated, the plot of Zimna wojna is simplicity itself. The film begins in 1949, two years since a communist government came to power and the country was provisionally renamed _Rzeczpospolita ludowa_ [Polish People's Republic]. It opens with composer and pianist Wiktor (Tomasz Kot), his ethnomusicologist producer Irena (Agata Kulesza), and rigid state-sponsored overseer Kaczmarek (Borys Szyc) travelling through the isolated rural communities of the Polish countryside, recording folk songs and attempting to find recruits for a folk music school, with the aim of putting together an ensemble to perform nationally, and hopefully, internationally. Wiktor is bored out of his mind with the repetitive nature of the work, until a young woman named Zula (an extraordinary Joanna Kulig) comes to the school to audition. Although she doesn't fit the profile of what they are looking for \u2013 she's from the city rather than the countryside, is rumoured to have spent time in prison for killing her father, and performs not a folk song at her audition, but a piece from a Soviet film \u2013 and although Irena points out there are better singers, Wiktor argues that she has \"_something different_.\" Irena, who may or may not be in love with Wiktor, immediately recognises that he's enamoured with Zula, but he assures her he's acting out of pure professionalism. Of course, he isn't, and soon enough, he and Zula are in the midst of a passionate relationship. And that's pretty much it as far as the plot goes. The rest of the film takes place over 20 years and four countries (Poland, France, Yugoslavia, and East Germany), but it never branches out from the central relationship. There are no subplots or significant supporting characters; the narrative is pared down to within an inch of its life, with every scene, every line of dialogue, every action, existing only in relation to this focal driving force.\r\n\r\nSo, to look first at some aspects of the film which I liked. The aesthetic is absolutely unparalleled, as Pawlikowski and director of photography \u0141ukasz \u017bal (_Ida_; _Loving Vincent_) allow the visual design to both originate from and convey thematic points, a truly extraordinary example of form and content blending into one another. As an example, the film is exquisitely shot in Academy ratio (1.37:1), which has the effect of confining the characters within the frame. The nature of the film lends itself to sweeping vistas and cityscapes captured in anamorphic (2.39:1), but, instead, Pawlikowski and \u017bal use the box-like nature of the Academy frame to trap the characters, meaning they don't seem free even when standing in the vast open countryside or in Paris at night. The epic nature of the narrative and the confined frame work in a kind of ironic symbiosis to visually convey the important theme of the tensions within and between the characters; freedom and confinement constantly working against one another.\r\n\r\nAnother example of the synergy between form and content is the use of focus. For example, in the opening scene, the shallow focus creates a depth of field so small that the village just behind the in-focus singers is completely flattened. This renders it visually inaccessible, and thus compels the audience to concentrate fully on nothing except the foreground singers. Compare this with the scene where Kaczmarek is giving a speech extolling the glory of the state and the prestige of the school to a collection of bored students, all the while a cow is wandering around in the mud behind him. The use of a deeper focus here than in the opening means that the cow falls within the larger depth of field, and can be clearly seen, once again directing the audience's attention, only this time that attention is directed away from the foreground character as opposed towards him. The cow, obviously enough, serves as a commentary, telling us exactly what Pawlikowski thinks of Kaczmarek's speech, and the ideologies underpinning it.\r\n\r\nAnother scene of this ilk is when a worker is attempting to hang a \"_We welcome tomorrow_\" banner on the front of the music school, under directions from Kaczmarek. However, falling from his ladder (and by the sounds of it, falling to his death), the banner is never hung, hanging limply across one side of the building. Again, as with the cow, this is Pawlikowski criticising the state-sanctioned machinery introduced by the _Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza_ [Polish United Workers' Party] since 1948. Of course, the communists are not \"welcoming tomorrow\" \u2013 they are far more interested in the past, which is why they are collecting folk songs; in an effort to create a Politburo-approved musical tradition designed to instil both national pride and political conformity, by rejecting the \"western\" rock & roll music of tomorrow in favour of a musical past.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of music, in relation to the way the opening scene is shot, it instantly becomes clear how vital a part of the story music and singing are. As the narrative develops, music becomes Wiktor and Zula's everything \u2013 they derive hope from it, they imbue it with their feelings, it brings them together, it drives them apart, it even comes to symbolise the strange bond between them, never moreso than when Wiktor refers to an album on which they have been collaborating as \"_our child_.\"\r\n\r\nAnother structural aspect that is exceptionally well handled is how Pawlikowski designs the time jumps, as the film skips forward to the next instalment in the story. When a sequence is finished, the film cuts to black, and then, using a variation of a J cut, the sound from the next scene can be heard a few seconds prior to the image being seen. Furthermore, that sound is usually music, reemphasising just how important music is to these characters. Interestingly however, the last few time jumps don't use music to introduce the incoming scene, perhaps referring to the changes in the characters' circumstances at this stage of the film, the darker ideological underpinnings of their psyches. In relation to this, it's also worth pointing out that once we get to the second half of the film, the two leads almost never smile (not that they smiled that much in the first half). Ironically enough, the character who smiles the most is probably Kaczmarek.\r\n\r\nSo, having spent all this time waxing lyrical about aspects of the film which impressed me, why did I not enjoy it? As I said above, there's a huge amount to admire here, the craft is exceptional, but, at the end of the day, this is a romance. And it doesn't work as a romance. Yes, it's not what you would call a standard romance by any means, the character motivations and justifications that you'd see in other narratives of this ilk (not just filmic texts) are absent here, and maybe because of that, although there was undeniable chemistry between the leads, I just didn't buy their seemingly insatiable compulsion to seek one another out, sleep together, hurt one another, and then split up. The problem is, this exact template happens about five times \u2013 they meet, have a great time for a while, argue over something, and one runs off. Wash, rinse, repeat. And even at only 85 minutes, this kind of structural repetition becomes, well, repetitive, as I increasingly found myself asking \"why are these two even together?\"\r\n\r\nTo give you an example of what I'm talking about, during one particular argument, after Zula finds out Wiktor has been lying to people about her background, he explains, \"_I wanted to give you more colour_\". Seriously? These are two people who have precious little respect for one another; beneath all the eroticism and physical attraction, they are simply two irreparably damaged people trying to save one another, living with a co-dependency, but instead hastening each other towards destruction. And as I couldn't buy into the believability of the romance, the entire enterprise floundered; it never achieves the status it seems to be aiming for, that of cathartic high-tragedy. And although the end is very well done, and the last line is spectacular, it left me unmoved, because, by that stage, I just didn't care. True, the structure of the film and the insanely tight editing means that events in their lives are glanced at rather than lingered over, so the kind of nuances and character beats you'd often expect are absent, with the audience being allocated no time to become enveloped by the emotions on screen. As the narrative is built on ellipses and omissions, many (in fact, almost all) of the standard romantic tropes simply aren't present. By design, the film is barren and emotionally impenetrable, and in that sense, Pawlikowski seems to have been attempting to construct as detached a narrative as he possibly could. If anything, he succeeds too well.","id":"5cde013f9251416b5bd3c1a7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cde013f9251416b5bd3c1a7","movie_id":440298}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Aesthetically flawless and brilliantly acted, but too melodramatic and generic for me_**\r\n\r\n>_I think there are several layers. There is the first layer of the film that is a thriller - though not necessarily in the meaning of a detective story or a film trying to surprise and confuse the viewer - but this aspect is just a pretext to plunge into the path of my characters. That's where the interest lies, in the path and the secret and the mystery of the characters. So there is this first layer, this general aspect, but if someone is really searching for a thriller, they would not find it her__e. And it was not my intention to make a thriller for the sake of making one._\r\n\r\n- Asghar Farhadi; \"Director Asghar Farhadi Interview: _Everybody Knows_\" (Justin Quinzon); _ScreenRant_ (February 15, 2019)\r\n\r\nRarely has a filmmaker been so intimately tied to a place as two-time Academy Award-winning writer\/director Asghar Farhadi is to his native Iran. Since his 2003 directorial debut, _Raghs dar ghobar_ [_Dancing in the Dust_], six of his eight films have been set there, collectively mapping out the socio-political soul of the country, examining such socially-realist topics as divorce (_Raghs dar ghobar_, _Jodaeiye Nader az Simin_ [_A Separation_]), crime (_Shah-re ziba_ [_Beautiful City_], _Forushande_ [_The Salesman_]), secrets and lies (_Chaharshanbe-soori_ [_Fireworks Wednesday_], _Darbareye Elly_ [_About Elly_]), and the themes for which he's best known; class and the importance of the past in the present. In 2013, he made his first film outside Iran, _Le Pass\u00e9_ [_The Past_], which was set in France, although it did feature an Iranian protagonist, and was thematically uniform with his previous work. His second such film, _Todos lo saben_ [lit. trans. _Everybody Knows It_], is set in Spain, and although it finds him working for the first time with a relatively conventional genre template, it remains thematically very much a Farhadi film.\r\n\r\nMore a dark psychological study of people under extreme pressure than the kidnapping thriller as which it's been marketed, the film examines what can happen when such pressure causes long-buried secrets to rise to the surface, how they can bring some together and tear others apart, often because of misunderstandings as to what is and what isn't common knowledge, with characters both underestimating and overestimating what others know about their lives. However, although beautifully shot and exceptionally well-acted, _Todos_ is easily the weakest film in Farhadi's filmography. Whereas his previous work is elegant, nuanced, and perfectly formed, _Todos_ clumsily falls back on clich\u00e9d genre tropes and heavy-handed melodramatic plotting, with the narrative hinging on the revelation of a secret so obvious, I'm not even sure you can call it a plot twist.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the story of Laura (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz), a Spanish woman living in Buenos Aires, who returns to her hometown outside Madrid with her 16-year-old daughter Irene (Carla Campra) and eight-year-old son Diego (Iv\u00e1n Chavero) for her sister Ana's (Inma Cuesta) wedding. Laura's husband, Alejandro (Ricardo Dar\u00edn), a successful architect and recovering alcoholic, has stayed behind in Argentina due to unexpected work commitments. Laura is particularly looking forward to seeing Paco (Cruz's real-life husband, Javier Bardem), the son of the family maid, with whom she grew up and was in love for many years. Now married to local girl Bea (B\u00e1rbara Lennie), Paco co-owns a local vineyard, having bought the land from Laura at a low rate, with Antonio (Ram\u00f3n Barea), Laura's bitter and drunken father, still resenting Paco's success with land to which he believes his family is entitled. That night, as the wedding guests are celebrating, there is a power outage, during which Irene disappears from her bedroom. Shortly thereafter, Laura receives a text message demanding \u20ac300,000 and warning her not to contact the police or Irene will be killed. Believing the kidnapping may have been perpetrated by the same people who kidnapped and murdered a young girl several years previously, Laura's brother-in-law Fernando (Eduard Fern\u00e1ndez) contacts his friend Jorge (Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Egido), a former cop, to begin looking into things. When he suggests the kidnapping may have been perpetrated by someone at the wedding, it doesn't take long until the family is at one another's throats, with old animosities resurfacing, and distrust spreading between them. To make matters worse, Irene is ill, and without her medication, she will die.\r\n\r\nAs one would expect from Farhadi, _Todos_ is aesthetically flawless. Shot by Pedro Almod\u00f3var's regular cinematographer, Jos\u00e9 Luis Alcaine (_Volver_, _La piel que habito_, _Passion_), the film captures the sun-kissed Spanish countryside beautifully, with a gorgeous palette of rich browns, golds, and reds emphasising tradition and pride in the past. Drawing the audience's attention to the importance of the passage of time, the film opens by depicting the workings of a cathedral clock. However, the scene also strikes a more ominous note - the bell tower features a hole through which smaller birds can fly, but it is too small for the pigeon who also flits around the clock, trapping him inside; a visual metaphor to which we return several times. Also aesthetically impressive is the opening montage, which introduces us to a dizzying number of characters. Farhadi is at his most economical and leisurely in these quick-fire early scenes, drawing a complex web of blood relations and friendships (if this were a novel, there'd be a family tree included), whilst still creating a sense of intimacy and tight-knit community. It's also worth noting from an aesthetic perspective that although Alberto Iglesias (_Todo sobre mi madre_, _The Constant Gardner_, _Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy_) is credited as the composer, the film only features one piece of non-diegetic music, which plays over the closing credits.\r\n\r\nThematically, as with all of Farhadi's previous films, _Todos_ touches on a number of issues. Racism and class prejudice, for example, are looked at (albeit briefly) in how the family instinctively ask Paco if any of his staff at the vineyard, all immigrants, could be behind the kidnapping. Later, suspicion falls on some youths from the school where Bea works, whom she employed to film the wedding; when Jorge learns they all have petty crimes on their record, many of the family immediately assume their guilt.\r\n\r\nGiven the nature of the story, a major issue is the weight of the past on the present - seen most clearly in how Antonio still resents Paco's purchase of Laura's land and how Bea believes that Paco is still in love with Laura (when Irene disappears, there is a scene where Paco hugs Laura, and Farhadi immediately cuts to Bea watching them). More specifically, the film looks at secrets, examining not only the importance of who knows what and how secrets can sometimes bring people closer, but also looking at the more complex issue that much of what we do in any given situation is based on what we assume other people do and do not know. Set in a small community where everybody knows everybody else, Farhadi gets a lot of mileage out of revealing that what some thought were secrets were actually common knowledge (hence the title). Speaking to Slant, he states,\r\n\r\n>_because I wanted to deal with the notion of secrets, and secrets being related to the past of the characters, I had to choose a society in which people are aware of each other's pasts. If I had put my story in a big city it wouldn't have made sense. People don't know where the others come from; they aren't aware of each other's background. I wanted it to be in a small community in which people pretend that they don't know anything about the others, but in reality they know everything._\r\n\r\nHowever, it's in relation to secrets where the narrative begins to fall down. Introducing a huge number of red herrings, false leads, and dead ends, Farhadi uses the revelation of secrets as a structural principle, much as he has in his past work. Some of these revelations could be seen as plot twists (such as how Alejandro's construction business is doing), some not so much (why Paco and Bea have no children, for example). The film builds the tension reasonably well until about two-thirds of the way through, when it unveils the biggest secret\/plot-twist, and the moment upon which the entire last act hinges. However, it's a revelation so telegraphed, when the scene came, I literally had to consciously remind myself that the character involved was unaware of the information being shared - \"hang on, why is he flipping out about this, he already knows...oh, wait, that's right, he doesn't.\" The actors play the hell out of the scene, but Farhadi is so self-serious about the profundity of the moment that it almost has a comic effect, like a magician too interested in the audience's reaction to a trick to notice he is screwing the trick up.\r\n\r\nThe film also strays into outright melodrama far more than in any of Farhadi's previous work. The above-mentioned twist is one example. Another is that there's a late-night thunderstorm (although, thankfully, no one has sex in front of a raging fireplace during it). The more the film goes on, and the more twists and turns Farhadi throws into the mix, the less I cared about any of the characters, and the more clumsy his script becomes, something I would never say about any of his previous work, which is uniformly graceful and light-handed. Even his only flirtation with genre prior to this, _Darbareye Elly_, has nuance and grace utterly lacking in the more heavy-handed deterministic plotting of _Todos_. The fact that Irene needs medication or will die in a couple of days is a particularly egregious example of this; a detail shoehorned into the narrative to arbitrarily create extra time-sensitive tension. It's a clich\u00e9d genre trope more suited to something like _Law & Order_ (\"_the girl is in a coffin, and only has six hours more oxygen_\"), that is, quite frankly, beneath an _auteur_ of Farhadi's calibre.\r\n\r\nIndeed, speaking of genre, how he approaches the kidnapping plot itself is a little unusual. Obviously, the film is not about the kidnapping, it's about how people react to it. However, even with that in mind, he sketches things very thinly. When the kidnappers are revealed, for example, apart from a couple of throwaway lines, he completely ignores what motivated them to do it. Additionally, there are so many twists, so many secrets, so many false leads, and so many scenes of characters having moments of portentous revelation, it becomes narrative chaos - like a pizza with every single available topping. Also, Farhadi never really connects the kidnapping plot to the secrets of the past, so although Irene's abduction does serve as the impetus for the characters to come clean about various issues, it all seems so random that you could imagine any crisis having similar results.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that the central conflicts aren't as well-grounded in the milieu as in Farhadi's Iran-set work, where the issues explored in each film arise directly from that film's immediate environment. This was also a problem in _La Pass\u00e9_, but it's more pronounced here (compare _Todos_ to something like Francesco Rosi's _Cronaca di una morte annuciata_ (1987), for example, in which the tensions at the heart of the film are indistinguishable from their social context). This could be because Farhadi is simply unfamiliar with the environment (like _La Pass\u00e9_, he wrote the script in Persian, and had it translated), but whatever the case, in comparison to the nuance of his previous work, _Todos_ feels like a step backwards. For example, the kidnapping plot, by definition, suggests a villain with a motive, whereas one of the more striking aspects of his _oeuvre_ to date is the lack of antagonists, and the difficulty in assigning the majority of blame to any one person. Additionally, what often went relatively unspoken (class resentment in _Jodaeiye Nader az Simin_, for example, or domestic violence in _Darbareye Elly_), is here much more overt, with the characters presented in a more open manner, their prejudices, hopes, and desires more explicit, and thus far less interesting.\r\n\r\nI didn't hate _Todos lo saben_, but given the pedigree of the director, it did leave me massively disappointed, especially in how he falls back on genre clich\u00e9s and melodramatic tropes. Farhadi is on his game aesthetically, and, once again dealing with issues of class and the destructive power of the past, so too thematically. The problem is the narrative. He piles so much on that I just stopped caring, as the plot lurched from secret\/twist to secret\/twist to secret\/twist. There's nothing wrong with grafting one's thematic preoccupations onto a genre framework, of course; filmmakers as varied as Alfred Hitchcock, John Ford, Michael Mann, David Fincher, and Christopher Nolan work within genre conventions, but are very much auteurs. However, when doing so, one must pay attention to the genre elements of one's film or they will be overwhelmed and seem like a poorly thought-out distraction, bumping against the themes rather than organically co-existing with them. That's exactly what happens in _Todos_. Nevertheless, Farhadi remains a supremely talented filmmaker, and his worst is still better than a lot of director's best. Beautiful to look at, and thematically interesting, the film is, unfortunately, let down by a disappointing narrative.","id":"5d48d401a0be287cf6a13c8c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d48d401a0be287cf6a13c8c","movie_id":401545}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Deeply respectful of its subject_**\r\n\r\n> _Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members. Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs. Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind._\r\n\r\n- Ralph Waldo Emerson; \"Self-Reliance\" (1841)\r\n\r\nIn _Walden_, his 1854 memoir\/philosophical treatise, Henry David Thoreau chronicles a period of two years, two months, and two days during which time he lived alone in a small cabin he himself had built in the forest near Walden Pond, Massachusetts, on property owned by his mentor and friend, Ralph Waldo Emerson. Inspired by the tenets of transcendentalism, of especial importance to Thoreau was \"Self-Reliance\", an 1841 essay by Emerson, which argues that an individual must avoid conformity, follow their own ideas and concepts, and trust in their own instincts if they are to attain a deeper understanding of the nature of existence. In _Walden_, Thoreau was putting this concept to the test, isolating himself from civil society, and existing in nature with only the barest means of subsistence;\r\n\r\n> _I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach._\r\n\r\n_Walden_ went on to become one of the (many) foundational texts of libertarianism, the core principles of which are the valuation of personal liberty above all else, and the encouragement of scepticism towards authority in general, and the state\/government in particular.\r\n\r\nAll of which brings us to _Leave no Trace_, which could, perhaps, be described as a darker version of Matt Ross's _Captain Fantastic_ (2016). Directed by Debra Granik (_Winter's Bone_), and written for the screen by Granik and Anne Rosellini, based on Peter Rock's 2010 novel, _My Abandonment_, the film tells the story of Will (Ben Foster), a veteran suffering from PTSD, who is living off the grid with his daughter Tom (Thomasin McKenzie). Making their home in a national park in Portland, Oregon, they embody many of the concepts underpinning Emerson's notions of self-reliance; individual authority, nonconformity, solitude, internal self-truth, with Will especially valuing freedom of thought. However, when a jogger sees Tom, park wardens are dispatched to track them down, and social services open an investigation into their situation. Will is aghast, resenting the infringement upon his autonomy, recalling Iain King's statement that\r\n\r\n> _autonomy should only be infringed if a person is unable to know their own interests on a particular matter._\r\n\r\nThis certainly isn't the case with Will, and he sees no reason why he and Tom shouldn't be allowed to continue to live in their own way.\r\n\r\nNone of the philosophical theories outlined above are explicitly mentioned anywhere in the film. However, knowledge of them definitely helps one to more easily understand Will. Whether Granik or Rosellini are even aware of these concepts is beside the point, as they serve to give one a more assured theoretical entry point into a not easily penetrated film. For example, does one have to know that Will is at stage six of Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development to understand or enjoy the film? No, of course not. Does it help? Absolutely.\r\n\r\nOn a less theoretical note, the film does a lot that on paper would seem to be wrong; for long stretches of time, there is no real sense of any kind of standard Aristotelian conflict, as we simply observe Will and Tom going about their day. In tandem with this, the film is extremely light on plot, incident, and tangible character development, focusing instead on mood and tone, and calling upon the actors to externalise their emotions through action and expression rather than dialogue. Obviously, this means almost everything hinges on the quality of the performances and the believability of the bond between the characters. Thankfully, both Foster and McKenzie are exceptional \u2013 he plays Will as someone who has seen the darker side of humanity and has no time for frivolousness, whereas she plays Tom as someone desperate to have a childhood, but who also wants to make her father proud. In one particularly telling scene, when they must leave on a moment's notice, he tells her to pack only what is essential, and she places a toy horse in her backpack, but only after she has wrapped it up so Will can't see it, an action which tells us a great deal about both characters.\r\n\r\nThe film's pacing is both its greatest asset and its biggest flaw. To speed things up would have compromised the tone Granik is going for. However, this kind of methodical pacing is likely to alienate a lot of viewers, who will undoubtedly criticise the film as boring, and its focus on Will and Tom to the exclusion of almost everything else as too narrow. When it does branch out (for example, a minor sub-theme is the treatment of veterans upon their return to society), it is only insofar as to show how the two main characters are affected. What's especially interesting about the story, however, is that the narrative seems predicated on the transcendentalist notion of the inherent goodness of people; pretty much everyone Will and Tom encounter is trying to do right by them, even the social workers are genuinely trying to help them. In the end, what the film gives us is a deeply respectful portraiture of a man trying to make the best of it in the only way he knows how. A fine film.","id":"5cc25a01c3a3681e6b805326","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cc25a01c3a3681e6b805326","movie_id":443463}

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"Cam thrillingly records commentary on social media before glitching out at the climax. If ever there was a relatable topic in my life right now, or atleast for the past few years, it\u2019s this one. The ever-growing addiction to social media, thirsting on the superficial requirement of \u201cpopularity\u201d. That unnecessary attentive praise for the detailed work I\u2019ve produced. Followers and likes on Instagram. Helpful votes on other review sites. It doesn\u2019t matter. It is a regressive byproduct of artificial socialisation. Cam, for it\u2019s introductory act, depicts the fundamental issue with modern reality perfectly. A young woman, who performs live shows on an adult entertainment website, rapidly escalates her controversial performances in an attempt to become the most watched entertainer.\r\n\r\nIn a society where individuals can get paid to showcase nudity online, with anonymous users tipping the entertainer, the addiction and lust for exploiting one\u2019s self to earn a few hundred dollars has never been easier. Yet still within the guidelines of the law. Whilst it may sound monetarily heavenly to earn a living from the comfort of your own bedroom, it comes with potential consequences. Stalkers attempting to locate your abode. Anonymity running the risk of friends and family members discovering your explicit content.\r\n\r\nHowever, it\u2019s the psychological impact that Cam explores, in particular \u201cLola\u201d and her manifestation of envy. She wants to be the best. The top girl. And she\u2019s willing to do anything and everything to get that position. A modern issue for the youth of today who become addicted to technological entertainment such as gaming and adult content. Brewer\u2019s engrossing performance enabled a subtle layer of sympathy to come through. It\u2019s a relatable issue. Naturally, we resent her actions through a shocked expression, but empathise due to relatability. Obese old white men pleasuring themselves behind the security of their webcams. It\u2019s gross, to say the least, yet a trend that does occur and is exploited. ChatRoulette is just one of many websites that harness the power of anonymity for sexual exploitation.\r\n\r\nThen the direction changes as the plot progresses. Another entity is pretending to be \u201cLola\u201d and locking the real \u201cLola\u201d out of her account. This second act shifts the focus from thirsting popularity to conspicuous mystery. Who or what is pretending to be \u201cLola\u201d? Old videos that have been downloaded and re-uploaded? A doppelg\u00e4nger? Regardless, the story\u2019s believability diminishes as the plot unfolds, but still remains captivating throughout due to the subject matter that is depicted. \u201cLola\u201d as a character loses her dimensionality in order to focus on this imposter, detrimental to the thrilling nature of the narrative. Simply, it becomes more convoluted as it nears its climax. Then the third act commenced, and the mysterious reveal was exactly as I feared. Non-sensical. Illogical. Essentially, stupid. Initially what started out as a realistic subject study, concluded as a surrealistic mess. A dire shame considering how engaged I was throughout.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Cam exceeded my expectations (although fairly low to begin with...). Illustrating a topic that should be discussed more frequently in today\u2019s Internet environment.

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_I wouldn't call it entertaining per se, but it's certainly provocative_**\r\n\r\n>_I saw kids who are so neglected, so abused that there's nothing anymore in their eyes. These children don't laugh, don't cry, and don't play. If you put a toy in front of them, they don't touch it. They are just numb. There's no more childhood in their eyes. After seeing these kids many times, when they started to have a trusting relationship with me, I used to ask them, \"are you happy to be alive?\" Ninety-nine percent of the kids answered \"no\". They told me: \"I'm not happy to be here.\" \"Why am I here when there'__s no one to take care of me?\" \"Why am I here if I'm going to be hungry all the time?\" They have the feeling that they're here because they are being punished for something._\r\n\r\n- Nadine Labaki; _Capharna\u00fcm_ Production Notes\r\n\r\nTaking as its subject the horrific plight of guttersnipe children in the slums of Beirut, _Capharna\u00fcm_ is the kind of film of which a superficial reading might suggest miserablism at best, and \"poverty porn\" at worst. Comparisons to film such as Danny Boyle's _Slumdog Millionaire_ (2008), Stephen Daldry's _Trash_ (2014), and Sean Baker's _The Florida Project_ (2017) are probably inevitable, albeit not very informative if one wishes to parse the film. Instead, it's much more useful to view _Capharna\u00fcm_ in the tradition of classic Italian neorealist pictures such as Luchino Visconti's _Ossessione_ (1943) and _La Terra Trema_ (19548), Roberto Rossellini's _Roma citt\u00e0 aperta_ (1945) and _Germania anno zero_ (1948), and Vittorio De Sica's _Ladri di biciclette_ (1948) and _Umberto D._ (1952), albeit far more pessimistic than any of them.\r\n\r\nThe third film from Lebanese writer\/actress\/director Nadine Labaki (_Caramel_; _Where Do We Go Now?_), _Capharna\u00fcm_ is written by Labaki, Michelle Keserwany, and Labaki's regular writing partner Jihad Hojaily (Georges Khabbaz, Labaki's husband, and the film's producer and composer, Khaled Mouzanar are credited with \"screenplay collaboration\"). Presenting a _milieu_ in which people are utterly discardable, the film depicts children who are literally bought and sold for a few chickens; 11-year-old girls who are married off so their family can afford the rent; babies who are fed on ice cubes covered in sugar; refugees who roam the streets; mental illness which goes untreated; and people without a Lebanese identity card who don't officially exist. Uplifting it most certainly is not. In a similar tonal key to H\u00e9ctor Babenco's _Pixote: a Lei do Mais Fraco_ (1981) and Walter Salles's _Central do Brasil_ (1998), the film works because it never feels like it's exploiting, patronising, or trivialising the poverty and misfortune it depicts, never attempting to manipulate the audience into feeling a preconceived emotion. On the contrary, it's matter-of-fact, and notable for just how unsentimental it is. However, it's also deeply humanist, with genuine compassion in its DNA and a quiet rage at its core, born partly from an inherent sense of authenticity; shot in the style of _cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9_, it uses non-professional actors whose lives are not dissimilar from the characters they play, with Labaki encouraging improvisation throughout. There are some problems, of course - the framing device of a trial is poorly conceived and distracts from the superior filmmaking surrounding it, the ending is disappointingly didactic, and the litany of hardships endured by the main character does get a little over-the-top. However, this is undeniably impressive filmmaking, as harrowing and angry, as it is solicitous and respectful.\r\n\r\nZain El Hajj (Zain Al Rafeea) is a young boy from the slums of Beirut serving a five-year prison sentence for, as he puts it, \"_stabbing a son-of-a-bitch_.\" Neither he nor his parents, mother Souad (Kawsar Al Haddad) and father Selim (Fadi Youssef), know Zain's exact age, as he was never officially registered, and therefore has no birth cert. As the film begins, Zain is brought before a judge, as he has decided to sue his parents for bringing him into the world despite not being able to care for their already numerous children. The film then flashes back several months, with Zain working as a delivery boy for the family's landlord, Assad (Nour El Husseini). Life is harsh, but Zain and his sister, 11-year-old sister Sahar (Haita \"Cedra\" Izzam), look out for one another. When he sees bloodstains on her underwear, he helps her hide the fact that she has begun her period, believing their parents might try to marry her off. Making plans to escape with her, Zain returns home one day to find his parents in the process of handing Sahar over to Assad. A brutal struggle ensues, but Zain fails to save her, and that night, he runs away. Seeking refuge in a rundown amusement park, he meets Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw), an Ethiopian refugee working as a cleaner. Taking pity on Zain, she agrees to let him stay with her in exchange for him looking after her one-year-old son Yonas (an absolutely astounding performance by Boluwatife Treasure Bankole) when she's at work. Her forged migrant documents are set to expire soon and as she doesn't have enough money to pay her forger, Aspro (Alaa Chouchnieh), for new papers, he is trying to persuade her to sell him Yonas. As time passes, Zain, Rahil, and Yonas form a tight bond, until one day, Rahil doesn't return home from work, leaving Zain and Yonas to fend for themselves.\r\n\r\nThoroughly uplifting stuff, am I right? Labaki first got the idea for the film when she saw a woman and a one-year-old baby on a traffic island in Beirut. In the film's production notes, Labaki writes,\r\n\r\n> _the little boy couldn't sleep. Every time he would doze off, he would wake up again. And it hit me. The only place where this kid is going to experience life is this half a meter of concrete between two highways. It's all he knows._\r\n\r\nWhen she got home, she drew a picture of a child shouting at a group of adults, with the caption,\r\n\r\n> _I'm sorry! I quit! I don't want to be here! I don't belong in your world! I don't want to breathe, eat, play, learn, laugh or dream! I don't want to grow up to become like you! You have failed me!_\r\n\r\nBrainstorming, she began to write down everything that bothered her about the situation;\r\n\r\n> _where did the system fail these kids? Why do we as a society allow this sort of injustice to happen? The migrant workers' situation in Lebanon; the absurdity of the notion of frontiers; the absurdity that you need a paper to prove that you exist._\r\n\r\nLooking at the list of topics, she thought of the French word, \"_Capharna\u00fcm_\" (alternatively spelt Capernaum). The term was originally the name of a Biblical fishing village on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee, which is mentioned multiple times across all four gospels, as a place where Jesus performed several miracles. However, it's best known from Matthew 11:23, when Jesus curses the village for its lack of faith in him (\"_And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day_\"). Later on, however, the word came to be used in French literature to signify a state of chaos and disorder. The current dictionary definition is, \"_a confused jumble; a place marked by a disorderly accumulation of objects_\".\r\n\r\nBeginning to research what life is really like for children of poverty, Labaki went to prisons for minors, refugee camps, courtrooms, and the streets themselves. Shooting with as small a crew as possible, she elected to use a non-professional cast whose lives resembled those of the character they're playing (like Rahil, Shiferaw is an illegal Ethiopian immigrant who was working as a cleaner; like Sahar, Izzam was unable to attend school in Lebanon, and was selling gum on the street; like Souad, Haddad has children for whom she has been unable to get ID). In this sense, casting director Jennifer Haddad deserves a great deal of praise, as she's done an astounding job of pulling together an authentic ensemble. During the shoot, Labaki would give the performers the basic outline of a scene, but allow them to use their own words and mannerisms, and draw upon their own experiences, without worrying too much about where the scene is supposed to go. With the film being shot in sequence, this necessitated that the script was constantly being rewritten, so as to accommodate something which somebody had improvised.\r\n\r\nFrom an aesthetic perspective, Labaki wisely keeps things simple and functional, eschewing any directorial gymnastics, with the aesthetic design perfectly chosen to convey the story she wishes to tell. Adopting a documentarian sense of realism, cinematographer Christopher Aoun sticks to handheld cameras and, for the most part, natural lighting. The scenes on the streets of Beirut are especially impressive, with Labaki shooting most of the material from roughly Zain's height, or slightly lower. This allows the scenes to adopt a heavily focalised and subjective view of the world, without having to resort to less elegant POV shots. Chadi Roukoz's sound design is also superb in these exterior scenes, with the soundtrack crammed with car horns, shouting, crying, laughter, dogs barking, airplanes flying overhead, traffic on the streets. It's an aural overload, conveying how the massive city is overwhelming Zain, and again, tying us to his subjectivity.\r\n\r\nLaure Gardette (_Jeune & Jolie_; _Frantz_) and Konstantin Bock's editing is also laudable. Even apart from the fact that they had to cull the film from over 500 hours of footage (the first cut ran 12 hours), with the complete editing process taking over two years, the editing is extremely powerful in certain scenes, with the specific cuts tied closely to the theme and tone of the film. Probably the two best examples are the scene where Zain is trying to prevent his parents from giving Sahar to Assad, and a later scene when Zain leaves Yonas on the side of the road and tries to walk away. The fight for Sahar balances, on the one hand, combinations of shots focusing on Sahar and the parents, and on the other, an equal number of shots focused solely on Zain. This places him front-and-centre in the _mise en sc\u00e8ne_, simply by virtue of the fact that we see more of him than any of the other characters. The result is that the scene, although ostensibly concerned with the parents' choice to give Sahar away, is actually more about Zain's reaction to that choice. Similarly, in the scene where he tries to leave Yonas, the editing focuses on him rather than the baby - the shots of Zain are longer, there are more of them, and there are a combination of different framings, whereas all of the shots of Yonas are uniform. This kind of editing is as shrewd as it is subtle, giving Zain a greater sense of agency and energy, and ensuring the audience knows that he, not Yonas, should be the focus of our attention.\r\n\r\nLabaki sets the tone for the film to come in the very first shot, as we see Zain, filthy dirty, in only his vest and underwear. It is subsequently driven home multiple times that life is almost worthless in this place - Sahar is sold for some chickens, Aspro tries to get Rahil to sell Yonas in return for forged migrant documents, Assad tells Zain, \"_I can buy a human for 500_\". This is a world in which people think of children in the same way as they think of commodities, with the notion of adults protecting children subservient to that of adults looking at children in a cold transactional manner. In such a place, Zain somehow manages to retain his sense of empathy, although he too is infected with the concept that everything is transactional, as his pragmatism illustrates to him that materialism is the order of the day. However, although he suppresses his sense of compassion, he does not completely extinguish it, nor would he want to. In a world where adults are reprehensible, and children their innocent victims, Zain is the story's moral compass, exhibiting a humanity far in excess of any kindness than has ever been shown to him.\r\n\r\nThematically, Zain's jaded disillusionment, which is far more pronounced than it should ever be in a child his age, echoes the line from _Ladri di biciclette_, when Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) decries, \"_I curse the day I was born._\" Zain himself is kind of an amalgamation of Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) from Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's _Les quatre cents coups_ (1959), Huckleberry Finn, and any number of Charles Dickens youngsters (Oliver Twist, David Copperfield, Little Dorrit, Philip Pirrip, aka Pip), with his unique perspective on the world illuminating the horrors of that world in a way that would be impossible were he an adult. An important plot point in relation to Zain is his lack of an ID card. Without being registered when he was born, he can't get a state ID, meaning he is effectively a non-person; he cannot own a passport, he cannot legally work, and he is not entitled to an education or medical care, a situation that attains an almost Kafka-esque surrealism in its bureaucratic absurdity.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, there are a few. The framing device of the trial, for example, is awkwardly realised, and for the most part, serves only to interrupt the far more compelling story of Zain, Rahil, and Yonas. Additionally, not only do the scenes in court come across as more heavily scripted than everything else, but they also depict something that couldn't happen (as Labaki herself has acknowledged, children can't sue their parents for giving birth to them). Obviously intended as a means to dramatize how Zain wants a voice, it is nonetheless a narrative contrivance that gets in the way of the far more accomplished filmmaking seen elsewhere. Surrounded by the more naturalistic realism of the rest of the film, the court scenes stand out because they feel like a plot machination. The third act in particular, which focuses primarily on the trial, and which features the usual impassioned speeches you would get in any clich\u00e9d courtroom drama, strays into something Labaki has deftly avoid everywhere else; didacticism. Elsewhere, there is something of a sense that Labaki overloads the story, pushing just one too many hardships on Zain, as she attempts to cover a plethora of topics. For example, she touches on domestic violence, the migrant crisis, human trafficking, paedophilia, child labour, education, the justice system, and on occasion, the film feels like it's going to collapse under the weight of human suffering and thematic nihilism. This is a shame because some of the best scenes in the film are those involving Zain and Yonas just going about their day, and if Labaki had had the confidence in these quieter moments, she might have scaled back on the socio-political content.\r\n\r\nIn a strange way, _Capharna\u00fcm_ has something of the same thematic DNA as Paul Schrader's _First Reformed_ (2017), with both films examining the morality of bringing children into a world of suffering (albeit from fundamentally different perspectives, with Schrader's examination far more existential than Labaki's practical workaday world). Never feeling exploitative, nor glorifying the poverty at its centre, the film isn't even especially sentimental, depicting scenes with a raw matter-of-factness, that were they featured in a Hollywood movie would be in slow-motion, with string music telling us to \"Cry now\". Zain is no saint; he's a rough, foul-mouthed thief, but he's also the most inherently honourable character in the film. Labaki could easily have used Zain to attempt to elicit unearned pity, but instead, she is far more interested in examining the day-to-day survival of children like him. One of his most salient characterises is his practical-minded solutions to the challenges he faces, and in this, we're encouraged to respect how he responds to his situation rather than pity him for being in such a situation in the first place. The film adopts something of the same manner; much like Zain, it's tough-minded and practical, and just as his hardened exterior is completely authentic, so too is the film's quiet anger. Placing us not just in Zain's world, but, crucially, in his subjective interpretation of that world, Labaki draws us to him, allowing us to view the world partly as outraged adults, but also as sharers in his experiences. The conclusion is disappointingly didactic, and the journey there harrowing and exhausting. However, in the last shot, Labaki dares to offer a very cautious bit of optimism, and ultimately, the takeaway is not despair, but compassion. Just as Zain finds a humanity within himself that should be long dead, the film finds a moment of optimism amidst the chaos, and encourages the audience to cling to it.","id":"5d377f2de54d5d20a4dc8582","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d377f2de54d5d20a4dc8582","movie_id":517814}

I had had no experience failing_.\r\n\r\n- Lee Israel; _Can You Ever Forgive Me?: Memoirs of a Literary Forger_ (2008)\r\n\r\nDirected by Marielle Heller, with a screenplay by Nicole Holofcener (who was originally attached to direct) and Jeff Whitty, _Can You Ever Forgive Me?_ is based on Lee Israel's 2008 memoir, _Can You Ever Forgive Me?: Memoirs of a Literary Forger_. Taking the form of a buddy crime caper in which two mismatched rogues are thrown together by circumstances and set out to stick it to a system, if you strip away the easily-digestible\/easily-marketable surface, you'll find that _Can You Ever Forgive Me?_ is a surprisingly moving study of loneliness.\r\n\r\nFunny in places, the film is very much anchored by its two leads - Melissa McCarthy as Israel herself, a broke unemployed 51-year-old lesbian alcoholic who is pouring her time and energy into a book no one wants to read, and is unable to even pay her beloved cat's vet fees; and Richard E. Grant as her (fictional) friend Jack Hock, a promiscuous homeless homosexual junkie. On paper, these are not the kind of people you'd want to spend time with, nor the kind of people you'd expect to care about. But Holofcener and Whitty's script is so good, Heller's direction so subtle, and the performances so nuanced and layered that you do come to care for them. Rather deeply in fact. Indeed, there's a scene about three-quarters of the way through the film that's one of the most devastatingly succinct depictions of utter heartbreak and physically manifested grief that I can recall seeing on screen. The film is presented in such a way as to show us that behind the acerbic fa\u00e7ade these two people have constructed for themselves, they are vulnerable, lonely, and scared, and although neither would admit it, they are both crying out for meaningful human companionship. There's a lot of pathos in that, and Heller makes sure to mine every single bit of it in what is an unexpectedly exceptional film.\r\n\r\nSet in New York in 1991 against the backdrop of the AIDS epidemic, the film tells the story of Lee Israel (McCarthy). Once a celebrated biographer, her books _Miss Tallulah Bankhead_ (1972) and _Kilgallen: An Intimate Biography of Dorothy Kilgallen_ (1980) were both well received, with Kilgallen placing on _The New York Times_ Best Seller list. However, her 1985 book, _Est\u00e9e Lauder: Beyond the Magic_, was a critical and commercial failure, and she is subsequently unable to generate interest in a proposed biography of Fanny Brice. By 1991, finding herself out of touch with the current literary vogue of prolific and trashy celebratory authors such as Tom Clancy, she has become so irrelevant that her agent, Marjorie (Jane Curtin), is reluctant to return her calls, ultimately telling her she should find another line of work. Financially crippled, Israel is unable even to afford the vet bill for her beloved cat, Jersey, and so she begins to sell her belongings, including a letter from Katharine Hepburn. Whilst continuing to research her Brice biography, she happens upon an original letter from Brice folded in a book. Taking it to a local book-seller, Anna (Dolly Wells), Israel is told that the more interesting the contents of a letter, the more it will sell for. With this in mind, she begins to forge and sell letters by deceased celebrities such as Edna Ferber, Dorothy Parker, Ernest Hemingway, No\u00ebl Coward, Marlene Dietrich, Lillian Hellman, and Louise Brooks, ensuring they contain intimate details so as to command a higher price. Meanwhile, Israel develops a friendship with Jack Hock (Grant), who is eventually pulled into her scheme. However, when the forgeries are discovered and the FBI become involved, both Israel and Jack find themselves in over their heads.\r\n\r\nThe film was originally announced in April 2015, with Julianne Moore as Israel, and Nicole Holofcener (_Friends With Money_; _Please Give_; _Enough Said_), set to direct from her own script. In May, Chris O'Dowd was cast as Jack. However, in July, Moore dropped out due to \"creative differences\", and was soon followed by Holofcener and O'Dowd. In May 2016, Melissa McCarthy was cast as Israel, with Marielle Heller (_The Diary of a Teenage Girl_), directing from playwright Jeff Whitty's (_Avenue Q_; _Head Over Heels_) rewrite of Holofcener's original script. The phrase \"_can you ever forgive me_\", which is also the title of Israel's memoirs, is taken from a line Israel used in a forged letter from Dorothy Parker. The real Israel began writing in the 1960s for _The New York Times_ and _Soap Opera Digest_. In 1967, she wrote a piece on Katharine Hepburn shortly after the death of Spencer Tracy that was published in _Esquire_. In 1972, she published _Miss Tallulah Bankhead_, and in 1980, _Kilgallen: An Intimate Biography of Dorothy Kilgallen_, which made it onto _The New York Times_ Best Seller list.\r\n\r\nIn 1983, Macmillan paid her an advance to begin a warts-and-all Est\u00e9e Lauder biography. Lauder herself tried to block the biography, with Israel claiming that Lauder repeatedly offered to pay her off to stop writing. When Israel refused, Lauder began writing her own memoirs. Both were published in 1985, but Israel's was critically thrashed and a commercial failure. Israel later wrote,\r\n\r\n> _instead of taking a great deal of money from a woman rich as Oprah, I published a bad, unimportant book, rushed out in months to beat hers to market._\r\n\r\nWith the failure of the book, Israel's career went into rapid decline, and she was soon on food stamps (which isn't shown in the film). Upon beginning her letter scam, Israel went to extraordinary lengths to make her forgeries difficult to detect - she obtained old typewriters appropriate to the era in which the letters were supposedly written, with each typewriter assigned to a different person; in order to match the paper to that used in real letters, she would tear out blank pages from the back of contemporaneous periodical journals, or, when that wasn't an option, she would bake paper to age it; she read real letters from her subjects to better ensure that the cadence of her forgeries was appropriate; she would trace over signatures by placing pages on an upturned TV. According to Israel, she either altered, forged, or stole over 400 letters in total.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, _Can You Ever Forgive Me?_ is not about Israel's scam; it's about two exceptionally flawed people. Just as she did in her debut feature, Heller presents fully dimensional portraits of such people within the larger framework of a vibrantly realised milieu; in _Diary of a Teenage Girl_, it was the sexual liberation of San Francisco in the 1970s, whereas here it's the AIDS epidemic of New York in the 1980s\/1990s. However, just as _Diary_ was not about an epoch, but about a specific person within it, such is the case in _Forgive_, where AIDS is always present, but rarely foregrounded; it's the backdrop of the story, not the subject. Credit must also be given to Holofcener and Whitty's script, which vividly represents some extremely unpleasant aspects of Israel and Jack's loneliness (Israel's apartment, for example, is infested with flies, which isn't the most subtle metaphor of all time, but it is effective). In this sense, the film fits very much into Holofcener's _oeuvre_, and it would have been very interesting to see what she'd have done with the material had she remained on as director.\r\n\r\nCut off from virtually all human contact, grouchy and bitter, Israel only ever seems at ease when buried in research or lying in bed with Jersey. However, in contradistinction to most narratives about this type of acerbic personality (think films as varied as Peter Berg's _Hancock_ or Alexander Payne's _Nebraska_), there's no real attempt to humanise or redeem Israel, and even when the story reaches its emotional apex, there's no real sense of the moment being instructive or a watershed. Even when she goes on a date, she is afforded very little humanity, as she purposely sabotages the encounter moments after realising she is beginning to open up, as if she's ashamed of herself for showing vulnerability. Indeed, in practical terms, Israel has very little arc; she's a little softer at the end, but not much (in her final scene she laughs about being in a bar when she's supposed to be at an AA meeting, and jokes about tripping up an AIDS patient with a crutch). Furthermore, the film never excuses her crimes. It does rationalise why she started forging letters, but it never celebrates or condones her activities.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely committing to her performance, Melissa McCarthy completely immerses herself in Israel, in what is easily her best role to date. Helped in no small part by the frumpy costume design by Arjun Bhasin (_Life of Pi_; _Love is Strange_) and the less-than-flattering hairstyling by Linda D. Flowers (_Captain America: The First Avenger_; _The Hunger Games_; _Furious 7_), Israel seems organically fused to the production design of Stephen H. Carter (_The Bourne Legacy_; _Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)_; _Spotlight_), with her world one of dirty browns, dark beiges, and neutralising greys. Both the film and McCarthy lean into the fact that Israel is such a contentious, contrary, and unlikable individual. In an early scene at a party, for example, Israel steals toilet rolls, some shrimp, and someone's jacket. At one point, an exacerbated Marjorie tells her, \"_you have destroyed every bridge I have built for you_\", explaining, \"_either become a nicer person or make a name for yourself. As an unknown, you can't be such a bitch._\"\r\n\r\nHowever, what makes the performance so good is that no matter how cruel Israel is, no matter how irreverent and combative, her loneliness is always there to see, making it difficult to dislike her as much as we should. McCarthy touches on everything from friendship to creative insecurity to heartbreak, so as easy as it is to view her antagonistically, it's almost impossible to really condemn her. Yes, her exterior is prickly and calloused, but it serves to cover up not insignificant pain. Yes, she can be unjustifiably misanthropic, but she's also extremely vulnerable. McCarthy plays Israel as her own worst enemy, a deeply sad woman, whose acerbity is both a cause and a result of her situation. Where the performance really excels is in the subtle ways McCarthy shows us Israel's buried humanity, demonstrating how much she craves companionship \u2013 we see it in how she is when alone with Jersey, we see it in how she gravitates towards Jack, we see it in the early parts of her date with Anne, we see it in a brief scene when she meets up with her ex, Elaine (Anna Deavere Smith).\r\n\r\nMcCarthy is perfectly matched by Richard E. Grant, who plays Jack as a rouge's rouge, difficult to pin down (when Lee asks him what he does, he replies, \"_oh, this and that. Mainly that_\"), a mischievous shark-ish smile permanently on his face, never one to let minor things like homelessness or drug addiction get him down. Their chemistry is perfectly modulated, and their scenes together (which take up about half of the film) are so well written and performed, so hilariously denigrating and quick-witted, you'd be happy to sit there watching them all day. Like McCarthy, Grant is well aware of Jack's flaws, and like McCarthy, he emphasises them rather hides them. Jack actually has a more conventional arc than Israel, and two scenes in particular really push the audience's ability to view him sympathetically. Whilst Israel remains on a relatively even keel throughout, with her worst characteristics on display from the get-go, Jack's core is revealed more slowly, and towards the end of the film, his choices show his character in a different, and not especially flattering, light. With this in mind, it's a testament to Grant's performance that Jack remains so demonstrably human throughout.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the film is the pride that Israel takes in what she is doing. Yes, it's criminal, but she takes the work very seriously and is proud of the results. In her book, Israel argued that the forged letters were the best work of her career, far surpassing her three biographies, proudly claiming, \"_I'm a better Dorothy Parker than Dorothy Parker_\". When Jack mentions what she's doing is not dissimilar to the _Hitler Diaries_, she momentarily beams with pride. At a later point, when Jack expresses disdain for the importance of the forgeries, Israel chastises him, telling him the letters are \"_a portal into a better time and a better place when people still respected the written word_\", following this up with the curt, \"_respect what you're selling_\". She may be a criminal, but she has reverence for what she does.\r\n\r\nIn reality, Israel had struggled for decades to find her place in New York's literary scene, unsuccessfully (of course, it didn't help that she despised everyone in the industry). She had spent the 1970s and 1980s writing biographies, but by the early 90s, the scene had changed, and she had failed to change with it. Who can blame Marjorie for not being especially interested in a biography of Fanny Brice when she has someone like Tom Clancy as a client? Sure, he's a hack who churns out variations on the same story over and over again (think a slightly more talented Dan Brown), but his books sell millions, whereas Israel's most recent work was marked down by 75% only weeks after going on sale. Indeed, the film takes a particularly funny swipe at Clancy (although he's never mentioned in the memoirs). He is shown at a party (played by Kevin Carolan), wearing the most pretentious polo-neck I've ever seen, and conceitedly telling a group of hangers-on,\r\n\r\n> _writer's block is a term invented by the writing community to justify their laziness. My success is nothing more than that I have the dedication and stamina to sit and get the work done._\r\n\r\nOf course, the fact that Israel's forgeries proved so successful highlighted two extremes of her ability; yes, she could be genuinely creative, but only when imitating someone else's voice. This is why she was such a good biographer - apart from being a diligent researcher, the most important skill for a biographer is the ability to place the reader in the head of the subject, i.e. to imitate them. The letters proved that Israel could do this with unparalleled success (much to her amusement, two of the letters she forged from Coward were actually published in the first imprint of Barry Day's 2007 book, _The Letters of No\u00ebl Coward_, although they were removed for the second printing). They also demonstrated that she had a keen and caustic literary wit, although it was a talent of which she unsure what to do for most of her life. Interestingly, in the book, Israel says she was uncomfortable with the fact that due to increased scrutiny on the part of buyers, she had to start stealing real letters from archives, replacing them with forgeries, and then selling the originals. Not only does outright theft violate the sanctity of the written word which she holds so dear, but, perhaps more importantly, the creative element of her work was now lost - all she was doing was copying from one page to another. Indeed, when the film depicts this phase of her forgeries, it does so dispassionately, void of the sense of fun which had been very apparent up to this point.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, the film is gorgeous in how drab it looks. I've seen numerous critics talk about how evocative it is of a New York that's long since gone, and, having never been to New York, I'll have to take their word for it, but I'll certainly agree it exudes an evocative sense of place, reminding me of something like the New York of Spike Lee's _25th Hour_ (2002) or the Tokyo of Sofia Coppola's _Lost in Translation_ (2003). I've already mentioned the production design, wardrobe, and hair, but equally as impressive is the cinematography by Brandon Trost (_Crank: High Voltage_; _Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping_; _The Disaster Artist_). It's rare that you see a film where it doesn't just look cold, it literally feels cold, as if the weather has somehow gotten into the texture of the celluloid. This damp and dreary New York is a million miles from the more romantic depictions of the city we're so used to seeing. It's a place where people still smoke in bars and workplaces and do cocaine in public toilets, where there are warm, cosy bookshops on every street corner. Again, I can't attest to this myself, but I'm told the venerable old-school New York bookshop is, sadly, a dying breed, an analogue institution in an increasingly digital world. The point is, the world of the film feels lived in; from Israel's horrific apartment with its cat faeces and fly infestation, to the bookshops, to the gay bars she and Jack frequent - everything feels like it was just filmed as is, without an art department finessing it, even extending to the props, which prove so important once Israel has acquired multiple typewriters.\r\n\r\nIt's rare I write a review in which I legitimately struggle for something to criticise, but this is such a review. Aside from Israel lacking an arc (which I personally don't see as a problem, but some definitely will), the only other thing I would bring up concerns the tone of the story, which remains detached, and which some will probably find too impersonal. I guess some people might find the story a bit dull as well.\r\n\r\nThis is a film about fundamentally broken people trying to put themselves back together, about people on the edge trying to chart a course to the centre, about scavengers trying to find something life-changing in the wreckage. It asks the question (although never explicitly) how such a talented writer as Israel could have gone unnoticed and ended up as she did. With the industry what it is today, this is an even more pertinent question than it was in 1991 (or 2001. Or 2011 for that matter). What is on the surface (and what is being marketed as) a caper dramedy is, in fact, a much deeper and more observant study of human frailties and failings, a paean to the importance of friendship, and (clich\u00e9 alert) the importance of love (even if it's only of the feline variety). Melissa McCarthy gives a monumental performance in a role that, in any other year, would have made her a favourite for Best Actress. This year, she's competing against Olivia Colman for her performance in Yorgos Lanthimos's _The Favourite_, which means she hasn't a hope in hell of winning. However, hopefully, this will lead to more dramatic roles down the line. She certainly deserves them.","id":"5d2bbaa9b84f94001449467b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d2bbaa9b84f94001449467b","movie_id":401847}

{"author":"trineo03","content":"First of all, the acting in this film just perfect. In every scene, you can see and tell that all the actors and actresses were giving it their one hundred and ten percent. Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne played compelling characters that seemed like real people. I think any parent will be able to relate to them in one way or another. The kid actors did great, especially Isabela Moner who plays Lizzy. Just like how Mark and Rose played characters parents can relate to Isabela played a character that a majority of teens can relate to. I know I could easily relate to her. The pacing in the film was surprisingly great. I thought for a film like this they would want to rush some scenes but no. All the scenes seemed to have the perfect pacing in them and only a few of them were cut a bit too short but that didn\u2019t bother me too much. The humour in this film was placed in the right places and didn\u2019t seem forced. This film will take you on an emotional rollercoaster. At some parts, you\u2019ll be happy and laughing while in others trying to hold back tears. I also really enjoyed how the film felt like you were a fly on the wall during all the scenes. I think my only big problem with this film is when they tried to throw more conflict into the film. I won\u2019t say what they did but it was unnecessary and could have just been cut out of the film altogether. Also, the few scenes that should have been longer but weren\u2019t also kind of bugged me but didn\u2019t ruin my enjoyment of the film. In the end, this film is an excellent film for the whole family to go and see.

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Very strange, very stylish, very funny, but not for everyone_**\r\n\r\n> _Modern man is drinking and drugging himself out of awareness, or he spends his time shopping, which is the same thing._\r\n\r\n- Ernest Becker; _The Denial of Death_ (1973)\r\n\r\n> _In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should enjoy unprecedented savings on all their favourite brands. This was the first Black Friday and took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria. All went to their own towns to find their discounts. Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the cit__y of David called Bethlehem, because he had his eye on a new laptop. He went to be registered at Target with Mary, to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in the latest styles from Old Navy, and laid him in a shopping cart, because they were waiting in line to get into Walmart._\r\n\r\n- Adam Kotsko; \"The story of the first Black Friday\" (2014)\r\n\r\nOne of the most visually and aurally accomplished filmmakers currently working, writer\/director Peter Strickland has thus far enjoyed considerable critical acclaim and some limited arthouse and festival success, but has been unable to make much of a mainstream impact. Not that he seems remotely bothered by this, as his latest, _In Fabric_, is easily the most impenetrable and singular work in his increasingly impressive _oeuvre_. On paper, it's all very straightforward \u2013 an unsuspecting customer buys a dress that seems to be haunted (or may actually be inherently evil), and it unleashes chaos in her life. But as anyone who has seen any of Strickland's previous films knows, bare plot outlines do little to convey the riches therein \u2013 sure, _Katalin Varga_ (2009) is a rape\/revenge thriller, _Berberian Sound Studio_ (2012) is a giallo love-letter, and _The Duke of Burgundy_ (2014) is an S&M-themed lesbian romance, but each one goes to some truly unexpected places not in any way suggested by their ostensible subject matter. With _In Fabric_, although it definitely flirts with embracing the transformative power of fine clothing and the positive psychological effects one can experience by wearing something one believes to look fantastic, Strickland is far more interested in roundly mocking some of the more crass elements of consumerism, particularly the pernicious and seemingly irresistible lure of \"the bargain\", and the herd mentality manufactured, maintained, and exploited by retail corporations during Black Friday (an event that if witnessed by aliens would surely lead to them judging us too intellectually rudimentary to bother conquering). _In Fabric_'s biggest single problem is that it's actually made up of two loosely-connected storylines, but because the first one is so much more interesting, it leads to some narrative slackness in the second half, and all in all, it's not a patch on his best work to date, _The Duke of Burgundy_. Nevertheless, it's brilliantly acted, looks (and sounds) amazing, has an unparalleled commitment to the more tactile elements of the medium, is exceptionally funny, and will never allow you look at a washing machine (or a washing machine repairman) in quite the same way again.\r\n\r\nSet in a London suburb at an unspecified point in time (although obviously meant to be during the 1980s), the film tells the story of bank teller Sheila Woolchapel (Marianne Jean-Baptiste, playing the role as if she's in a piece of 1960s social realist cinema). A recently-divorced mother to a teenage son, Vince (Jaygann Ayeh), whose older girlfriend Gwen (an unrecognisable Gwendoline Christie having an absolute blast) seems to have moved in without asking, Sheila's life is in a rut (the most excitement she has is watching Vince and Gwen having sex through a keyhole...don't ask). Having recently placed a lonely-hearts ad in the paper, she has an upcoming date, and is determined to make a good first impression, and so visits a Dentley & Soper department store looking to buy something nice in the January sales. Apparently run by a coven of witches who don't even bother trying to conceal their true identities, Sheila is all but accosted by Eastern European sales assistant Miss Luckmoore (Strickland regular Fatma Mohamed, who gleefully plays the role like she's in a Halloween special of _The Simpsons_, and who describes the store as \"_a panoply of temptation_\"). Talked into buying a beautiful \"_artery red_\" dress, it doesn't take long for Sheila to realise that something is not entirely kosher about the garment - from prompting dog attacks to trashing her washing machine to floating above her bed to having strange phrases sown into the lining (\"_you who wear me will know me_\") to featuring prominently in particularly nasty dreams, clearly the dress is as nefarious as a Dublin-made shell suit (although it looks slightly less ridiculous), and has nothing but bad intentions for poor Sheila. And to make matters worse, the date is a bust. Meanwhile, the wedding of washing machine repairman Reg (Leo Bill) and his fianc\u00e9e Babs (Hayley Squires) is fast approaching; Sheila's micromanaging bosses, Stash and Clive (a hilarious Julian Barratt and Steve Oram, respectively), have some concerns over her method of shaking hands; Luckmoore and her boss, Lundy (Richard Bremmer), spend their free time doing something questionable to a mannequin; and a game of Ludo between Sheila, Vince, and Gwen redefines the term passive-aggressive.\r\n\r\nApparently inspired by Strickland's childhood memories of being taken to the January sales by his mother, he claims that they made such an indelible impression on his psyche that to this day, he experiences autonomous sensory meridian response whenever he encounters anything related to sales. Irrespective of this, _In Fabric_ is undeniably a consumerist satire, not entirely divorced from something like George A. Romero's _Dawn of the Dead_ (1978). The malignant control that capitalism exerts on the masses, the commodification of desire, the exploitation and manipulation of notions of self-worth, the vulgarity of a materialism serving as its own end - all are interwoven into the film's style, sensuality, and texture, much as the themes of his first three films are indistinguishable from their aesthetic design. Just look at how Strickland uses TV commercials advertising the sales; in a film partly about the impulses that drive us to purchase, these clips are the first (and certainly not the last) indication that consumerism is effectively a form of mass hypnosis. Strickland has a real talent for making theme elevate style into something more meaningful, and _In Fabric_ provides more evidence of that, with the highly-stylised aesthetic commenting on the ultimate emptiness of retail therapy, even as it seems to offer short-term happiness. Leaning into the artificiality of the film's _milieu_, Strickland makes no attempt to construct a believable, lived-in world, asking not only how do the customers of Dentley & Soper not realise something is wrong, but so too querying whether our own real-world behaviour is any different, when we see that item we've been craving turn up in a sale.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, although this is not an especially realistic film, it is an absolutely gorgeous film, one that gleefully embraces gaudy 70s kitsch from literally its opening frames (a perfectly manicured hand violently opening a box, followed by the most 70s title sequence you'll see all year). Reproducing the hyper-stylised look of classic giallos, the most obvious touchstone is Dario Argento's _Suspiria_ (1977), with Strickland and his young Australian director of photography Ari Wegner (_The Kettering Incident_; _Lady Macbeth_; _Stray_) bathing the film in a lurid colour palette of over-the-top reds, purples, and greens. The other-worldly vibe is helped immensely by Cavern of Anti-Matter's synth score full of harsh electronic screams and repetitive droning, and the queasy, disorientating sound design by Martin Pavey, executive producer Ben Wheatley's regular sound designer. Filling the soundtrack with non-diegetic whispering and incantations, the aural design keeps the viewer constantly on edge, as if the evil in the dress has somehow infected the magnetic track. Indeed, the sound design is just as important here as it was in _Berberian Sound Studio_, a film which was literally about sound design - just listen to the sounds of the bargain-hunting crowds in Dentley & Soper, with the incoherent mumbling of their stampede into the store turned into a chaotic, animal-like din.\r\n\r\nOne of the film's most successful elements, and one of the reasons it's so funny, is how ultra-seriously everyone takes the whole thing. Jean-Baptiste, Bill, and Squires (the three ostensible leads) all play their parts as if they're in a Ken Loach film (which all three have been in the past), whilst Strickland, for his part, approaches the whole endeavour with a similar reverence - there's no winking at the audience here, and it's the absence of such winking that makes it all so funny. From Stash and Clive explaining the correct etiquette when meeting the mistress of one's boss to the sexual power that Reg has over women once he starts explaining the inner workings of a washing machine, the film's humour is rooted firmly in the fact that no one involved acts like they're in a comedy, and it's this self-seriousness which is so disarmingly and consistently funny (just look at the Ludo game from hell or the scene where Stash and Clive discuss the difference between \"_looking for staff_\" and \"_trying to find staff_\"). The scenes of the dress crawling around Sheila's house are especially funny partly because they look so ridiculous (you can all but see the wires leading off-camera), but mainly because Strickland treats them with complete sincerity, as if he's not actually in on the joke (which he most certainly is). A film about an evil dress shouldn't work on any level except parody, yet it's precisely because the film doesn't seem parodic that it works so well, and that's a testament to his immense control of tone. This is particularly true of the batshit insane proclamations uttered by Luckmoore (\"_the hesitation in your voice soon to be an echo in the recesses of the spheres of retail_\"; \"_our perspectives on the specters of mortality must not be confused by an askew index of commerce_\"; \"_dimensions and proportions transcend the prisms of our measurements_\"; \"_did the transaction validate your paradigm of consumerism?_\"). This is pure verbal diarrhoea, and can only be in any way effective if it's roundly mocked. And yet, it's the utter dearth of mockery that renders each statement so hilarious.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, by the very nature of what he's trying to accomplish, Strickland is somewhat guilty of allowing the film's sensual elements to overwhelm the characters. Certainly, the film burrows under your skin and lodges there, and Strickland has absolute mastery of the difficult-to-control tactile components of the medium, but aside from Luckmoore, none of the characters really linger in the mind, despite the superb cast. None are especially interesting as people, and when the film focuses on them rather than the inherent strangeness at its core, it slackens quite a bit. From an emotional point of view, there isn't a huge amount of empathy or pathos, and had Strickland focused on just the one storyline, the whole might have worked slightly better. Or perhaps he should have gone in the other direction entirely, making it a kind of ensemble piece, with five or six different storylines, watching the dress affect different people in different ways. Also in relation to this, because the Sheila plot is so much more interesting that the Reg plot, the film seems front-loaded, which is never good. And although it didn't bother me, some people will really dislike the amount of loose ends, unexplained background elements, and narrative dead ends, especially in the bonkers last act.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I really enjoyed _In Fabric_. Yet more evidence that Strickland is a master stylist (in the best sense of the term), the craft behind the film is simply beyond reproach. Feeling for all the world like a rediscovered giallo, lost for the last four decades and restored to its original glory (complete with _very_ questionable dubbing), it's cryptic and impenetrable, but so too is it hilarious and a feast for the senses. No one makes films quite like Strickland, where the existential and esoteric rub shoulders with the tactile and the sensual, where the textures of the _milieu_ leap off the screen right alongside the themes. Hypnotic, seductive, immensely enjoyable, _In Fabric_ is quite unlike anything you'll see all year.","id":"5d816afed34eb3001c4f734f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d816afed34eb3001c4f734f","movie_id":475220}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Decent enough, but adheres far too rigidly to the_ Rocky _template_**\r\n\r\n> _I have not met one person who didn't like a_ Rocky _movie._\r\n\r\n- Steven Caple Jr.; \"How _Creed II_ Director Crafted His _Rocky IV_ Successor\" (Mia Galuppo); _The Hollywood Reporter_ (November 21, 2018)\r\n\r\nRyan Coogler's _Creed_ (2015) was probably the best of the remakequels (ostensible sequels that are, for all intents and purposes, remakes) that came out in the mid-2010s (the most obvious ones being J.J Abrams's _Star Wars: The Force Awakens_, Colin Trevorrow's _Jurassic World_, and Adam Wingard's _Blair Witch_), and was the first _Rocky_ film not written by Sylvester Stallone, and not directed by either Stallone or John G. Avildsen. After _Rocky Balboa_ did the seemingly impossible, redeeming and concluding the franchise after the damage done by _Rocky V_, _Creed_, written by Coogler and Aaron Covington, and directed by Coogler, did something even more unlikely \u2013 revitalising the franchise with Rocky himself as a supporting character. For the sequel, Stallone is back as a writer (sharing credit with Juel Taylor, from a story by Sascha Penn and Cheo Hodari Coker), with Steven Caple Jr. directing (Coogler is credited as an executive producer). Whereas _Creed_ was essentially a remake of the original _Rocky_, _Creed II_ is more of a combination of _Rocky III_ and _Rocky IV_, with some elements from _Rocky II_, and whilst it hits all the beats one expects from a _Rocky_ movie, the problem is that it hits them so slavishly, and does little else. It also, perhaps inevitably, suffers badly in comparison to its predecessor, especially in terms of direction \u2013 whereas Coogler's directorial work was assured, distinctive, and inventive, Caple Jr.'s is pedestrian and functional. Had it strayed from the formula just a tad, the way _Creed_ did, the way _Rocky Balboa_ did, it would have been a much better film instead of a bland rehash of something we've seen multiple times (and not just in this franchise, but in virtually every boxing movie). The kernel for a terrific film is there, but the execution is not, it features a litany of clich\u00e9s, it's dull, repetitive, the antagonist's subplot is infinitely more compelling than the main plot, and the culminating fight is almost parodic in design.\r\n\r\nIn _Rocky IV_, former WBC Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) was killed in the ring during an exhibition bout against Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). Determined to avenge the loss of his best friend, reigning champion Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) travelled to Moscow, where he not only defeated Drago, he also got the Soviet crowd on his side. 33 years later, Ivan's son, Viktor (the man-mountain that is Florian Munteanu), is training as a professional boxer in Ukraine, under the watchful eye of promoter Buddy Marcelle (Russell Hornsby). Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, three years after his professional debut against \"Pretty\" Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew), Apollo's son, Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan), is preparing for a bout against the champion, Danny \"Stuntman\" Wheeler (Andre Ward). Upon winning the title, Adonis proposes to his girlfriend, Bianca Taylor (Tessa Thompson), who says yes. Life seems perfect. That is until Viktor and Ivan head to the US and issue a very public challenge to Adonis. Meanwhile, Ivan tells Rocky, who is in Adonis's corner, that the fight is a way to regain honour for the Drago name, explaining that after their bout 33 years ago, he lost everything, including his wife, Ludmilla (Brigitte Nielsen), who left him shortly after Viktor's birth. Spurred on by Marcelle, and seeing an opportunity to avenge his father's death, Adonis plans to take the fight, but is warned against doing so by Rocky. When Adonis insists, Rocky says he can no longer train him. Adonis and Bianca move to Los Angeles so she can pursue her singing career, moving into a luxury apartment near Apollo's widow, Mary Anne (Phylicia Rash\u0101d). To replace Rocky, Adonis recruits Tony \"Little Duke\" Evers (Wood Harris), Wheeler's former trainer, and son of Tony \"Duke\" Evers (Tony Burton), who trained both Apollo and Rocky in the past. Feeling betrayed by Rocky, and finding it difficult to adjust to the recent changes in his life, including the fact that Bianca is pregnant, Adonis's preparations for the bout are not what they should be, whilst Ivan makes sure to push Viktor as hard as he possibly can.\r\n\r\nWhat's perhaps most surprising about _Creed II_ is that not only is it a sequel to _Creed_, it's also a sequel to one of the most ridiculous films of all time, and one which certainly didn't cry out for a continuation of the narrative, _Rocky IV_. _Creed_ recast the _Rocky_ template for a modern audience, setting it in a social-realist African-American _milieu_ and relegating Rocky to a supporting player. _Rocky IV_, by contrast, was the movie wherein the franchise abandoned all semblance of realism; the film in which Rocky himself, the working-class everyman, became a superhero (he even had a talking robot sidekick), travelling to the Soviet Union, defeating Communism, and winning the Cold War by preaching _glasnost_ to the Soviet people (two years before Ronald Reagan's \"_tear down this wall_\" speech). It's a movie so ridiculous that the poster quite literally tells you how it ends! It also features Sylvester Stallone all but sexually abusing Sergei Eisenstein's theories of montage. The first example of such (Rocky driving pensively into the night) is a montage of Rocky thinking about montages, and the second (Rocky training by cutting down trees and running atop mountains) is probably the most 80s thing to ever exist. The film is, in fact, so preposterous, far-fetched, and ludicrous that if you're unable to have fun watching it, you may as well just stop watching movies.\r\n\r\nFrom an aesthetic point of view, _Creed II_ is largely unremarkable (there's certainly nothing as epic as the single-shot fight from the first film), but one aspect that did stand out is the sound. As the first film established, Bianca is losing her hearing, something which is manifested in the aural design of _Creed II_ several times. At the start of the film, for example, as Bianca walks through the backstage area prior to the title fight, the sound of the crowd is soft and distanced until she puts in her hearing aid. Later, when Creed is training in a swimming pool, Bianca and Mary Anne are talking at another location, with their conversation carrying over his scenes. However, every time he goes below the water, the sound of their voices dulls as if it were diegetic. When Adonis is knocked down during his bout with Viktor, all sound is pulled from the film, only returning when he locks eyes with Bianca in the crowd. Even Adonis's marriage proposal involves her hearing aid. This is all thematic, of course, insofar as they are worried their child may inherit her hereditary hearing loss.\r\n\r\nThematically, legacy is a huge issue in _Creed II_, particularly as it relates to fathers and sons \u2013 Apollo and Adonis, Ivan and Viktor, Duke and Little Duke. Rocky himself is something of a surrogate father to Adonis, and is estranged from his own son, Robert (Milo Ventimiglia, who played the role in _Rocky Balboa_), and a grandson he has never met. Whilst _Creed_ saw Adonis use boxing as a way to symbolically bond with a father he never knew, _Creed II_ is more concerned with the emotionally fraught terrain that can result when fathers try to live vicariously through their sons, and when sons must live with their father's failures. Everything Viktor does, for example, is an attempt to earn Ivan's approval, whilst Ivan sees Viktor as the only way to atone for what happened to him after losing to Rocky.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the depiction of the Dragos in general is especially interesting, and is both one of the best aspects of the film, and simultaneously one of the most problematic. In _Rocky IV_, Ivan was a cartoon villain, a badly written, pseudo-xenophobic hyperbole of what some Americans seemed to think Soviets were like. He was barely one-dimensional. In _Creed II_, he's still relatively thin as a character, but Lundgren is given enough room to portray him as essentially broken, living on nothing but bitterness, resentment, and shame. When he meets up with Rocky in the latter's restaurant, promising, \"_my son will break your boy_\", he comes across as more pathetic than anything else, a million miles from the almost automaton-like warrior of three decades prior. When Ivan mentions their fight, Rocky tries to dismiss it, \"_that's like a million years ago_.\" Ivan, however, replies, \"_but just yesterday to me_.\" One gets the impression that from the moment of his loss he's been waiting for this, seeing his son as nothing more than the delivery method of his vengeance. Ivan has raised Viktor in pure hate, teaching him that the only thing that matters is winning, but you can see in every move that Viktor is far more concerned with earning his father's respect \u2013 winning as an end unto itself means relatively little to him. There's a lot of pathos in that, and both Lundgren and Munteanu act the hell out of the complex dynamic. Working with Stallone for the fifth time, Lundgren's understated and subtle performance is easily the best of his career, and the best in the film, with the quietness that spoke to lack of interiority in the previous film, here suggesting a deeply felt pain.\r\n\r\nThe training montages also do something very interesting in respect to Viktor. Showing him jogging through economically impoverished communities, stacking crates, lugging around bags of cement, and working with less than state-of-the-art equipment, the parallel is not to Ivan, who trained with hi-tech gizmos and gadgets in _Rocky IV_, but to Rocky's training in the original film. Indeed, whilst Adonis lives in a luxury apartment, Viktor and Ivan live in a dingy bedsit in Ukraine that recalls Rocky's original digs in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe problem with all of this is that the Dragos' story is by far the most compelling one in the film. One should not come away from a film named _Creed II_ wishing there had been less Creed and more of the antagonists. Although Creed, Bianca, and Rocky all get a little character development, the most interesting story arc is that of Ivan. Set against the complex and fascinating Drago family drama, Creed and Bianca's story is pretty insipid, and is essentially a rehash of Rocky's relationship with Adrian (Talia Shire) in _Rocky II_. The most dramatic and heartfelt moments of the film involve Ivan and Viktor, and the long middle section where Creed falls into a depression seems to go on forever; the whole time we were watching him fall apart, I was yearning to get back to the Dragos.\r\n\r\nAnd this feeds into the film's most egregious problems \u2013 its rigid adhesion to the _Rocky_ template, and the concomitant predictability. Chances are that everything you think might happen in _Creed II_ does, as the film makes no attempt whatsoever to be original. Aside from the Drago subplot, there is nothing here that we haven't seen before. Granted, the _Rocky_ franchise has always tended to wear its predictability like a badge of honour, and the core template does undoubtedly work. But even when a film adheres to that template, one shouldn't be able to predict each narrative beat with near perfect accuracy. Even _Rocky V_, as awful as it was, tried something new, culminating with a street fight rather than an in-ring bout. It didn't even remotely work, but the thinking behind it was admirable. Aside from two unexpected cameos, _Creed II_ never once caught me off-guard, doing nothing original, unexpected, or in any way daring. And because of that, for large portions of the runtime, particularly the middle section, the film is interminably boring.\r\n\r\nEven the boxing itself is not especially well-done. The cinematography by Kramer Morgenthau (_Thor: The Dark World_; _Chef_; _Terminator Genisys_) is fine, but nothing special, and pales in comparison to Maryse Alberti's work in the first film. Similarly, Caple Jr.'s direction is efficient, but not in the same ballpark as Coogler's. Aside from Martin Scorsese's _Raging Bull_ (1980) and Michael Mann's _Ali_ (2001), both visually unique in their own ways, _Creed_ is arguably the most technically proficient boxing movie in terms of in-ring competition. _Creed II_, however, shoots all the fights very conventionally, holding a fairly uniform three-quarters distance from the actors, with Caple Jr.'s only trick seeming to be slow-motion, which he grossly over-uses. This has the effect of making the fights seem repetitive, even when the story being told by the fighting action is different (which isn't helped by the fact that Ivan tells Viktor to \"break him\" about 150 times).\r\n\r\nWhile we're on the subject of the boxing itself, the culminating fight between Adonis and Viktor is beyond ridiculous, even for this franchise. The boxing in _Rocky_ films has never been even remotely realistic, with a laughable number of haymakers landing cleanly in every round of every fight, but _Creed II_ takes this almost to the point of parody. In the recent Deontay Wilder vs. Tyson Fury fight, the total power punches landed was 31-38 from 182-104 thrown (17%-36.5%), whilst overall punches was 71-84 from 430-327 (16.5%-25.7%). These numbers are a little below the heavyweight average (which is 15 punches per round), but they're not especially unusual. In one round towards the end of _Creed II_, I counted Creed landing 19 power punches to Drago's 12. That's just ridiculous, to the point where it completely takes you out of the film. There's also an unintentionally hilarious moment when Adonis is knocked down, and Little Duke, apparently auditioning as the worst corner man in boxing history, looks out to Bianca in the crowd and shrugs!\r\n\r\nInsanely, even \"Gonna Fly Now\", that most fundamental aspect of all _Rocky_ movies (except the one it wasn't used in) is underwhelming; whereas the first film used it to carry the audience to the emotional highpoint, combining Ludwig G\u00f6ransson's interpolation of Bill Conti's legendary score with the on-screen action and Rocky screaming, \"_You're a Creed_\" as a way to inspire Adonis off the canvas, _Creed II_ just kind of randomly drops it into the mix without a whole lot of justification or thematic relevance.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are some laudable elements here, _Creed II_ is a disappointment in almost every way, from the dull and soulless domestic scenes to a _d\u00e9nouement_ that goes beyond suspension-of-disbelief, with not a hint of unpredictability. By essentially deconstructing the _Rocky_ template, _Creed_ found its way to unexpected thematic depths, recasting the great-white-hope subtext into a narrative about a struggling black man, whilst also examining notions of masculinity in the 21st century, and having Rocky himself face his own mortality. _Creed II_ exists entirely on the surface. Sure, the _Rocky_ melodrama is there, the _Rocky_ fights are there, the Stallone one-liners are there, but with a narrative focused almost entirely on the less interesting characters, this has to go down as a missed opportunity. Apart from the Drago subplot, everything is by-the-numbers. Yes, we care about these characters, but that's primarily because of the previous films, and whereas _Creed_ forged a path very much its own, _Creed II_ returns us to the safety of the overly familiar.","id":"5d17a9c590fca30022aafb30","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d17a9c590fca30022aafb30","movie_id":480530}

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"Crazy Rich Asians expends its expensive mahjong skills to produce a hilarious heartfelt insight into a familial cultural clash. Romantic comedies. The amalgamation of two genres that exercise the very worst tendencies of Hollywood\u2019s mechanical repetitions. Modern romcoms follow the same formulaic narrative structure and embed the same interpretive clich\u00e9s. Y\u2019know what I\u2019m talking about. Boy and girl fall desperately in love, something\/someone comes between them, they fight, break-up and embrace each other again, to the accompaniment of Coldplay or Ed Sheeran, when they realise that \u201cthey are the one\u201d. All the same mundane clich\u00e9s that fail to exert the writing capacity to take those mechanisms and overload them with ferocious energy.\r\n\r\nWell, Chu\u2019s adaptation of the eponymous best-selling novel battles that. He consumes the clich\u00e9-ridden narrative structure of a romcom and transforms it into a cultural depiction of Asian traditions, juxtaposing the values of American immigrants, whilst still bashing the familiar beats of \u201cboy meets girl\u201d. And let me tell you now, this is without a doubt, the best romcom since \u2018Bridesmaids\u2019. I loved it! Rachel is invited by her new boyfriend Nick to Singapore to meet his family who are attending a wedding, but without realising Nick\u2019s family is one of the wealthiest, infamous and superficial in the country.\r\n\r\nChu tackles several poignant themes and morals within this two hour romantic comedy, whilst retaining a sufficient amount of investable character development and hilarity. Yes, the underlying story between Rachel and Nick is a predictable ordeal, but much like any film within the genre, acts as the backbone for the additional qualities. One of them being the exploration into Asian culture, particularly the continent\u2019s cuisine, highlighting the traditions that contrast with the typical audience member. I cautiously read somewhere, that Crazy Rich Asians was the \u201cwhitest romcom featuring a non-white cast\u201d, which is an absolute barbaric statement to form. The predominant cast and crew were all of Asian descent. Just because the film was confounded within the Hollywood system, does not discredit the contents of its insight. Overtly politically correct viewers bumbling about a non-issue. I\u2019m sure \u2018Black Panther\u2019 didn\u2019t receive the same criticism from them. Anyway! I digress.\r\n\r\nThe point is, Chu allows the illustration of traditions and values to be accessible for everyone. However it\u2019s not just a cultural clash. Wealth and public image are two contributing factors to the spiky relationship between Rachel and and Nick\u2019s family. Yet neither one of them are viewed as the antagonistic force of the plot. Every character is treated as a delicate human, with sufficient back story and development, to warrant their choices and actions. A sub-plot involving an affair could\u2019ve been a \u201chow dare you!? We\u2019re over!\u201d situation, but Chu manages to present the reasoning of the immoral act and add that subtle layer of empathy. You understand. You feel. You reflect. And there are several poignant moments throughout, like this, that elevate the contextual values that are insightfully divulged.\r\n\r\nOf course though, Awkwafina provides the majority of laughs, demonstrating the creative humour of writers Chiarelli and Lim whilst showcasing her own excellent comedic timing. Conversely, Wu and Yeoh focus on levelling the comedy with romance and drama respectively. They do so with blinding results. Expressing a variety of emotions, participating in tantalising chemistry and bringing their A-game (their...acting game...).\r\n\r\nThe lavish \u2018Great Gatsby\u2019 parties and genuinely beautiful weddings, that performed a rendition of my all-time favourite romantic song \u201cCan\u2019t Help Falling In Love With You\u201d by Elvis \u201cHound Dog\u201d Presley, nearly brought a tear to my eye with the astounding production design. Minor nuances such as the pop soundtrack, including Coldplay, sung in Mandarin, dumplings being everything and my eternal yearning for marriage, rounded off the rough edges of Crazy Rich Asians smoothly.\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely refreshing to see a high-ticketed American produced romcom have an entirely Asian cast and crew, granting several new opportunities for those involved. It is absurdly reassuring to witness a clich\u00e9-ridden and formulaic narrative of the genre be fully exploited in a wonderfully entertaining story that harnesses every angle available. Yet most importantly, it\u2019s a colossal piece of entertainment that can legitimately be enjoyed by everyone. Crazy fun, rich in characters and quintessentially Asian.

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_A film every Irish person should watch_**\r\n\r\n>_There were 9,987 people homeless in the week of January 21st-27th 2019 across Ireland. This figure includes adults and children. The number of homeless families has increased by 83% since January 2016. More than one in three people in emergency accommodation is a child. However, this number does not include 'hidden homelessness' which refers to people who are living in squats or 'sofa surfing' with friends. Furthermore, women and children staying in domestic violence refuges are not included in these homeless emergency accommodation counts. The_ _national figure also does not include people who are sleeping rough._\r\n\r\n> _In November 2018, the official rough sleeping count confirmed 156 people sleeping rough in Dublin, with an additional number in the Night Caf\u00e9, without a place to sleep._\r\n\r\n>[...]\r\n\r\n>_In the past, most people using emergency accommodation were single adults. But in the last three years, there has been a rapid increase in the number of families becoming homeless, and in January 2019, there were 1,614 families accessing emergency accommodation. This includes 3,624 children._\r\n\r\n>[...]\r\n\r\n> _According to Focus Ireland research and analysis, the overwhelming number of families becoming homeless had their last stable home in the private rented sector, and the crisis in this sector is the immediate cause of their homelessness - landlords selling up or being repossessed, shortage of properties to rent, scarcity of properties accepting rent supplement, and high rents._\r\n\r\n> _Most of the families becoming homeless have never experienced homelessness before and never thought this could happen to them. Thousands more families are struggling on very low incomes or social welfare and many are falling into serious housing difficulties as rents continue to rise._\r\n\r\n>[...]\r\n\r\n> _At the end of January 2019, there were over 893 young people (adults aged under 25) living in emergency homeless accommodation. This represents an 84% increase from January 2015. 65% of these young people live in Dublin._\r\n\r\n>[...]\r\n\r\n> _What you see above is the 'official' homeless figures.

These young people survive by sleeping on a friend's sofa, squatting or staying in other insecure or unsafe places._\r\n\r\n> _We know so little about the real numbers of young people facing homelessness in this way and the challenges they face that Focus Ireland has referred to them as 'the forgotten homeless'._\r\n\r\n>[...]\r\n\r\n> _The right to housing is recognised by the United Nations (Article 25 in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights) and the UN has been active in highlighting homelessness as a violation of human rights._\r\n\r\n- \"About Homelessness\"; Focus Ireland\r\n\r\nTackling the current homeless crisis in Ireland, specifically in the capital city of Dublin, _Rosie_ is as relevant and timely a film as you're ever likely to see. Directed by Paddy Breathnach (_I Went Down_; _Shrooms_; _Viva_), and written by Roddy Doyle (_The Commitments_; _The Snapper_; _Family_) in his first feature since _When Brendan Met Trudy_ (2000), the film is an intimate character drama rather than an angry piece of protest cinema. Not concerned with pointing fingers at who may be responsible for this situation, examining why it is getting worse rather than better, engaging with the economic complexities, or analysing the wider socio-political implications, Doyle is instead more interested in imparting to the audience that homelessness could happen to almost anyone. Rather than evoke ire, he wants to evoke empathy, something that is, sadly, often lacking in our inured social media-obsessed society. One need only look at some of the comments on previews of the film to see what many people really think about the homeless \u2013 in short they're all lazy scumbags looking for a handout; one particular comment was, \"why would I want to see a film about wasters on the dole trying to con themselves into a gaff?\" For whatever reason, Irish society in general, and Dublin in particular, has become one of great bitterness, void of empathy for those struggling on the margins, and this film tries to go some way to addressing that. Unfortunately, the lack of major stars, the almost non-existent advertising campaign, and the grim subject matter will hamper its commercial prospects, and whilst I'd love to say this is going to be the Irish equivalent of Ken Loach's _Cathy Come Home_ (1966), enacting change on a grand scale, the chances are it will pass from cinema screens without much of an impact. Maybe if there was a superhero in it, more people would go to see it. Whatever the case though, irrespective of its commercial achievements, or lack thereof, _Rosie_ is an exceptionally well made film.\r\n\r\nAs with much social realist cinema, _Rosie_'s plot is simplicity itself. Set on Dublin's Northside over the course of roughly 36 hours (from 16.30 on a Wednesday afternoon through to the early hours of Friday morning), the film tells the story of the Davis family; mother Rosie (Sarah Greene), father John Paul (Moe Dunford), and four young children - thirteen-year-old Kayleigh (Ellie O'Halloran), eight-year-old Millie (Ruby Dunne), six-year-old Alfie (Darragh Mackenzie), and four-year-old Madison (Molly McCann). Several days previously, the family were forced to leave their rented private home of seven years when the landlord decided to sell the property, giving them only two weeks' notice. With most of their possessions at John Paul's brother (Lochlann O'Mear\u00e1in) and his wife's (Natalia Kostrzewa), the couple have packed the essentials (spare clothes, toiletries, a toy rabbit named Peachy, who is practically another character, etc.) into their car, out of which they are now effectively living. As John Paul works every hour he can washing dishes in an up-market organic restaurant, Rosie spends the day looking after the kids and trying to arrange temporary alternative accommodation by calling the numbers provided to her by Housing Welfare; hotel rooms where the family can stay, with the bill paid by Dublin Corporation via the oft-mentioned \"_Dublin City Council credit card_.\" However it soon becomes apparent that finding somewhere in the stretched-to-bursting system is not going to be an easy task; she starts the film asking for somewhere for \"_a couple of weeks_\", before dropping to \"_three or four nights_\", and finally pleading for a single night's accommodation. Meanwhile, she has to get the three older children to their various schools, and later pick them up, all the while trying to keep Madison entertained. Attempting to organise such things as washing the clothes, bathroom visits, and the completion of homework all from the confines of the car, Rosie quickly learns that without a roof over your head, even the simplest of tasks becomes a complex logistical nightmare. With all this going on, she has no time to look for a new house, so John Paul attends an open property-viewing on his lunch break, a trip which ends with a foreboding and infuriating realisation. In this situation, the last thing the family needs is more trouble, but when Rosie goes to pick Kayleigh up from school, the sullen teenager is nowhere to be found.\r\n\r\nDoyle began writing _Rosie_ two years ago after listening to an interview with a woman who explained that although her husband worked full-time, the family were living out of their car, finding themselves with literally nowhere to go after being evicted from their rented accommodation. The woman emphasised that she never imagined such a situation for herself or her family, explaining that ordinary people don't realise how easily this can happen to them. And this is precisely the theme Doyle emphasises in the film. The Davis family are a completely normal working-class family, meeting none of the commonly held (mis)conceptions about the homeless, and the film challenges at every turn the stereotypical images we have of such people. As Greene tells RT\u00c9,\r\n\r\n> _audience[s] are often very quick to place judgement on people in these situations \u2013 that they might be cheating the system, or taking benefits, and this is not the case. It's that the system is failing thousands of families._\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Davis family are an \"ordinary family\" enables Doyle to demonstrate that no great economic cataclysm or personal defect is necessary for people to be cast into the void, it's as much to do with bad luck and bad timing, and, in this sense, the film explores the extent to which the housing crisis has begun to cross class borders.\r\n\r\nSince Doyle began writing, the crisis has worsened significantly, making the film even more relevant now than it was two years ago. Indeed, a scene in the film in which the family are told to spend the night in a Garda station is as \"ripped from the headlines\" as is humanly possible. When asked about the film's topicality by RT\u00c9, Greene states,\r\n\r\n> _I think that's why Roddy wrote it, because he was so angry at the situation, and felt ashamed, being a citizen of Ireland, at this happening. We're not a Third World country, we're a very wealthy country, and it is shameful to see so many families in this situation. It's not okay._\r\n\r\nDunford adds,\r\n\r\n> _this story is about normal people who are just in a desperate situation, and it could happen to anybody. It's the last thing that they considered ever happening to them._\r\n\r\nAs this may suggest, Rosie is a piece of social realist drama in the tradition of Ken Loach or Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne. However, it is much less concerned with constructing a left-wing world-view than the French brothers (I'm thinking of something like _L'enfant_ or _Deux jours, une nuit_), and far less melodramatic than recent Loach output (the most obvious point of comparison is the predictable and manipulative _I, Daniel Blake_ (2016), a decidedly inferior film to _Rosie_). As with all social realist cinema, Rosie speaks to the privations of the working class, and voices a critique of prevailing social structures. However, the nature and target of that critique is less conspicuous than we often find in the work of Loach, Mike Leigh, or Antonia Bird, with the film placing more emphasis on private character beats than synecdochical situations or character archetypes.\r\n\r\nOne of the strengths of Doyle's script is that he has been able to transmute emotionless news headlines and dry statistics concerning the rising tide of homelessness into a deeply effective and emotional story which does, by all means, work as a call-to-action, but which is much more forcefully a call-to-care. Doyle is not overly interested in sermonising about the failings of the State, concerning himself much more with what the housing crisis means to real people in practical terms. Avoiding overarching socio-political protest, he focuses on eliciting empathy and compassion for a situation about which the majority of people simply don't care. Sure, when a homeless person dies on our streets, there is much head shaking and \"isn't it terrible\" remarks, a few fingers pointed at our officials, but the majority of people do nothing \u2013 they don't give to charity, they don't volunteer, they don't give people a few euro on the street, or buy them a coffee and a roll, they don't campaign, they don't care. _Rosie_ dares you to care. It demands that you care.\r\n\r\nIn exploring this issue, Doyle's script is remarkable for its sense of restraint, avoiding condescension, clich\u00e9, predictability, and melodrama. Rather than the characters speechifying about their plight and the state of the country, they devote all their energies to simply getting through the day, dealing with each on-the-spot challenge (such as going to the toilet) as it arises. As a result, they never come across as a manipulated political device, existing only at the level of symbolism or allegory, merely a means to allow the screenwriter some socio-economic grandstanding (indeed, the wider-ranging homeless crisis itself is literally never mentioned in the film). However, this is not to say that the film avoids looking at how this kind of situation can exist in a country whose GNP has dropped only twice in the 21st century, and has risen steadily since 2009, and markedly since 2014. The film very much deals with the issues arising from the housing crisis, but in subtle ways.\r\n\r\nFor example, during a small disagreement between Rosie and John Paul, she criticises his job, saying the restaurant where he works make \"_organic lunchboxes_\". Her derision at the incongruity that her family is on the street, whilst others enjoy this kind of luxury is never explicitly stated, but it is there in Greene's performance, which offers a novel take on the old \"_the gap between the haves and the have-nots is widening_\" speech. Another example is found when John Paul attends an open-viewing for a house he and Rosie are thinking of buying in the East Wall area of Dublin. Finding the house crawling with people obviously considerably more wealthy than himself, John Paul asks the real estate agent to put his name down, only to be told the house \"isn't really suitable for a family.\" Again, the real meaning behind this remark is left unsaid, but the critique of gentrification is unmistakable. An extremely important scene in this respect is when Rosie visits her brother-in-law and his wife. When he refers to the family being homeless, she quickly chastises him, telling him \"_don't use that word_\", and denying that the family are, in fact, homeless. This speaks volumes as to cultural stigma and social labelling. The family are very clearly homeless, but Rosie is unwilling to use the word or acknowledge that status, as to do so would place her amongst a social class that has been utterly cast off, and is generally seen as less than dirt by the populace at large.\r\n\r\nAside from the way in which it handles the housing situation as a national crisis, Doyle's script is surprising in other respects. For example, something I didn't see coming is that Rosie's mother (Pom Boyd) has a decent-sized house, and a good relationship with her grandchildren, who she is more than happy to let stay with her. However, she and Rosie have had a falling out recently over something unspoken concerning Rosie's deceased father, and her mother won't let Rosie back into the house until she takes back whatever she said. Rosie, for her part, refuses to apologise, and as she also refuses to split the family up, that means the children can't stay with their grandmother. In this respect, one of the sub-themes of the film becomes one of personal ethics \u2013 will Rosie abandon her principals in order to put a roof over her children's heads? Another nice piece of writing is that Doyle doesn't have Rosie and John Paul at each other's throats the whole film, as we might expect. Instead, they support each other 100%, working together to try to keep the children's spirits up, and only seriously arguing once (which, tellingly, they do away from the kids). One of the film's most salient themes is that theirs is a marriage of genuine love and respect, and that goes double for their family. The film may be asking for empathy from the audience, but it also depicts a great deal of empathy, as Breathnach and Doyle stress that this is a tight-knit family unit filled with love and affection. Their situation may be grim but they are in it together. Doyle has also fashioned an absolutely knockout ending, which somehow manages to be both extremely uplifting, yet utterly soul-shattering.\r\n\r\nFrom an aesthetic point of view, Breathnach's direction is utilitarian, wisely avoiding any kind of directorial gymnastics which would draw attention away from the story. Which is not, however, to say that the film is visually uninteresting. One particularly well-blocked scene sees Rosie talking to a school principal, with the sequence shot in such a way that the two-shot is demarcated by a computer monitor, literally cutting Rosie off from the well-to-do world represented by the principal. The scenes in the family's car (which comprise a sizable portion of the film) are suitably cramped and claustrophobic, with a palpable sense of unrest growing ever more prominent as the film continues. In contrast, however, many of the exterior scenes are shot in such a way as to feel disconcertingly empty, with Rosie and her family often dwarfed within the frame, creating a real sense of hopelessness and swimming-against-the-tide. Additionally, almost the entire film is shot with handheld cameras, with a lot of the exteriors consisting of long single-take Steadicam shots which create a sense of urgency, as well as depriving the characters of any sense of the control with which they could be imbued by editing. Much of this works to enhance the film's prevailing aesthetic style, which is a kind of pseudo-_cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9_ documentarian approach, with the on-screen _milieu_ feeling completely authentic.\r\n\r\nOne especially well managed aspect of the film is how it deals with the task of ringing around the various hotels trying to find a room, going through the exact same conversation over and over and over again. Before we see any images, we hear a radio report talking about the homeless crisis, followed by Rosie ringing the first number on her list. Then the image fades in. This conversation becomes a refrain, and is continued throughout the film, serving almost like a chorus punctuating the rest of the days' activities. It's also worth noting that Rosie's mobile phone is visible in practically every scene.\r\n\r\nI'd be remiss here if I didn't address the performances. Greene is simply outstanding as Rosie, carrying the bulk of the film, and most of the emotional weight (a good 70-80% has her front and centre). Her attempts to remain calm in front of the kids, never losing her temper or chastising them for being frustrated with their situation, and her sorrow and regret on the few occasions when she does, are utterly heart-breaking. Her brave face slips a couple of times, and when it does, there is no sense of catharsis, no feeling of pressure being released. There is just sadness, and acknowledgement of her suffering. Despite her outward optimism, the ominousness of the situation is always there, right beneath the surface. It's an extraordinarily subtle and layered performance of just a few emotional registers, but it's completely effective and rings completely true. The ever-reliable Dunford is also excellent in the slightly under-written role of John Paul, imbuing the character with a warmth and fragility, especially noticeable in a heart-breaking scene in which he reveals to Rosie his shame at not being able to adequately provide for or protect his family.\r\n\r\nAlthough _Rosie_ is about a national crisis, it is also intensely personal. Doyle may not be outwardly concerned with the politics, but his sense of anger is unmistakable as he attempts to show that the ordinary and decent people of this country are being humiliated and degraded on a daily basis. Speaking to RT\u00c9, Dunford states,\r\n\r\n> _this is about our people, this is about Ireland, this is about a bigger picture. It's about our brothers, it's about our sisters, it's about how they're being taken for fools by weasely people in government who are cowards, and something has to be done. That's what it's about._\r\n\r\nIn this sense, Rosie should make audiences angry. And it probably will. The problem is that it will have a very small audience. This is not _Cathy Come Home_ being watched by 12 million people on the BBC. This is a small independent film playing on a few screens across the country, a film of which the vast majority of the cinema-going public have never heard. In the end, despite the fact that it's exceptionally well made, deeply affecting, and flawlessly acted, _Rosie_ won't make much of a difference or have much of an impact. And that's a crying shame.","id":"5cfad673c3a36868871ef770","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cfad673c3a36868871ef770","movie_id":542422}

And for some reason in the beginning, he was introduced as being from Scotland; for some reason they said he was Scot__tish. So now we're stumped. There's a Scottish guy? Really? Coming to the United States? So we're feeling pretty smug about our position right away, because it's going to be haggis and that kind of crap. So we're relaxed. All of a sudden he comes up on stage and you know what it is, it's like nothing we had ever seen before, nothing we had ever imagined before. We go home at night and are writing our little jokes about stuff, and this guy comes in and we're like morning dew, he comes in like a hurricane. And now, the longer he's on stage, the worse we feel about ourselves. Because it's not stopping. And then he finishes, and I thought, \"well that's it, they're going to have to put an end to show business, because what can happen after this?\" We get to see this night after night after night, and we didn't approach him because we were afraid of him. Honest to God, you're thinking, \"Holy crap, there goes my chance at show business because of this guy from Scotland.\"_ [...] _But beyond being a very talented man, and a good friend, and a gentleman, I'm sorry, like everybody else, I had no idea that the man was in pain, that the man was suffering.

It's very hard to talk about him in the past because he was so present in all of our lives. For almost 40 years, he was the brightest star in the comedy galaxy. But while some of the brightest of our celestial bodies are actually extinct now, their energy long since cooled, but miraculously, because they float in the heavens so far away from us now, their beautiful light will continue to shine on us forever. And the glow will be so bright, it'll warm your heart, it'll make your eyes glisten, and you'll think to yourselves, \"Robin Williams, what a concept\"._\r\n\r\n- Billy Crystal; _66th Primetime Emmy Awards_ (August 25, 2014)\r\n\r\nWhen Robin Williams was found dead on August 11, 2014, there was an unprecedented outpouring of grief, not just from those in the industry who knew him, but from fans in general, most of whom had never met him. The shock at his passing, however, was dwarfed by the incomprehensible fact that he had hanged himself. Even taking into consideration his well-documented history of substance abuse and bouts of depression, and even as it emerged that he had been diagnosed with \"diffuse Lewy body dementia\", it just seemed impossible that this man, so full of life, so vibrant, so joyous, could have died at his own hand. His death was personal to so many people, but the manner in which he died, even now, some five years later, is impossible to reconcile. How could it have ended this way?\r\n\r\nDirected by Marina Zenovich (_Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired_; _Richard Pryor: Omit the Logic_; _Fantastic Lies_), _Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind_ is a fairly rudimentary bio-doc that fails to live up to its subtitle; the Robin Williams presented in the film is no more knowable than Robin Williams the stand-up comedian or Robin Williams the Academy Award-winning actor. The film opens with a clip from his 2001 appearance on _Inside the Actors Studio_, with host James Lipton asking him about his \"mental reflexes\", wondering if his mind simply works faster than the rest of us. This prompts Williams to leap to his feet and launch into an improvised _tour de force_ of jokes, puns, wordplay, _double entendre_, accents, characters, meta-commentary, and sight gags. Getting a standing ovation, he sits back down, but he never actually answers the original question, and Lipton doesn't press him on it. _Come Inside My Mind_ essentially reproduces this exchange \u2013 it asks questions about Williams, gives him a platform, marvels at his on-stage energy, but never manages to elicit or elucidate much in the way of genuine psychological insight. Perhaps a little too respectful of her subject, although Zenovich avoids, for the most part, hagiography, so too does she tend to gloss over some of the darker aspects, although it's certainly laudable that she refuses to allow the manner of his death become the defining moment of his life. What the film most definitely does have going for it, however, is the superbly chosen archival footage, much of it not seen in years, which shows Williams at the absolute height of his powers, exuding an on-stage mania that makes early Jim Carrey seem sedate. And, ultimately, the quality of much of this footage offsets the film's failure to offer anything resembling a deep dive into his thought-processes or private life.\r\n\r\nThe film covers all the major biographical beats that you'd expect \u2013 Williams's birth in Chicago on July 21, 1951; his father's work as a senior executive for Ford, which kept him away from the family for long periods; his enrolment in Claremont Men's College in California to study political science, although, hoping to meet girls, he subsequently switched to theatre; his appearance as Tranio in James Dunn's Wild West-themed production of _The Taming of the Shrew_ at the College of Marin and subsequently at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1971 (a production that has been revived almost annually ever since); his 1973 scholarship to The Juilliard School, where he and Christopher Reeve were the only students selected by John Houseman to join the Advanced Program; the beginnings of his stand-up comedy career in San Francisco, before he moved to LA and began performing at The Comedy Store and The Roxy Theatre; his cocaine and alcohol addiction; his casting as the alien Mork in a fifth season episode of _Happy Days_, where his largely improvised performance was so well received, it unexpectedly led to a spin-off show, _Mork & Mindy_ (1978-1982); his 1978 marriage to Valerie Velardi; the death of his friend John Belushi in 1982 from a heroin overdose, which led to Williams getting clean; his legendary stand-up performance at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1986; his Oscar-nominated performance in Barry Levinson's _Good Morning, Vietnam_ (1987); his celebrated appearance alongside Steve Martin in Mike Nichols's 1988 production of _Waiting for Godot_ at the Lincoln Centre; his divorce from Velardi in 1988; his Oscar-nominated performance in Peter Weir's _Dead Poets Society_ (1989); his marriage to Marsha Garces in 1989; his appearances in Penny Marshall's _Awakenings_ (1990), Terry Gilliam's _The Fisher King_ (1991), for which he received his third Oscar nomination, Steven Spielberg's _Hook_ (1991), Chris Columbus's _Mrs. Doubtfire_ (1993), Gus van Sant's _Good Will Hunting_ (1997), for which he won Best Supporting Actor, and Mark Romanek's _One Hour Photo_ (2002); his divorce from Garces in 2008; his appearance in Bobcat Goldthwait's _World's Greatest Dad_ (2009); his 2009 open heart surgery; his 2011 marriage to Susan Schneider; his return to television sitcom with _The Crazy Ones_ (2013-2014); checking himself into rehab in 2014 to treat his remerging alcoholism; his diagnosis with early-stage Parkinson's; and ultimately, his suicide.\r\n\r\nInterviewees include Valerie Velardi (first wife), David Letterman (comedian and talk show host), Bennett Tramer (writing partner), McLaurin Smith-Williams and R. Todd Williams (his half-brothers), Elayne Boosler (comedienne), Scott Marshall (actor), Pam Dawber (_Mork & Mindy_ co-star), Eric Idle (actor), Arthur Grace (photographer), David Steinberg (manager), Billy Crystal (actor and Williams's closest friend), Zak Williams (Williams's son), Steve Martin (actor), Whoopi Goldberg (actress), Mark Romanek (director), Cheri Minns (make-up artist), and Lewis Black (comedian). The obvious absentees here are Marsha Garces and Susan Schneider (his second and third wife, respectively), and Zelda Williams and Cody Williams (his second and third child, respectively, both of whom he had with Garces). Their absence is never mentioned and it leaves a significant lacuna in the narrative, especially towards the conclusion, where Schneider's insights would have been invaluable (her article, \"The terrorist inside my husband's brain\", which was published in the September 2016 issue of _Neurology_, is an absolute must-read).\r\n\r\nAs you would expect, and much as the improvised chaos of the opening scene suggests, a major area of interest is Williams's hyperkinetic brand of comedy. Whilst David Letterman recalls how the various young comics at The Comedy Store were both in awe of Williams and envious of his insanity, Lewis Black states, \"_he was like a light that never knew how to turn itself off._\" The film's great strength, however, lies not in the talking head interviews, but in the archival footage, some of which will probably be familiar (such as the outtakes of his improvisations explaining the uses of a stick from his 1991 appearance on _Sesame Street_, where, upon Elmo calling him \"_Mr. Robins_\", an unimpressed Williams improvs, \"_I'm taking the stick back Elmo_\"). The vast majority of footage, however, is not especially well known, certainly not to fans who knew him only as a film actor. In one of the first pieces of footage, we see him on the _Late Show with David Letterman_, as he tells Letterman, \"_we didn't have water when I was growing up. My mother and father would have to take hydrogen and oxygen and shove them together._\" We also see footage of his 1986 performance at the Met Opera House, including one of his most famous bits;\r\n\r\n> _a nuclear bomb - it's basically a man's way of saying, \"I'm gonna fuck up the Earth, yeah.\" A woman would never make a nuclear weapon. They would never make a bomb that kills you. They'd make a bomb that makes you feel bad for a while. It'd be a whole other thing. That's why there should be a woman president. Don't you see? That'd be a wonderful thing. Be an incredible time for that. There would never be any wars, just, every 28 days, some intense negotiations._\r\n\r\nOther outstanding moments, feature his hilarious improvised \"acceptance speech\" at the 2003 Critics Choice Awards, where he was nominated for Best Actor alongside Jack Nicholson and Daniel Day-Lewis, and the result was declared a draw between Nicholson and Day-Lewis. Invited on stage by Nicholson (who actually takes his sunglasses off after Williams jokes about him wearing them indoors), he launches into an increasingly bitter (and increasingly funny) speech (\"_thanks for nothing. It's a tie with three people! It's so nice to have nothing leaving here, I don't have to thank anybody. You pretty much said, \"Fuck you, Robin!\" Thank you, I hope that's televised!_\"). His speech culminates when Nicholson and Day-Lewis give him the envelope with their names on it, and he says,\r\n\r\n>_I want to thank Jack Nicholson and Daniel Day-Lewis for giving me this piece of paper. It has their names on it, not mine, and I'm glad to be left out of this incredible group. I want to thank Jack, he is to me, the greatest actor, and Daniel Day-Lewis, also the greatest actor. And I'm just a hairy actor. It's been a wonderful evening for me, to walk away with nothing; coming here with no expectations, leaving here with no expectations. It's pretty much been a Buddhist evening for me._\r\n\r\nFunny stuff. Also shown is his bit on the evidence that God gets stoned (\"_look at the platypus_\"), and _Comic Relief VI_ in 1994, where he gives an improvised performance as, first, Billy Crystal's penis, and then Whoopi Goldberg's vagina.\r\n\r\nThe film also tosses out some interesting facts. For example, his father was a very stern man, and it was when a young Williams saw him laugh at Jonathan Winters, that he first began to consider a career in comedy, where he too could make people laugh. The film also features footage of Winters improvising with a stick on a 1964 episode of _Tonight Starring Jack Paar_, a bit not entirely dissimilar from Williams's own aforementioned stick-based improvisations on _Sesame Street_. Also fascinating is that when Williams started filming _Mork & Mindy_ in 1978, all American sitcoms were shot with a basic three-camera set-up. Introduced by cinematographer Karl Freund when he began work on _I Love Lucy_ in 1951, this set-up uses three cameras recording simultaneously at three different angles (one captures the wide shot, and the others capture close-ups). However, due to Williams's unpredictable improvisational style, when shooting _Mork & Mindy_, he would rarely stick to his marks, making it virtually impossible for close-ups, as the camera operators never knew where he was going to end up (he was a pioneer at doing on TV what theatre actors usually refer to as \"_exploring the space_\"). And so, the show's creator and executive producer Garry Marshall introduced a fourth camera, whose sole purview was to follow Williams as he moved about the set, fundamentally changing how sitcoms were shot.\r\n\r\nThe use of audio interviews with Williams, which essentially act as narration, see him more contemplative. In one clip, for example, he explains, \"_a character can be a comic actor more than a comedian. I don't tell jokes, I use characters as a vehicle for me. I seldom just talk as myself._\" Which is, of course, a key admission, and which is one of the main themes of the film \u2013 the public and private were not only differentiated, they were, in many ways, diametrically opposed. However, this brings us to one of the film's main failings - the lack of exploration of the dissonance between these two aspects of his personality (the manic public comedian and the pensive private man); it's touched on a few times, but it's never explored in any detail. Indeed, for a film which literally invites the audience into the subject's mind, there's very little of any psychological worth to be found here, little exploration of the rigid division between the performer and the man.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is Zenovich's (perhaps understandable) unwillingness to depict with any degree of completeness some of the darker aspects of his life. Lip-service is given to much of it, but nothing more. So, for example, Elayne Boosler talks about being his girlfriend whilst giving her blessing for him to be with other women; Billy Crystal explains that Williams was essentially addicted to audience reaction, which gave him a sense of validation, always needing \"_that one extra-special hug you can only get from a stranger_\"; Pam Dawber recalls telling him that John Belushi had died just hours after Williams and he had been doing drugs; Valerie Velardi explains that in order to maintain her privacy, she never corrected news reports that Williams had been having an affair with the maid, Marsha Garces, when in fact, he and Garces had not gotten together until over a year after he split with Velardi, and at a time when Garces was no longer working for him; and Steve Martin discusses how difficult Williams found it to stay sober. However, apart from these brief moments during the talking head interviews, Zenovich never examines any of the issues thrown up.\r\n\r\nAnd there's nothing at all on Dawber's claim that Williams often fondled her and exposed himself to her the set of _Mork & Mindy_. Now, you're probably thinking, that's because she didn't reveal this until March 2018, only a couple of months before the film debuted on HBO. However, she initially made the claim when Dave Itzkoff interviewed her for his biography, _Robin_, an interview which took place prior to her interview for _Come Inside My Mind_. I can certainly understand why it's been left out of the film, especially insofar as Dawber herself has said she was never offended or threatened (\"_there was nothing lascivious about it, in his mind. It was just Robin being Robin, and he thought it would be funny_\"), but it's rather conspicuous by its absence.\r\n\r\nThe film's structure is also a little unusual, focusing on his rise in the 70s and 80s and the last few years of his life, without spending a huge amount of time looking at the intervening years. There's next to nothing, for example, on his film work; there are references to and a few clips from films such as _Good Morning, Vietnam_, _Dead Poets Society_, _The Fisher King_, and _Awakenings_, but little beyond that (Zenovich literally devotes only a few seconds to his Oscar win for _Good Will Hunting_). Because of this, when his 2014 suicide comes, it feels abrupt, with much of the narrative tapestry that brought him to that place skipped (so, for example, there's a reference to him not being himself whilst filming _The Crazy Ones_, but little about the years leading up to 2014).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, although these problems are significant, fans of Williams will enjoy _Come Inside My Mind_, with the archival footage very much the main attraction. Zenovich's refusal to allow his death be the characterising moment of his life is laudable, but the film undeniably lacks any kind of psychological depth, and although the argument could be made that Williams was notoriously difficult to know even in real life, hence we shouldn't expect a documentary to lay him bare, the fact is that Zenovich doesn't really try, relying instead on recalling his popularity and comedy prowess. However, I can't help but think that presenting some of the darker times with a more journalistic sense of objectivity would have been a more truthful approach. It wouldn't have tarnished his legacy, nor would it have led to anyone thinking less of him, but it would have made for a deeper film. In the end, Williams was consumed by his demons, but _Come Inside My Mind_ has sidelined those same demons as much as possible, allowing us to remember the laughter, without dwelling on the sadness.","id":"5d9bccfc6d675a0012f264cd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d9bccfc6d675a0012f264cd","movie_id":493100}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This movie is following the usual recipe for these kind of movies. Big companies are bad, gene science is bad, big monsters are cool. The story is fairly ludicrous, science non-existent and almost everyone except the hero is a dumb-ass.\r\n\r\nRegardless of all that, I quite enjoyed this movie. I watched it with the expectation of seeing The Rock and huge monsters wreck things and that is exactly what I got. The story itself is weak and the science is, well ludicrous. How these monsters grows to immense sizes in almost no time at all defies science of course. But heck, who want\u2019s to spend time in a action movie watching animals grow? Also, what a strange coincidence that the ape, who happens to be on the good side, is the only one of them that doesn\u2019t grow huge fangs, horns or other horrific appendages. As I said, the story is nonsense.\r\n\r\nHowever, once the action starts it is the usual wreck everything overkill kind of action that which is one of the few things that Hollywood is really good at these times. I really enjoyed it even if it was, at times, very very silly. And then we have The Rock. I really like The Rock. Call me old-fashioned but I do like macho type heroes with silly one-liners.\r\n\r\nAs usual the military trying to fight the monsters are depicted, pretty much, as morons. Uberconfident in their capacity to stop the monsters. The monsters of course proves them wrong. So what to do then? Well just nuke them. Okay, they didn\u2019t try to use actual nukes but dropping a MOAB on the downtown of a major city is not that far from using nukes. I mean, come on, they claimed to have evacuated the city in what? A few hours. Not happening. Also in the fighting before this dumb-ass decision they send in a Warthog which was a fairly logical decision at least but they send in a single one! What the f\u2026? And do not get me started about these creatures just shrugging of a Warthog. These planes are tank-killers for Christ sake. Oh well, here I go about science again.\r\n\r\nBad guys. Gotta have bad guys (well apart from the monsters of course) don\u2019t we? Well, Claire Wyden is not too bad. The stereotypical big company asshole not caring about anything than her personal gains. However, Brett Wyden is just annoying. He\u2019s stupid, stupid, stupid and just overly childish. Did I say stupid? From the first scene that he was in I rooted for him to get eaten by his sister\u2019s creations. He wasn\u2019t eaten actually but his demise was fairly satisfactory nonetheless.\r\n\r\nDespite all of this I did, as I wrote earlier, enjoy the movie. It was exactly what I hoped it would be. A roller-coaster ride of action and mayhem. The Rock was great. His \u201cside-kick\u201d Dr. Caldwell was okay but fairly forgettable. Agent Russell however went from annoying government agent to one of my favorite characters in the course of the movie. The scene where he stops that dumb-ass Brett Wayden and then lets him walk away towards his well deserved destiny quite enjoyable.\r\n\r\nI did like the ape as well. I liked how he made jokes on The Rock. An ape giving The Rock the finger may sound silly but it was actually quite funny.\r\n\r\nBottom line, two hours of good entertainment providing that monsters on rampage is your kind of movie.","id":"5bb9c538c3a368241f028e74","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bb9c538c3a368241f028e74","movie_id":427641}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_A World War II political allegory\/fairy tale\/coming of age drama wrapped up in a horror aesthetic that works exceptionally well_**\r\n\r\n>_Everything that was not connected with the immediate task of keeping oneself and one's closest friends alive lost its value. Everything was sacrificed to this end. A man's character became involved to the point that he was caught in a mental turmoil which threatened all the values he held and threw them into doubt. Under the influence of a world which no longer recognised the value of human life and human dignity, which had robbed man of his will and had ma__de him an object to be exterminated (having planned, however, to make full use of him first \u2013 to the last ounce of his physical resources) \u2013 under this influence the personal ego finally suffered a loss of values. If the man in the concentration camp did not struggle against this in a last effort to save his self-respect, he lost the feeling of being an individual, a being with a mind, with inner freedom and personal value. He thought of himself then as only a part of an enormous mass of people; his existence descended to the level of animal life. The men were herded \u2013 sometimes to one place then to another; sometimes driven together, then apart \u2013 like a flock of sheep without a thought or a will of their own. A small but dangerous pack watched them from all sides, well versed in methods of torture and sadism. They drove the herd incessantly, backwards and forwards, with shouts, kicks and blows.

But I don't think many focused on heaven; too much of hell had been lived to allow for God's grace._\r\n\r\n- Janneke Jobsis Brown; _Following Shadows_ (2017)\r\n\r\nI'll never forget something a student of mine once said to me in an English tutorial. Waiting to begin the class, I was chatting with the students when the subject of Paddy Considine's superb directorial debut, _Tyrannosaur_ (2011), came up. I can't remember the context, but I do remember saying how much I'd enjoyed it and recommending it to the group. One said he'd just seen it on DVD the previous weekend and he was a fan too, but his girlfriend not so much, telling me that after 30 minutes or so she turned to him and asked, \"_when do the dinosaurs show up?_\" To this day, I've never worked out if he was joking or not, but either way, it was funny stuff. Fast forward nine years, and I'd just emerged from a screening of writer\/director Adrian Panek's extraordinary genre-bender _Wilko\u0142ak_ [_Werewolf_], thinking to myself, \"_I wonder how many people will get to around the 30 minute mark and start wondering when the werewolf is going to show u_p\". Spoiler: there is no werewolf. At least, not literally.\r\n\r\nPart-World War II\/concentration camp drama, part-fairy tale, part-psychological study of how even children can descend into barbarism given the right circumstances, part-allegory for what happened to the Polish people after German occupancy was replaced with Soviet occupancy, all wrapped up in the aesthetic and tonal qualities of a horror movie, _Wilko\u0142ak_ is a parable of violence and lost innocence. The title is a rather clever play on the figure of the lycanthrope as found in literature dating back to at least the Middle Ages \u2013 the film depicts children who are ravenous and uncontrollable and dogs who are ravenous and uncontrollable, but there's no werewolf unless one combines the two groups on an abstract thematic level. Which, of course, is exactly what the title is inviting us to do. Looking at the psychological impact the Holocaust had on those who survived it and the ramifications of the cruelty they suffered, especially when they attempt to reintegrate into society, _Wilko\u0142ak_ is kind of like John Carpenter's _Assault on Precinct 13_ (1976) set in the immediate aftermath of the War, with elements of Charles Perrault's 1697 version of _Le Petit Chaperon Rouge_ and William Golding's _Lord of the Flies_ (1954), as well as films such as Jan N\u011bmec's _D\u00e9manty noci_ (1964), Samuel Fuller's _White Dog_ (1982), and Korn\u00e9l Mundrucz\u00f3's mesmerising _Feh\u00e9r isten_ (2014). Understated, subtle, and thematically layered, it was the deserved winner of both the Audience Award and the Ecumenical Jury Prize for Best Film at the 2018 Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival and Best Director at the 2018 Polish Film Festival (where it was also nominated for the Golden Lion).\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1945; _Konzentrationslager Gro\u00df-Rosen_ [Gross-Rosen concentration camp] in modern-day Rogo\u017anica, Poland. Germany have all but lost the War, and the _Schutzstaffel_ (SS) are in the process of abandoning the camp. Before they go, however, they force the inmates to do pointless exercises in the freezing night-time temperatures, with anyone resisting or attempting to flee set upon by the camp's vicious German Shepherd guard dogs, who are trained to recognise the inmates' striped uniforms. When the SS depart, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army liberate the camp, and a group of eight children are transported to a temporary orphanage housed in a dilapidated mansion in the forest near the G\u00f3ry Sowie [Owl Mountains]. The group includes the de facto leader, Hanka (an excellent Sonia Mietielica), who, at 20, is the eldest by several years; Hanys (Nicolas Przygoda) a late addition to the group from another camp, who is not made especially welcome (because he was born near the Polish-German border, the others cruelly call him \"Kraut\"); the quiet and possibly irreparably disturbed Wladek (a very creepy Kamil Polnisiak), who deeply resents Hanys's presence, especially his friendship with Hanka, and from whose perspective much of the film is told; and Mala (Matylda Ignasiak) a mute six-year-old girl. The only adult at the mansion is the bitter and disillusioned Jadwiga (the always excellent Danuta Stenka), who, despite herself, soon bonds with Hanka and Mala. The orphanage itself is in a bad state of disrepair, with no electricity or running water, very little food, and no means of transport, which renders more complicated Hanka's attempts to re-civilise the children (by having them use a knife and fork instead of their hands, for example). To make matters worse, there are marauding Soviet soldiers with rape on their mind and a nearby bunker in which someone unidentified appears to be living. The greatest threat, however, is that the now feral camp dogs, driven mad with hunger, have made their way through the forest to the mansion, leaving several bodies in their wake. At first, they linger in the trees, but soon enough, they surround the house, trapping the group inside, as provisions rapidly run out. And so, the children must fight to stay alive, with the barbarism instilled in them at _Gro\u00df-Rosen_ proving as much of a foe as the ferocious dogs.\r\n\r\nThat plot summary should give you a good sense of the film's debt to narratives such as _Lord of the Flies_ and _Assault on Precinct 13_. It really is a strange beast \u2013 a World War II pseudo-horror story about traumatised concentration camp children trapped in a house by vicious dogs. It sounds like it absolutely should not work. But it absolutely does work, with all manner of subtle thematic layering (without mentioning anything of the extraordinary, unpredictable, and fascinating closing moments). Of course, the main theme is barbarism; the idea that the children have been dehumanised by their time in the camp. One of the first scenes upon arriving at the mansion sees several of the children cruelly chasing a rat, which they then stamp to death. It's a moment that recalls how the SS were treating the prisoners just minutes earlier, and it's telling that the first instance of violence after we leave _Gro\u00df-Rosen_ is perpetrated not by a German or a Soviet, not even by the dogs, but by the children themselves.\r\n\r\nOf course, this highlights the question of who exactly is the eponymous _Wilko\u0142ak_ - the voracious dogs, the brutalised and pseudo-bestialised children, or both. Panek approaches this question by drawing a lot of parallels between the children and the dogs; for example, both are hungry, both have been taught barbarism, both are aggressive and feral, both move in packs, both need significant reconditioning if ever they are to be reintegrated into society. Indeed, just as is the case with the dogs, Hanka says of the children, \"_they can't go hungry or they'll kill each other_\", to which Jadwiga says, \"_then let them kill each other_\". This draws yet another parallel \u2013 neither group are seen as worth saving, neither is considered human; to quote William Shakespeare's _King Lear_, \"_Man's life's as cheap as beast's_\" (4.ii.270).\r\n\r\nWorking in tandem with such parallels, the title is metaphorical \u2013 neither the children nor the dogs are the _Wilko\u0142ak_, yet both are, with the title essentially referring to a thematic combination of each. That this is so is indicated only moments after the scene with the rat, as we see the children happily playing tag in the mansion's grounds. It's an extraordinary contrast, which suggests for every moment where their traumatised dysfunction rises to the surface, so too are there moments where their childish innocence shines through (i.e. they are half-human, half-beast), a contrast which recurs in various guises throughout \u2013 for example, for all of Wladek's psychological trauma, there's always Mala's gentle innocence; and although Hanka makes the children sit at the table and use cutlery, another scene sees them fighting over a tin of dog food, which they spill on the floor, before devouring with their hands. Indeed, according to Panek, \"_this is a story about being infected with evil. About people who were brought to the level of animals and are trying to return to human form_\".\r\n\r\nThe most obvious aesthetic element of the film is that it employs classic horror tropes throughout - POV shots of the dogs in the forest, watching the house; after the initial scene, we don't see the dogs for some time; the grisly discovery of a mutilated corpse; the mysterious person in the bunker; a slow-motion shot as one of the children is being chased by a dog; the dilapidated and isolated house, which is both sanctuary and prison, with Anna Wunderlich's production design and Marcin Aziukiewicz's art direction really helping to establish the film's tone; Antoni \u0141azarkiewicz's ominous but understated score; Dominik Danilczy's subtle photography which often shoots from around corners and within shadows. Additionally, much of the film is focalised by Wladek, which gives the story an element of intimacy and emotional stoicism (insofar as Wladek is emotionally shut down). Grafting the story of concentration camp survivors onto a horror template may seem crass and disrespectful, but Panek pulls it off magnificently. Just like his thematic subtlety, there's a great deal of nuance to the film's aesthetic design; it's never quite a horror movie, never quite a war movie, never quite a concentration camp movie, never quite a coming-of-age movie. Yet it's all of these things, with Panek moulding this hodgepodge into a believable and thematically focused narrative.\r\n\r\nThere are a few problems here and there, but none are especially serious. For example, the film lags a little in the long middle act, which sees the dogs surround the house, and which becomes a little repetitious, with the tension slackening somewhat. This act could have done with having maybe ten minutes or so shaved off. Another small issue is that apart from Hanka, Hanys, and Wladek, none of the other children receives much characterisation. Mala gets a little backstory, but that's about it, with the rest of the group essentially functioning as background extras, to the point where they tend to blur into one another. Jaroslaw Kaminski's editing is also a little choppy on occasion, not really giving shots enough time to register before quickly shifting to something else.\r\n\r\nThese small issues notwithstanding, however, _Wilko\u0142ak_ is an exceptional film. What really struck me about it was that despite its use of horror tropes, despite the gore and the fairy tale aesthetic, there's hardly anything here that one could say with confidence could not have happened in historical reality. This is part of the reason that the film never comes across as exploitative or distasteful; because it maintains a realist stance throughout. All things considered, then, this is a thematically fascinating, brilliantly made film. Highly recommended.","id":"5da7d2bde6d3cc0018aec2b5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5da7d2bde6d3cc0018aec2b5","movie_id":500915}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_A poignant and poetic evocation of childhood_**\r\n\r\n> _We were allowed to be what we were, frightened and vengeful - little animals, clawing at what we needed._\r\n\r\n- Justin Torres; _We the Animals_ (2011)\r\n\r\nA remarkably contained and intimate story featuring only five main cast members and around ten locations, _We the Animals_ is about a young boy awakening to the fact that he's homosexual. Equal parts disassociated lyricism and warts-and-all grittiness, in attempting to untangle the struggles concomitant with his burgeoning queerness, the film looks at issues such as the ever-increasing distance between himself and two brothers with whom he was once so close, the dawning realisation that although his parents love each other, so too are they destroying one another, and the fact that the crystallising of one's perception of the world goes hand-in-hand with a loss of innocence. Despite the themes with which it engages, however, _We the Animals_ is relatively apolitical (never once, for example, does it feel like a principled ideological stand against notions of heteronormativity, whilst the domestic violence in the family is shown as coming from both parents, not just the father). Less concerned with narrative beats and character arcs than with tone and impressionistic visual poetry, the film operates in a similar magical realist key as Benh Zeitlin's masterful _Beasts of the Southern Wild_ (2012), whilst also calling to mind the Texas scenes of Terrence Malick's opus _The Tree of Life_ (2011), especially in the whispery pronouncements of the voiceover narration. Mixing nostalgia, idealism, recrimination, anger, personal freedom, and the constant conflict between optimism and experience into a potent whole, whilst the narrative could be accused of being a little insubstantial, _We the Animals_ is an effective and poignant evocation of the modulations of childhood.\r\n\r\nSet in upstate New York in the 1990s, the film tells the story of nine-year-old Jonah (Evan Rosado), who lives with his Ma (Sheila Vand) and Paps (Ra\u00fal Castillo), and two slightly older brothers, Manny (Isaiah Kristian) and Joel (Josiah Gabriel). Existing just above the poverty line in an isolated and dilapidated house, the family is tightly-knit but dysfunctional, although Ma and Jonah are especially close. Married when they were still teenagers, both Ma and Paps possess violent tempers, which often leads to arguments that become physical. Although they seem to still love one another, and although the passion they once felt for one another is still there, both are deeply unhappy and want nothing more than to escape the poverty that pervades every aspect of their lives. However, they are both realistic enough to know that the chances of that happening are slim - she works a thankless job on an assembly line, he works as a part-time security guard at a factory. As time passes, Jonah begins to notice how different he is from his siblings; more contemplative and wistful, he is as happy reading or drawing and writing in a scrapbook as he is joining Manny and Joel in their boisterous adventures. However, when Paps leaves after a violent argument with Ma, she takes to bed, refusing to get up, forcing the unsupervised trio to fend for themselves. When they are caught stealing vegetables from a neighbour's garden, the man takes pity on them and makes them a meal, introducing them to his teenage grandson, with whom they become friends. When the boy later shows them a porn movie, Jonah is taken aback when he reacts more strongly to the brief clip of two men having sex than anything else in the video. And so he must attempt to navigate something he doesn't understand and can't articulate, in a _milieu_ built on rugged heterosexual masculinity.\r\n\r\n_We the Animals_ is the fiction film debut of documentarian Jeremiah Zagar (_In a Dream_; _Captivated: The Trials of Pamela Smart_), and was written for the screen by Zagar and Daniel Kitrosser, from Justin Torres's semi-autobiographical 2011 novel of the same name. Considered to be unfilmable at the time of its publication, the novel features relatively little dialogue, is written entirely in the first-person plural, and foregrounds the unreliability of memory. However, Zagar involved Torres in every part of the adaptation process, sending him the various iterations of the screenplay, having him on set during filming, and even inviting him into the editing room.\r\n\r\nPerhaps because of this, although the film changes some aspects (the three brothers are unnamed in the novel, for example, whilst the protagonist's first homosexual experienced is far more graphic than in the film), it remains a remarkably authentic adaptation, capturing both the tone and texture of Torres's prose. And much like the novel, rather than presenting a classically structured plot with forward momentum, the film is instead composed of vignettes presented in a broadly, but not exclusively, chronological manner. Within this scheme, _We the Animals_ is essentially a _bildungsroman_, and in its depiction of a young boy struggling to understand why he feels so different to those around him, it covers some of the same thematic ground as Barry Jenkins's _Moonlight_ (2016). However, as mentioned, it has more in common with the esotericism and ethereal magical realism of films like _The Tree of Life_ and _Beasts of the Southern Wild_ than with Jenkins's more grounded film. In a similar manner, although its depiction of the three brothers' unsupervised mischief recalls Sean Baker's _The Florida Project_ (2017), _We the Animals_ is far more lyrical and existentialist.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, there's a lot to admire here. Zagar's documentarian background is especially noticeable in his use of the techniques of _cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9_; scenes of the brothers chasing one another through long grass, for example, weren't blocked by Zagar, but were improvised on location by the performers, with cinematographer Zak Mulligan simply following along behind them with a Steadicam, reacting to their spontaneous movement, giving the film a sense of being unmediated. In another stylistic choice, the film initially presents the boys as relatively indistinguishable from one another (the \"we\" of the novel is manifested in voiceover lines such as, \"_when we were brothers, we wanted more_\"). However, at about the half-way point, this begins to change, as Jonah starts to become aware that he isn't like his brothers, and so begins to withdraw from them, first ideologically, then physically. In tandem with this, the voiceover narration becomes less and less frequent, and hence so too does the use of the plural pronoun. \r\n\r\nTied into this are the crayon pictures which Jonah draws in his scrapbook, and which are presenting in crudely animated form (designed by Mark Samsonovich) throughout the film. As Jonah struggles to process the realities of sex, violence, and his increasingly fraught family life, the nature of the images begins to change; from relatively innocent doodling to images that are far more sexualised and violent. Also important here is how well Zagar uses the _mise en sc\u00e8ne_ to suggest psychology. In the early parts of the film, equal screentime is given to shots of Jonah under his bed drawing and shots of him huddled with his brothers in a blanket fashioned like a tent. However, as the film progresses, we see less and less of him in the tent, and more under the bed, something which carries huge thematic importance for the penultimate scene.\r\n\r\nIn terms of focalisation, the film is tied rigidly to Jonah's perspective throughout, never allowing the audience access to anything that he himself doesn't explicitly see or hear. In a general sense, this can be seen in the frequency with which Mulligan places his camera at Jonah's eye level. A more specific example involves a scene when Paps is arguing with another man off-camera. We can hear the voices and make out the odd word, but we can't clearly hear all that is said, because neither can Jonah. It's an extremely effective use of off-screen space, and recalls a similar scene in Paul Dano's _Wildlife_ (2018). Also important in this sense is that the film is shot on very grainy Super 16, predominately with wide lenses and a shallow depth of field that flattens the backgrounds. This means that the images don't possess the normal sheen or depth, thus foregrounding the impreciseness of memory; it is as if we are looking at events through gauze, half-remembered and half-embellished, a formalism that doesn't distinguish between past and present, which reminded me a little of Andrei Tarkovsky's _Zerkalo_ and Terence Davies's _Distant Voices, Still Lives_ (for my money, the best representations of memory ever put on film).\r\n\r\nThematically, although the story would seem to lend itself to socio-political commentary, Zagar is relatively uninterested in anything beyond Jonah's immediate experience; so if Jonah is unaware of how homosexuals are perceived in the country at large, then such information cannot be presented in the film. However, there are some undeniable thematic undercurrents. For example, when we are first introduced to Ma and Paps, they seem blissfully in love, but this image is shattered shortly afterwards when we see Paps's temper. However, it soon becomes apparent that he isn't the sole purveyor of violence - when he arrives home with a truck of which Ma disapproves, she slaps him several times and verbally berates him. We also see her snap at the children on several occasions, something we never see Paps doing. However, none of this is to excuse his violence or his attempts to downplay it; after splitting her lip during one argument, he tells the boys that he'd been \"_punching on her a little_\".\r\n\r\nSome of the dialogue is also achingly beautiful, but underneath the poetry, there are darker implications. When Jonah sees a light bulb in a metal cage, he asks Pa \"_why is that light in a cage?_\", to which Pa answers, \"_so it doesn't fly away._\" Another example sees Ma tell Jonah that when children are 10, they leave their parents, asking him, \"_promise me you'll stay mine forever._\" When he asks \"_how_,\" she states, \"_simple; you're not 10, you're 9+1_\". There's a beauty to this sentiment, but so too is there something unhealthy about it; in one sense she's denying him agency, and in another, she's making him feel guilt for something in his future. Either way, it's not great parenting.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, a few problems. For one thing, we've seen most of the issues with which the film deals in _Beasts_ and _Tree of Life_, and it's nowhere near as accomplished as either of them. Another issue is that whilst the sense of place is magnificently handled, there is a sense that we are never really allowed into the characters' cores, even Jonah, with Zagar more interested in lyricism that emotion; in trying to convey Jonah's interiority through abstract visual poetry, Zagar neglects the issue of emotional realism. This should be a heartbreaking film, but it isn't, mainly because the characters exist primarily to facilitate philosophical musing, rather than as unique entities in themselves.\r\n\r\nThat aside, however, _We the Animals_ is a superbly realised film and an impressive debut. Dealing with issues of masculinity, domestic violence, homosexuality, and the discovery of self in a _milieu_ not predisposed to accepting a self which deviates from normative societal doctrine, it's very much focused on the impressionistic and chaotic nature of memory. Depicting a young life yet to be fully formed, the film's inconclusive ending is vital - life doesn't have a three-act structure that simply ends with the closing credits. Things are far more complicated than that. And this might be the film's crowning achievement; in a story ostensibly about the past and how we access it, the final impression with which it leaves us is that we can never know what lies in our future.","id":"5d800a9c389da10030957dd9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d800a9c389da10030957dd9","movie_id":490000}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Pretty enjoyable, very funny, but doesn't tell us anything we didn't already know_**\r\n\r\n> _We have guaranteed freedom, security, and peace for a larger share of humanity than has any other nation in all of history. There is no other like us. There never has been. We are, as a matter of empirical fact and undeniable history, the greatest force for good the world has ever known._\r\n\r\n- Dick Cheney; _Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America_ (2015)\r\n\r\nAs a non-American, I've always been fascinated by the concept of a two party system. Breeding rancour and division by its very nature, with only two sides from which to choose on any issue, the more controversial a subject is, the wider the ideological gap becomes. I'm not sure if it's a cause or a symptom, but intricately intertwined with such deep-rooted partisanship is the fact that everyone seems to be preaching to their own choir; Republicans have Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, and Ben Shapiro (and Alex Jones), whilst Democrats have Bill Maher, Anderson Cooper, and Chris Cuomo (and Cenk Uygar). The problem is that the people watching _Fox and Friends_ and reading _Breitbart_ are already staunchly on the right, whilst those watching CNN and reading _The New York Times_ are already firmly on the left; everyone is sermonising to the already converted, and no one is listening to what the other camp is saying. Written and directed by Adam McKay, _Vice_ is a good example of this; it's a left-leaning film made by left-leaning people for a left-leaning audience. When McKay was asked by the _ACLU_ if he had any theories as to why Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump allegedly walked out of a screening, his response was telling; \"_I think the bigger question is: Why did they buy two tickets and walk in?_\"\r\n\r\nOstensibly a biopic of former Vice President Dick Cheney, _Vice_ argues that he was actually the _de facto_ President, with George W. Bush taking a back seat, particularly in the globally crucial years from 2001-2003. Very much a political satire in the vein of Decimus Iunius Iuvenalis and Jonathan Swift, or films such as Barry Levinson's _Wag the Dog_ and Joe Dante's _The Second Civil War_ (both 1997), _Vice_ eschews conventional narrative structure, breaks the fourth wall regularly, intercuts shots of fly-fishing and animals hunting into the middle of tense plot-heavy dialogue scenes, features several self-reflexive references to itself, has a false ending, has a scene in which characters speak in iambic pentameter, and in a deleted scene, the entire cast breaks into song. Much as was the case with recent \"based on a true story\" films such as Spike Lee's _BlacKkKlansman_ and Jason Reitman's _The Front Runner_ (both 2018), _Vice_ has one eye on the here and now, using Cheney's story as a vehicle to examine the current political situation in the US, positing that without the power-mad Dick Cheney and the Unitary Executive Theory, there would never have been a Donald Trump. However, although there are many individual moments of brilliance, the film is unsure if it's a straightforward biopic or an excoriating satire, ultimately finding a kind of ideological middle ground that mixes comedy with pathos, not always successfully.\r\n\r\nNarrated by Kurt (Jesse Plemons), a fictitious veteran of the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars, who claims to have a unique connection to Cheney, the film begins in Wyoming in 1963 as a young Dick Cheney (Christian Bale) is arrested for drunk driving for the second time. It then cuts to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center in the immediate aftermath of 9\/11, as Cheney orders the shooting down of any suspicious commercial airliners, despite President Bush (who was en route to Washington from Florida) not signing off on such an order. How Cheney got from being a drunk in 1963 to taking control of the government in 2001 is the film's primary focus, introducing us to a huge cast of characters (played by an extraordinary ensemble), all of whom feature in Cheney's rise to power in some manner \u2013 Lynne Vincent (Amy Adams), Cheney's fianc\u00e9e and later wife; Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell), under whom Cheney worked from 1969, later White House Chief of Staff (1970-1971) and Secretary of Defense (1975-1977 and 2001-2006); Gerald Ford (Bill Camp), President (1974-1977), for whom Cheney was White House Chief of Staff; George H.W. Bush (John Hillner), President (1989-1993), for whom Cheney was Secretary for Defense; Liz (Lily Rabe) and Mary (Allison Pill), Cheney's two daughters; Roger Ailes (Kyle S. More), founder of Fox News; George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell), President (2001-2009), for whom Cheney was Vice President; Scooter Libby (Justin Kirk), Chief of Staff to the Vice President (2001-2005); David Addington (Don McManus), Cheney's legal counsel (2001-2005) and Chief of Staff to the Vice President (2005-2009); Colin Powell (Tyler Perry), Secretary of State (2001-2005); Condoleezza Rice (LiaGay Hamilton), National Security Advisor (2001-2005) and Secretary of State (2005-2009); Paul Wolfowitz (Eddie Marsan), Deputy Secretary of Defense (2001-2005); George Tenet (Stephen Adly Guirgis), Director of Central Intelligence (1996-2004); Karl Rove (Joseph Beck), Senior Advisor to the President (2001-2007); Trent Lott (Paul Perri), Senate Minority Leader (2001-2003); Jay Bybee (Brandon Firla), Assistant Attorney General (2001-2003); and John Yoo (Paul Yoo) Deputy Assistant Attorney General (2001-2003). Within this framework, the film hits all the beats you'd expect \u2013 the bombing of Cambodia (1969-1970); the formation of Al-Qaeda (1988); the outbreak of the Somali Civil War (1988); the invasion of Panama (1989); the Gulf War (1990-1991); Cheney's time as CEO of Halliburton (1995-2000); 9\/11 and the invasion of Afghanistan (2001); the \"Torture Memos\" and \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" (2002); the invasion of Iraq (2003); the Plame affair (2003); the accidental shooting of Harry Whittington (2006); the rise of IS; Cheney's 13% approval rating upon leaving office (2009); his heart transplant (2012); and the breakdown in Mary's relationship with her family when Cheney gives Liz permission to oppose gay marriage whilst running for the Senate, despite Mary being a married to a woman (2013).\r\n\r\nIn writing Vice, McKay focused on five main sources \u2013 David Corn's _The Lies of George W. Bush: Mastering the Politics of Deception_ (2003), Ron Suskind's _The One Percent Doctrine: Deep Inside America's Pursuit of Its Enemies Since 9\/11_ (2006), Michael Isikoff and David Corn's _Hubris: The Inside Story of Spin, Scandal, and the Selling of the Iraq War_ (2006), Barton Gellman's _Angler: The Cheney Vice Presidency_ (2008), and Jane Mayer's _The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals_ (2008).\r\n\r\n_Vice_ presents Cheney as devoid of ideology, with a Zelig-esque ability to alter his manner so as to best deal with whomever it is in whose company he finds himself. In this sense, his political ambition is portrayed as cynical and mercenary; McKay's Cheney has no interest in attaining power so as to influence policy or stimulate ideological change, he is obsessed only with power-for-power's sake. One of the most telling scenes in the film happens quite early when he learns that President Richard Nixon and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger are planning to bomb Cambodia without going through Congress. Asking Rumsfeld, \"_what do we believe?_\", he is met by Rumsfeld laughing hysterically at being asked such a ridiculous question. Speaking to The New Yorker, McKay explains,\r\n\r\n> _what I found \u2013 and I know there are people who disagree with this \u2013 was a surprising lack of ideology. I found beliefs that would flip and flop, based on what was convenient and what was strategically useful._\r\n\r\nHowever, although the film presents Cheney as lacking ideology, it does show him as passionate when he adopts (and later usurps) the Unitary Executive Theory (essentially, the idea that the President should have virtually unchecked power to direct the Executive Branch, particularly during times of crisis). McKay tells _The New Yorker_,\r\n\r\n> _at one point, he even says the President should have certain monarchical prerogatives._\r\n\r\nSpeaking to _ACLU_, he says of Cheney's adoption of the Theory,\r\n\r\n> _you see it constantly throughout his career \u2013 his attempts to expand executive reach, expand executive authority, to operate without transparency, to operate with impunity._\r\n\r\nKey lines in this respect include Cheney arguing, \"_if the president does it, it's legal_\", and, when discussing the issue of the US using torture, \"_if the US does it, by definition, it can't be torture_\".\r\n\r\nNowhere is his character shown as more ruthless than in a scene towards the end of the film. In 2013, Liz is running for the Senate when a TV advert from a group affiliated with the incumbent Senator for Wyoming, Mike Enzi, claimed that she \"_aggressively promotes gay marriage_\". Mary had been married to Heather Poe since 2012, and although Cheney and Liz knew it went against their party's doctrines, they had supported her. However, the day after the advert aired, Liz appeared on _Fox News Sunday_ and said she did not support gay marriage. The following day, Cheney and Lynne released a statement supporting Liz, and causing a rift between the family and Mary which remains to this day. The film features a scene the night before Liz goes on TV, in which she asks permission to say she opposes gay marriage. In a chilling moment lifted right out of Francis Ford Coppola's _The Godfather Part II_ (1974), Cheney indicates his approval with a single silent nod of his head. Speaking to _ACLU_ about this scene, McKay states,\r\n\r\n> _that to me is what made it a complete and total tragedy and that's the final kind of tally, the final destructive count of power. Is what he did to the country, what he did to countries like Iraq, punching holes in the Geneva Convention, what he did to the checks and balances of our democracy, what he did to the spirit of the American voter, the spirit of the American nation. And then the final thing, the tools that he used_ [\u2026] _eventually took down his own family. So to me at that point the tragedy was complete on every level: personal, family, country, world._\r\n\r\nMuch as in _BlacKkKlansman_, _Vice_ concludes with a haunting montage that brings the story up to date, showing some of the long-term effects of the Bush-Cheney years (instability in the Middle East, irreparable damage to the environment, the rise of IS). In relation to the here and now, although Trump is never explicitly mentioned (and is only shown for a split second in archive footage), McKay is unafraid to admit that the film is not entirely focused on the past. Speaking to the _New York Times_ about Cheney's dismantling of executive checks on power, McKay states,\r\n\r\n> _Cheney was the expert safecracker who opened up the safe, and now the orangutan is in there, throwing around the money and the jewels._\r\n\r\nHe also sees the film as something of a corrective, a reminder of just how bad it was during Bush's time in office, telling _ACLU_\r\n\r\n> _somewhere along the line, Donald Trump got elected, and all of a sudden we started hearing people say, \"Hey, I kind of miss George W. Bush. You know, he wasn't that bad, him and Cheney.\" And then I really felt like I got to make the movie. I was like, this is crazy that people are saying this._\r\n\r\nAs with McKay's previous film, _The Big Short_ (2015), _Vice_ is aesthetically audacious. While there are fewer self-reflexive celebratory cameos explaining difficult terminology in direct-to-camera monologues (sadly, there's no Margot Robbie in a bath this time around), the film is edited in such a way as to remind me of Oliver Stone's \"horizontal editing\" in films such as _JFK_ (1991), _Natural Born Killers_ (1994), _Nixon_ (1995), and _U-Turn_ (1997). It's no coincidence that Vice was cut by Hank Corwin, who cut all of the above except _JFK_. This style of hyperkinetic editing can be seen throughout the film. For example, as Chaney attempts to manipulate Bush into agreeing to give him more power, there are intercepts of fly-fishing. It's not subtle, but it is effective. Indeed, this recalls an earlier scene when Cheney is teaching his daughters to fish, explaining,\r\n\r\n> _you have to find out what the fish wants, and then you use that to catch the fish._\r\n\r\nElsewhere, much as Stone uses Coke commercials and footage from old films in _Natural Born Killers_, Vice features excerpts from the Budweiser \"Whassup?\" commercial (1999) and _Survivor_. In another scene, when Cheney first learns of the Unitary Executive Theory from Antonin Scalia (Matthew Jacobs), he immediately realises it is his road to power, and the film cuts to a lion bringing down a gazelle. For me though, some of the most effective editing in the film is more conventional. One particularly strong example is as Bush declares war on Iraq, the camera tilts down to show his leg is shaking. The film then cuts to a shot of an Iraqi civilian's leg shaking as the bombs begin to drop.\r\n\r\nAlso similar to _The Big Short_ is the film's sense of humour, with a tone of irreverence established from the very beginning, as the opening legend states,\r\n\r\n> _the following is a true story. Or as true as it can be given that Dick Cheney is known as one of the most secretive leaders in recent history. But we did our fucking best._\r\n\r\nA particularly sardonic scene comes about an hour in, as the film shows Cheney stepping away from politics in 1993 and later turning down Bush when he asks him to be his running mate in 2000. At this point, the legend explains that Cheney had chosen his family over politics, and that he happily lived out his days in Wyoming, becoming known as a great philanthropist and fly fisherman. As the Cheneys gather around a family barbeque, triumphant music swells, and the closing credits start to roll, only for the movie to interrupt itself, pointing out that that's not what happened at all, and then continuing with the narrative. It's a very meta technique, and one which both mocks feel-good biopics, whilst also providing a sly criticism of Cheney himself \u2013 had he not returned in 2000, the world could have had this happy ending.\r\n\r\nAnother very funny sequence sees Cheney and Lynne in bed discussing whether or not he should accept Bush's offer, with the narrator explaining,\r\n\r\n> _sadly there is no real way to know exactly what was going on with the Cheneys at this history-changing moment. We can't just snap into a Shakespearean soliloquy that dramatises every feeling and emotion. That's just not the way the world works._\r\n\r\nThis is immediately followed by Cheney and Lynne speaking in _faux_-Shakespearean blank verse (\"_Hast blindness usurped vision in you my wife?_\", \"_Mine own blood and will are yours til pierc'd be the last soldier's breastplate, spilling open its jellied ruby treasures_\") as they work themselves up into a sexual frenzy (although technically, this is a duologue, not a soliloquy). There is also a scene in which Cheney meets two oil executives, whose faces are blurred out, and whose names are bleeped every time they are spoken. In another scene, a waiter (Alfred Molina), reads from a menu that features various forms of Cheney-endorsed torture;\r\n\r\n> _tonight, we're offering the enemy combatant, whereby a person is not a prisoner of war, or a criminal, which means, of course, that he has absolutely no protection under the law._\r\n\r\nAfter listening to their options, Cheney gleefully declares, \"_we'll take it all_\". There is also a hilarious mid-credit scene, which sees a focus group descend into chaos when a conservative calls a liberal a \"_libtard_\", prompting a mass brawl. Ignoring the fight, however, are two young girls who are instead interested only in speculating as to the quality of the new _Fast & the Furious_ film.\r\n\r\nFor all that, however, _Vice_ isn't a patch on _The Big Short_, for a number of reasons. For example, whereas in _The Big Short_, the self-reflexive _Tristram Shandy_-style narrative structure worked to the film's advantage, providing a way into the complex story, here it has the exact opposite effect, oftentimes distracting from McKay's thematic concerns, preventing the film from focusing on telling us how (and why) Cheney exploited loopholes in executive power to restructure US foreign policy. McKay is also less successful at moving from scenes of quiet tragedy to scenes of comedy than he was in _The Big Short_.\r\n\r\nThe most egregious problem, however, is that the film fails to give any kind of psychological verisimilitude or interiority to Cheney. Presenting him in an almost robotic manner, there is very little on what drives him, depicting his various deeds without offering anything cogent in terms of his motivations. Is he simply an ideologically-weak opportunist? Is he an evil megalomaniac fuelled by a deeper purpose, and if so, what purpose, and how? Could it all really have been about power, viewing the global geopolitical sphere as his own personal playground and nothing more? And if the film is arguing this, suggesting that this man, responsible for so much pain and suffering, did it all simply because he liked power, isn't that to downplay his agency, to allow one to argue that he didn't really know how much damage he was causing? Depriving him of psychology weakens any attempt to censure his actions. The film's Cheney is ultimately unknowable, and that makes his acts more easily forgivable. The argument that it was all because of power and greed really does next-to-nothing to help explain the man. And in any case, if we accept the thesis that Cheney cared only for power, then surely he warrants serious moral scrutiny, not a self-reflexive and, at times, self-congratulatory narrative that assumes the audience agrees with it before it has even said anything.\r\n\r\n_Vice_ traces all of Cheney's acts back to Lynne dressing him down when he was younger, suggesting that without her prodding, this unambitious two-time Yale dropout would never have gotten into politics in the first place (it's telling, perhaps, that Lynne is unenthusiastic when she learns Cheney is thinking of accepting Bush's offer to be his running mate, pointing out, \"_the VP just sits around and waits for the president to die_\"). But to reduce all of it to being told off by wife, seems far too easy, although it could, I suppose, be cited as an example of the banality of evil. Except that the film's Cheney is anything but banal. In fact, he's terrifying.\r\n\r\nCheney pressured the CIA to find links between Al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein so as to justify invading Iraq. He oversaw the public relations campaign to build popular support for the war. He encouraged the torture of terror suspects all the while denying it was torture. He was responsible for the worst strategic blunder in US history, the growth of a domestic surveillance state, the dictatorialisation of the office of the President, and the deaths of 4,000 American troops and at least 100,000 Iraqi civilians, although possibly as many as 500,000. His contempt for and willingness to rewrite the rule of law makes him a precursor of Trump. Positing him as a man who was power-mad and little else, _Vice_ remains always on the outside, trying to listen through the wall, never managing to open the door and expose his actual inner workings. The comedy and structural experimentation make it entertaining as a film, but it tells us very little about Cheney that we didn't already know. Strip away the artifice, and you'll find it doesn't have a huge amount to say. Never attaining the scale of tragedy to which it clearly aspires, the film functions instead to remind critics of Bush's cabinet why they became critics of Bush's cabinet. In the end, rather than exposing Cheney's dark soul, the film argues that he doesn't have one. And that is a far less interesting thesis.","id":"5d290381be4b3612f6a27860","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d290381be4b3612f6a27860","movie_id":429197}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Superb colorful Norse adventure\/fantasy highlighted by protagonist Anna Demetriou*** \r\n\r\nThe sole rightful heir of a Scandinavian kingdom (Anna Demetriou) is unjustly exiled and must survive the unforgiving wilderness while figuring out a way to win back her father\u2019s throne.\r\n\r\n\"Viking Destiny\" (2018) may be low-budget, but it\u2019s superb for what it is: A simple heroic fantasy flick with a compelling story that flows, great Irish locations, colorful cinematography & costumes, an effective score, a quality cast, and a runtime that doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome (the credits start rolling at 84 minutes). I\u2019m assuming the events take place during the Viking era, 793\u20131066 AD. In any case, Anna Demetriou is both beautiful and convincing as the Viking princess, a thoroughly worthy protagonist.\r\n\r\nThe budget is comparable to similar low-cost flicks like \u201cThe Viking Queen\u201d (1967) and \u201cThe Lost Future\u201d (2010), but with the modern production sheen of quality sword & sandal TV series\u2019, like Vikings, but more colorful and less dismal & brooding. Nevertheless, there are several bits o\u2019 wisdom to mine. If you like movies like \u201cTristan + Isolde\u201d (2006), \u201cThe Vikings\u201d (1958), the aforementioned \u201cThe Lost Future,\u201d \u201cConan the Barbarian\u201d (1982) or any of the D&D pictures, I guarantee you\u2019ll find a lot to appreciate here.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s one story issue that might turn-off some viewers and that\u2019s the idea that a couple of Norse Gods appear to the protagonists and antagonists. But it\u2019s explained that only the person in question can \u201csee\u201d these gods, whether Odin or Loki. It might help to accept this on the grounds that people in the modern day are motivated through God or the devil & evil spirits (or however you want to put it). The character of the individual determines which ones from which they receive.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 91 minutes and was shot in Northern Ireland. The action gets pretty brutal and there\u2019s one overt sex scene in the forest.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-","id":"5ceb6ba59251416a3fbcd130","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ceb6ba59251416a3fbcd130","movie_id":537347}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Too ambiguous for its own good_**\r\n\r\n> _There is alarming evidence that important tipping points, leading to irreversible changes in major ecosystems and the planetary climate system, may already have been reached or passed. Ecosystems as diverse as the Amazon rainforest and the Arctic tundra, may be approaching thresholds of dramatic change through warming and drying. Mountain glaciers are in alarming retreat and the downstream effects of reduced water supply in the driest months will have repercussions that transcend generations._\r\n\r\n- \"Climate Change\"; United Nations\r\n\r\nBased on Christophe Dufoss\u00e9's 2002 novel, _L'Heure de la sortie_ [lit. trans. _The Time to Exit_] had its world premiere at the 2018 Venice Film Festival where it screened in the new \"Sconfini\" section, a non-competition category for difficult-to-classify films. Which should tell you a great deal. If you can imagine the ecological themes of films such as Jeff Nichols's _Take Shelter_ (2011) or Paul Schrader's _First Reformed_ (2017), filtered through the _milieu_ of Peter Weir's _Dead Poets Society_ (1989), but with the tonal qualities of Wolf Rilla's _Village of the Damned_ (1960) or Fritz Kiersch's _Children of the Corn_ (1984), then you'd be some way towards nailing director and co-writer S\u00e9bastien Marnier's second feature. Is it a satire about liberal Generation Z snowflakes overdramatically reading apocalyptic omens into trivial matters? Is it an allegory about how difficult it can be for gifted children to fit into so-called normal society? Is it a metaphor for the generation gap, and how today's children can often be alienated from even relatively young adults? Is it about desensitisation amongst a generation who have never known life without the internet or a world without post-9\/11 paranoia? Is it a desperate call-to-arms, a plea on behalf of tomorrow's adults that humanity is rapidly reaching the point-of-no-return in terms of the damage we are doing to the Earth? Is it a horror movie about creepy kids doing creepy things? Is it all of these?\r\n\r\nThe film opens in the prestigious St. Joseph's in France, a private middle school with an excellent reputation. On an unusually warm day, as a class of _troisi\u00e8me_ students (children aged 13-14) are quietly sitting a test, their teacher, Professor Eric Capadis (Cyrille Hertel), casually walks to the window, opens it, and throws himself to his death. Most of the students are shocked, but six remain relatively unfazed. Several days later, Pierre Hoffman (Laurent Lafitte) arrives at St. Joseph's as a temporary substitute for Capadis. Still writing his own PhD thesis, Pierre believes the job will be straightforward, even though the class is for intellectually advanced students. Almost immediately, however, he learns they are far ahead of where he thought they would be. Seeing how deeply unpopular a central clique of six especially gifted students (the same six who weren't especially bothered by Capadis's death) are amongst the school's other pupils (and many of the teachers), Pierre tries to ingratiate himself with them, but gets nowhere. Meanwhile, he begins to notice odd behaviour, such as when one of the students arrives for school with facial injuries, but no-one seems to care. With his curiosity getting the better of him, he starts following them, learning that they head to an abandoned quarry every day after school, where they have hidden a collection of DVDs. Upon viewing the discs, Pierre finds they contain endless hours of footage of industrial animal slaughter and food processing intercut with images of nuclear conflagrations, flashes of apocalyptic biblical imagery, and dire warnings about the unsustainable future of humanity. Unnerved by his find, he soon comes to believe the clique are watching him. Are they responsible for the mysterious late-night phone calls he has been getting? Do they have anything to do with his tap water turning brown? Or his electricity turning on and off? Or his missing laptop? What about the cockroaches that invade his apartment? Could the clique even have been involved with Capadis's suicide? But to what end? What are they planning, and why?\r\n\r\nI ended both of the above paragraphs with a series of questions for a reason. Namely, to emphasise that if you're looking for definitive answers here, you won't get them. Virtually none of the mysteries the film throws up, of which there are a hell of a lot, are conclusively resolved. The film is happy for you to peer inside, but Marnier steadfastly refuses to give you much info to contextualise what you're looking at. Speaking to Cineuropa, Marnier explains that the film begins as if to present\r\n\r\n> _the opacity of adolescence through the eyes of a 40-year-old man_ [...] _I was interested in placing viewers inside Pierre's head and body, as if to hypnotise, contaminate and poison them._\r\n\r\nHowever, as Pierre gets more and more unnerved by the clique, the film slowly changes course; according to Marnier, this is\r\n\r\n> _the point at which the classic confrontation forks off towards a point of rupture._\r\n\r\nThe nature of this rupture, however, is never really clarified, as Marnier is far more interested in asking questions than answering them. There are certainly clues about what it all means, and the audience is pushed in certain directions from time to time, but even the final scene, although it does suggest some answers, also raises more questions.\r\n\r\nIn theory, I don't have a problem with this kind of narrative. Films built around ambiguity, where certain details are withheld, and everything is left up to subjective interpretation, can work extremely well (after all, one of my all time favourite films is Terrence Malick's _The Tree of Life_). However, the mysteries of _L'Heure de la sortie_ are very different to those found in Malick, or, say, David Lynch's _Lost Highway_ (1997), _Mulholland Dr._ (2001), _Inland Empire_ (2006), or _Twin Peaks: The Return_ (2017). Whilst Lynch's films tend to function as sensory puzzles, where the audience must bend their interpretation around what is on screen, with every little aural and visual detail meaning something (and often more than one thing) in relation to the whole, _L'Heure de la sortie_ is more of an intellectual conundrum, asking question after question without time to pause, and then stepping back and asking, finally, \"_so what do you think I was trying to say there_?\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of one possible interpretation of the film, (namely, the ecological one \u2013 that this generation is gifting to the next a planet we have largely destroyed, something about which we're not overly bothered), Marnier states,\r\n\r\n> _we are aware but we're not fighting anymore \u2013 not just because we feel let down by politicians. I think the world has become so scary that we take refuge in our little lives, trying to make them as pleasant as possible._\r\n\r\nThe clique act as if they have no hope for the future, and that they firmly believe the world left for them (their \"_era_\" as they call it) will throw up problems the likes of which humanity will be unable to overcome. Of this meaning, Marnier explains,\r\n\r\n> _the film states that we are still waiting for the disaster to happen so that \"living together\" and collective awareness can take shape again. But we need to work together before it's too late._\r\n\r\nThe clique don't share this optimism, believing too much damage has already been done. In fact, they believe that optimism itself is part of the problem; as one points out, \"_it's too late, there's no future. You don't want to face the truth_.\"\r\n\r\nAs this might suggest, the film tackles political and social themes infinitely more weighty than those typically found in Lynch (who tends to focus on psychological issues), but as an artistic statement, I found it lacking. And whereas the absence of any obvious directorial or authorial \"statement\" in Lynch's work is actually part of what makes it so successful, here, due to the various political themes raised, the question of \"_what is the director trying to say_\" remains front-and-centre the entire time. I rarely ask myself that question when watching a Lynch film, or a Malick film, or a Guy Maddin film; I might ask it afterwards, but during the experiential moment, the artistry becomes its own referent. During _L'Heure de la sortie_, I was constantly wondering to myself, \"_what does Marnier mean by that_?\", something I don't even do when viewing the work of a politically allegorical filmmaker such as Peter Greenaway. The narrative jumps from unanswered question to half-answered question to unexplained scene to unclear theme back to unanswered question, throwing so much gasoline on the fire that it burns itself out. By roughly the half-way point, I had stopped caring why Capadis had killed himself, because there were about fifteen other unanswered questions rattling about. And it's a case of ever diminishing returns \u2013 the more mysteries that go unaddressed, the less important each of them feels.\r\n\r\nBut it's not just that there are too many mysteries. Again, this can work well in the right hands. Rather, it's that few of them ever connect to the others. Take, for example, the hobo scene in _Mulholland Dr._ For much of the runtime, it seems completely divorced from everything else in the film. But we do eventually learn how it relates to the main plot, even if it remains ambiguous. _L'Heure de la sortie_ is full of what feels like completely disconnected mysteries. There's also little to reward the patient or observant viewer. Contrast it with films such as _Lost Highway_, when we recognise the police sirens at the end are the same ones that Fred (Bill Pullman) heard in the opening scene, or _Mulholland Dr._, when the Cowboy (Monty Montgomery) explains to Adam (Justin Theroux) what it will mean if he sees him \"_two more times_\", and right at the end, we see him for the second time. There's nothing like that in _L'Heure de la sortie_, with so much feeling like it exists in isolation from everything else.\r\n\r\nWhich is not to say there is nothing to like about the film. The 1980s-style retro score, by John Carpenter aficionados Zombie Zombie, is excellent, and Romain Carcanade's cinematography is superb, using anamorphic lenses to distort interiors in tandem with Pierre's crumpling mental state, and really hammering home how monumentally hot it's supposed to be, using a recurring visual motif of beads of sweat. Additionally, there are some wonderful touches in the screenplay, co-written by Marnier and Elise Griffon. For example, Pierre is writing a thesis on Franz Kafka and his apartment is invaded by cockroaches.\r\n\r\nThere are also individual scenes of great brilliance. For all its unsettling weirdness and creepy kids, for me, the most disturbing scene was one based entirely in reality. When an alarm sounds in the school, Pierre asks if it's a fire drill, and the class all but laugh at the question. Of course it isn't a fire drill \u2013 it's an active shooter drill. The students calmly gather their things and move to the wall, sitting under the windows looking into the corridor. However, when Pierre joins them, they chastise him, not once, but twice \u2013 firstly, for leaving his own things on his desk, meaning if a shooter walks by, they will look in and know someone is in there, and secondly, he forgets to turn his phone onto airplane mode. The scene is chillingly effective in it profound mundanity, not only showing us their accustomed and dispassionate response, but in hammering home the very different lives that people of Pierre's age led when they were in school. Obviously, this speaks to the generation divide, but it also speaks to issues of desensitisation; the state of the world has sufficiently traumatised these children to the point where something like this is routine; the possibility that a shooter might wander into a school and start killing people is not something any child (in any country) should live with. In fact, if you read the scene allegorically, it actually suggests that not only did older generations grow up in a different environment, should the worst happen, they are relatively powerless to protect the next generation, and may even end up getting them killed. That's essentially the polar opposite of what an adult is supposed to bring to a young person's life.\r\n\r\nAll in all though, despite these elements, the film left me disappointed. It builds up very nicely in the early stages, but about mid-way through the second act, it flounders, as you start to realise it's not actually building to anything specific. Even the _d\u00e9nouement_ is insipid (although the short coda that ends the film is excellent; evocative and properly creepy). The characterisation is also poor, with only Pierre given any kind of arc, whilst the children themselves remain empty avatars, devoid of psychological verisimilitude. I'm also not entirely convinced that if you want to prod people into action _vis-\u00e0-vis_ climate change, the best way to go about it is by presenting a mystery-thriller that has no intentions of explaining what is going on \u2013 the vehicle just doesn't correlate with the message. It's worth a look, but given the scope of the themes and the nature of the central message, you would hope for a lot more.","id":"5d12a5bc0e0a26597dcd8a75","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d12a5bc0e0a26597dcd8a75","movie_id":475928}

Also, since I write novels in my spare time and feature plenty of dialogue, I don't mind a lot of talking in movies either.

Decidedly different from Paul Greengrass's recently released Netflix film, _22 July_, the makers of _Ut\u00f8ya 22. juli_ have little interest in either overt political contextualisation or the aftermath of the massacre. Comparisons are, of course, inevitable, as the two films will undoubtedly prompt debate as to the ethics of recreating such a contemporary tragedy. However, what's interesting is that Greengrass isn't overly interested in the massacre itself, focusing instead on the repercussions and subsequent trial, attempting to explicate some of the far-right political motivations. In this sense, _Ut\u00f8ya 22. juli_ and _22 July_ complement one another in such a way as to provide a reasonably inclusive overview of the motives, the act, and the punishment. Where _Ut\u00f8ya 22. juli_ is especially laudable, however, is in its extraordinary and thematically justified aesthetic design, which elevates it from a fine film to a superb one.\r\n\r\nWritten by Anna Bache-Wiig and Siv Rajendram Eliassen, from a story treatment by Erik Poppe (_Tusen ganger god natt_; _Kongens nei_), who also directs, _Ut\u00f8ya 22. juli_ is based exclusively on the testimony of survivors, but the characters are fictional, with the protagonist a composite of several different people, experiencing on her own what they did collectively. The film begins with the detonation of a bomb near the Statsministerens kontor [Office of the Prime Minister] in Oslo. The film then jumps roughly 90 minutes forward, and about 20 miles northwest, to the Arbeidernes ungdomsfylking [Workers' Youth League] summer camp on the island of Ut\u00f8ya. Politically on the left, and affiliated to the Arbeiderpartiet [Labour Party], the camp is an annual event attended by roughly 600 youths. As word of the Oslo bombing slowly starts to filter through, we are introduced to Kaja (an extraordinary Andrea Berntzen), a 19-year-old with political aspirations, who is attending the camp with her younger sister Emilie (Elli Rhiannon M\u00fcller Osbourne). With Emilie patently uninterested in politics, Kaja resents having to look after her. Also introduced are Petter (Brede Fristad), a young man with a knack for pushing Kaja's political buttons; Magnus (Aleksander Holmen), an eternal optimist who has come to the island primarily to pick up girls, and who has his sights on Kaja; and Issa (Sorosh Sadat), a young Muslim who is hoping the bombing is not the work of a jihadist, as he fears it will increase the prejudice he already experiences on a daily basis. As they discuss the matter, they hear strange noises coming from the far side of the forest. Initially believing them to be firecrackers, it is only when terrified campers start rushing from the trees that they realise something more serious is happening. Taking shelter in a nearby cabin, Kaja is distraught to learn Emilie is nowhere to be found. As the sounds of gunfire get closer, the campers inside the building realise it provides no real safety, and leave. As Petter attempts to convince everyone it's probably just an elaborate safety drill, it is suggested they may be safer on the island's shoreline than in the forest. However, as that would take them even further from the campsite where Kaja last saw Emilie, she refuses to go, returning to the camp alone in an effort to find her sister.\r\n\r\nFirst, as is my wont, here's a little background information. Both attacks were carried out by Anders Behring Breivik, a right-wing terrorist and possible psychopath. Roughly 90 minutes prior to the bombing, Breivik emailed over 1,000 people a 1,518-page manifesto, _2083: A European Declaration of Independence_. Essentially an amalgamation of Islamophobic, xenophobic, national conservatist, pan-nationalist, monoculturalist, misogynistic, and anti-Marxist ideologies, Breivik outlines why he believes Europe is currently experiencing the Clash of Civilisations, brought about by immigration and various refugee crises. To this end, the manifesto cites a huge number of both moderate and far-right authors, including counter-jihadists Robert Spencer and Peder Are N\u00f8stvold Jensen (aka Fjordman); pro-Israeli Gis\u00e8le Littman (aka Bat Ye'o); Islamophobic blogger Pamela Geller; orientalist and Indologist Koenraad Elst; president of the Middle East Forum, Daniel Pipes; leader of the Partij voor de Vrijheid [Party for Freedom] in the Netherlands, Geert Wilders; and paleoconservatist Sr\u0111a Trifkovi\u0107. The manifesto outlines how Breivik sees himself as a knight fighting against Muslim immigration into Europe. Indeed, he very literally believes this, claiming to be a member of a \"_Christian European military order_\" called the Pauperes commilitones Christi Templique Solomonici [PCCTS], which he says is a modern day reincarnation of the Knights Templar. Established in London in 2002, as an \"_anti-Jihad crusader-organisation_\" that fights \"_Islamic suppression_\", the group's goal is\r\n\r\n> _to seize political and military control of Western European multiculturalist regimes and to try, judge and punish Western European cultural Marxist\/multiculturalist perpetrators for crimes committed against the indigenous peoples of Europe._\r\n\r\nAccording to _2083_, there are between 15 and 80 \"Justiciar Knights\" operational in Western Europe, supported by a network of civilian members across all walks of life. However, no evidence has ever been found to suggest the PCCTS is real.\r\n\r\nThe Oslo bomb killed eight and injured 209. Roughly 90 minutes later, Breivik, dressed as a policeman, boarded the ferry for Ut\u00f8ya. Presenting himself as performing a routine check on the camp following the bombing, he was met by camp leader and island hostess, Monica B\u00f8sei. Becoming suspicious, B\u00f8sei called Trond Berntsen, the island's security officer and half-brother of Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway, but Breivik killed them both, firing his first shot at 17:22. Using hollow-point bullets to increase tissue damage, Breivik repeatedly shouted, \"_You are going to die today, Marxists_.\" At 18:01, he called emergency services to surrender, but hung up, and continued shooting. At 18:25, the Beredskapstroppen [Emergency Response Unit] arrived on Ut\u00f8ya, and one minute later, Breivik again called to surrender, again hanging up. At 18:34, 72 minutes since the first shot had been fired, Breivik was arrested. 69 people were dead, and 110 were injured, with the ages of the dead ranging from 14 to 51.\r\n\r\nAlthough there was talk of charging Breivik with high treason or crimes against humanity, he was instead indicted on domestic terrorism charges. He readily admitted his culpability in both attacks, but denied criminal guilt, citing a defence of \"necessity\" (in legal terms, necessity refers to an argument that the defendant had no option but to break the law, so as to prevent a greater harm). A major aspect of the trial was whether Breivik could be deemed criminally insane. Examined by a team of forensic psychologists, they concluded he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, and was psychotic when he carried out the attacks. However, under pressure from the victims' families, the court ordered a second evaluation. This time, it was determined that he suffered from antisocial personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder, but he was not psychotic during the massacre. Upon being found guilty, he was sentenced to 21 years in a maximum security prison, with the option to have his sentence extended in five-year increments if he is still deemed a threat to society (the maximum sentence allowed by Norwegian law).\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the _Gj\u00f8rv-rapporten_ [_Gj\u00f8rv Report_] was published. The official results of a fact-finding commission ordered by the Norwegian government, the _Rapporten_ found that police could have prevented the bombing, should have reached Ut\u00f8ya sooner, and should have caught Breivik faster. The Oslo police became aware of the shooting at 17:25, three minutes after the first shot, and the Beredskapstroppen was dispatched from Oslo at 17:30. Local police reached the ferry point at 17:55 but were ordered to wait until the arrival of the team from Oslo. They reached the ferry point at 18:09, but were forced to wait for a suitable boat to take them to Ut\u00f8ya. However, the inflatable boat that was procured was too small for the amount of personnel and equipment, and the engine cut-out during the crossing. They then transferred to two privately owned boats in the vicinity, reaching the island at 18:25. The _Rapporten_ stated that police should have been on the island by 18:00 at the latest. It also cited a phone-call made by a civilian 10 minutes after the bombing, giving police a description of Breivik, and alerting them to the fact that he was armed and wearing protective clothing. However, the police failed to act on the information. The _Rapporten_ also alluded to the fact that the country's only police helicopter was not used during the massacre, because its crew were on vacation. \u00d8ystein M\u00e6land, director of the Politidirektoratet [National Police Directorate] resigned in the wake of the _Rapporten_.\r\n\r\nSo much for background. Although dealing with a politically motivated incident _Ut\u00f8ya 22. juli_ is a relatively apolitical film, in the sense of Gus Van Sant's overly-simplistic _Elephant_ (2003) or Paul Greengrass's superb _United 93_ (2006). It simply has no interest in contextualising the event within a larger socio-political or socio-historical framework. It doesn't investigate why Breivik did what he did, what specifically set him off, or what happened to him afterwards. It is instead a homage to the young people upon whom he focused his aggression. In filtering the event through the fictional character of Kaja, Poppe is able to narrativise it, and thus render it emotionally compelling. Of course, it could, and probably will be argued that no such emotional restructuring is necessary, as the event, in and of itself, is emotionally traumatic enough, and using a fictional protagonist is distasteful and disrespectful.\r\n\r\nHowever, to counter this argument, the film was made in consultation with numerous survivors of the massacre. In a BBC interview, Poppe stated that he chose to use fictional characters in order to\r\n\r\n> _make a reflection of what happened out there, as close as possible to what I learned. There were ethical reasons for me to tell a fictionalised story. It would be hard for the survivors to watch the film if they thought these people were friends who had been killed._\r\n\r\nSpeaking to _The Guardian_ at the world premi\u00e8re, one of the survivors, Ingrid Endredrud, said,\r\n\r\n> _this film is so important because it captures what right-wing extremism can lead to. This is hate in its purest form and as a society, we have to stand together against it. For me, the reason for helping with this film is because it tells the story which for so many of us has been impossible to tell. I've only been able to tell my experience with a great deal of distance and that's where film can offer another way of preserving an important part of Norway's history._\r\n\r\nAlso speaking to _The Guardian_, Poppe states,\r\n\r\n> _my overall aim by making the film was not to traumatise people, but to help the healing process._\r\n\r\nIn this sense, rather than proving exploitative, the film is instead both necessary and cathartic. Indeed, private screenings were held around Norway to which survivors and families and friends of victims were invited, and Poppe sought their approval of every aspect of the film before releasing it.\r\n\r\nAs Endredrud alludes to above, however, the film is not _entirely_ apolitical. The opening and closing legends both cite far-right thinking (the kind of people who don't understand the difference between nationalism and xenophobia, or patriotism and jingoism), and Poppe makes certain we know this is a condemnation of such an ideology. However, he wisely chooses not to ram this condemnation down our throats, nor even to foreground it. Instead, he simply lets the extremist ideology speak for itself, and, as is so often the case with far-right (and far-left) thinking, the doctrine condemns itself. Perhaps the most salient political point in the film is that we are forced to see in specifics an incident which we tend to think of as an abstraction; it's one thing to say 69 people died. It's disassociated, depersonalised, a statistic. However, it's something else entirely to see some of those people die. In this sense, the film is an exceptionally effective condemnation of gun violence.\r\n\r\nRelated to this is an aesthetic point that bleeds into the political; Breivik is seen only once, from a great distance, silhouetted against the horizon. Instead of showing him, the film is rigidly tied to Kaja's perspective throughout. In the wake of the real event, the 69 dead and the hundreds of injured and traumatised were anonymous, with Breivik occupying all the headlines. The film inverts this so that we focus on the victims, with the perpetrator denied any agency. As Poppe tells the BBC, he felt it was \"_morally questionable_\" to devote any time to \"_portraiting_\" Breivik; \"_the last thing I wanted was to give him more social media fame. I wanted it to be a story about the victims_.\" Recalling how Terrence Malick initially introduces the Japanese soldiers on Guadalcanal in _The Thin Red Line_ (1998), Breivik is not afforded any kind of pathology, interiority, psychological verisimilitude, or even a bogeyman status. Instead, he is disembodied. In fact, his name is never mentioned once, not even in the opening or closing legends. Instead, he exists more in the aural realm than the visual one, a more obvious presence in the sound design by Gisle Tveito (_Trolljegeren_; _Turist_; _Thelma_) than Martin Otterbeck's cinematography. Primarily, this consists of the constant gunfire heard throughout the film. With no score or soundtrack to punctuate the story beats, the never-ending cracking of gunfire has a cumulatively oppressive and terrifying effect, disorientating both characters and audience.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, however, the film is exemplary beyond its sound design. For example, in reality, from the time of the first gun-shot to Breivik's arrest, 72 minutes passed. In the film, from the time we hear the first gunshot to the film cutting to black, exactly 72 minutes pass. Additionally, we hear the exact same number of gunshots as Breivik fired in real-life, 186. However, where it is most audacious is that the 72-minute sequence (encompassing the entire film save for the brief opening scene, which shows real security camera footage of the Oslo bombing) is made to look like a single-shot, with the edits hidden, \u00e0 la Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's _Birdman: or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)_ (2014). The film was shot in one take on five successive days, acting out the same scenario each day. Poppe and his editor, Einar Egeland (_Kongens nei_), then edited extracts from each day together, hiding the cuts behind camera movement or darkness on screen. Coupled with this, everything is filmed hand-held, eschewing the pseudo-stability given by the use of a Steadicam.\r\n\r\nTogether, the hand-held nature of the cinematography, the single-shot effect, and the real-time structure work to establish a pseudo-documentarian verisimilitude, as if the camera is literally capturing these events as they are really happening in a _cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9_ manner (it's worth noting that Otterbeck has thus far worked primarily on documentaries). In this sense, the fabula is as unmediated as possible, recalling some of Ernest Hemingway's short stories, such as \"Hills Like White Elephants\" or \"The Killers\" (both 1927). In essence, the lack of obvious editing, the absence of well-blocked compositions and predetermined camera positions, and the real-time sense of immediacy all work to occlude any impression of either an omnipresent artifice, or an omniscient authorial voice.\r\n\r\nInstead, the film works as much as possible to inculcate the viewer into the event. This creates a prominent experiential plane, as the audience is made to consider what it must have been like to be involved in this nightmare \u2013 we see and share the panic as the characters peer out from behind cover, race to get to safety, or collapse onto the ground in exhaustion. In this way, the film avoids being exciting in any conventional sense; what we are witnessing is instead deeply traumatic, and the experience for a viewer is an ordeal, almost an endurance test. Rarely has the artifice of a single-take been this thematically justified (contrast, for example, its gimmicky usage in Sebastian Schipper's _Victoria_), and rather than the single-take structure serving as its own rationale, Poppe uses it to subvert genre expectations and defamiliarise the narrative, all in the name of preventing the audience from attaining any comforting sense of normality.\r\n\r\nAdding to all of this is the brilliantly naturalistic acting, especially from Andrea Berntzen, who is an absolute revelation as Kaja. When she returns to the campsite looking for Emilie, for example, all she finds is Emilie's mobile phone, and Tobias (Magnus Moen), a traumatised child of 10 or 11. Her increasing desperation and despair are flawlessly conveyed by Berntzen, and as she searches Emilie's tent, she suddenly realises Breivik is close-by. She freezes, and we hear his footsteps moving past the tent. This scene is legitimately one of the tensest and most terrifying scenes I've seen in a long time, generating infinitely more dread than any supernatural hijinx, and Berntzen's acting is a large part of that. This is also true in an utterly heart-breaking telephone conversation with her mother, where she apologises for not being able to find Emilie. Equally as poignant is a scene where she encounters a severely wounded girl (Solveig Kol\u00f8en Birkeland) who asks Kaja to tell her mother she loves her. The acting from both Berntzen and Birkeland here is extraordinary, and this short scene serves as perhaps the most disturbingly real in the entire film.\r\n\r\nA final point on the film's aesthetic design concerns the opening few seconds of the 72-minute sequence, which begins with a superbly conceived bit of visual trickery that, like everything else in the film, is thematically justified. As the camera approaches Kaja from behind, she turns around and looks directly into the lens, saying \"_You'll never understand_.\" This seems a challenge as much as an assertion, directed at the audience, in a breaking of the fourth wall, articulating that the upcoming carnage will defy rationality. However, after a moment, she turns her head and we see she is wearing an earpiece. It then quickly becomes apparent that she's talking to her mother, and her comment was diegetic \u2013 when she looked into the camera, she wasn't addressing the audience, it was simply the direction in which she was looking. This simple but effective moment knocks the audience immediately off balance, alerting us to the artifice of the film in an almost _Verfremdungseffekt_, before then shifting 180 degrees away from that apparent moment of self-reflexivity and immersing us completely into the _fabula_.\r\n\r\nOf course, the film is not perfect, and Poppe does misjudge a couple of elements. For example, the tragedy on display is, in and of itself, overwhelming, and for the most part, he remains detached. However, on occasion, he does feel the need to foreground sentimental aspects which don't work and are unnecessary. The most egregious example is towards the end of the film as Kaja and Magnus are trying to hide. To take their mind off what's happening they talk about their future plans (she wants to be a politician; he wants to be an actor). However, when he finds out she's a singer, he urges her to sing for him, which she reluctantly does, choosing Cyndi Lauper's \"True Colors\" (1986). It's a fairly mawkish scene (really, all its lacking is a \"Cry now\" prompt), it doesn't accomplish anything, and it comes across as manipulative and deliberately scripted, a concession to the rules of cinematic drama, lapsing into the traditional generic signposting that the film has mostly avoided up to this point. The scene instead serves to cheapen the experience of documentary realism, with the constructed artifice's fictional foundation becoming apparent.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is related to the film sticking rigidly to Kaja's perspective. For the most part, this works to the narrative's thematic advantage. Obviously, a film about a person hiding for 72 minutes wouldn't be very interesting, or say much of relevance. With this in mind, Kaja moves around a lot, encountering various people, and it becomes a little repetitive and episodic in places. Because she is a composite of several people, her experiences are used by the filmmakers to give the viewer something of an overview of the panic and suffering. However, for one person to encounter all of these characters and have such varying experiences does strain credibility just a tad.\r\n\r\nHowever, these are relatively minor criticisms, and overall, this is a superb film, as aesthetically inventive as it is emotionally devastating, as politically aware as it is historically important. It will be sure to prompt heated debate about whether such an event should be used to provide the source material for a film, especially this soon after the fact. Some will argue it's a dignified memorial, whilst others will see it as fundamentally exploitative and disrespectful. Personally, I see it as a vital text for Norway, capturing the essence of the most traumatic event the country has experienced since World War II. If people can let go of their notions of \"cinema as entertainment\", and try to embrace more of a \"cinema as art\" approach, it will become much easier to accept the film for what it is, and to realise that Poppe and his screenwriters genuinely have something important to say about the massacre, and, more specifically, about the _experience_ of the massacre. The last three or four minutes are utterly devastating, and really drive home the senseless loss of life and the innate randomness of what happened. However, Poppe's main goal is to show the audience the bravery of these people, to honour them. Evil, the film suggests, is banal. Compassion and valour are much more worthy of our attention.","id":"5d080fe6c3a368445b30572e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d080fe6c3a368445b30572e","movie_id":500006}

And those beautiful people who were being slaughtered, I wanted to tell their story. To this very day I carry the weight and responsibility of what I promised. And I'm still doing it; it's never going to stop._\r\n\r\n- Paul Conroy\r\n\r\nIn an age when many people give huge credence to patently fake news, outrageous conspiracy theories, and social media memes purporting universal truths, what is the role of perhaps the last great stalwart of what H.L. Mencken once referred to as \"_the life of kings_\" \u2013 the investigative journalist? The Fourth Estate has taken a pounding in recent years, and one wonders what Edward R. Murrow would have made of it all, but one thing of which we can be certain is that he would have respected the hell out of _Sunday Times_ war correspondent Marie Colvin, the ostensible subject of writer\/director Christopher Martin's excellent documentary, Under the Wire. Based on _Under the Wire: Marie Colvin's Final Assignment_ by Colvin's photographer, Paul Conroy, who is also the primary interviewee in the film, the documentary covers the assignment on which Colvin was killed \u2013 the February 2012 military offensive during the Siege of Homs in Syria. Featuring a mixture of talking-head interviews and footage shot on-the-ground, with a small amount of interspersed reconstruction, the documentary is a more personalised version of the types of news story we see on a regular basis \u2013 \"_a journalist was killed today in\u2026_\" However, whilst thematically, the film is about both Colvin's indefatigable spirit and Conroy's deep respect for her, it's structured more like a thriller, complete with plot twists, heroism, sacrifice, and success against-the-odds.\r\n\r\nGenerally uninterested in the official versions of events, which she equated with propaganda and often outright lies, Colvin was instead primarily concerned with presenting the stories of those usually forgotten in conflicts, arguing that \"_being a war correspondent is about what people are going through_\". Believing passionately that \"_journalism can make a difference_\", her career exemplified this belief. For example, in September 1999, Colvin was reporting on the East Timorese independence referendum. When the majority of voters chose independence from Indonesia, the pro-Indonesian militia began a wave of violence in the capital city, Dili. As journalists fled the country, tens of thousands of civilian refugees left the city. However, around 1,500 made their way to the UN compound. Colvin was urged to get out of harm's way, but refused, and, along with two Dutch reporters, Irene Slegt and Minka Nijhuis, headed instead to the compound. After four days of the trio shaming the Indonesian government in the international press, the journalists, the UN staff, and the 1,500 civilians were allowed to leave safely. In December that same year, whilst covering the early months of the Second Chechen War, she was embedded in the mountains with Chechen rebels. Finding her extraction route cut off by Russian paratroopers, she instead escaped over a snow-swept 12,000 foot mountain into Georgia. Surviving eight days in the wilderness, braving chest-high snowdrifts, hunger, exposure, and altitude sickness, she was eventually rescued by a Georgian helicopter dispatched at the behest of her husband, Patrick Bishop, and _Sunday Times_ colleague, Jon Swain. In 2001, whilst reporting on the treatment of Tamil peasants during the Sri Lankan Civil War, her left eye was badly hurt when she was hit with shrapnel from an RPG. Despite the injury, which caused her to permanently lose the sight in her eye, she still managed to file copy before that day's deadline. In 2011, she conducted the first interview with Muammar Gaddafi since the commencement of the Arab Spring earlier that year. Essentially, Colvin was not someone who simply believed \"_journalism can make a difference_\", she was someone who made sure \"_journalism_ did _make a difference._\"\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to _Under the Wire_. Having covered the Arab Spring in Libya, Colvin next headed to Syria, where civil uprisings had been taking place since March 2011, and armed insurgency had broken out in July. On February 3, 2012, in the city of Homs, which had been under governmental attack since May 2011, the Syrian Army launched an offensive focused on the rebel stronghold of Baba Amr. With the Bashar al-Assad government attempting to control the influx of journalists into the country, Colvin and Conroy were refused travel visas, and so, on February 13, they illegally crossed the Syrian\/Lebanon border, heading to Baba Amr. Once there, they soon learned that Assad's claim that no civilians were in harm's way was a lie \u2013 over 28,000 civilians were trapped in the district. Based out of a \"media centre\" (basically, one of the few houses in the area which still had wi-fi), Colvin, Conroy, _TIME_'s William Daniels, and _Le Figaro_'s Edith Bouvier, and her photographer R\u00e9mi Ochlik, immediately began to file copy, as the city was shelled incessantly around them. As the shelling became more intense, and with rumours spreading of a ground assault, the _Sunday Times_' editor, Sean Ryan, told Colvin and Conroy to get out of the area. They did so, but the next day, when the ground assault never happened, feeling they had abandoned the people in the district, they both returned. On the evening of February 21, Colvin was interviewed live by CNN's Anderson Cooper, whom she told the shelling was the worst she had ever experienced, explaining\r\n\r\n> _there's nowhere to run. The Syrian Army is holding the perimeter, and there's just far more ordinance being poured into the city, with no way of predicting where it's going to land._\r\n\r\nThe following morning, the media centre in which the reporters were based was shelled, with both Colvin and Ochlik killed, and Conroy and Bouvier seriously injured.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting thing about the film is that the above summary only takes us to just after the half-way point. At this stage, I was thinking, \"okay, so I guess the rest is going to be obituary-type material\". However, that's not where it goes at all. With Colvin dead, the narrative shifts focus to Conroy, and the film basically turns into an escape thriller, as the wounded photographer seems to have little hope of making it out of the country alive (nor does the even more severely wounded Bouvier). Obviously both did, as they both give interviews in the film, but even though we know this, the fact that it doesn't dilute the heart-in-the-mouth experience of the second half of the narrative is a testament to Christopher Martin's craft and storytelling ability.\r\n\r\nFor example, the film opens with a purposely disorientating shot that appears to be inside a tunnel of some kind. We later learn that it is the 3km storm drain which Colvin and Conroy used to get into Syria. However, what's especially well-thought-out about this opening is that that storm-drain proves vitally important towards the end too. This is basic narrative foreshadowing, but it's relatively unusual to see it in a documentary. Similarly, the fact that everyone in the audience knows before the film even begins that Colvin dies adds an air of foreboding that, strangely enough, reminded me of Sean Penn's use of a similar(ish) technique in _The Pledge_ (2001). Also vital to this thriller structuring is the time the documentary takes to explain the Syrian Arab Red Crescent incident. No spoilers, but this sequence is one of the best parts of the film, providing perhaps the biggest twist in the story, and highlighting how one can find heroes (and villains) in the most unexpected of places.\r\n\r\n_Under the Wire_ is not especially interested in contextualising the events it depicts (I've given more background on the conflict in the above couple of paragraphs than the film does), but that's because this isn't what the story is about; this is not an examination of the politics or morality of the Syrian Civil War. For example, although it explains that Homs was held by rebels, it never specifies who the rebels are or why they are fighting the government. Similarly, it never covers the theory, held by both the _Sunday Times_ and the French government, that Colvin and Ochlik's deaths were in fact executions \u2013 that the media centre was shelled on purpose to silence the reporters stationed there; nor does it examine the fact that after their deaths, the Syrian government tried to claim the explosion which killed them was actually a rebel bomb.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this isn't a standard bio-doc \u2013 we don't get all the beats from Colvin's life, why she became a journalist, famous stories she'd written etc (there are brief references to the East Timorese and Sri Lankan incidents, but nothing else). In that sense, this is a very different animal than something like Brian Oakes's _Jim: The James Foley Story_ (2016), which focuses very much on Foley's bio. Having said that, however, the documentary does make sure to drive home how driven, and oftentimes difficult, Colvin could be (Conroy refers to her as \"_a one off_\" and Ryan says she was \"_the most important war correspondent of her generation_\"). This is accomplished primarily by way of two stories \u2013 one in which a photographer assigned to her told his editor that she was scarier than the war they were covering, and another in which she refused to work with a photographer who identified as a metrosexual. She was a brilliant woman. No one said she was an easy woman.\r\n\r\nApart from the thriller structure and the streamlined, non-contextualised narrative, another aspect of the story which gets a lot of attention, and which is also very well done, is the issue of reporters losing their objectivity in situations like the one in Baba Amr. Early on, Conroy relates how, as journalists, they should never allow themselves to become partisan. However, as the narrative goes on, this objectivity goes out the window, and for good reason. How does one remain objective when reporting on Dr. Mohammad Mohammad, a surgeon operating without sterile equipment or anaesthetic because had he left the basement in which he was working so as to obtain supplies, he would have been shot by snipers? How does one remain objective when reporting the story of a child injured in the shelling, dying on a table because there is no equipment to perform the operation needed to save his life? Or when reporting that he was so badly disfigured that the elderly woman acting as a nurse didn't even recognise him as her own grandchild at first and subsequently had to stand by and watch him die in front of her. According to Conroy,\r\n\r\n> _I felt rage and I knew that, for Marie, this was her story and she was going to go for it whatever the cost. She decided to do as many broadcasts as possible as a plea to the world._\r\n\r\nIn her final broadcast, Cooper asked Colvin why she was staying and how was she able to cover such incidents, to which she answered,\r\n\r\n> _I feel very strongly that they should be shown. That's the reality. That little baby probably will move more people to think 'Why is no-one stopping this murder that is happening every day?' Every civilian house on this street has been hit. There are no military targets here; the Syrian army is simply shelling a city of cold, starving civilians._\r\n\r\nSpeaking retrospectively, Conroy relates, \"_it wasn't war, it was slaughter._\" This is not journalistic objectivity. Nor should it be. Conroy knows that, in an ideal world, they should remain always non-partisan, but he is equally as aware that this is impossible in the face of the indiscriminate slaughter of defenceless civilians, and neither he nor the documentary make any apologies for that.\r\n\r\nObviously, as the author of the book on which the film is based, Conroy anchors proceedings. Indeed, there are only a few additional interviewees (Bouvier, Ryan, Daniels, their Syrian translator Wa'el, and Colvin's colleague and friend Lindsey Hilsum). Passionate, funny, and full of nervous ticks, Conroy's talking-head material contrasts well with the terrifying footage he himself shot in Syria, and raises significant questions regarding why Assad has been allowed to remain in power, whilst also forcing the audience to consider our own attitude to the Syrian refugee crisis (try watching an elderly man and woman hobble away from the ruins of the home they have lived in all their lives, their few remaining possessions strapped to their backs, and remain detached as to the plight of these people). Conroy is also deeply emotional regarding his experiences, and one of the most moving parts of the documentary is when he views footage of a mass protest in Homs on the evening of February 22, with the people carrying banners and flags emblazoned with pictures of Colvin and Ochlik, alongside the words \"_We will not forget you_\". Conroy was unaware this had happened at the time, and had never seen footage of it before filming his interview. It's simply impossible not to be deeply moved by his reaction to the footage.\r\n\r\nAnd that, in a nutshell, is why this is such a strong piece of work. Equal parts emotive, stimulating, anger-inducing, and thrilling, it's a story of bravery and professional dedication in the face of unimaginable horrors, of determined humanitarianism, and absolutely impossible-to-deter dedication to giving a voice to those who so often remain voiceless.","id":"5ceb1edd92514175e8bc2ffe","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ceb1edd92514175e8bc2ffe","movie_id":524006}

Except really, really, really awful_**\r\n\r\n>_I got sent the script for_ Under The Silver Lake _and it was as mind-bending in word, as it was, in deed, as it were. It was 160-odd pages, which is about 30 or 40 pages more than the usual script, and it was like as if Sean Astin's character, Mikey, from_ The Goonies _is far too old to still be going on adventures, but he still wants to. But now he's in a David Lynch film that's set in a Los Angeles that's like the antithesis of the_ La La Land _Los Angeles. The deep, dark underbelly of L.A. And I read it and I just th__ought, this is totally marvellous and totally unique, and it's very, very rare that you get a unique piece of cinema in this day and age. I thought, well, I love_ The Goonies_, and I love David Lynch, and I love Los Angeles._\r\n\r\n>_Also I loved it because it was quite skewering of Hollywood and a kind of patriarchal abusive system. I think Sam sees himself as a Travis Bickle. He sees himself as this liberator, he's fully deluded in this self-assessment. He sees himself as this vigilante liberator of the divine, sacred feminine in Hollywood. But actually he has a tendency to perpetuate the same abuse in an unconscious way perhaps. I just found it really, really interesting, and it's a mystery, within a mystery, within a mystery, and there's no getting to the centre of it. I think that's maybe the point - we're on a constant quest towards the centre of things. And perhaps that's enough, just being on the quest is enough._\r\n\r\n- Andrew Garfield; \"Andrew Garfield Interview: _Under the Silver Lake_, Pop Culture Obsessions, and Spider-Verse\" (Ben Travis); _Empire_ (March 19, 2019)\r\n\r\nIn 2001, an unknown 26-year-old filmmaker named Richard Kelly released a film called _Donnie Darko_. Filmed on a tight budget over a few weeks, it made little impact at the box-office, but was critically championed as heralding a genuinely unique and exciting voice in genre filmmaking. The following year, the film was released on VHS and DVD, earning twice as much as it did at the cinema, and giving Kelly virtual _carte blanche_ for his next project. In 2006, that hotly-anticipated project was premi\u00e8red in a rough-cut form at Cannes. The 160-minute _Southland Tales_ was savaged by critics, and went through multiple re-edits before a 144-minute version was released theatrically in North America in 2007. Grossing less than $1 million against a $7 million budget, the film was released straight-to-DVD in most international territories. Kelly's career has yet to recover, and he has made only one film since. In 2014, David Robert Mitchell released his second feature, _It Follows_, which he shot on a tight budget over a few weeks. A box office and critical success, the film was championed as heralding a genuinely unique and exciting voice in genre filmmaking, giving Mitchell virtual _carte blanche_ for his next project. In 2018, that hotly-anticipated project was premi\u00e8red at Cannes, where it was savaged by critics.\r\n\r\nOkay, the analogy isn't perfect \u2013 _Southland Tales_ was Kelly's second film, whereas _Under the Silver Lake_ is Mitchell's third; _It Follows_ was nowhere near as good or as celebrated as _Donnie Darko_; and _Under the Silver Lake_ isn't quite as bad as _Southland Tales_, nor have the negative reviews from Cannes been quite as damning or universal. However, the sequence of events is undeniably similar - a young filmmaker riding high on an unexpected success dusts off an ambitious older project he had been unable to make at the time, and is given far too much autonomy and leeway, resulting in a pretentious, self-indulgent, convoluted, overlong mess. It's like no one has learnt from the hubris of Michael Cimino!\r\n\r\nPositioning itself as equal parts neo-noir and genre subversion, _Under the Silver Lake_ is essentially a cross between David Lynch's _Mulholland Drive_ (2001) and Thomas Pynchon's _Inherent Vice_ (2009). With the major difference being that it's absolutely, unrelentingly terrible. As with Mitchell's previous films, _Silver Lake_ works as both an example and a subversion of genre - _The Myth of the American Sleepover_ (2010) was a homage to films such as Peter Bogdanovich's _The Last Picture Show_ (1971), George Lucas's _American Graffiti_ (1973) and the work of John Hughes, whilst also deconstructing the coming-of-age subgenre; and _It Follows_ recalls films such as William Friedkin's _The Exorcist_ (1973), Wes Craven's _A Nightmare on Elm Street_ (1984) and the work of John Carpenter, whilst also satirising the tropes of such films. _Silver Lake_ is no different - a mystery noir \u00e0 la Robert Aldrich's _Kiss Me Deadly_ (1955), Robert Altman's _The Long Goodbye_ (1973), and Roman Pola\u0144ski's _Chinatown_ (1974), the film is also at pains to undermine and critique many of the generic markers found in such films. A 140-minute labyrinthine, paranoia-laden shaggy-dog story full of MacGuffins, false leads, narrative dead ends, and unexplained details, the film relocates the detective stories of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett to the chaotic postmodern era of cognitive semiotics where the relationship between signifier and signified is now so arbitrary that meaning-making itself has become a protean commodity. However, it is easily the most self-important piece of garbage I've seen in a long time; a philosophically juvenile rumination thoroughly convinced of its own portentousness. Fundamentally misogynistic (it's not misogyny, apparently, because Mitchell is being super-ironic when he presents no less than six female characters as literal sex toys for the protagonist), it's at least 45 minutes too long, with an unfocused narrative, poorly thought-out metaphors, an insipid protagonist, about 377 themes, and a laughable screenplay. The cinematography is pretty though.\r\n\r\nSet in contemporary LA, _Under the Silver Lake_ follows Sam (Andrew Garfield), a 33-year-old man-child with no job, no ambition, and no direction, whose day consists of sitting on his balcony watching his neighbour (Wendy Vanden Heuvel) parade around topless, having unfulfilling NSA sex with a friend-with-benefits (Riki Lindhome), and visiting his drinking buddy (Topher Grace) to use a drone to spy on women (it should tell you a bunch about the film that none of these three characters are even assigned a name). Out of the blue, he meets and instantly falls in love with Sarah (an admittedly radiant Riley Keough), but when he visits her apartment the day after meeting her, he finds her gone and the apartment empty, apart from a shoebox with a photograph and a few trinkets, and a strange symbol painted on the wall. Although he later identifies Sarah as one of three women killed in a car crash alongside billionaire media mogul (and professional stuntman) Jefferson Sevence (Chris Gann), having recognised a hat found at the scene to be hers, he refuses to believe she's dead. And so begins an odyssey to track her down that ultimately involves, amongst other things, a parrot who keeps repeating the same meaningless phrase, a hipster pirate, secret codes hidden in everyday objects such as statues, song lyrics, _Nintendo Power_ magazines, and cereal boxes, a glam rock band named Jesus and the Brides of Dracula, the July 1970 issue of _Playboy_, a dog murderer, a conspiracy theorist comic book writer (Patrick Fischler), the Hobo Code, a vast network of underground tunnels, an actual literal homeless king (David Yow), a helpful coyote, an unhelpful skunk, an escort agency staffed by former child-stars, a balloon dancer (Grace Van Patten), a walled-off Xanadu-like mansion, a mysterious songwriter (Jeremy Bobb) with a strange claim, a female serial killer who enters men's apartments wearing nothing but an owl mask, and a New Age cult lead by super-wealthy men.\r\n\r\nAnd if this makes it sound convoluted, unwieldly, and overly plotted, believe me, you don't know the half of it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most immediately obvious aspects of _Silver Lake_ is the sheer range of homages that Mitchell includes at both plot and formal levels. Some of these homages are impressively handled, some not so much. The music by Rich Vreeland, for example, and the cinematography by Mike Gioulakis are both extremely retro, serving to situate the film firmly in the formal styles of yesterday. Vreeland's score (although I didn't like it in and of itself) is a solid imitation of the work of composers such as Franz Waxman (_Sunset Boulevard_; _A Place in the Sun_; _Rear Window_) and Bernard Herrmann (_Citizen Kane_; _Vertigo_; _Psycho_), whilst Gioulakis's photography, with its overly dramatic camera movements and crash zooms that seem to come out of nowhere, recalls the work of Robert Burks (_Rear Window_; _To Catch a Thief_; _Vertigo_) and Sam Leavitt (_The Defiant Ones_; _Anatomy of a Murder_; _Cape Fear_).\r\n\r\nMost of the other homages come at plot level, and although some are well integrated into the narrative, many feel shoehorned in, as if Mitchell is showing off his range of reference, so much so that the film essentially becomes pastiche. Examples include Sam's mother's obsession with Janet Gaynor, particularly Frank Borzage's _7th Heaven_ (1927); Sam sitting on his balcony using binoculars to spy on people, \u00e1 la L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart) in Alfred Hitchcock's _Rear Window_ (1954); Sam's fascination with Don Ornitz's picture of Janet Wolf from the cover of the July 1970 issue of _Playboy_; a Nirvana poster above Sam's bed; Sam and Sarah watching Jean Negulesco's _How to Marry a Millionaire_ (1953); a brief glimpse of an _Amazing Spider-Man_ comic (intertextual and self-reflexive, given Garfield's appearance as the titular character in two films); a visual quotation of Marilyn Monroe in a swimming pool from George Cukor's unfinished _Something's Got to Give_ (1962); the Brides of Dracula doing a cover of Lulu's \"To Sir with Love\" (1967) from James Clavell's film of the same name; R.E.M.'s \"Strange Currencies\" (1994) playing at a party; a visit to Griffith Observatory from Nicholas Ray's _Rebel Without a Cause_ (1955); references to the original _Legend of Zelda_ (1986); a very on-the-nose shot of a gravestone with the word \"Hitchcock\" on it; and a scene that references songs as varied as The Arrows' \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\" (1975), Gary Portnoy's \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name\" (1982) from the TV show _Cheers_, Foreigner's \"I Want to Know What Love Is\" (1984), Harold Faltermeyer's \"Axel F\" (1985) from the film _Beverly Hills Cop_, Pixies' \"Where is my Mind?\" (1988), Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" (1991), and Backstreet Boys' \"I Want it That Way\" (1999). The most consistent referential touchstone, however, is David Lynch, particularly _Mulholland Drive_, an infinitely superior mystery thriller also set in the darker environs of LA involving a sprawling cast of strange characters.\r\n\r\nThematically, the film is all over the place, never settling on any one issue (or even a few issues), instead jumping around like a hyperactive puppy trying to be in eight different places at once. Characters say things such as \"_who isn't being followed these days?_\" and \"_the ideology you thought you adopted through free will was actually subliminal messaging_\", but it's all meaningless in a narrative chaos where nothing is ever examined for more than a couple of minutes before the film leaps onto something new. Positing that pop culture has profound hidden meaning (in direct contrast to most cultural-anthropological thinking), the film is so imprecise and scattered that it's impossible to tell if Mitchell actually buys into the notion that schizophrenic conspiracies are all around us or if he's being facetious.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I understand what he's doing here - presenting the film from the point of view of a pop culture-saturated Millennial who's easily distracted and hence keeps losing the run of his own story. However, just because it's apparent what the director is trying to do doesn't mean he has succeeded. Oliver Stone did a far better job of depicting a similarly media-soaked shortened-attention span over 20 years ago with _Natural Born Killers_ (1994). Easily the most interesting issue touched on is the concept that much of what has defined generations and been the artistic impetus behind and symbol of cultural revolutions throughout the 20th century all comes from the same corrupted and cynical place; the music that has most embodied rebellion and freedom is actually even more manufactured than the worst boy band could ever be. This is a fascinating and fundamentally postmodernist way of thinking, but mere moments after introducing it, Mitchell abandons the theme entirely in favour of a piece of absolutely gratuitous violence which says nothing of interest about anything.\r\n\r\nThe most troubling thing about the film from a thematic point of view, however, is how it depicts women. Yes, it's partly about the male gaze and how Hollywood has a track record of objectifying women, especially in films of this nature, so a degree of objectification is necessary. But Mitchell does it to the point where critique simply becomes content - he doesn't need six women (only two of whom are even given names, and none of whom receive much in the way of characterisation) to throw themselves at Sam to adequately deconstruct the trope. Granted, his intentions may be noble; he is obviously side-lining the female characters with the goal of satirising male entitlement, but he is unable to distinguish between replication and repudiation. All the best intentions in the world don't alter the fact that the women in the film are wallpaper, and his attempt to critique Hollywood's tendency to depict women as such ends up as simply another example of the very trope he is setting out to critique. So all the unnecessarily topless shots aren't exploitative you see, because irony!! Additionally, it's worth mentioning that Sam doesn't initiate a single sexual encounter; every one of them is initiated by the woman. How does that fit into Mitchell's deconstruction of Hollywood's depiction of men using women, if the women are essentially allowing themselves to be used? If his critique was in any way consistent, Sam would be seducing them, not the other way around, thus allowing Mitchell to directly engage with the notion that men look at women as playthings. It's a facile attempt to critique a theme that cries out this is a filmmaker attempting something that he simply doesn't have the requisite ability to pull off.\r\n\r\nAnd if only these thematic issues were the film's only problems, it mightn't be so bad. Unfortunately, there is so, so much else wrong here. This is a (supposed) satire, yet there is practically no humour. There are a couple of funny scenes (such as when Sam beats up two children for egging his car), but they are few and far between. Additionally, Mitchell completely fails to make us care about Sam or his quest to find Sarah; there is no emotional connection whatsoever. As for the quest itself, it soon becomes obvious that we're following Sam down a rabbit-hole which Mitchell has filled to the brim with pointless digressions, meaningless distractions, and derivative clich\u00e9s. Whereas in _Mulholland Drive_, Lynch creates a beautiful and complex tapestry where everything has precise meaning, with no wasted motion, no weirdness simply for weirdness sake, in _Silver Lake_, Mitchell just lobs anything and everything at the viewer whether it's ultimately significant or not. A pirate? Sure. A female serial killer? Why not. A dog murderer? Of course. A story that makes sense and deals with its themes coherently? Don't be ridiculous. It's like the worst type of student film where the filmmaker has been allowed to shoot whatever he wants, and ends up making something so convoluted that any meaning it may have becomes subsumed amongst self-important pretension. And the more needlessly complex and bloated the plot becomes, the less interesting it is. The whole thing smacks of Mitchell shouting \"_look at me. Look how wacky I am._\"\r\n\r\n_Under the Silver Lake_ is a tiresome, self-important, overlong, intellectually juvenile mess. If Mitchell actually has anything to say about subliminal messaging, the commodification of women, wealth buying privileges even in the afterlife, the pervasiveness of pop culture, or conspiracy theories, it's lost within a painfully dull and self-indulgent plot. With _It Follows_, Mitchell was constricted by a tight budget. With _Silver Lake_, he has been allowed to play relatively unsupervised in the sandbox, and the results are disastrous; a swollen, self-admiring film that can't follow through on anything, thematically or narratively, a film that is totally and completely in love with itself.","id":"5d4a09b1439be100149075df","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d4a09b1439be100149075df","movie_id":396461}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Divisive Dilemas.\r\n\r\nHave to be honest, I had no idea this was filmed on an iPhone 7 or that it was directed by Steven Soderbergh. I was stuck for something to watch on cable the other night and I liked the sound of the plot premise. So unburdened by expectation of a searing horror classic I settled in to see what unfolds.\r\n\r\nPlot has Claire Foy as Sawyer Valentini who inadvertently commits herself to a mental health institution. Once inside things being to unravel and the threat of her one time stalker now being even close to her opens up the book of terror - but is it real?\r\n\r\nFirstly you have to say that the mental health authorities must have had kittens when they saw this, much of what is on screen is utterly ridiculous and paints the system in a damning light. Secondly you really have to jump on board with the improbability of it all, this really is made for dramatic entertainment purpose and not as a viable horror of the real world.\r\n\r\nAs a thriller it worked for me, the constant question of what is real or not keeps things on the slow burn. Either way, real or not, it's thought provoking enough to warrant staying till pics end. The psychological angle is pungent enough to say there's some thought in the writing, though this is undone by utter nonsense as things spiral into the impossible for the final quarter of film.\r\n\r\nFoy is good value up front and the fulcrum of it all, while elsewhere good work comes from Nate Hoffman and it's nice to see Juno Temple in a spicy role. Ultimately this is no blood letting horror picture, and certainly it's no One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Girl Interrupted etc etc. \r\n\r\nThe iPhone experiment is a gimmick that works here due to the confines of the location for story, but as a genre piece of worth it is unlikely to have legs. However, even though I enjoyed this as a one time only viewing experience, I perfectly understand why it has become divisive. So for those who haven't seen it yet then it is advised you understand this is no terrifying thrill a minute piece. It's tricky to recommend with any sort of confidence, and thus I feel the internet ratings of about 6.5\/10 is just about right. 6.5\/10","id":"5c9b6c88c3a368349f39a12d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c9b6c88c3a368349f39a12d","movie_id":467660}

{"author":"trineo03","content":"First of all, I love the animation style in this film. The animation in this film is styled to look like an actual comic book. I think this approach for this kind of film was an excellent choice because we\u2019ve all seen the usual kind of animation but nothing like this. To tie in with the animation I need to talk about the action scenes in this film. These tie in with the animation because of the way the directors styled the action shots is to look like something in a comic panel. Most people don\u2019t know who Miles Morales is and after this film, you\u2019ll want to learn more about him because of how they made him so relatable in this film. He acts like a typical teen in this situation compared to other versions of Spider-Man. Other versions kind of just acted like they always knew how to use their powers when Miles struggles with his. Miles isn\u2019t the only relatable character film all of them are. The creators of this film did a \u201cMarvel\u201dous job at making each character in this film somebody at least one person in the audience can relate to. All of the voice actors did a great job in their respected roles but it would\u2019ve been nice to have a returning voice to at least one of the Spider-Man. It would\u2019ve been cool to hear a returning voice even if it was for a few seconds. I have to talk about the humour in this film. It isn\u2019t overpowered in this film and I felt like it had just the right amount of humour that will make everybody laugh. They poke fun of things that wouldn\u2019t make sense in a real movie and other Spider-Man movies. Not a single moment in this film felt rushed or slowed down every scene felt the right pace for a movie like this. The cinematography in this movie was spectacular. This is probably because of it looking like a comic book and how the lighting needs to match up with how it would look in an actual book. If you are a comic book junkie you\u2019ll love all of the easter eggs in this film. Some of them just comic book readers will get but others a majority of people will understand. The music in this film is fantastic. Every song in this film isn\u2019t overused and matches perfectly with the age of the character. Somebody Miles age would be listening to the type of music he listens to. And the music without lyrics helps increase the emotion in the film. Also, there are two end credit scenes that are worth waiting for. In the end, this film is perfect for everybody.

{"author":"TomTag","content":"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) is no ordinary Spider-Man movie, it contains multiple characters with the same powers in multiple dimensions.\r\n This is also not an ordinary animated movie. It has animated style we have never seen before. There were 177 animators and it took 1 week to animate 1 second and 1 year to nail down 10 seconds. Nowadays, animations are being made to look real but this movie was different. However, the creators wanted it to look like something new for viewers. They don't make it realistic or cartoon. The creators used an old-school technique called \"smear\". If you look in a single frame, you'll notice things like multiple limbs to create the illusion of movement. Basically, the entire movie was a comic book that moves. There is a technique in half-toning, which uses dots to create colors and gradients. They were really jaw-dropping. The shadows were created with hatching or crisscrossed lines. The movie had some textures so it would be exactly like a comic and I was glad that it deserved Oscars's Best Animated Feature. All of these techniques combined to make a movie that was the best animated feature not just in 2018 but perhaps of all time. It was really like a masterpiece of animation!\r\n The story plot was really good. The scenes were quite EPIC and sometimes tragic and hilarious. The unbelievable thing was when Peter Parker died in Miles' Dimension. It was really sad to see an iconic superhero killed by a supervillain. The deaths are moving and the hilarious scenes kept me laugh a lot. I like the end-credits when it started in the Animated Tv Show Spider-Man (1966) when the two Spider-Men look exactly like each other arguing, but this time, it was Spider-Man pointing to Spider-Man 2099. How did they do that? Perhaps the best moment to me was \u201cA Leap of Faith\u201d when Miles tried to be the one and only Spider-Man in his dimension, after Peter Parker was dead.\r\nI wasn't bored watching this movie, it kept my eyes open on the screen looking at the newest kind of animation. I was totally impressed! Perhaps this is the greatest animated movie of alll time! It was a really good idea to release this on Christmas!","id":"5cd04fcdc3a3684fbcdea3dd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cd04fcdc3a3684fbcdea3dd","movie_id":324857}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"_**Irreverent, dynamic, and portentous; the picture it paints of the increasingly indistinguishable divide between celebrity and notoriety isn't pretty though**_\r\n\r\n> **Bill O'Reilly**: _You can take some of your lyrics, such as, \"You'll understand when I'm dead.\" I mean, disturbed kids could take the lyrics and say, \"you know, when I'm dead, everybody's going to know me.\"_\r\n> \r\n> **Marilyn Manson**: _Well, I think that's a very valid point, and I think that that's a reflection of, not necessarily this program, but of television in general - if you die and enough people are watching, then you_ _become a martyr, you become a hero, you become well-known. So when you have things like Columbine and you have these kids that are angry and they have something to say and no one's listening, the media sends a message that if you do something loud enough and it gets our attention, then you will be famous for it. Those kids ended up on the cover of_ Time _magazine twice. The media gave them exactly what they wanted._\r\n\r\n- Marilyn Manson speaking with Bill O'Reilly; _The O'Reilly Factor_ (August 20, 2001)\r\n\r\n> _The movie's inspired by Apple News updates, and the way that you have four or five top stories; basically, at any given time, there's usually some coverage of a mass murder and maybe something about Ariana Grande having cut off her ponytail. In 20 or 30 years, when we're at the mid-century mark and we have a little perspective, what are the events that we will identify as having defined this time? I do think that there's been a major shift in the culture since Columbine and 9\/11, and now we've had an even greater tectonic shift with this new administration. When people look back, they remember Britney Spears along with 9\/11. Popular music is just a way of talking about the popular culture._\r\n\r\n- Brady Corbet; \"Vox Lux's Brady Corbet on Making One of the Most Polarising Movies of the Year\" (Charles Bramesco); _Vulture_ (December 7, 2018)\r\n\r\nA story about popular art born amidst violent trauma. A thriller about the remorseless and cannibalistic machinations of fame. An allegory for the calcification of celebrity-obsessed American society. A study of the interactions between pop culture and global terrorism. A _bildungsroman_ about the possible consequences of a troubled childhood. A dark fairy tale about the music industry. A threnody for a pre-Columbine and 9\/11 world. The bold, wildly ambitious _Vox Lux_ is all of these. And more. Written by former actor Brady Corbet and his partner Mona Fastvold, and directed by Corbet, the film takes the basic _A Star is Born_ template, and gives it an angry and bitter 21st-century makeover, mercilessly torpedoing Bradley Cooper's whimsical paean to Old Hollywood romanticism into neon-soaked glitter-adorned oblivion. As a director, Corbet exploded onto the scene in 2015 with the sensational, out-of-nowhere _The Childhood of a Leader_, a visually stunning examination of the birth of 20th-century fascism from 19th-century aristocracy. And although _Vox Lux_, a film about a contemporary pop star, seems to have no thematic connection to _Childhood_, there are marked similarities between the two films - they both examine troubled formative childhood years intertwined with global tragedy that ultimately produce less than admirable adults; they both use the specifics of a small group of people to synecdochally engage with larger socio-political issues; they both unapologetically indict a culture in its death throes; they are both fundamentally built on asking questions without providing answers; neither is especially interested in conventional psychology or character arcs. There are a couple of problems (the film could be accused of relying too heavily on voiceover; it strays into clich\u00e9 on occasion; it's front-loaded, with the best scenes happening in the first act; it walks a very fine line between portentousness and pretentiousness), but all things considered, this is another superb film from a director who, at only 30, is already a unique and exciting cinematic voice.\r\n\r\nDivided into four parts (\"Prelude - 1999\"; \"Act I: Genesis - 2000-2001\"; \"Act II: Regenesis - 2017\"; and \"Finale - XXI\") the story begins on Staten Island in 1999, with a student opening fire in his school. 13-year-old Celeste Montgomery (Raffey Cassidy) tries to talk him down, but is shot in the throat. Although she survives, the bullet is lodged in such a way as to make it impossible to remove, and thus she will be in permanent pain for the rest of her life. Several months later, at a memorial service for the slain students, Celeste sings a song written by herself and her elder sister Eleanor (Stacy Martin). The performance goes viral, and draws the attention of a talented, if not entirely scrupulous, manager (Jude Law), with Celeste suddenly finding herself on the fast track to global superstardom. With Act I concluding with 9\/11, the film then jumps to Croatia in 2017, as a terrorist group open fire on a beach. Wearing masks similar to those worn in one of her first music videos, the bad publicity comes as the now adult Celeste (Natalie Portman), a neurotic, self-obsessed, and barely functioning alcoholic, is putting the finishing touches to a new album and preparing for a massive concert and tour. Her mood isn't helped by her fraught relationships with her own teenage daughter Albertine (also played by Cassidy), her manager, her publicist Josie (Jennifer Ehle), and Eleanor, who has basically raised Albertine. When asked by a reporter (Christopher Abbott) about the terrorist attack in Croatia, Celeste makes an offhand comment that seems to invite an attack at her show later that night, sending her behind-the-scenes people into a tailspin as they try to decide whether to go ahead with the concert.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, as one would expect from the director of _Childhood_, there's all manner of things to be fascinated by in _Vox Lux_. The film's temporal structure, for example; whereas the Prelude and Act I cover about two years, followed by a 16-year gap, Act II and the Finale take place over the course of roughly eight hours. There's also the voiceover (provided by Willem Dafoe). The existential, adjective-heavy, and almost \"_once upon a time_\"-like quality to the narration is the very definition of purple prose, but it works magnificently in context. For example, the film begins with,\r\n\r\n> _Celeste was born in America in 1986. Considering her parents' background, education, and socioeconomic status, being somewhat on the losing side of Reaganomics, the name of Latin origin seemed an especially poetic choice. It carved her out some predetermined destination, a route by which to travel. But many years before \"Celeste\" rolled off the cultural tongue like a principled anecdote one senses they were born knowing, she might not have been described as all that special or conspicuously talented. However, she did possess that proverbial \"something,\" which on occasion captured the attention of her teachers and young peers._\r\n\r\nThe narration does have an important thematic purpose, however, serving as a kind of omniscient chorus on events, with Dafoe describing it as \"_an important tonal element and framing device. It's a kind of go-between with the audience_\". Also aesthetically important is the music. The unashamedly over-produced and plastic songs sung by Celeste are all written by Sia (although they're performed by Cassidy and Portman), whilst the score is provided by the legendary Scott Walker, whose music so elevated the grandeur of _Childhood of a Leader_. He's more restrained and contemplative here, but it's still an exceptionally important component of the film, and represents the last piece of original work before his untimely death earlier this year.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the acting, there's no weak link. Tapping into some of the same energy she possessed in Darren Aronofsky's _Black Swan_ (2010) and some of the same nuance she showed in Pablo Larra\u00edn's _Jackie_ (2016), Portman plays adult Celeste as suitably frazzled. Holding nothing back, her histrionic but always authentic depiction of a woman on the edge of a total breakdown is mesmerising to watch, whilst a concert sequence is as bravura a piece of acting as anything from _Black Swan_. In the dual role of young Celeste and Albertine, Cassidy does enough to differentiate the parts, but not so much as for the roles to seemingly have no connection to one another; her Celeste is all overwhelmed and innocent, struggling to maintain control, whilst her Albertine is stoic and world-weary, mature before her years. Jude Law's unnamed manager is just sleazy enough to be disreputable but just honest enough to be likeable, whilst Jennifer Ehle's Josie is wonderfully _haute_, permanently looking down on pretty much everyone around her, Law in particular.\r\n\r\nThematically, the film's most salient concern is a cynical deconstruction of celebrity and fame, specifically the 21st-century post-reality TV incarnation of such (there's a reason the closing credits give the film the subtitle, \"_A Twenty-First Century Portrait_\"). In an era whereby one can become famous for virtually anything, the film is painfully of its time, saying as much about celebrities and the machinery of fame as it does about celebrity-obsessed culture. Important in this is that there's no real attempt to make adult Celeste likeable or sympathetic. Sure, she's very much a product of her time, and she's been forced to live her entire life within the parameters of what happened when she was 13. But she's also emblematic of some of the worst components of her time, and Corbet is unconcerned whether the audience empathises with her; his critique of celebrity works just as well if we despise her and all she represents.\r\n\r\nOf course, much of the film's biting satire is tied into the plot itself, with Celeste building a career based off a massacre; gun violence used to sell records (a nice visual representation of this is that Celeste turns the neck scarf she has to wear post-shooting into a glittery accessorised part of her brand). She is literally the beneficiary of tragedy in a world where mass shootings have become so commonplace that they can serve as launch-pads for musical careers. Indeed, Corbet is one of very few American directors operating at the moment who is too young to have really known a world in which such incidents weren't an accepted part of the cultural fabric (he was 11 when Columbine happened), and this feeds into the film's DNA. Although the shooting with which the film opens is fictional, it is obviously based on Columbine (both occur in 1999), whilst the shooting in Croatia seems derived from the 2015 massacre at Port El Kantaoui. And obviously, 9\/11 looms large, forming the closing punctuation to Act I, with Corbet able to use the transition to subtly suggest that post-9\/11 everything has fundamentally changed.\r\n\r\nCeleste herself articulates an important element of the connection between pop culture and mass murder when she says, \"_nihilist radical groups perceived as superstars. If everyone stopped talking about them, they'd disappear_\", which is very reminiscent of the main theme in Oliver Stone's _Natural Born Killers_ (1994), and which is an even more pertinent sentiment today than it was in 1994. By way of illustration, think about how most people know the names of the Columbine shooters, or the 2012 Aurora shooter, or the 2017 Las Vegas shooter, or, to get away from the US, the 2011 Ut\u00f8ya shooter. Now think about how many victims from any of those tragedies you can name off the top of your head. People know the names of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold; very few know the names of William \"Dave\" Sanders, Jon Curtis, or Jay Gallentine, the Columbine teacher and two janitors who saved over 100 students, at the cost of Sanders's life. _Vox Lux_ doesn't provide any answers to the question of the crossover between pop culture and terrorism - how one might lead to the other, or how both provide opportunities for fame - but that's because there _are_ no easy answers. It's simply the way things are, and Corbet's cynicism emphasises that just because this is the way things are, doesn't mean this is the way they should be. And the irony at the heart of the film is that in 1999, a mass shooting shaped Celeste, but in 2017, Celeste shaped a mass shooting. This is the nightmare of the 21st-century celebrity wheel of time, and it's brilliantly, if distressingly, presented.\r\n\r\nThere are more grounded engagements with celebrity as well. An early scene, for example, sees Celeste proudly declare that she's \"_in command of [her] own destiny_\", followed immediately by a scene of her vomiting into a toilet after drinking too much. In another scene, Corbet brilliantly nails the drudgery of press junkets that every celebrity seems to despise, with Celeste trying to talk about her album, but all any of the journalists want to talk about is the shooting in Croatia. Another aspect of this, and something the film has in common with Cooper's _A Star is Born_, is that as time goes on, Celeste moves further and further away from her stylistic origin point. Introduced as a good Christian girl into folk music and gentle ballads, when we meet her as an adult, she's an autotuned, silicon amalgamation of Madonna, Katy Perry, and Lady Gaga, with her music just one step above boy band quality (as she herself says, \"_I don't want people to have to think too hard. I just want them to feel good_\"). However, she's also wildly popular, and her music clearly does make people feel good, even if it says precisely nothing of interest or note (which is, of course, ironic considering that her breakthrough came with a song that spoke volumes to the entire world, giving voice to unspoken collective grief).\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, there are a few. Obviously, any film with such lofty aims as mapping the ideological decline of 21st culture onto the rise and fall and rise of a pop star is setting itself a huge task, and at times Corbet's ambitions exceed his reach. Parts of the adult Celeste portion of the film definitely stray into melodrama, and the fact that the first act is so good does make the second seem a little prosaic in comparison (although the Finale is mesmerising). The ambiguity of the first act, which is unclear if Celeste's rise to fame is redemptive or an extension of the evil unleashed in the shooting, gives way in the second to the far more mundane (and clich\u00e9d) study of a harried celebrity, and although the totality is satisfying, I couldn't shake the feeling that the first act seemed to be setting up for something upon which the second fails to deliver. The tone of the film is also ice-cold, and in tandem with its sardonic attitude, could rub some people the wrong way.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this is a vicious, deeply cynical, deeply sardonic, and deeply ironic dissection of contemporary culture and the forces that drive it. However, finding much to criticise in the millennial pop landscape, Corbet is never nihilistic, mainly because Celeste may have lost her soul, but she is still able to make millions of people happy, even if only transitorily. Both a victim of her time and its desensitised apotheosis, through her, much as he did through Prescott in _Childhood_ of a Leader, Corbet explores questions relating to the interaction between the private and the public. Where are we as a society? What does our obsession with celebrity say about us? What is the cost of fame? Is there any real difference between fame and notoriety? _Vox Lux_ asks such questions, but does not provide answers. That's not Corbet's remit; he merely holds up the looking glass. What we see in it is entirely up to each of us.","id":"5d69c0be0929f6001544ba7d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d69c0be0929f6001544ba7d","movie_id":429202}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Well, if you are a fan of The Rock this is a decent enough high octane action, disaster and special effects movie. If not, well then you probably have to be a pretty big fan of special effects and action to overlook its weak points.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the good stuff. One, it is The Rock (yes I am a fan) although he certainly doesn\u2019t come out at his best in this movie. Personally I could do without the artificial leg crap but it didn\u2019t bother me too much in the end. It didn\u2019t really add anything except some silly (and unrealistic scenes) though.\r\n\r\nThen we have the action and the special effects. They were as good as you would expect from a multi million dollar action movie. At least I enjoyed them. I really liked the design of the Skyscraper. I thought it was booth cool and beautiful. I kind of would like to see it built in real life.\r\n\r\nWas the movie derivative? Well of course it can be said to be derivative! How many movies with burning Skyscrapers and bad guys hi-jacking them can you make before it becomes derivative after all? The first movie named Skyscraper was made in 1928 for Christ sake. It didn\u2019t bother me at all.\r\n\r\nNow for the not so good. The movie was hugely predictable. I mean, you could tell who the bad guys were from the first scene they were in. Especially the rat faced jerk Mr Pierce. The main bad guy? Well, he was no Hans Gruber that\u2019s for sure. More like a common thug. The movie really lacked a bad guy with some charisma. Overall, most of the movie from start to finish was really a no-surprise-there event from the first bad guy entering the scene to the rebooting of the systems.\r\n\r\nThen we have the realism factor. I do not expect an action and special effects movie to be realistic but there are some limits. Sawyer climbing around on the outside of the building (with one leg remember) in the updraft from 50 or so burning levels was just nonsense. Also, a building burning that much and that long and yet all the electrical wiring and plumbing still working was a bit too much. The absolutely worst offence though was how everyone magically survived sitting in the middle of the fire being extinguished by the release of halon gas (or some equivalent). That just brings stupidity (or maybe laziness) in script writing to a whole new level.\r\n\r\nSo, to sum it up, this move could have been a lot better. To me it was saved by The Rock and my love of special effects loaded action movies.","id":"5c161753c3a36866c7375d20","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c161753c3a36866c7375d20","movie_id":447200}

To carry out all these searches, Google's data centre uses 0.01% of worldwide electricity._\r\n\r\n- \"122 Amazing Social Media Statistics and Facts\" (Kit Smith); _BrandWatch_ (January 2, 2019)\r\n\r\n_Searching_ is a film with two main organisational principles; there's the thriller plot, which ostensibly keeps everything moving, and to which everything else should, in theory, be in service. Then there's the aesthetic design, with the entire film taking place online, the images presented taking the form of what is seen on computer screens, iPhones, security cameras etc. One of these principles is exceptionally well handled, the other isn't, and it shouldn't take a genius to guess which is which. If we're being really honest, in fact, the plot becomes more and more incidental as the narrative progresses and ever more ludicrous flights of fancy are introduced, transposing the story from a search for a missing girl into a litany of clich\u00e9s and melodrama. On the other hand, the main reason, indeed probably the only reason any of us saw the film at all is because of its unique visual schema, and thankfully, this aspect is realised with an impressive degree of craft. You know you're in reasonably secure territory when the filmmakers are self-aware enough to begin an online film depicting the latest in consumer technology with the sound of an old dial-up connection.\r\n\r\nWritten by Aneesh Chaganty and Sev Ohanian, and directed by Chaganty, the film begins with a montage of video clips depicting various events in the recent lives of David Kim (John Cho), his wife Pamela (Sara Sohn), and their daughter Margot (Michelle La). The montage covers several years, taking in Margot's childhood, Pamela's diagnosis with cancer, the disease going into remission, her relapse, and, finally, her deterioration and eventual death. This brings us up to roughly the present day, with Margot now a teenager who has drifted apart from her father, although David himself doesn't seem to have noticed. In the early hours of the morning on a night when Margot left the house to attend a study group, she calls David three times, but he is asleep and doesn't hear the phone. Seeing the missed calls the next morning, and realising Margot isn't in the house, he tries to call her back, but her phone is turned off. Assuming she left early to attend a piano lesson, he calls the teacher, but she tells him Margot cancelled the lessons six months prior. Thereafter, he discovers that the money he had been giving her for her lessons was instead being deposited into her bank account, and, several weeks ago, the entirety was transferred to a now deactivated Venmo account. Frantic, David reports her missing, with the case assigned to Det. Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing). However, as David and Vick begin to delve deeper into Margot's life, David is shocked to learn she has no friends at school, and has instead an online existence of which he knew nothing. Meanwhile, every investigative avenue seems to throw up another mystery, and as time passes, it begins to look more and more as if Margot has simply run away. David, however, refuses to believe this, with his wildly vacillating suspicions regarding who may have been behind her disappearance ranging from a friendly YouCast (video blogging site) user, a disrespectful pot-smoking Facebook user, his own brother Peter (Joseph Lee), and everyone in between.\r\n\r\nAlthough the plot has a reasonably strong forward momentum, with a well-judged pace, it comes across as initially insipid, and ultimately rather ridiculous. If this was a standardly shot film, without the unique visual design, no one would be giving it a second glance \u2013 the thriller plot is clich\u00e9d, derivative, and trite, and despite the foolishness into which it descends, it's also fairly predictable (I guessed who the villain was, although not why they were so villainous). In this sense, the film reminds me of something like Robert Montgomery's _Lady in the Lake_ (1946) or Sebastian Schipper's _Victoria_ (2015). Both feature dull and hackneyed plots that serve only as something onto which to hang the structure, rather than the other way around; _Lady in the Lake_ is shot entirely in the first-person, whilst _Victoria_ is shot in a single continuous take, and neither is worth looking at for their plot, characters, or dialogue.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, the aesthetic aspect of _Searching_ is much more successful, with almost the entire film taking place on a computer screen, with Facetime conversations, iPhone messages, security camera footage, and TV material rounding out the design. It's a fascinating hook, and thankfully, it does more than simply exist to carry a poorly written plot \u2013 the filmmakers actually have something to say, albeit nothing too revolutionary.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to know is that the aesthetic is extremely well crafted; from Chaganty's direction to Juan Sebastian Baron's cinematography, to, especially, Nicholas D. Johnson and Will Merrick's editing; logistically, this can't have been an easy film to plan or shoot, and the fact that the various components that go into making up the final image all work so well together suggests a great degree of care. In tandem with this, whilst the overarching plot is poor, Chaganty and Ohanian's writing is excellent in terms of how it continually finds natural ways to confine the action to a screen \u2013 whether it's David looking into Margot's finances, Vick watching FaceTime conversations, TV news showing security footage \u2013 never once did it feel like a gimmick, like it was being forced to stay within the computer screen simply to satisfy an abstract aesthetic rubric. It all worked reasonably organically, and after a few minutes of acclimating yourself, you barely even register it anymore.\r\n\r\nWithin this, the filmmakers are even able to throw up a few surprises. For example, the structure grants us more access to David's interiority than would be possible in a regular film. How so? Simple \u2013 by employing something we've all done, many times. On several occasions, David is shown typing something during a conversation, only to delete it, and send something completely different, whether because the first message was angry, or emotionally revealing, or accusatory etc. Anyone who has spent any amount of time talking online or via text will be familiar with this, and the use of it in the film allows us a glance into his psyche, showing us where his mind is in an unfiltered sense, before self-censorship kicks in. It only happens a few times (if it happened too much, it would become meaningless), but it really does impart a degree of psychological verisimilitude that I wasn't expecting.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as mentioned earlier, the film actually uses the visual design to offer some social commentary, which is, again, something I wasn't expecting. Chaganty himself is a former Google Creative Lab employee, so he would know a thing or two about issues such as the uses and over-uses of technology, the unpleasant side of online culture, and the notion of digital footprints, and it is these areas where most of the film's more salient points are concentrated. For example, the addiction to technology and social media so prevalent in today's culture is right there in the set-up \u2013 the entire Kim family are obsessed with speaking to one another via phones and computers, and recording pretty much everything, often at the expense of having more natural face-to-face conversations. Another subject is the toxicity of the internet, the prevalence of online troll culture, and the tendency for people to say things online that they never would in person, believing that the anonymity afforded by the internet gives them the right to be unpleasant. This is communicated primarily through one scene \u2013 after watching a news report about Margot on YouTube, David begins reading the comments, which almost immediately start making jokes about him having killed her, and being \"father of the year\" (presented as a meme, obviously, because typing is such a drag).\r\n\r\nA very pertinent topic in the wake of Trump's election is the dissemination of fake news, and this is conveyed through a half-funny, half-unpleasant scene \u2013 shortly after realising Margot is missing, David speaks to Abigail (Briana McLean), at whose house the study group had taken place, who confesses that she barely knew Margot. Later on, however, when the media is swarming all over the case, she is seen on the news, tearfully lamenting how much she misses her \"best friend.\" The impossibility of ever being invisible online is another topic. Yes, the film is about a person who had an entire online existence that no one knew about, but that was only because no one had looked. Once someone did, and once a few threads were pulled, everything is exposed, as the impossibility of erasing ones digital footprint becomes manifest in the story. Anyone who has spent any amount of time online will be familiar with many of these issues, and the fact that they all ring so true, without the film becoming preachy, is a testament to the quality of the filmmaking.\r\n\r\nFinally, and this cannot be overemphasised, the film includes a pitch-perfect, perfectly timed, perfectly delivered Justin Bieber joke that is absolutely hilarious, and has to be seen to be appreciated.","id":"5cde0221c3a36878dcc14b70","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cde0221c3a36878dcc14b70","movie_id":489999}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nLiving in Portugal has a ton of pros, but regarding movies, it lacks serious advantages. The price of admission is expensive, there is only one film theater in my city (every time I want to watch a movie on IMAX or Dolby Atmos, it's a financial effort and time-consuming) and the worst of all, a whole bunch of films aren't released in their original date, especially November\/December Oscar-bait movies. Only now I had the opportunity to see Green Book, and I am so mad I wasn't able to write its review in 2018 because this is undoubtedly the best comedy-drama of last year and one of the best overall!\r\n\r\nWith the help of a terrific cast, Peter Farrelly and his writing crew (which counts with Vallelonga's son, Nick) deliver what I think is the best screenplay of 2018. I can't remember the last time I cried of so much laughter in a film. I can't remember the last time I did the latter and still got emotional with the dramatic arc. This comedy-drama sent me through a roller coaster of emotions I wasn't expecting, at all. I went in anticipating outstanding performances (check) and solely that. Since 2019 has already begun, I'm watching the Oscar-bait movies with no real hopes of being utterly amazed.\r\n\r\nHowever, Green Book completely took me by surprise. I genuinely don't know why everyone was so shocked when it won Best Screenplay at the Golden Globe Awards. It possesses such a well-written story, filled with brilliant narratives about the most sensitive subjects. It takes the two main characters and elevates their individual arcs into subplots where you begin and end with two completely different personas. It's an extremely relevant film that shows how our world evolved and fought back racism and discrimination, without ever becoming too dark or even dull. It's not more of the same, it's not another movie produced exclusively to send a social message and catch some Oscar nominations. It's a truly captivating story of how two men can change their perspective of another race or even the entire world, by actually spending time with another culture and ignoring preconceived notions.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this well-structured, beautifully-directed and cleverly-written film would be just \"good\" if not for the two incredible actors, who take this movie to a whole other level. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have such compelling chemistry that I wouldn't mind watching them interact for two hours on a car trip. Every single car sequence either produces hilarious moments, filled with tearful laughter, or it drastically changes into a more dramatic and emotional tone, subtly touching delicate topics. I knew Mortensen had a humorous side to him, but I never saw this coming! His timing, his expressions, his Italian accent, his body movements, everything about his performance is perfect. He absolutely nailed his part, by giving me the best time I had at a film theater in a long time, and his Oscar nomination is more than fair. He made a 130-min feature movie feel like a short flick.\r\n\r\nAli doesn't come far behind. Obviously, since Viggo has a funnier role to portray, the audience members might feel that he's just there to help his co-star shine, but he does much more than that. Since he brings the drama element to the story, he has a more restrained performance during the first half of the film. However, once Shirley starts getting along with Tony Lip, Ali gradually offers more and more splendid acting moments. He's definitely a supporting actor, but God is he a phenomenal one! Linda Cardellini (Dolores Vallelonga), even though she's only on-screen for a few minutes spread throughout the runtime, also delivers a great performance.\r\n\r\nTony Lip and Dr. Don Shirley have quite distinct personalities, besides being from different races. Each character's arc is brilliantly illustrated by Peter Farrelly, who gradually shows how Tony and Don are changing their view of the world and of each other's culture. Either through the witty car sequences or through unfortunate and horrible experiences, these two characters carry the audience on a journey of growth. Change in behavior, mindset and preconceived ideas, by sharing their own culture with another. Even though they were born in different countries and lived through distinguished lifestyles, with contrasting quality of life, they eventually start realizing that what they think of the world and everything else might not be entirely right.\r\n\r\nTechnically, Farrelly controls the movie's pacing exceptionally well, by making a two-hour-ish film feel like half of it. Remarkably-balanced tone and some great cinematography is showed in a couple of scenes. Consistently-filmed and well-edited, even though the latter has small hiccups here and there. Nevertheless, this isn't a film with extraordinary technical attributes, nor it needs them. Farrelly only needed to do \"ok\" with the producing and filming of a standout screenplay to achieve a fantastic result, and that's exactly what he did.\r\n\r\nFinally, regarding the controversy surrounding this movie ... See how easy it is to watch a film without being affected by outside matters which don't have a single thing to do with the movie itself? I don't care if someone who worked in the film tweeted something wrong today, let alone years ago. I don't care if someone misinterprets Viggo Mortensen's speech about racism. I don't care if the family of Don Shirley doesn't like how the movie approaches his way of being or his way of life. I don't care if the story isn't 100% true, as long as it succeeds in transmitting the vital message it wants to deliver, while actually being a good film. So, please, stop trying to listen to everything everyone says about a movie or the people working on it, especially nowadays, where chaos is easy to create.\r\n\r\nGreen Book surprised the hell out of me and left me speechless in the end. One of the best comedy-dramas I've seen in a long time, one of the best films of 2017 and, by far, the best original screenplay of the last year. Peter Farrelly and his fellow co-writers delivered a seamlessly-written story, filled with wonderful character arcs and with a quite important message to the audiences around the world. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali deliver award-worthy performances, especially the former who shows his incredible comedic timing and dramatic range. Still, the most compelling and emotional scenes come from Ali, and he does not deserve to be forgotten. I thought 2018 was going to be the first year without me giving an A+, but guess what ...\r\n\r\nRating: A+","id":"5c49ff1cc3a36847778b6ca2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c49ff1cc3a36847778b6ca2","movie_id":490132}
{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nEvery year, there are a couple of underrated and\/or overlooked movies. Greta is 2019\u2019s first film to belong to both categories. It was definitely overlooked since Hellboy stole the spotlight, and it\u2019s also underrated based on online feedback. Critics being divisive is kind of expected, but audiences are disliking Greta more than the former group, which I find quite surprising. Nevertheless, I enjoyed a lot and that\u2019s mostly due to the outstanding performances of its leads. Isabelle Huppert is incredible as Greta, as expected from such an acclaimed actress. Her character has a very mysterious personality which is well-developed throughout the runtime. Undeniably, her character\u2019s past and decisions turn out to be a bit questionable, in terms of logic. I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s straight-up rubbish, but I can\u2019t deny that some aspects of her persona lack consistency and sense. Fortunately, it\u2019s nowhere near Serenity\u2018s level of absurdity. In the end, Huppert elevates her script and delivers a creepily captivating display. \r\n\r\nChlo\u00eb Grace Moretz is one of the most talented young actresses out there, and I already stated a few years ago that she will be a much-desired star, sooner or later. In this movie, she shows off the subtlety of her expressions at the same time that she proves how amazing her range is. She embodies the charitable and innocent personality of her character like she is, indeed, Frances. Two wonderful performances that become even better due to the palpable chemistry that the two actresses have with each other. With such a short runtime, their interactions are interesting in the beginning, becoming more and more intriguing as time goes by. In addition to these two, Maika Monroe (Erica Penn) surprised the hell out of me! Not only her character doesn\u2019t follow the stereotypical \u201cblonde, dumb friend\u201d, but she really offers an exceptional performance.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay does have some narrative issues, being most of them related to Greta, as mentioned above. It\u2019s hard to imagine that what happens in the second half of the film could occur in real life as it\u2019s depicted, which instantly kills most movies. However, it\u2019s not as unbelievable as people might think at first, and after some thought, it\u2019s actually pretty reasonable, having in mind the psychological factor. It doesn\u2019t separate itself from the genre\u2019s cliches and it\u2019s quite predictable throughout, even though the ending comes as a nice surprise. It\u2019s the typical B-movie that\u2019s good to see at home on a Sunday afternoon, but if you catch it in the theaters, you won\u2019t regret the money spent.\r\n\r\nGreta is 2019\u2019s first underrated and overlooked film. With two extremely captivating performances by Isabelle Huppert and Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, this B-movie truly stands out from the most recent flicks of the same type. The leads\u2019 chemistry carries most of the engaging story, even though a word of praise must go to Maika Monroe for her display. The indisputable narrative problems can either be completely nonsensical or reasonable, at best, depending on what kind of moviegoer you are. There are enough justifications for interpreting the second half events and Huppert\u2018s character actions as both silly or realistic. I stand on the latter, and I enjoyed myself during the whole runtime. Go see it if you catch it near you. If you don\u2019t, be sure to watch at home.\r\n\r\nRating: B","id":"5cb74e79c3a3686b0483d439","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cb74e79c3a3686b0483d439","movie_id":471506}
{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_Insubstantial and forgettable, but Huppert makes it moderately entertaining_**\r\n\r\n> _The philosopher is right who says that nothing thicker than a knife's blade separates happiness from melancholy; and he goes on to opine that one is twin fellow to the other; and draws from this the conclusion that all extremes of feeling are allied with madness._\r\n\r\n- Virginia Woolf; _Orlando_ (1928)\r\n\r\nIn Claude Chabrol's _Violette Nozi\u00e8re_ (1978), Isabelle Huppert plays a prostitute who contracts syphilis from a client, tells her parents she inherited the disease from them, kills her father, tries to kill her mother, and falsely claims that her father molested her. In Chabrol's _La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie_ (1995), she plays a woman who shoots an entire family to death as they watch TV. In Michael Haneke's _La Pianiste_ (2001), she plays a pianist who uses broken glass to injure the hand of a fellow professional. In Christophe Honor\u00e9's _Ma M\u00e8re_ (2004), she plays a woman who commits suicide whilst having sex with her son, timing it so that her death coincides with his orgasm (just don't ask). In Paul Verhoeven's _Elle_ (2016), she plays a rape victim who sets out for revenge on her rapist, all the while indulging in ever more extreme play-rape scenarios with her (married) neighbour. It's quite a CV of depravity (and that's only five of the 120+ films in which she has appeared).\r\n\r\nAnd so we have _Greta_. Written by Ray Wright (_Pulse_; _Case 39_) and Neil Jordan, and directed by Jordan (_The Company of Wolves_; _The Crying Game_; _Interview with the Vampire_; _Michael Collins_), this is schlocky B-movie territory through-and-through, with a completely ridiculous plot and over-the-top final act, all infused with a ludicrous generic campiness. It's one of those films that's so utterly horrendous in almost every way, it's actually kind of enjoyable. Kind of. Very much in the tradition of stalker-thrillers such as Brian De Palma's _Body Double_ (1984), Adrian Lyne's _Fatal Attraction_ (1987), and Barbet Schroeder's _Single White Female_ (1992), although nowhere near as good as any of them, _Greta_ was introduced at the Venice Film Festival as \"_a twisted little thriller_\". Well, it's certainly twisted, and it's also rather little, but there isn't a huge amount of thrilling going on. Same problem if you want to call it a psychological thriller, as there's precious little psychology. In fact, there's precious little of anything going on, as Jordan seems to have precisely nothing to say; the film simply isn't inherently _about_ anything. Although it is good for a few laughs (and I'm pretty sure not all of them intentional).\r\n\r\nFrances McCullen (Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz), a young Bostonian, is sharing an apartment in New York with her college friend Erica Penn (Maika Monroe). Having recently lost her mother to cancer, she is all-but-estranged from her workaholic father Chris (the great Canadian Shakespearean actor Colm Feore), with every conversation painfully taut. Returning home from her waitress job, Frances finds a handbag on the subway belonging to Greta Hideg (Huppert). Bringing the bag to Greta's house, the two share tea, as Greta explains her husband died some time ago, and her daughter is living in Paris, leaving her feeling lonely. They strike up a friendship, with each filling an emotional void in the other's life. Although Erica thinks the relationship is \"weird\", Frances ignores her, and she and Greta grow ever closer. However, as Greta prepares dinner one evening, Frances finds a collection of handbags identical to the one she found on the subway, each labelled with a name and phone number. Deeply concerned, Frances tries to cut ties with Greta, conceding that Erica was correct. Greta, however, has no intentions of allowing Frances to walk out of her life.\r\n\r\n_Greta_ is Neil Jordan's eighteenth film, and the eleventh to feature Stephen Rea (here playing a rather useless private detective), and his output has always been patchy; for every classic like _Mona Lisa_ (1986) and _The Crying Game_, there's a _We're No Angels_ (1989) and a _Byzantium_ (2012). Something in which he has always been interested, and which infuses many of his films, is folklore, especially fairy tales. Obvious in films such as _The Company of Wolves_ (1984), _High Spirits_ (1988), _In Dreams_ (1999), and _Ondine_ (2009), it's also to be found just below the surface in everything from _Angel_ (1985) to _The Miracle_ (1991) to _Breakfast on Pluto_ (2005). In _Greta_, Jordan allows his familiarity with the tropes of classic fairy tales to imbue the film's _milieu_, especially in relation to Greta's home, which is so obviously inspired by \"Hansel and Gretel\" it may as well as have been made of gingerbread, whilst Frances has more than a hint of Little Red Riding Hood's innocence and _na\u00efvet\u00e9_ about her.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is a Roger Corman-style B-movie before it is anything else. For example, something you see a lot in B-movie thrillers is that when danger is apparent, otherwise intelligent characters must act like complete and utter simpletons; so, upon a barrage of calls and texts from Greta, Frances neither blocks Greta's number nor changes her own; when Greta starts calling the landline, neither Frances nor Erica think to unplug it; although it's never explicitly stated that Greta has a key to the girls' apartment, the fact that she seems to pop in and out at will suggests she does, yet the girls don't change the locks; Frances's big plan to combat Greta is to root through her garbage to try to find something incriminating; when trapped in Greta's house, after trying the door and one window, Frances thinks the best course of action is to flee to the dark cellar. Whether the film intends for this level of stupidity to be humorous or not is beside the point; anyone who has ever seen a movie (any movie) will surely get a chuckle from such appalling writing\r\n\r\nThe question one must ask, then, is whether or not Jordan is actually in on the joke. It remains somewhat ambiguous, but I would say, for the most part, that he is not, and that he seems to take the material relatively seriously. What is certain, however, is that Huppert is very much aware of the ludicrousness around her. Although _Greta_ is nowhere near the most extreme character she's played, she is clearly having an absolute blast with the part - whether it's delivering her lines as if she's over-rehearsed them, literally dancing across the set as she commits homicide, spitting chewing-gum into Frances's hair, gleefully engaging in some DIY emergency medicine, standing completely motionless in a city street, or overturning a table as if her life depended on it, you rarely see a performance wherein the performer is so joyful; she practically winks at the camera a couple of times. She commits totally to every bonkers moment, which come thick and fast in the last act. Without her exuberant performance, the film would be virtually unwatchable; Moretz is fairly wooden; Monroe's Erica is a blank slate rather than a character; Feore is wasted in only two scenes; and Rea is his usual hang-dog self. Only Huppert pops. But man alive does she pop bigly!\r\n\r\nThematically, the film flirts with a few issues, but never really penetrates any of them. One could certainly read it as a satire of NYPD inefficiency, the ineffectiveness of the justice system, and the misnomer that in a post #MeToo society, it's easier for women to report instances of stalking and harassment and be believed; when Frances makes a formal complaint about Greta, a bored policeman tells her \"_it's not harassment if it's in a public place_\". Later on, when Frances tries to file a restraining order, she is told it could be months before her case is heard. When Greta is taken into custody at one point, she is released almost immediately, despite clearly being unstable.\r\n\r\nFrom an aesthetic point of view, the film signals its campiness right from the off, opening with Julie London's 1963 cover of \"Where Are You?\" As you would expect from Jordan, the film looks great. In relation to the production design by Anna Rackard (_Boy Eats Girl_; _Love & Friendship_), the dark brown classical feel of the interior of Greta's house, with delicate sunlight filtering through the curtains, and looking, for all the world, like a 19th century rural French cottage, contrasts sharply with the bright, grey, modernist look of the girls' sleek apartment. Jordan's regular set decorator John Neligan must also be mentioned, as he fills Greta's house with innumerable trinkets whilst leaving the girls' environment relatively unadorned. Also worth mentioning is how Jordan and director of photography Seamus McGarvey (_The Hours_; _We Need to Talk About Kevin_; _Nocturnal Animals_) shoot scenes of Greta watching Frances menacingly from outside the restaurant where she works - placing her dead centre in the frame as she remains completely motionless, in the midst of a flurry of movement and passers-by all around her. It's a very creepy image. \r\n\r\nAnother really well mounted part of the film is a scene where Greta is following Erica. Although neither Erica nor the audience ever actually see Greta, we know she's there, because she keeps sending Frances picture messages of her pursuit, as Frances is on the phone to Erica telling her to run. The editing by Nick Emerson (_Starred Up_; _Lady Macbeth_; _Daphne_) is especially impressive here, cutting rhythmically between Erica, Frances, and inserts of the picture messages, as the tension mounts. Again, it's a very unsettling scene, and a unique way to stage a chase. Finally, there's the sound design by Stefan Henrix (_The Devil's Double_; _Britannia_), which is noticeable in what it doesn't do; whenever we are outside, there are the typical sounds of a city that you would expect, however, when we move into Greta's house, the sound design is dialled back almost to zero (much quieter than the girls' apartment), creating the impression of the house as somehow separate from the frantic pace of the city right outside the door.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the aesthetic very much lets the film down in terms of location. Although set in New York, it was shot primarily in Dublin, with some pick-ups in Toronto, and it shows. Granted, I live in Dublin and was able to pick out most of the locations in a way someone not from here wouldn't. But irrespective of that, the filmmakers seem to have made little effort to disguise the location; from the sequence of the traffic lights to the side of the road on which the cars drive to the street signs. It's very distracting, and really wouldn't have required that much effort to fix. This is especially irritating insofar as the location's significance is built into the script (it's mentioned several times that if Frances were from New York she would never have picked up the bag). So the fact that so little effort has gone into actually making the film look like it was shot in New York is disappointing.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there are a myriad of other problems. For starters, there's the script, which never feels like anything other than pure genre fare. Yes, it's to be lauded for using women in the role of both stalker and stalked, when stalker-thrillers have traditionally been about male anxiety. However, it doesn't take this trope anywhere, as if simply having two women at the centre is enough, and doesn't need further comment. When _clich\u00e9d_ issues like vulnerability, loneliness, and obsession are presented in a _clich\u00e9d_ manner, they don't cease to be _clich\u00e9d_ just because they've been given an undercoat of pseudo-feminism. The opportunity to engage with gender politics is right there, but is disappointingly avoided. \r\n\r\nAnother problem with the script is that none of the characters are given much in the way of interiority or psychological verisimilitude. Frances and Greta have some rudimentary backstory, but it isn't enough to compensate for their lack of psychology. There's little emotional complexity anywhere in the film, no real sense of any of the characters having an unconscious. And whilst the ludicrousness of Huppert's performance distracts from this and transcends the limitations of the writing, Moretz remains unable to break free. In this sense, she comes across like a cog in the screenwriters' machinery, only behaving in such and such a way because the plot dictates it, with scene after perfunctory scene doing only enough to get us to the next scene and nothing else. Neither Moretz nor Monroe are able to escape the generic moulds of their character-types; the bright-eyed and innocent newbie whose kindness will be her downfall, and the tough friend who seems churlish and cynical but who ultimately proves to have been right all along.\r\n\r\n_Greta_ is a rote stalker-thriller that looks great, but offers nothing we haven't seen before; it's essentially a potboiler in a nice suit. No different from any of the late 80s\/early 90s obsession thrillers, the plot is plodding and uninspired and the characters are underwritten. When all is said and done, it's hard to really figure out what Jordan was aiming for with this. You can't call it a psychological thriller about obsession and loneliness, because it does nothing with these themes, but you can't call it a self-aware and campy B-movie, because Jordan doesn't seem to be fully cognisant that it's campy schlock. Huppert's batshit insane performance elevates the material significantly, but even she can't paper over all the cracks. It's been 23 years since Jordan has made anything of real significance, and on the evidence of his last few films, it's going to be a while before he does so again.","id":"5d5f210bf263ba2ba594b868","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d5f210bf263ba2ba594b868","movie_id":471506}

{"author":"The Peruvian Post","content":"\"Frequently, when someone tries to portray the overwhelming decade of the 1960s, they usually misuse the concept of discrimination towards African Americans, which is accurate to describe this social issue. Nevertheless, the way Peter Farrelly and staff go into detail about this social wretchedness embodying the psychological impact it has in the main character makes the film an outstanding one\".\r\n\r\nThe year is 1962, and the film begins inside Copacabana restaurant where we get introduced the imposing personality of Tony Lip, an Italian descendant whose family came from a lower middle class coping with some financial difficulties. The way Viggo Mortensen performs the character is a proper model of then American racism; therefore he attempted to keep them out until the occasion arrived and Don Shirley appeared in his path, offering him a two-month lifetime opportunity. We all need to bear in mind the precise dates because, in real life, it was nearly a year they spent together. Despite his gifted pianist skills and his upper-class status, he was still a victim of the convulsed cultural impact. Both of them, during the film, learn from each other and fight against the unsettling behaviour of determined people. \r\n\r\nAlthough it may seem simple, their interaction is one of the primary reasons why it succeeds. Believe it or not, it arouses curiosity, reaches the climax when they finally let them know as they are, and sometimes it results as a plot twister due to the radical temperament change of each actor. It has been ages since I watched such a pleasant film; afterwards, I felt refreshed as though it renewed me.\r\n\r\nThe contextualisation was imperative to build up each one's personality; moreover, it was visually dazzling owing to the costumes, the space and the background advertisement of the decade. Comedy is present as well so that you won't be missing from genuine laughs. Everything appears to be perfectly balanced, even the role of secondary personages such as Tony's wife and the cheeky cards experience. I'm chuffed to bits!\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the film \"Green Book\" is an exceptional example of the conception of a masterpiece without spending loads of money in production and without creating plenty of trifling scenarios.\r\n\r\n\r\n[85\/100]","id":"5e4a08fa1e92250015c349aa","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e4a08fa1e92250015c349aa","movie_id":490132}

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"**_A strangely formless and insubstantial love-letter to Shakespeare_**\r\n\r\n> _There is an vpstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his_ Tygers hart wrapt in a Players hyde_, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blanke verse as the best of you: and being an absolute_ Iohannes fac totum_, is in his owne conceit the onely Shake-scene in a countrey._\r\n\r\n- Robert Greene; _Greenes Groats-VVorth of witte, bought with a million of Repentance_ (1592)\r\n\r\n\"We know very little about the life of William Shakespeare.\" If you're ever reading something that says this, or any variation thereof, stop reading, and find something by someone who knows what they're talking about. Because the simple fact is that we know a great deal about the life of William Shakespeare. In fact, we know more about the life of William Shakespeare than we do about all of his contemporary dramatists and poets. Combined. There are, however, three areas where our information is sketchy. The first is that we don't really know anything about his personal opinion of the plays - did he have a favourite; were any of them personal for him; did he prefer comedy or tragedy, etc. The second is the so-called \"Lost Years\"; 1578-1582 (from leaving grammar school at 14 to marrying Anne Hathaway at 18) and 1585-1592 (from the baptism of his twins, Hamnet and Judith in Stratford-upon-Avon, to a contemptuous reference to him by Robert Greene in his tract _Greenes Groats-VVorth of witte, bought with a million of Repentance_ as an up and coming dramatist who has already achieved considerable success in London). The third area for which we don't have a huge amount of information is the time from the burning down of the Globe Theatre on June 29, 1613 to Shakespeare's death on April 23, 1616.\r\n\r\nAnd it is this later period explored by Kenneth Branagh (as director, producer, and star) in _All Is True_. A pleasant enough film obviously born from great reverence, and, unsurprisingly, brilliantly acted, it's a curiously formless piece of work, clumsily episodic in structure, and relatively free of conflict, focusing instead on non-incident and trees silhouetted against picturesque sunsets. By the very nature of the years during which it takes place, Ben Elton's screenplay is full of interpolations and suppositions, some of which are interesting, but many of which don't work. There's a much better film hidden in the contours of _All Is True_, a darker story examining Shakespeare's psychology; his inability to process the death of Hamnet, his guilt over the fact that he put his career ahead of his family, his possible misogyny, his obsession with his legacy. These issues are in the background, but they are not the focus, and whilst _All Is True_ is perfectly fine, it's also perfectly forgettable.\r\n\r\nThe film begins on June 29, 1613, as Shakespeare (Branagh) watches the Globe Theatre burn to the ground, after a canon misfired during a performance of _All Is True_ (later renamed _The Famous History of the Life of King Henry the Eight_). Devastated by the loss of his theatre, Shakespeare decides to retire and return home to Stratford for the first time in 20 years (curiously, it is never mentioned that _All Is True_ was most likely a collaboration with John Fletcher, or that _The Two Noble Kinsmen_, also written with Fletcher, was Shakespeare's last play). Coldly received by his wife Anne (a miscast Judi Dench; more on that in a moment) and youngest daughter, Judith (a superb Kathryn Wilder), he gets a slightly better welcome from his eldest, Susanna (Lydia Wilson). Still mourning the death of Hamnet (Sam Ellis), his only son, who died from plague aged 11 in 1596, Shakespeare decides to grow a garden to honour his memory. However, he must also try to deal with Judith's hatred for him, stemming from her conviction that he believes the wrong twin died, an accusation he seems reluctant to deny.\r\n\r\nAnd that's about it as far as the plot goes, with everything else treated like a subplot \u2013 the animosity between Shakespeare and Susanna's devoutly Puritan husband John Hall (Hadley Fraser), a physician who believes every theatre in the country should be closed; Shakespeare's frustrations at having to deal with contemptuous local magistrate Thomas Lucy (Alex Macqueen at his smarmy best); Judith's reluctance to marry Tom Quiney (Jack Colgrave Hirst), a hard-drinking vintner with a reputation as a lady's man; accusations that Susanna is having an affair with the local haberdasher, Rafe Smith (John Dagleish); and Shakespeare's embarrassment that the sonnets he wrote for Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton (Ian McKellen) were published illegally, much to Anne's shame.\r\n\r\nIn terms of significant artistic output, Kenneth Branagh has few peers. The only person in history to have been nominated in five different Oscar categories, he has written and\/or directed films such as the noir-homage mystery thriller _Dead Again_ (1991), the irreverent \"luvvie\" comedy _Peter's Friends_ (1992), the flawed but vastly ambitious _Mary Shelley's Frankenstein_ (1994), the scaled-back romantic comedy _In the Bleak Midwinter_ (1995), the visually stunning but narratively weak musical _The Magic Flute_ (2006), and the unpopular but aesthetically fascinating remake of _Sleuth_ (2007). More recently, he has become an in-demand director-for-hire, working on such big-budget franchise films as (none of which I've seen) _Thor_ (2011), _Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit_ (2014), _Cinderella_ (2015), and _Murder on the Orient Express_ (2017), with _Artemis Fowl_ and _Death on the Nile_ both forthcoming. It could very well be the case that _All Is True_ is a palette-cleanser, allowing him to return to the familiarity of Shakespeare, and work on a more intimate film after several years on relatively impersonal projects.\r\n\r\nOf course, this is not his first filmic engagement with Shakespeare, and it is in his Shakespearean adaptations where, I believe, his real and lasting contribution to cinema can be seen - his extraordinary directorial debut, the savagely anti-war _Henry V_ (1989), worth seeing just for his recitation of the \"St. Crispin's Day\" speech from IV.iii; the energetic and fun-loving _Much Ado About Nothing_ (1993); the divisive 242-minute _William Shakespeare's Hamlet_ (1996), audaciously filmed on 70mm; the box-office bomb that was his bizarre (but entertaining) musical adaptation of _Love's Labour's Lost_ (2000); and the self-reflexive Japan-set _As You Like It_ (2006). And this isn't even to mention his acting-only roles in film and on TV, his vast list of theatrical credits (which has seen him play Hamlet in no less than five different productions), his radio and audiobook work, and his appearance at _Isles of Wonder_, the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics, where he played Isambard Kingdom Brunel reciting Caliban's \"Be not afeard\" speech from III.ii of _The Tempest_. I've seen a few people talk about how _All Is True_ is the epilogue to Branagh's cinematic engagement with Shakespeare. I sincerely hope not, as we've yet to see him take on the unactable role yet.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to note about _All Is True_ is how full of references it is to both Shakespeare's plays and incidents (or rumoured incidents) from his life. The idea that Shakespeare retired after the Globe fire is not original to the film, but was first hypothesised by Nicholas Rowe in _Some Account of the Life of Mr. William Shakespear_ (1709), the first Shakespeare biography. Additionally, several of the subplots are taken from real life. For example, as the film shows, when a local man named John Lane (Sean Foley) accused Susanna of adultery, she and Hall sued for slander. When Lane failed to appear to provide evidence of his accusations, he was excommunicated, and Susanna was cleared. Also true is that in 1616, shortly after he married Judith, Quiney was charged with \"_carnal copulation_\" with Margaret Wheeler (Eleanor de Rohan), who had died in childbirth along with the baby. Admitting to the charge, he was fined five shillings, and Shakespeare altered his will so as to safeguard Judith's entitlements should Quiney attempt anything underhand; originally, the will had included a provision \"_vnto my sonne in L_\", but \"_sonne in L_\" was struck out, and Judith's name inserted. A third example is a running joke concerning the matrimonial bed. When Shakespeare returns to Stratford, Anne sees him more as a guest, and so assigns him the best bed, as was customary for visitors, whilst she takes the second-best bed. Over the course of the film, he continually tries to work his way back into her good graces (i.e. back into her bed). Famously, Shakespeare left Anne \"_my second best bed_\" in his will, which some scholars have read as an insult to her, whilst others have suggested the second-best bed was the matrimonial bed, and therefore of great symbolic significance. This is the position the film takes.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, there are references to _The Merry Wives of Windsor_ (the composition of which Anne points out was what Shakespeare did to avoid dealing with the death of Hamnet); _Macbeth_ (\"_I once uprooted an entire wood and moved it across a stage to Dunsinane_\"); _The Winter's Tale_ (Shakespeare mentions that Ben Jonson \"_laughs at me because I speak no Greek and don't care whether Bohemia has a coast_\", an allusion to William Drummond of Hawthornden's assertion that Jonson mocked Shakespeare for giving the landlocked Bohemia a coastline in the play); the legend that Shakespeare fled Stratford some time prior to 1592 after he was caught poaching deer from Thomas Lucy's land (during an argument, Shakespeare tells Lucy, \"_I wish I had poached your bloody deer_\" - although, in reality, Lucy died in 1600); Robert Greene's contemptuous reference to Shakespeare as, amongst other things, an \"_upstart crow_\" (which Southampton chides him for still being bitter about); and Richard Burbage (Shakespeare refers to him as \"_a brilliant lunatic actor_\" who demanded \"_a bigger show for a smaller budget, and a shorter play with a much longer part for himself_\"). There's even a subtle reference to the ridiculous Shakespeare authorship question, when Henry (Phil Dunster), a Cambridge student, travels to Stratford to ask Shakespeare how he knew \"_everything_\", pointing out, \"_there is no corner of this world which you have not explored. No geography of the soul you cannot navigate. How? How do you know?_\" I'm also fairly sure Branagh quotes himself at one point; arriving back at Stratford, a shot from inside the Shakespeare house shows the door opening and Shakespeare standing in the doorway, heavily silhouetted against the light outside, which is exactly how we first see Henry in Branagh's _Henry V_, silhouetted in a doorway.\r\n\r\nA particularly funny reference concerns _Titus Andronicus_. When trying to scare Lane out of testifying against Susanna, Shakespeare tells him about the Moorish actor who played Aaron, a man \"_magnificent and terrifying. Mighty like a lion. Strong as a bear. I saw this man tear the heart from a fool who wronged him and eat it raw!_\" Explaining that the man is in love with Susanna, and would do anything for her, even though he knows they can never be together, Shakespeare tells Lane, \"_he swore that if ever she had need, his sword, his claws and his teeth would either defend her or kill for her. Should I tell him of Susanna's current distress?_\" This is intercut with an African-American actor (Nonso Anozie) reciting Aaron's menacing last speech from V.i, in which he brags about his life of misdeeds. However, when Shakespeare tells Anne, she confusedly reminds him that she met the actor who played Aaron, and \"_he was the sweetest chap you should hope to meet_\", to which Shakespeare acknowledges, \"_yes he was, lovely fellow_\".\r\n\r\nA critical scene, and easily the best in the film, involves Southampton visiting Stratford. Excitedly telling Anne of the impending visit, she rebukes him, reminding him that a lot of the town's folk read the poems, to which he replies, \"_those sonnets were published illegally. Without my knowledge or consent_\". Later, speaking to Southampton, Shakespeare states,\r\n\r\n> _they were only meant for you, Your Grace. Not for any other living soul nor any yet to live. Just you._\r\n\r\nThis alludes to the theory, popular during the nineteenth century, though somewhat out of favour now, that the original publisher of the sonnets, Thomas Thorpe, did so without Shakespeare's consent. The film also addresses the question of the identity of the \"_fair youth_\" to whom the first 126 poems are addressed. Often assumed to be one and the same as the dedicatee, \"_Mr. W.H._\", (\"_To the onlie begetter of these insving sonnets Mr.w.h. All happinesse And that eternitie Promised By Ovr ever-living poet Wisheth The well-wishing Adventvrer in Setting forth_\"), the two main (but by no means only) theories as to his identity are Southampton and William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke. Pembroke was Shakespeare's patron and one of the dedicatees of the _First Folio_ in 1623. Additionally, one of the primary motifs of the first 17 sonnets (the so-called \"Procreation sonnets\") is an attempt to convince the youth to marry, and in 1595, when many of the poems were written, Pembroke was being urged to marry Elizabeth Carey, which he refused to do. Southampton, on the other hand, was the dedicatee of Shakespeare's earlier narrative poems _Venus and Adonis_ and _The Rape of Lucrece_, and was well-known for his good looks.\r\n\r\nIn the film, there is little room for doubt - Southampton is the fair youth. When he points out, \"_it was only flattery of course_\", Shakespeare responds, \"_just flattery. Except, I spoke from deep within my heart_\", which Southampton dismisses with, \"_well, I was younger then. Younger and prettier_\". Shakespeare then quotes in its entirety \"Sonnet 29\" (\"_When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes_\"), with Branagh reading it as an agonised ode to an impossible love. He then alludes to the fact he'd always hoped Southampton may have one day reciprocated his love, to which Southampton reacts sternly, telling him, \"y_ou forget yourself, Will. As a poet, you have no equal. And I, like anyone with brain and heart am your humble servant. But as a man, Will, it is not your place to love me_\". Getting up to leave, Southampton then also recites \"Sonnet 29\", with McKellen's intonation changing it into a celebration of the power of art to transcend such foolish distractions as love. It's a beautifully shot, incredibly well-acted, and deeply nuanced scene that, if it accomplishes nothing, serves to remind us just what talented actors can do when reciting the exact same text, simply by modulating their tone.\r\n\r\nOne of the film's main themes is, of course, family, with Elton's script focusing on how resentful Anne and especially Judith have become of Shakespeare. We don't know a great deal about the real Judith, so much of Elton's characterisation is speculative. The film's Judith is essentially a protofeminist, a brilliant, complex, and acerbic woman railing against the narrow-minded patriarchy her father endorses, boldly telling him, \"_nothing is ever true_\". The likelihood of this being the case is slim at best, but Wilder is excellent in the part and makes Judith much more believable than the character has any right to be. Where Elton is more successful, and on firmer factual ground, is that Shakespeare's interest in his daughters' marriages revolves primarily (if not exclusively) around whether they can give him male grandchildren, now that Hamnet can't carry on the family name. The film acknowledges that Shakespeare was a neglectful father and husband, and never fully gets behind him as he defends himself by citing the cultivation of his genius, pointing out that his talents made the family very wealthy, and thus he should be excused. However, by the end, even he doesn't believe this himself, coming to understand the price his family paid for his greatness.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, cinematographer Zac Nicholson (_The Death of Stalin_; _The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Pie Society_; _Red Joan_) seems to have watched one too many Terrence Malick movies during preproduction, but as with everything Branagh directs, there's a sincerity and verisimilitude to the visual design. Nicholson's interior compositions draw inspiration from various Baroque painters, with the daytime scenes recalling Gabri\u00ebl Metsu and Johannes Vermeer, and the nighttime scenes drawn from the likes of Michelangelo da Caravaggio and Georges de La Tour. His exteriors, as one would expect given the similarity to Malick, are from German Romantics such as Joseph Anton Koch, Caspar David Friedrich, and Carl Blechen. The nighttime compositions are particularly striking, often lit with only practical candles, making use of shallow focus and strong contrast as characters huddle together in narrow shafts of light. Adding to the effect is the excellent production design by James Merifield (_The Deep Blue Sea_; _A Little Chaos_; _Mortdecai_) and Branagh's unexpected, but not unwelcome, use of gentle Dutch angles to underscore moments of heightened tension.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some considerable problems. First and foremost is the script, which has a strangely formless structure, derived from an extremely episodic organisational principal, with scene after scene addressing one and only one issue at a time, ensuring each issue is cleared before moving onto the next. The accusation against Susanna, for example, is introduced, developed, peaks, and resolves in around 15 minutes, dutifully followed by the next subject, which repeats the pattern. Scenes often involve the characters saying only what is necessary to get to the next scene, with little room to breathe, almost as if we're watching a \"previously on\" montage of a TV show. Because of this, when we do get scenes that are given a bit of time, such as the Southampton scene, they stick out, stylistically detached from the surrounding material. Additionally, what should have formed the core of the story, the allegations against Susanna or the question of Judith's marriage, for example, are instead treated like subplots. The problem with this is that because the main plot has a distinct lack of urgency, and is relatively conflict-free, the subplots come across as much more vital, only for them to be constantly interrupted by the less engaging main narrative.\r\n\r\nAnother issue with the script is its use of 21st-century gender politics. This kind of retconning, of course, is nothing new, and the question the film raises is an interesting one - was Shakespeare so ensconced in patriarchal thinking that the lack of a male heir blinded him to the fact that one of his daughters may have had the ability to carry on his poetic legacy, if not his name. Maybe he was, I don't know. None of us know. But the film's answer is the worst type of filmic oversimplification. Every woman around Shakespeare is a protofeminist, each of them more progressive (in the modern sense of the term) than him. And thus, the film builds to the moment when he comes to see they were right all along, scolding himself for his short-sightedness and boldly embracing the idea of gender equality. It's a poor attempt to graft contemporary ideology onto an epoch that simply had different beliefs. It's one thing to say Shakespeare may have been in been in favour of the female parts being played by women. It's one thing to say that _The Taming of the Shrew_ may have been written to satirise and mock misogynistic attitudes rather than endorse them. It's something else entirely to say that Shakespeare, by the end of his life, was a feminist, and would eagerly have burnt his bra, given the chance. That takes speculation into the realm of the incongruous, as if Elton and Branagh are afraid to judge him by any standards other than their own.\r\n\r\nThe casting is also problematic. Now, don't get me wrong, I love Dench and McKellen as much as the next man, and they're both excellent in the film, but that doesn't change the fact that they are both badly miscast. Both play their characters as elderly, but in 1613-1616, Anne (played by the 84-year-old Dench) was 57-60, and Southampton (played by the 79-year-old McKellen) was only 40-43. Additionally, Anne was six years older than Shakespeare, but Dench is 26 years older than Branagh, and it shows. And whilst age discrepancies can often produce fascinating results (in Laurence Olivier's _Hamlet_ (1948), for example, the actress playing Hamlet's mother Gertrude (Eileen Herlie) was 11 years younger than Olivier himself), here it just distracts from the content.\r\n\r\nAs a massive Kenneth Branagh fan (and a fan of Ben Elton's wonderfully irreverent comedy _Upstart Crow_), I was pretty disappointed with _All Is True_. Equal parts sullen and playful, Branagh's Shakespeare is both an extraordinary genius, not of the ilk of everyday mundanity, and a man who lives in the world and must deal with its absurdities. The film tries to strike a balance between a laid-back and wistful story about a retired writer, and a study of filial grief, with the dawning realisation that much of that grief could have been avoided. Some elements unquestionably work; the Southampton scene, Shakespeare's struggle to reconcile his one-of-kind genius with the personal cost of that genius for both himself and others, Judith's resentment of Hamnet, the night-time photography, the humour, the myriad of references. But a hell of a lot doesn't work. It's an inoffensive and perfectly fine film, but given the director and the subject, it could, and should, have been so much more.","id":"5d31af44caab6d1dfc989f5d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d31af44caab6d1dfc989f5d","movie_id":558095}

But there are passionate outbursts and exciting reveals. I almost feel sorry for those impatient viewers who are done in by movies that present complex, finely drawn plots. I can only assume they would also nod off while watching an actual Shakespeare play (as in, \"Why don't they speak real English?\").\r\n\r\nI suppose the details of All is True aren't all completely true, but even the Bard himself took liberty with his source materials, which, let us remember, was often history written by the winners and those whose heads weren't lopped off.\r\n\r\nSo I think the layered and admittedly slow moving plot rewards the patient viewer. I appreciated Anne Hathaway in this and wished to see more of her, and the Bard's relationship with his family is finely drawn.\r\n \r\nIf you haven't watched this film yet, check out the trivia entry on this page concerning a scene between Branagh and Dench. It is priceless. Oh, and one negative comment I saw pointed out the apparent disparity in the ages of the three main characters and the historical figures they are based on.

The answer is quite evident in \u2018Fallout\u2019 as his Ethan Hunt is as good as a caped superhero in the sixth film of the series. The story isn't all that new with its twists and turns. But \u2018Fallout\u2019 manages to build on the previous films in the series by bringing back old friends and foes, besides adding some new ones. Henry Cavill as August Walker fits right into this universe as the hammer to the scalpel that is Ethan Hunt. His presence is looming enough to fill the entire screen whenever he appears. Simon Pegg takes on the status of a series regular alongside Ving Rhames, whose Benji and Luther respectively play more than just mere sidekicks as they add comic levity and heart. Alec Baldwin and Angela Bassett also make a mark in their brief appearances but watch out for impactful turns by Rebecca Ferguson and Michelle Monaghan along the way.\r\n\r\nWriter & Director Christopher McQuarrie allows each character to shine while building on their history with each other, thus making them endearing to the audience. This only serves to up the ante when they\u2019re in danger. McQuarrie also lets the story breathe by bringing some calm before the storm hits. Which leads to the most crucial aspect of the series, and one that McQuarrie clearly excels at in this film \u2013 the action sequences. Not only are they meticulously planned; they are executed with precision, even when the fist fights are gritty and gruesome. Rob Hardy beautifully choreographs the camerawork following these intricate set-pieces, either allowing you to take in the expanse or bringing you up close and personal when required. This is paired with a soundtrack by Lorne Balfe that lends to the tension by giving the iconic \u2018Mission Impossible\u2019 theme a sinister sense of urgency.\r\n\r\nMcQuarrie has now directed two \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 films; his understanding of the franchise and its characters proves to be the secret weapon of the series. The fact that the stunts are largely done with practical effects featuring the cast, and most prominently Cruise himself, sets a whole new standard for action films. \u2018Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout\u2019 is a great mix of plot, pacing and performances that is undeniably the best entry in the franchise, while it re-establishes Cruise\u2019s status as an action superstar.\r\n\r\nReview by Times of India (TOI)\r\nFinal Rating - 4.0\/5","id":"5b5b3d24c3a368670c015b12","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b5b3d24c3a368670c015b12","movie_id":353081}

It is a hybrid war, happening alongside an open armed conflict, accompanied by killings and robberies on a mass scale, and a gradual degradation of the civilian population. There is fear, deception, hatred and violence everywhere. The society is collapsing, and death and deadly silence lie upon the place._\r\n\r\n- Sergei Loznitsa; Director's Statement; _Donbass_ Production Notes\r\n\r\nIn an era of fake news and alternative facts, when the public's familiarity with far-flung military engagements derives as much from civilian smartphones as it does from on-the-front-line reports for CNN or _The New York Times_, and where mass falsehoods promulgate like wildfire via questionable sources on social media, control of propaganda has become a key component of modern warfare. Focusing on the conflict in eastern Ukraine between Ukranian loyalists and Russian-backed separatists, writer\/director Sergei Loznitsa (_\u0421\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0435_ [_My Joy_]; _\u0421\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0435_ [_The Event_]; _\u041b\u0430\u0433\u0456\u0434\u043d\u0430_ [_A Gentle Creature_]) adopts a savagely satirical and unapologetically ironic tone in _\u0414\u043e\u043d\u0431\u0430\u0441_ [_Donbass_] as he examines the corrosive effects hateful propaganda can engender at all levels of society. Depicting an absurdist horror show that would be darkly hilarious if it wasn't so tragic, the film presents the Donbass as a pseudo-Orwellian dystopia of endemic corruption, state-sanctioned discrimination, sycophantic bureaucracy, and unashamed media manipulation. There are no heroes here; everyone is tainted, from the generals and politicians calling the shots to the soldiers on the ground to the civilians caught up in the mayhem. The lack of a standard plot and the absence of a protagonist won't be to everyone's liking, whilst the complete dearth of any geo-political contextualisation will alienate others. It's also inevitable in that in a film built on individualised vignettes, some work considerably better than others. Nevertheless, this is sobering stuff, and as timely as it is despairing.\r\n\r\n_Donbass_ is made up of thirteen segments, each of which plays out in its entirety before we move onto the next. Relatively self-contained, the only real connection between segments is that each leads to the next via a particular character, who hands the narrative over to someone else (like a baton in a relay race). So, for example, a segment depicting a hospital administrator is followed by a segment in which that administrator is stopped at a checkpoint where a foreign journalist is being questioned about his passport and whom we follow into the next segment. And so on. No character, however, appears in more than two segments, so there's nothing even approaching a protagonist. Each segment is based on a documented real-life incident that took place in the \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0456\u043a\u0430 [Donetsk People's Republic] in 2014-2015, with several derived from amateur footage posted on YouTube.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with a scene in which a group of people are having makeup applied, presumably on the set of a movie or TV show. The next segment sees a woman (Olesya Zhurakovskaya) dump a bucket of faeces over a politician (Grigory Masliuk), claiming he libelled her. Next, we see Mikhalych (Boris Kamorzin), a maternity hospital administrator, proudly showing his unenthusiastic staff that the hospital is fully stocked. This is followed by events at a roadblock, including a soldier (Igor Kirilchatenko) demanding food from a bus of civilians. A German journalist (Thorsten Merten) is then interrogated at the roadblock, followed by a news report from a bomb shelter. The next scene depicts a politician (Vadim Dubovsky) half-heartedly listening to a woman (Zanna Lubgane) who wants to tour a holy relic around the region. The issue of soldiers looting is examined next, followed by a section in which Semyon (Alexander Zamurayev) learns his stolen jeep has been recovered by the military. This is followed by the film's most disturbing scene, in which a captured soldier (Valery Antoniuk) is accused of being part of a Ukrainian \"_extermination squad_\", and is tied to a pole, ridiculed, and eventually beaten by a civilian mob. A wedding scene is next, before finally, we return to the makeup trailer where we began.\r\n\r\nHaving covered the origins of the War in Donbass in documentary form in _\u041c\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0430\u043d_ [_Maidan_] (2014), Loznitsa is not especially interested in context in Donbass, partly because his point is that no amount of context can explain the absurdity of what is happening - scenes such as the captured Ukrainian soldier being abused by a mob don't acquire new meaning simply because one is familiar with the politics. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this review, a little background on the Ukrainian crisis is helpful. In November 2013, in response to President Viktor Yanukovych's U-turn regarding the signing of a Ukraine-European Union association agreement, deciding instead to establish closer ties to the Russian Federation rather than the EU, a series of demonstrations took place, collectively known as the Euromaidan movement. These protests culminated in February 2014 in a Revolution which saw the overthrow of Yanukovych. However, in response, Russian-funded anti-Revolutionary\/pro-Yanukovych protests took place across east and south Ukraine, particularly in the Donbass region. These protests led to the establishment of the proto-states, Donetsk People's Republic and \u041b\u0443\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0456\u043a\u0430 [Luhansk People's Republic], and the proposed creation of \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0456\u044f [Novorossiya], a confederation of the two states. The situation soon escalated into open conflict between the Russian-funded, and often Russian staffed, separatist forces, and the loyalist Ukrainian forces. As Loznitsa explains it in the film's production notes,\r\n\r\n> _one of the main reasons for this war, which has been going on since 2014, is the collapse of the USSR. Such collapse could be followed either by a fundamental reform and complete re-organisation of the society, or by its continuous gradual decay and destruction. In this particular case, the first option after the collapse of the USSR is a gradual reform aimed at the creation of a European developmental model (with the emphasis on the rights of the individual, rule of law, and protection of private property); the second option is the return to the totalitarian Soviet mode of existence. These two options are incompatible or rather mutually exclusive. Ukraine, at least the predominant part of its population, chooses the European way, whereas Russia is rapidly moving back to the USSR. It is also important to bear in mind that the Donbass is an industrial region, which developed in the first half of the 20th century. The region was industrialised largely by employing the free labour of GULAG prisoners. Their descendants have settled in the region, having created a very peculiar community based around the factories and labour camp barracks. In recent years, especially during the rule of the former Ukrainian president Yanukovich, who was a native of the Donbass, the territory became extremely criminalised. This is why, with military and financial help from the eastern neighbour, it became possible to divide this territory between paramilitary gangs and to usurp power in the aftermath of the Maidan revolution. The war goes on because Russia provides financial and military support to the separatist movement. Its goal is very simple - to prevent Ukraine from becoming an independent state._\r\n\r\nObviously drawing inspiration from Elem Klimov's masterful _\u0418\u0434\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438_ [_Come and See_] (1985), one of the greatest anti-war movies ever made, Loznitsa's aesthetic mastery of the filmic medium is breath-taking. A formalist in the very best sense of the term, and working with legendary cinematographer Oleg Mutu (_Moartea domnului L\u0103z\u0103rescu_; _4 luni, 3 s\u0103pt\u0103m\u00eeni \u0219i 2 zile_; _Zjednoczone Stany Mi\u0142osci_), Loznitsa shoots _Donbass_ in the style of _cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9_, hand-held and as unmediated as possible. For much of the film, the audience is placed in the role of an eavesdropper; we're never inculcated into the events, nor are we ever presented with the subjective perspective of a participant - instead, we watch as if this were a news report (which, in a couple of segments, it actually is). Most of the segments are shot in single-takes, which has the effect of heightening tension to almost unbearable degrees, knowing that at any moment, a bomb blast could wipe out the cast or an idiot with a gun and a grudge could open fire (during the long wedding segment, I realised I was gripping the arms of my chair so hard that my fingers were sore - simply in anticipation of...something). In this sense, Loznitsa brilliantly evokes the unpredictability of war in a manner rarely seen in films with ten times the budget.\r\n\r\nThe opening segment sets the tone brilliantly. Watching a group of people having makeup applied in a trailer, we think are on a film or TV set, but in actual fact, these people are being made up to appear in a \"factual\" news report as shell-shocked locals, complete with a director telling them what to say (basically to denounce the \"fascist\" loyalists as traitors), and a stage-managed warzone in the background. It's the very definition of fake news. This gambit immediately recalls Barry Levinson's superb _Wag the Dog_ (1997), in which a White House spin-doctor hires a Hollywood producer to \"produce\" a fake war so as to distract from a presidential sex scandal. And much like _Wag the Dog_, the comic tone with which _Donbass_ begins slowly gives way to something much darker, culminating in a deeply unsettling final scene that's as savagely ironic as anything you'll see all year.\r\n\r\nThe film's dark comedy probably reaches its zenith in the scene where Semyon heads to a military barracks because he's been told the separatist forces have recovered his stolen jeep. Believing that he will be getting the jeep back, he instead discovers that the military want him to sign the car over to them. When he refuses, he's hit with an exorbitant fine and accused of being pro-fascist. Marched into another room, he finds that room full of men, all on their phones trying to raise funds to pay the fines they too have been hit with for refusing to sign over their cars. It's like something out of Douglas Adams - a room full of be-suited middle-class men all desperately trying to do the exact same thing.\r\n\r\nThematically, each segment in _Donbass_ has its own target, whether it be a self-serving hospital administrator, a soldier abusing the power he has over civilians, or an uninformed mob interested only in blaming someone (anyone) for their misfortunes. No one escapes censure because no one is wholly innocent. Focusing on the misbehaviour of the separatist forces, however, accusations of fascism are everywhere \u2013 the mayor who has faeces dumped over him, the German reporter (\"_if you aren't a fascist, then your grandfather was_\" yells one soldier), the civilian occupants of a bus, Semyon, a soldier who proves reluctant to loot, the captured loyalist who is tied to a pole. This last instance is especially difficult to watch. Tied up by separatist forces who actively encourage passing civilians to verbally abuse him, things soon escalate to spitting and throwing food, and, ultimately, to brutal physical assault. When some of the thugs responsible for drawing a crowd and instigating the violence against him then attend a wedding in the following segment, they amuse themselves and the guests by showing smartphone footage of the man being beaten. Mind you, this is a group of people who respond to the bride wishing that her son is born \"_with a rifle in his arms_\" by cheering, so their moral calibre isn't sky-high.\r\n\r\nWith a lack of any heroes, or even a protagonist with whom we can identify, the one tone that links the various segments is bitterness, a bitterness deeply ingrained in the souls of the people, who believe the lies they are being fed, with virtually every conversation returning in some way to issues of partisanship. One of the questions Loznitsa is asking is how one can broach reconciliation between people whose enmities run so deep. It's a question to which he has no answer; there is no kindness or compassion here. Crucially, Loznitsa is positing that the war is being fought as much with lies and propaganda as it is with weapons, and, certainly in the case of the separatist forces, amorality is simply an aspect of combat. These people are criminals as much as they are combatants, and are depicted as inherently unscrupulous, unconcerned with Ukraine or its people, even as they position themselves as the country's saviours. Indeed, Loznitsa explains,\r\n\r\n> _Donbass is not a region, but a concept, and it became possible because the criminal relations there are the basis of life, and many people living there have no ground under their feet. And this is a problem that any government in Ukraine will have to deal with, and we, its residents, will face it every day._\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, although Loznitsa does depict loyalist forces here and there, most of his invective is aimed at the separatists, and in this sense, the film could be accused of being unbalanced. Another issue is the lack of any political contextualisation, with no explanation of who is fighting, nor what they are fighting for, as combatants are introduced without any kind of identification. That such lack of context can hamper the film a little is illustrated in a scene where the German journalist is interviewing a group of soldiers sitting on a tank. Asking them where they are from, they all declare they are Ukrainian, from Donbass. However, the journalist's translator finds this hard to believe, the implication being that they are actually Russians. Why the presence of Russians in a so-called Ukrainian army should be important, or why the men would lie about their birthplace, is never explained. I understand what Loznitsa is trying to do here - political context is irrelevant in a conflict built on lies and absurdity - but some kind of concession to an audience not familiar with the politics would have been immensely helpful. Another issue is that because there is no central character, there is no real emotional connection. We certainly feel sympathy with some (Semyon, the soldier tied to the pole), but there is never any real pathos. Again though, this is by design.\r\n\r\nA searing satirical portrait of a place where human interaction has devolved to a level just above barbarism, where kindness and empathy are signs of weakness, in the post-truth politics of _Donbass_, horror, violence, abuses of power, Orwellian propagation (and acceptance) of fake news, and war hysteria masquerading as patriotism are the order of the day. Novorossiya may not have come into being, but the Donbass of the film remains loyal to the motherland, irrespective of how much the motherland may lie. Loznitsa, however, doesn't see the conflict as a legitimate civil war; rather, this is gang warfare, with the concept of civil war used simply to cover-up and legitimatise criminality and the abuse of the working class. Donbass is a place where reality is a commodity, and its only value is in whether or not it can be sold to the masses. If it cannot, then it's worthless. Of course, this situation is not unique to Ukraine - this simulacrum of a functioning society is replicated all over the world, including the United States, where governmental deception and presidential falsehoods haven't reached the level of Donbass, but are certainly moving in that direction. And for people who still value concepts such as truth, honour, and inclusiveness, this is a worrying trend. Because when truth can no longer be used as a weapon, it must be replaced with something far more powerful and far more dangerous - lies.","id":"5d69bcd39d89390012004e78","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d69bcd39d89390012004e78","movie_id":519187}

I take her to my ex-wife's house and return to the shop. I took the scissors and I cut his face. Then the ears, then the nose. He screamed, but the volume of the stereo covered everything. He was bleeding and I sprayed fuel on the wounds and burned them. He is no longer responding. He was still alive. He never died, he had a strong heart. He was breathing, but now he was no longer talking. He understood who was the strongest. I took the scissors and I cut his tongue, then his cock and balls. I opened his mouth with pincers and put everything in it. Then I whispered to him: \"once a man, now you are a woman!\" He kept moving. Then suddenly he died. Suffocated. But the torture is not over. I break his teeth, stick a finger in his anus and two more in his eyes. Then I hammer open the skull and wash his brain._\r\n\r\n- Daniele Mastrogiacomo quoting Pietro De Negri; \"E Alla Fine Si E' Deciso A Morire...\"; _La Repubblica_ (February 23, 1988)\r\n\r\nLoosely based on a real-life incident, _Dogman_ is an intimate character drama telling the story of an inherently good man who pays the price for attempting to foster a friendship with an irredeemable and sociopathic brute. Directed and co-written by Matteo Garrone, the film operates on the level of both social realism and as a kind of modern-day Aesop's fable, as filtered through the sensibilities of a Martin Scorsese or a Francis Ford Coppola. Postulating the somewhat nihilistic view that, when pushed to extremes and backed into a corner, man is no different than a dog, the film returns Garrone to the mob-infused milieu of his breakout, _Gomorra_ (2008). However, the two are markedly different films \u2013 whereas _Gomorra_ weaved five separate stories into a complex narrative tapestry, _Dogman_ focuses tightly on one simple core story; whereas _Gomorra_ told the story of a widely-influential and powerful organised criminal enterprise, _Dogman_ tells the story of a localised and utterly ridiculous criminal mentality; whereas _Gomorra_ depicted mob figures both powerful and insignificant, _Dogman_ depicts people not even on the lowest rungs of the ladder. However, there are also undeniable similarities between the films. Both emphasise the importance of omert\u00e0, and both explore some of the less glamourous aspects of gangsterism \u2013 the casual and often pointless brutality, the illogical sycophancy, the centrality of pusillanimity, the power granted to dealers by addiction, the nature of poverty and\/or ignorance, the abdication of immediate self-interest in deference to potential long-term accruement. Essentially, if _Gomorra_ showed us how the Camorra is run, _Dogman_ shows us the squalor and sordidness at street level. And whilst it isn't a patch on Garrone's masterpiece, focusing a little too much on allegory and not enough on self-contained narrative beats, it's still an accomplished piece of work.\r\n\r\nDiminutive and inoffensive, Marcello (Marcello Fonte, who won Best Actor at Cannes for his performance), owns a small dog-grooming business in a run-down Neapolitan sea-side suburb. Separated from his wife, Marcello is devoted to his daughter, Alida (Alida Baldari Calabria), with whom he has a strong relationship. Popular in the community, he spends his free time playing five-a-side football and eating in the town's only remaining restaurant with the vicinity's other business-owners, including Franco (Adamo Dionisi), who owns a gold-for-cash store next door to Marcello. However, to pay for the expensive holidays on which he takes Alida, he sells cocaine on the side, his best customer for which is the hulking Simoncino (a ferocious performance from Edoardo Pesce that's equal parts Robert De Niro in Martin Scorsese's _Raging Bull_ and Matthias Schoenaerts in Micha\u00ebl R. Roskam's _Rundskop_). An unpredictable and volatile ex-boxer who everyone in town fears, although Simoncino treats Marcello with utter contempt, bullying him into being the driver when he is engaged in a robbery, Marcello seems to genuinely respect the bigger man, wanting to foster a real friendship \u2013 when Simoncino finds himself in a fight with two drug dealers, Marcello intervenes to help him, and later, when Simoncino is shot, Marcello steps in to save his life. However, when Simoncino decides to rob Franco's store by busting a hole through Marcello's wall, Marcello is immediately uncomfortable. Failing to talk him out of the robbery, Marcello is subsequently arrested, but refuses to testify against Simoncino. As a result, he is charged and sentenced to a year in jail. Upon his release, he is distressed to find the locals no longer speak to him, and Alida looks at him differently. Unchanged, however, is how Simoncino treats him, and Marcello soon decides he's had enough of being pushed around.\r\n\r\nAlthough it hasn't been widely advertised, the film is actually based on the case of Pietro De Negri. Known as \"Er Canaro\" (the dog keeper), De Negri was the owner of a dog-grooming business in the Magliana area of Rome who dealt cocaine on the side. In 1988, fed up with being bullied by former boxer and cocaine addict Giancarlo Ricci, De Negri laid a trap for Ricci, imprisoning him in a dog cage, and murdering him. The case made headlines in Italy because of the details of De Negri's confession, in which he claimed to have tortured Ricci for over seven hours prior to his death. According to De Negri, he tied Ricci up and, with Ricci still conscious, amputated the thumbs and index fingers from both hands, before cauterising the wounds with a blow-torch to ensure he didn't bleed to death. Having left to pick his daughter up from school, De Negri returned, cutting off Ricci's nose, both his ears, his tongue, and his penis. Using a pincer, he then inserted the severed penis into Ricci's throat, choking him to death. After Ricci was dead, De Negri smashed his teeth with a hammer, inserted some of the severed fingers into Ricci's anus and eyes, and finally split his skull open with a pipe wrench and washed the brain with dog shampoo. He then wrapped the body in plastic and attempted to burn it in a nearby landfill, where it was discovered the next morning, still smouldering. When De Negri was arrested, he confessed to the murder, making the above claims without any remorse. However, an autopsy quickly revealed that much of what De Negri had confessed hadn't actually happened \u2013 all of the amputations and much of the bodily harm had been done post-mortem. Ricci had actually died due to severe head trauma, with the coroner estimated that death had taken approximately 40 minutes, not the seven hours De Negri claimed. Additionally, the fingers had never been cauterised and there was no trace of shampoo in the cranium. During his trial, it was argued that De Negri suffered from paranoid psychosis, exacerbated by his own cocaine addiction, and he was sentenced to 24 years in prison. He was released in 2005. _Dogman_ is one of two 2018 Italian films based on the case, along with Sergio Stivaletti's less high-profile _Rabbia furiosa: Er Canaro_.\r\n\r\nNarratively, _Dogman_ is relatively uninterested in the culmination of the relationship between Marcello and Simoncino, and much more in the events that build to that culmination. In this sense, the narrative is fairly evenly bifurcated by Marcello's jail time, with the first half of the film focusing on the increasingly dangerous and destructive \"friendship\", whilst the second explores the fallout from the cumulative abuse, looking at what can happen when even the most mild-mannered individual is pushed too far too often. The film goes out of its way to ensure that the audience feels sympathy for Marcello, if not necessarily empathy, depicting him as a fundamentally decent person, coke dealing aside. Yes, he's weak-willed and a terrible judge of character, but he dearly loves his daughter, who he treats like a queen, he is respectful and accommodating to his friends, and he seems to genuinely believe he can save Simoncino from himself. When Simoncino proposes robbing Franco's store, one of the reasons that Marcello offers as to why he doesn't want to do it is that, \"_it's important that people here like me_.\" Although this could come across as narcissistic, the way Fonte plays the character instead suggests that being liked sincerely makes Marcello happy, and he is quite content to do what he must to earn the admiration of his peers. In this sense, his hamartia is that he believes he can apply logic to his friendship with Simoncino \u2013 if he gives Simoncino what he wants, then Simoncino will come to respect him, and at that point, Marcello can turn him away from the path down which he is travelling. Highly skilled at placating the snarling dogs who don't want him anywhere near them, Marcello believes he can do the same with Simoncino. The problem, of course, is that he is 100% wrong about this \u2013 Simoncino is a wild beast, permanently in battle mode, and logic cannot be applied to such a man. For a very brief period, it does seem like he has endeared himself to Simoncino, if not necessarily earned his respect - when the two visit a nightclub, Simoncino goes out of his way to try to hook Marcello up with a woman \u2013 but this is only a momentary lull, and the relationship soon returns to the bullying foundation on which it was originally built.\r\n\r\nEspecially worthy of praise is the film's almost post-apocalyptic location, which is practically another character entirely \u2013 the beach is ugly, dirty, and overgrown; the buildings are unoccupied, paint peeling off the walls, vines crawling up the facades, some of them literally only shells; the shopfronts are rusty. This ties into the film's allegorical concerns, as the desolate nature of the locale mirrors the barren souls of the men who live here (and they are almost exclusively men \u2013 the only females of note are Alida, who lives elsewhere, and Simoncino's mother (Nunzia Schiano), who appears in only one scene). Director of photography Nicolai Br\u00fcel often shoots the dilapidated housing blocks in extreme long shots, rendering the already diminutive Marcello even smaller and more oppressed. The film also mixes subjective handheld camerawork, with more elevated and fixed, pseudo-omniscient shots. The colours are also extremely limited, with white, yellow, and beige predominating.\r\n\r\nFitting very much into Garrone's oeuvre, Dogman bears a number of similarities to _L'imbalsamatore_ (2002); both are loosely based on real events, both are set in run-down coastal suburbs, both focus on co-dependent and toxic relationships between mismatched male characters. The Fellini-esque tendencies evidenced in _Reality_ (2012) and _Tale of Tales_ (2015) are also apparent, with Marcello and Simoncino working as a kind of twisted version of Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina) and Zampan\u00f2 (Anthony Quinn) from Fellini's _La Strada_ (1954). In _Dogman_, however, the allegorical content is taken further than in any of Garrone's previous work. Co-written by Garrone and his regular collaborators, Ugo Chiti and Massimo Gaudisio, the film wants to convey universal truths in respect to humanity by focusing on the micro rather than the macro. Of course, for an allegory to work, it must first and foremost function as a stand-alone story, and the argument could be made that this is where _Dogman_ falls down. The storyline is very slight, with Garrone seemingly more interested in philosophising than he is in story-telling.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are certainly metaphorical aspects that work. For example, it's telling that the activity most favoured by Marcello and Alida is scuba-diving. Similarly, \"Dogman\" may be the name of Marcello's business, but it also describes both protagonist and antagonist \u2013 Simoncino is the snarling attack dog who Marcello must try to calm, whilst Marcello is the unfailingly loyal lapdog who always returns to his abusive master. On the other hand, are the caged dogs seen throughout the film supposed to represent how Marcello is entrapped by Simoncino's violence, or are the shots of Marcello pampering them a metaphor for his servility to an indifferent master? In other words, the film is a little muddled on exactly which side of the allegorical equation the dogs belong.\r\n\r\nHowever aside from this slight impreciseness regarding the allegory, _Dogman_ is a fine film. Humble in its aspirations, and small by design, some viewers will find it too uneventful, whilst others will find the ending too abrupt. However, all things considered, I found it to be a strong piece of cinema.","id":"5d017822c3a3687992201e77","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d017822c3a3687992201e77","movie_id":483184}

The trailer was awful, making it look like a generic action flick; several colleagues saw the screening at ADIFF earlier in the year and were decidedly unimpressed; I thought most of the film was in English, which rubbed me up the wrong way altogether. Mainly though, I was just fulfilling my God-given right as an Irish person \u2013 being cankerous for no earthly reason whatsoever. However, because I was expecting to hate it, when I discovered, much to my chagrin, that it's actually quite good, it led to me thoroughly enjoying it. Colour me humbled. Easily the most hyped and anticipated Irish film of the last decade or so, _Black '47_ is proudly advertised as the \"_first film about the Great Famine_\". And were this true, it would undoubtedly occupy a canonical place in Irish artistic output in general, and Irish cinema in specific. However, there is one vital factor that everyone really needs to know before seeing it \u2013 it isn't the first film about the Famine. It's the first film set during the Famine, but it isn't about the Famine. This is a genre film, a pseudo-western revenge thriller set against the backdrop of the Famine. The Famine is not the film's central theme, nor does it attempt to engage with it on a national scale. If you accept that, and don't go in expecting to see Cecil Woodham-Smith's _The Great Hunger_ (1991) transposed to the screen, there's actually quite a lot here to admire.\r\n\r\nAs with many genre films, the plot is simplicity itself. It is winter 1847 in Connemara, two years since _Phytophthora infestans_ caused the failure of the potato crop on which large portions of the country's poor depend. Having deserted from the British Army's 88th Regiment of Foot (Connaught Rangers) after a difficult tour in Afghanistan, Martin Feeney (James Frecheville) returns home, unaware of the state of the country; everywhere, there is eviction, homelessness, starvation, and death. As people literally lie dying on the sides of the road, hundreds of thousands have already left Ireland for the United States. With Protestant clerics exploiting the crisis to compel Catholics peasants to convert in return for soup (\"_taking the soup_\"), grain is stockpiled for export to England. Travelling to his home, Feeney learns his immediate family is dead; his brother sentenced to hanging for resisting eviction, and his mother driven off the land after refusing to take the soup, subsequently dying of starvation and exposure. The only remaining family he has are his sister-in-law Ellie (the always excellent Sarah Greene), and her three children. Holding up in an abandoned cottage, Feeney persuades Ellie to join him in emigrating. However, the following day, an eviction party, led by the unscrupulous bailiff Cronin (Aidan McArdle) and the sadistic Sgt. Fitzgibbon of the Irish Constabulary (yet another strong performance from Moe Dunford), arrives with orders to eject the family and burn the property. Things soon turn violent, and Feeney is arrested. Held in a nearby garrison, he escapes, and sets about exacting revenge on the judge who hanged his brother, the people in the eviction party, the landlord who ordered the eviction, and anyone else who gets in his way. Meanwhile, learning of Feeney's escape, the British Army send a three-man team after him; the idealistic and pompous Sgt. Pope (Freddie Fox), the na\u00efve Pvt. Hobson (Barry Keoghan), and Feeney's former commander in the Rangers, the disillusioned and world-weary Hannah (Hugo Weaving). Considering Feeney a friend, Hannah is unenthusiastic about the mission, but has little choice, as he himself is awaiting execution, having killed a suspect he was supposed to be interrogating, and is told unless he brings Feeney back, his execution will go ahead. Soon joined by Conneely (Stephen Rea) as interpreter, bard, and geographical guide, the group set off after Feeney as he cuts an increasingly bloody path across the county towards the man his sees as the architect of the area's miseries; Lord Kilmichael (Jim Broadbent).\r\n\r\nBefore looking at why I enjoyed the film so much, a (very) small bit of background. The Famine is the single most significant event in Irish history; a cataclysmic tragedy on a biblical scale. Whilst you'll often hear it said that it was caused by either blight, an over-reliance on the potato crop, or colonial mismanagement (or organised genocide, if you believe Tim Pat Coogan), the fact is that it was the result of a myriad of factors, which, in 1845, combined to form a deadly perfect storm; bad luck, a natural occurrence, political ineptitude, pronounced socio-economic disparity, racism, massive poverty, national arrogance, etc. What is certain, however, is that it was a _completely_ preventable tragedy; even after the blight was initially recognised in 1844 (one year _prior_ to the crop failure), landowners continued to export grain. By the time 1847 had come around, the Irish Poor Law Extension Act had made Irish property owners fully responsible for public relief, and the \"Gregory Clause\" stated that any famer with at least a quarter of an acre was not eligible for such relief. The Amendment and the Clause, both ostensibly intended to ease the poor's suffering, had a catastrophic effect on the country, leading to an unprecedented rise in evictions. This was because the property tax assigned to pay for the Poor Law was levied on each rented holding, meaning it fell on landlords. Facing the possibility of this drastically increased taxation, many simply sidestepped the problem by evicting their tenants and destroying the dwellings. Simultaneously, due to the Gregory Clause, tens of thousands of tenants were trying to sell most of their land to the landlords so they could qualify for relief. However, because of the Amendment, many landlords refused to accept partial land surrenders, demanding instead the entire holding, plus the dwelling, which they could then burn, leading to a vicious cycle of homelessness, poverty, and destitution.\r\n\r\nBetween 1845 and 1852, around one-and-a-half million people died and nearly two million emigrated, reducing the populace by roughly 25% (1847 is known as \"Black '47\" because both the death and emigration rates were at their highest). In a lot of ways, the country still hasn't recovered; the Irish language was laid to waste; the myths and sagas of Irish folklore were forgotten for decades, until the advent of the Celtic Twilight and the _Athbheochan na Gaeilge_, and even with these movements, large portions of the folklore have never been reintegrated into the zeitgeist; the proud tradition of Irish bards changed forever, with thousands of songs lost; Irish literature slowed down to a trickle, taking over a hundred years before returning to its pre-Famine affluence; and hatred of the English occupiers became more galvanised than at any point in the previous 700 years of their presence \u2013 the common man blamed the Famine on the English, and for the first time, the poor and uneducated began to think along the lines of political insurgency.\r\n\r\nThe Famine was so devastating that even Irish literature, one of the finest literary traditions in the world, was reluctant to engage with it, both at the time, and ever since. Beyond a few poems by the likes of James Clarence Mangan, Aubrey De Vere, and Thomas D'Arcy McGee, isolated poetry like \"Thanatos, 1849\", and a few novels such as William Carleton's _The Black Prophet: A Tale of Irish Famine_ (1847), there really is no such thing as \"Famine literature\", certainly no Famine literary tradition. And even since then, the national literature has proved reluctant to engage, with only a few texts such as Patrick Kavanagh's _The Great Hunger_ (1942) and Seamus Heaney's \"At a Potato Digging\" (1966) willing to address it (even the masters, W.B. Yeats and James Joyce themselves, never explicitly dealt with the Famine head-on).\r\n\r\nAll of which brings us to _Black '47_. Considering how important an event this is in Irish history, it is as conspicuous by its absence from the national cinema as it is from the national literature. Here, however, there are practical considerations beyond the thematic enormity of the task; representing something of this scale and with this level of suffering is massively difficult on film, especially with a limited budget. And in any case, how does one fashion a narrative which could possibly convey the bleakness of the Famine. Maybe in this era of long-form narrative on TV, there's a possibility of doing something Famine-related, but condensing the most significant seven years in Irish history into a two (or three, or four) hour film is nigh-on impossible, not to mention the sheer unrelenting misery one would need to put on screen. It wouldn't exactly be a crowd-pleaser \u2013 watching an entire country slowly starve to death probably isn't going to pack Marvel fanboys into the local multiplex. And so, with that in mind, Black '47 has no intentions of dealing with the Famine on that kind of scale. This is a genre piece, it's a western, a revenge thriller. It's basically Clint Eastwood's _The Outlaw Josey Wales_ (1976), with Feeney having more than a hint of the Man with No Name.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, using the Famine as a backdrop for a genre exercise is probably a wise choice \u2013 it allows limited engagement by way of a plot-driven story, without setting up massive expectations (advertising hyperbole aside) and unconquerable thematic hurdles. Speaking to the _Irish Independent_, co-screenwriter\/director Lance Daly explains,\r\n\r\n> _the genre route was the only way to go. I mean, do you want to make a film that's just about suffering, about people watching their children starve and families lying dead in their homes? Do you want to watch it, do you want to make it, do you want to be someone who tries to dramatise that? You had to tackle it in a less direct way._\r\n\r\nAnd whilst grafting an historical tragedy onto a generic template runs the risk of the tragedy muting the genre elements, and the genre distracting from the tragedy, Daly and his fellow screenwriters, Pierce Ryan, P.J. Dillon, and Eugene O'Brien, make a fine stab at it.\r\n\r\nDoing it this way also makes a great deal of sense for a number of additional reasons. For example, no Famine narrative could ever depict a story in which a protagonist rights all the wrongs of Ireland, because no such person existed. However, the relatively contained story of Feeney's revenge is more than aware of that. He is never painted as someone out to liberate the country, spurred on by the wrongs done to him personally \u2013 he's no Mel Gib\u2026sorry, William Wallace. He wants revenge on the people who wronged him; he has no aspirations of saving Ireland, and is powerless to do anything on a larger socio-economic canvas. The film never lets the audience forget this, whether it be shots of Feeney emotionlessly riding past starving peasants on the roadside, or his invasion of a Protestant soup tent, where he eats his own fill and then leaves. He's not the avenging spirit of Ireland made flesh, he's not C\u00fa Chulainn, Fionn mac Cumhaill, or one of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann. This is not a piece of nationalist wish fulfilment, and it makes no claim to be.\r\n\r\nIn terms of how the film represents the Famine, apart from its importance to the plot, Daly employs a number of what could be called \"quintessential Famine images\". These include one of the first shots in the film, which shows a skull sinking into the wet mud, representing the dead and their connection to the land (a little on the nose, but it does the job); when Ellie first appears, she looks like Caitl\u00edn N\u00ed Uallach\u00e1in, the implication being that Ireland itself is literally dying; when Ellie and her children are evicted, the scene is very much an archetype of such evictions \u2013 women and children crying, men being restrained, the thatched roof of a cottage burning, callous bailiffs, brutalising police; a Catholic priest warning the starving peasants not to take the soup (Feeney's disdain for this priest recalls the scene in Jim Sheridan's _The Field_ (1990) when the Bull McCabe (Richard Harris) reminds Fr. Doran (Sean McGinley) \"_no priests died in the time of the Famine, only poor people_\"); peasants taking the soup, a scene which throws up one of the most controversial and long-lasting ramifications of the Famine (more on this in a moment); grain being stockpiled for export to England; bedraggled peasants huddled at the gates of an affluent estate, begging the rich occupants to give them food, in a scene visually reminiscent of Rowan Gillespie's _Famine_ memorial on Dublin's Custom House Quay); multiple references to emigration. In point of fact, although the Famine is essentially just background, Daly works hard to make sure the viewer never forgets what's happening beyond the edges of the frame, by occasionally allowing it within the frame.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons I thought I was going to hate _Black '47_ was because I thought it was entirely in English, which would have been patently ridiculous. Perhaps the most long-lasting effect of the Famine is that it decimated _Gaeilge_, the Irish language. The Famine is why this review is in English, and why I can speak only a few sentences in my native tongue. In seven years, the Famine did what the English couldn't manage in 700 \u2013 it destroyed that which defined us as a people, our very national identity. However, not only are large sections of _Black '47_ in Irish, the film actually uses the Irish language and the attempts to suppress it as an important recurring motif. For example, Feeney speaks both English and Irish, but he makes a conscious decision to only speak Irish, even when talking to non-Irish speakers, several of whom demand he speak in English. The film also shows a judge (Dermot Crowley) erupting in anger as peasants in his courtroom, unable to speak English, begin to converse in Irish, whilst Kilmichael refers to Gaeilge as \"_that aboriginal gibberish_\". However, the most important scene concerning the Irish language is one which recalls the linguistic brilliance of Brian Friel's play, Translations (1980). In the Protestant soup kitchen, when the priest asks a peasant his name, the man replies \"_S\u00e9amus \u00d3 S\u00failleabh\u00e1in_\". The priest turns around to a translator, who responds, \"_James Sullivan_\". This speaks to the Anglicisation of Irish place names by the British (B\u00e9al an \u00c1tha became Ballina, D\u00fan Dealgan became Dundalk, Tr\u00e1 L\u00ed became Tralee, etc), itself an attempt to destroy the language and undermine our sense of place. Daly never allows the devastating effect the Famine had on the language to fade too far into the background, and the narrative is all the better for it.\r\n\r\nThe film also seems to have one eye on the contemporary political climate. For example, the scenes of English gentry seizing land and demolishing homes perhaps alludes to the situation in Palestine, where Israeli forces can be seen doing essentially the same thing. Even more pertinent, and closer to home, the scenes of empty dwellings, as people try to survive in ditches, clearly alludes to the ludicrous phenomenon of empty, boarded-up houses found all over Dublin, which, for some reason best known to the council, can't be let out to the ever-increasing number of homeless families. Similarly, the scenes of people dying on the side of the road recalls the bitter 2018 winter, when four homeless people died on the streets of Dublin within a few weeks of one another. Even the eviction scene is comparable to contemporary events; just last week, at the behest of a landlord, balaclava wearing Garda\u00ed, flanked by private security personnel (also wearing balaclavas), violently evicted a peaceful Take Back the City protest which had occupied an empty house in Dublin so as to highlight the growing homeless crisis.\r\n\r\nLooking beyond the Famine, thematically, the film hits the ground running; the first scene is Hannah's murder of his prisoner, which is preceded by a short debate between the two on the issue of loyalty to one's nation vs duty to the Crown, a duality with which Hannah wrestles for the duration of the plot. Indeed, speaking of Hannah, he and Feeney are very much two sides of the same coin; they are, for all intents and purposes, Javert and Jean Valjean, locked into a pursuit by a system neither of them respect. In fact, in relation to this, whereas Hugo gradually fazes Javert out of the narrative, Daly goes in the opposite direction \u2013 as the film progresses, Hannah comes to the fore and Feeney drops into the background. This has the effect of making Feeney seem almost non-human, an elemental force who turns up now and again when things kick off, and it's a really well handled structural component.\r\n\r\nOf course, all of this is not to say the film is perfect. Composer Brian Byrne's score, which features a heavy usage of uilleann pipes, is decent, but overly didactic. Additionally, the character of Kilmichael is something of a clich\u00e9d, token villain, coming out with lines such as \"_this potato business has simplified things considerably_\". Daly also has a slight tendency to unsuccessfully mix naturalism with stylisation, perhaps most obvious in the use of intentionally artificial looking matte paintings as backgrounds in some of the panoramic scenes. Whilst the intention behind this was most likely to try to evoke the look of old sepia photographs, contemporary audiences used to photorealistic CGI in every shot will probably interpret it as cheap effects work, which is a shame, and does the film no favours. Finally, if there's one thing I was surprised that wasn't mentioned, especially given all the references to emigration, it would be the coffin ship, the image of which is a permanent component of the Famine's legacy in Ireland.\r\n\r\nHowever, all things considered, this is a strong and reasonably important piece of filmmaking. Yes, it's essentially just a revenge western, and yes, in that sense, it's nothing overly special; there are a hundred films along these lines, and several of them are better than _Black '47_. However, Daly allows the Famine background to come to the fore sufficiently so that we never forget when and where we are, and because of this, it's undoubtedly an important film. Mixing the historical with the generic just enough so that each informs the other without either becoming (too) diluted, it's not the first \"Famine film\", but it is a very decent, honest, and respectful attempt to put something (anything) of that great tragedy on screen. And that is something to be lauded.","id":"5ce5a86ac3a3683bd820ffec","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ce5a86ac3a3683bd820ffec","movie_id":438145}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"It was with some hesitation that I went to see this movie. I was afraid that it would be burdened with too much political and social preaching. Especially knowing how much the movie is praised amongst certain factions in our society today. Sure enough there were indeed some of that nonsense but luckily it was much less than I feared.\r\n\r\nI actually found the movie fairly entertaining. It is far from great, certainly very far from the insane hype surrounding it, but pretty okay. It is more or less a standard issue super hero movie on a big budget. Of course this means a fairly mediocre underlying story beefed up with lots of action and special effects.\r\n\r\nThe story itself is a traditional revenge story with some black power stuff. Nothing to write home about but it works as a vehicle for the action and special effects which is what makes this movie. There are the usual nonsense and plot holes in it of course. Like Shuri claiming that Vibranium (silly name but never mind) is instable at high speeds yet they have no problem making flying ships and other fast moving stuff with it.\r\n\r\nThe characters are a wee bit disappointing as far as the main characters are concerned. I felt that the main protagonist has little in terms of charisma. Killmonger, the main bad guy, was downright disappointing. To me he looked like the stereotype of a dumb thug and mostly he behaved like one. Bloody hell could they not have found an actor that looked less\u2026well\u2026stupid!\r\n\r\nPersonally the character I liked best was actually Klaue which was pretty cool, insane but cool. The female warriors, which were both kick-ass and smart, and Shuri is also fairly high up on my approval list.\r\n\r\nSpecial effects! This is of course where this movie shines. Overall I think the special effects were good. The design of the various gadgets, ships etc were very nice. The rampaging rhinos in the final fight really made me laugh. I should have seen that coming. I definitely liked all the sonic effects. Obviously this movie would have been more or less null if the special effects would not have been a success.\r\n\r\nOn the whole Black Panther is a quite enjoyable special effects and action movie. Nothing more, nothing less. Some social preaching nonsense but less than I feared, hum ho story, lots of action and lots of special effects.","id":"5a93b14b0e0a2616c602de5e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a93b14b0e0a2616c602de5e","movie_id":284054}

It opens with one of the most (in)famous scenes from Victor Fleming's _Gone with the Wind_ (1939), before pivoting to a fictional precursor of Alex Jones lecturing the audience on the dangers of the \"negroid\", and later takes in everything from Kwame Ture and the All-African People's Revolutionary Party to David Duke and his political aspirations, before lambasting D.W. Griffith's _The Birth of a Nation_ (1915), criticising the tropes of classic Blaxploitation films such as Gordon Parks's _Shaft_ (1971), Gordon Parks Jr.'s _Super Fly_ (1972), and Jack Hill's _Coffy_ (1973), going into agonising detail regarding the 1916 lynching of Jesse Washington, sardonically criticising police bureaucracy, and concluding with a montage of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, including raw footage of James Alex Fields, Jr. ploughing a car into a crowd of counter-protestors, resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, intercut with Duke championing Donald Trump's presidency, and Trump's own reluctance to condemn the Neo Nazi\/white supremacist component of the rally. The film then ends with an evocatively worded tribute to Heyer, before fading to an upside-down black and white American flag (which is not, as is often stated, a political protest, but is actually a governmentally approved signal for \"dire distress\"). Yep; this is a film with a lot to say.\r\n\r\nAt its core, _BlacKkKlansman_ is about institutional racism in the United States. Ostensibly dealing with the 1970s manifestation of such, the film's real point is that in 2018, not only is such racism still a problem, it's now even more endemic, due to its pseudo-legitimacy in the wake of Trump's election, and the concomitant upsurge in hate crime across the country. The film holds a mirror up to the contemporary era by way of presenting an historical event which both underlines the inherent nonsensicality of white supremacist attitudes, whilst also pointing out just how dangerous idiots like this can be in a country where guns are so readily available, where being a member of an organised hate group is not illegal, and where the belief that \"white is right\" reaches to the upper echelons of power.\r\n\r\nOn the surface, the film plays out as you would expect from the trailer - it's a frequently hilarious look at the true story of how a black police officer infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan. In 1979, Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) became the first black officer in the Colorado Springs PD. Initially assigned to the records room, Stallworth talks his way into an undercover investigation run by Detectives Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) and Jimmy Creek (Michael Buscemi), who have him attend a lecture being given by Kwame Ture (Corey Hawkins) with orders to report on the mood and attitudes of the crowd. Although taken with Ture's rhetoric, Stallworth nevertheless carries out his assignment, and is subsequently transferred to intelligence. Seeing an advert for KKK membership in the newspaper, Stallworth rings the number on a whim. Pretending to hate everyone who doesn't have \"pure white Aryan blood running through their veins\", Stallworth is invited to meet. He then hatches an insane plan to use Zimmerman as the in-person Stallworth, whilst Stallworth himself will continue the phone conversations. At the meet-and-greet, Zimmerman\/Stallworth is introduced to the unstable Felix Kendrickson (a superb Jasper P\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6nen), who is immediately suspicious of him. Nevertheless, he's approved for membership. However, unhappy with how long the paperwork is taking, Stallworth rings KKK headquarters, and is shocked to find himself on the phone with \"Grand Wizard\" David Duke (Topher Grace), who he impresses to such an extent that Duke promises to expedite his membership.\r\n\r\nAnd with this completely barmy premise as the hook, co-writer\/director Spike Lee (_Do the Right Thing_; _Malcolm X_) has made his best film since _25th Hour_ (2002), and his funniest since _Bamboozled_ (2000), possibly the funniest of his career. Of course, Lee is far from the first person to see humour in the idea of a black person joining a white supremacist organisation \u2013 perhaps the best known example is Dave Chappelle's character, Clayton Bigsby, a blind black man unaware of his ethnicity, who has become the leader of a local KKK sect. However, where the film is unique, and where it excels, is in how Lee uses history to offer viciously trenchant commentary on race relations in 2018.\r\n\r\nHis combative intent is signalled in the first scene, which is actually a scene from another film; _Gone with the Wind_, as Scarlett O'Hara (Vivian Leigh) looks for Dr. Meade (Harry Davenport) in the wake of the Battle of Atlanta in July 1864. A resounding victory for the Union, the battle bolstered confidence in Abraham Lincoln's leadership, and precipitated the Confederate States of America's surrender the following year. The scene depicts O'Hara picking her way through the thousands of wounded and dead Confederate States' soldiers as a crane shot pulls back to show the devastation, finally coming to rest on a tattered Confederate Navy Jack. The implication here, as elsewhere in the film, is clear \u2013 this is very much the world of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, the belief that prior to Reconstruction, the Antebellum South was an urbane and benign society, with the Confederacy heroically fighting the corrupt Union so as to preserve the inherently honourable southern way of life. Important in this skewered worldview is the contention that the practice of slavery was a benevolent institution, protecting the \"coloureds\" from their own worst predilections, and who, rather than being abused, were treated like members of the family who owned them. Lee first saw Gone with the Wind on a third-grade class trip, and of the experience, he states,\r\n\r\n> _that film disturbed me. The imagery of Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen \u2013 \"I don't know nuthin' 'bout birthin' no babies\" \u2013 I mean, there was no discussion at all about the imagery._\r\n\r\nLee keeps up the confrontational tack in the film's second scene, as _BlacKkKlansman_ segues into the first of two key scenes to reference another important filmic text set during the Civil War; D.W. Griffith's 1915 masterpiece _The Birth of a Nation_. This scene depicts the fictional cultural anthropologist Dr. Kennebrew Beauregard (Alec Baldwin), who, in grainy black-and-white footage tries to alert the audience to the fact that the negorids are attempting to take over the country. Obviously inspired by maniacs like Alex Jones, Beauregard is about as irrational as they come, and his frustration as he continually flubs his lines superbly undercuts any claim he may have to seriousness. But what's especially well done is how Lee uses _Birth_ to mock this type of individual. As footage of the film plays behind Beauregard, his face is erased of its colour \u2013 he is literally rendered white enough to become part of the projected image, which, of course, depicts a narrative built around the inherently virtuous nature of being white. It's a powerful shot that clearly tells us, yes, this is a comedy, and yes, these people are ridiculous, but also alerting us to the fact that Lee is not playing around here; he's going to use every filmic tool in his arsenal to get his point across.\r\n\r\nAnd what is that point? The cultural instability of the United States in 2018, with its entrenched institutional racism, an entire race of people once again being treated like second class citizens because of the amount of melanin in their skin, hateful rhetoric masquerading as national pride, the breakdown of the distinction between xenophobia and patriotism, and the transition of hate crimes from the fringes of society into the realm of social acceptability. The film suggests that organisational racism once existed half-way between the absurd and the dangerous, but in recent years, it has moved in the wrong direction. Even before we get to the chilling closing montage, Lee and his co-writers (Charlie Wachtel, David Rabinowitz, and Kevin Willmott) have dropped a few subtle allusions to Trump's presidency. In one scene, Stallworth confidently asserts that it doesn't matter how much of a legitimate businessman Duke becomes, and no matter how much he hides his racism behind more patriotic rhetoric such as immigration and crime, the country would never elect a crass, hate-filled racist as president. In another scene, Duke explains he and the KKK are \"_making America great again_.\" These two allusions would be enough to get the point across, but it would also mean that that point remains in the realm of comedy, and is therefore easily dismissed. The closing montage changes that, as it drops all pretence of humour in depicting what happened in Charlottesville, and Trump's asinine response (\"_You had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides_\"). This is very much a state-of-the-nation address.\r\n\r\nIn relation to _Birth of a Nation_, of course, things are more complicated than they are in relation to _Gone with the Wind_. Yes, the film is horrifically racist, and yes, it was singlehandedly responsible for the 20th-century revival of the KKK, but it is also probably the most important film ever made, and literally wrote the book on screen grammar. Conceivably, _Gone with the Wind_ could be removed from the canon and no longer taught, but _Birth_ absolutely could not. It is a foundational text, an undeniable landmark film, completely independent of its politics. Lee saw it during his first year at NYU, stating,\r\n\r\n> _they taught us all of the cinematic innovations Griffith had come up with, but they left out everything that had to do with the social impact of the film. That this film re-energized the Klan. The Klan was dormant, it was dead, and the film brought about a rebirth. Therefore, because of the rebirth of the Klan, it led to black people being lynched, strung up, castrated and murdered, but that was never discussed! I have no problem with Birth of a Nation being screened [\u2026] but let's put it in context, let's discuss it._\r\n\r\n_Birth_ is based on Thomas F. Dixon, Jr.'s 1905 novel T_he Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan_ - the second book in his KKK trilogy (the first is _The Leopard's Spots: A Romance of the White Man's Burden - 1865-1900_ (1902), and the third is _The Traitor: A Story of the Fall of the Invisible Empire_ (1907). As these titles suggest, all three novels valorise the practises and institutions designed to oppress black people, whilst depicting emancipated slaves and Yankee carpetbaggers as the \"real\" villains behind the Civil War, positing that the plight of the freedmen during Reconstruction was a direct result of their liberation (i.e., they (and the south in general) would have been better off had they remained slaves). In Dixon's depiction of the lawless society of the south, created by the Union, where coloureds can walk around freely, southern whites have become the target of racial violence, with freedmen being particularly fond of raping white women. In the trilogy, the Klan are depicted as arising from this maelstrom, honourable and heroic men forced to reluctantly take the law into their own hands so as to stop the rampage. So influential was the film that the modern KKK practices of wearing white hoods and burning crosses come from it, not from the original 1865-1871 incarnation of the Klan.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, Lee uses the film twice \u2013 in the Beauregard scene, and in a later scene where his use of it speaks to the formal complexity of his own work. One of the most important of Griffith's innovations was that of parallel editing (better known today as cross-cutting), something we all take for granted in everything from films to commercials to music videos. In a nutshell, parallel editing is when two separate actions from two separate locations are intercut to suggest they are happening simultaneously, often, but not always, to heighten tension. It's one of the most fundamental components of screen grammar, so much so we don't even think about it today \u2013 we just take it as given. However, Lee's genius in this scene is that he uses _Birth_ to mock the Klan by way of, you guessed it, parallel editing. As the KKK sit down to watch _Birth_, Lee intercuts their enjoyment of its absurdities with Jerome Turner (Harry Belafonte) telling the story of the barbaric lynching of Jesse Washington, which saw a crowd of over 10,000 people in Waco, Texas, cheering on as his testicles and fingers were cut off, after which he was slowly burned to death by being continually raised over a fire. Lee uses parallel editing here so as to have one scene comment on the other \u2013 he is literally using _Birth_'s own innovations against it and what it represents. _Birth_ may be politically abhorrent, but Lee is savvy enough to not only recognise its technological importance, but to co-opt that importance and use it for his own ends, showing us the stunned reaction to a vicious murder contrasted with a celebration of the conditions which led to that murder.\r\n\r\nAs all of this may suggest, yes, the film is preachy, but that's because Lee is preaching. He makes no apology for such. This is polemic filmmaking, and the move into heavy didacticism in the final montage is completely earned.\r\n\r\nOn a more formal level, Lee thematically employs many of the aesthetic devices for which he has become known \u2013 whether it's a pronounced dutch angle during Stallworth's phone conversations with the KKK to indicate just how surreal the whole thing is, disembodied heads fading into one another during a powerful Ture speech, or, of course, the double dolly shot, which he has used in most of his films to suggest disillusionment and\/or the characters' inability to control their own actions as they are inexorably pushed forward, divested of the contextualisation of their environment.\r\n\r\nAll of this is not to say the film is perfect, however. For example, it relates the apocryphal story that when Woodrow Wilson saw _Birth_, he commented, \"_it is like writing history with lightning_.\" Wilson never said this; the quote was most likely the invention of Thomas F. Dixon Jr., who was promoting the film at the time. Lee must know this, and it does his cause no good to perpetuate a lie. How he employs the double dolly also raises some interesting problems, suggesting, as it does, that orthodox black activism and underground black militancy must combine forces in the face of hate. The film also glosses over Stallworth's time in COINTELPRO, where he worked to sabotage radical black organisations, because this doesn't fit into the overarching theme the film is constructing. Making Zimmerman Jewish is also troubling (the real person he was based upon is known only as Chuck, and all we know about him is that he definitely wasn't Jewish). Is Zimmerman supposed to represent Republican voters who abhor the KKK as much as the political left do? Who knows, because beyond being Jewish, there's no further character development; he's more of a rhetorical device, a meme rather than a person with an inner life. Similarly, the fictional explosion towards the end of the story serves to distastefully simplify everything, once more making the KKK look foolish, something which is wholly unnecessary at this point in the film, whilst also positing Stallworth as a clich\u00e9d movie hero, something Lee has avoided up until this point.\r\n\r\nThese are relatively minor complaints, however. Look, Lee is far from my favourite filmmaker. I really disliked _Malcolm X_ (1992), for example, probably his most celebrated film, and he has justifiably been accused of racism himself on multiple occasions. None of that, however, changes the fact that this is an hilarious, powerful, insightful, and frightening piece of work.\r\n\r\nVital filmmaking from an angry filmmaker.\r\n\r\nAlso nice to see Clay Davis\u2026sorry, Isaiah Whitlock, Jr. pop up in a throwaway part, but still get to deliver his catchphrase. Seriously, how many actors these days have a catchphrase?

Allow me to disagree (almost) entirely. _Black Panther_ is a great film, not because it breaks the mould, but because Marvel Studios has a successful pattern and _Black Panther_ adheres to it completely. Obviously the importance of a lead who is not just black but actually African is not to be understated, we have the least white cast of any superhero movie to date and they absolutely killed it, all very important socio-political stuff, to be sure. But the bones of _Black Panther_, the plot, the script, the events, the turns, all of that, it's a carbon copy of what's worked 17 times before.

And apart from Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and Smeagol (Andy Serkis), everybody\u2019s black. And that\u2019s the way it should be.\r\nThe entire cast delivers. Boseman is excellent as king T\u2019Challa who struggles with his new role. It doesn\u2019t get any easierr when Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) shows up. Killmonger is a mean SOB yet you care for him (some good writing right there). He\u2019s a worthy adversary and one of the better Marvel villains. Jordan portrays him perfectly. Director Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan are a match made in heaven. This is their third collaboration after \u2018Fruitvale Station\u2019 and \u2018Creed\u2019 and again they\u2019re successful. The movie itself gets better as Jordan\u2019s role gets bigger.\r\n\r\nThe female characters and actors are equally impressive. Especially Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) and Okoye (Danai Gurira) steal the show.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s less humour in \u2018Black Panther\u2019 than we\u2019re used to seeing in Marvel films but that\u2019s not a bad thing. The movie doesn\u2019t need it.\r\n\r\nThough it\u2019s set in (fictional) Africa there wasn\u2019t any filming done in Africa. Nonetheless the movie looks right. The makers did a great job of creating Wakanda. Huge props to costume designer Ruth E. Carter and composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson who help bring Wakanda to life.\r\nOn the downside there\u2019s a lot of CGI. Sometimes it\u2019s too obvious (rhinos say hi). Despite that the battle scenes are beautifully choreographed. Especially Okoye wielding her spear is a thing to behold.\r\n\r\nAll in all \u2018Black Panther\u2019 is another wonderful addition to the MCU and we can\u2019t wait to see what role T\u2019Challa and his sidekicks are going to play in \u2018Avengers: Infinity War\u2019.","id":"5bf85f999251415cc80f0b3e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bf85f999251415cc80f0b3e","movie_id":284054}

Not only is the lead actor great as T'Challa\/Black Panther, but the supporting cast does a fine job as well, especially the female actors. T'Challa is surrounded by smart, strong women. Marvel seems to break its villain curse with Klau and especially Killmonger. Killmonger is very well developed and even sympathetic at times, despite his villainy.

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"Overrated due to political correctness; it\u2019s noble and has its points of interest, but it\u2019s also kinda meh\r\n\t\r\nRELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Ryan Coogler, \"Black Panther\u201d details events when T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman) takes over kingship of the hidden African nation Wakanda after his father passes (John Kani). The kingdom is technologically advanced due to its secret resource Vibranium, a priceless, almost magical metal. Unfortunately, T\u2019Challa\u2019s reign is challenged by an angry American former-black ops soldier, Erik \u201cKillmonger\u201d (Michael B. Jordan).\r\n\r\nWith its black director and mostly black cast (with a couple of token white dudes), \u201cBlack Panther\u201d was overhyped and overrated upon release. Critics were apparently afraid of being called \u201cracist\u201d by liberal fascists if they dared to be honest and say anything negative (rolling my eyes). The movie\u2019s likable and certainly has its points of interest, but the characters are rather dull, except for Killmonger, and the story isn\u2019t all that involving. It\u2019s basically a mediocre superhero movie that has some blatant Bond-isms and is set apart by its primarily black cast and African locale. It fails to rise to the entertainment level of even \u201cAnt-Man\u201d (2015).\r\n\r\nStill, it\u2019s respectfully noble and the story provokes interesting questions, like isolationism vs. internationalism and African-American culture vs. Native African culture. But there\u2019s some eye-rolling bits, like when Shuri (Letitia Wright) calls CIA agent Ross (Martin Freeman) a \u201ccolonizer,\u201d which isn\u2019t even accurate. Maybe it was supposed to be a joke.\r\n\r\nThe waterfall fight between the Black Panther and Killmonger was an homage to the first issue of The Black Panther series in Jungle Action: Issue #6, September, 1973. At the end of that comic\u2019s story T'Challa and Erik fight at the top of a waterfall culminating with Killmonger throwing Black Panther over the cliff. This issue was the beginning of the \"Panther's Rage\" storyline by Don McGregor (featuring artists Billy Graham, Rich Buckler and Gil Kane), which ran for over two years in 13 issues of Jungle Action #6-18 and 209 pages, including the Epilogue. Many consider it the first graphic novel. Of course, this wasn't the first appearance of the Black Panther (who debuted in 1966), but it was the first issue where he was the starring character. \r\n\r\nAnd it was this series that provided the intriguing exposition on T\u2019Challa, Wakanda and its citizens, visitors & enemies. It\u2019s a travesty that McGregor, who created the characters of Killmonger & W\u2019Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) and conceived this exposition, wasn\u2019t acknowledged in this movie; shameful.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 14 minutes and was shot in Georgia (Atlanta, Fayetteville), South Korea (Busan) and Iguaz\u00fa Waterfalls, Argentina. Ironically, nothing was shot in Africa.

{"author":"Dsnake1","content":"The Black Panther is a fun romp, but it definitely has some issues. First, the good.\r\n\r\nThe action is fun, the emotions hit home, and the story isn't dirt-poor. \r\n\r\nWhile the CGI gets ripped on from time to time, I thought it was solid enough for a Marvel movie. The fight scenes were relatively well-choreographed, as well. The ritual combat scenes were exciting and visually appealing. The fights in Korea were also fun to see, and while I'm not a fan of car chase scenes as a whole, I did enjoy this one. It was reminiscent of a James Bond movie. \r\n\r\nIn fact, that's another appeal, at least to me. The secret technology base and the fun action scenes were a great callback to James Bond-type movies. I do think the movie would have been complemented by giving T'Challa a similar vice as Bond's, although Marvel probably wouldn't veer down that line for the seemingly morally absolute King of Wakanda.\r\n\r\nThe story, well, it's a mixed bag. Everything seemed crammed together with major emotional keys being rushed through or somewhat ignored. The concept is fine though. A long lost relative comes to challenge the new king, wins, and shows his colors, becoming something amoral. The king comes back and takes down the usurper, realizing something about themselves\/their kingdom in the process. It's tired, but not so tired it damages the movie. \r\n\r\nThis is where the issues begin to rise, though. The movie is really a movie and a half or two movies crammed into one. Wakanda has a ton of wonderful mythology, but almost none of it is explained. The movie never really explains how the Wakandans used vibranium was used to make themselves wealthy. It touches on it in some exposition, but there was much more that was just glossed over. \r\n\r\nIn addition, W'Kabi became radicalized by Killmonger much too quickly for such a pivotal relationship to flip. Some of the emotional aspects of the movie fell flat because they weren't given enough screen time. \r\n\r\nDespite its flaws, Black Panther is a fun movie that adds to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It should have been two movies, but I doubt this is the last we'll see of Wakanda.","id":"5af0b71092514119a6000099","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5af0b71092514119a6000099","movie_id":284054}

I think_ Bone Tomahawk _and_ Dragged Across Concrete _have multiple characters and viewpoints, and I write all of my stuff from the viewpoint of the characters. If you watch_ Bone Tomahawk _and say, well, what the author really thinks is what Brooder (Matthew Fox) thinks, then you're going to come away with one point of view. If you think the author thinks what Arthur (Patrick Wilson) thinks, then clearly the author is Christian and pushing that forward - which is probably not the case with a Jew-turned-atheist such as myself. And that's something I've seen in a bunch of pieces, that it was a Christian movie._\r\n\r\n> _This is a thing I do as a writer: I put what the characters are doing and thinking on the line and in the piece much more than me putting out a single idea or a philosophy for people to latch hold of. Now at this point in time, people are falling all over themselves to make sure they aren't labelled this or that, and I'm fine with whatever anyone wants to take away from my movies. I think with_ Dragged Across Concrete _and_ Bone Tomahawk_, it's pretty hard to step away and say there's this singular viewpoint from all these characters, and that all these scenes reflect it. In fact, I think it's impossible. I think one needs to ignore a lot of what certain characters do, and then say, well, what these characters are doing and saying, that's what the author really feels. So then what you're doing is bringing in your judgment of the author, and looking for evidence to support it, rather than looking at the material that's at hand._\r\n\r\n> _In the case of_ Dragged Across Concrete_, I think it's a very complex world; there are a lot of differing viewpoints that show a lot of different people have different struggles. I understand why some people would say that my films are conservative - because there isn't a clear didactic, if not pedantic, agenda at the fore of these pictures. But I'm writing stuff that I find compelling, and I'm not going to stop writing a scene, or change a character's ethnicity, or remove a line of dialogue, because I think someone might interpret it in a certain way, or be offended by it.

I hope people enjoy them, but I'm not going to make different creative choices so that more of them do. If you come into a movie and you're very focused on one thing - like you're very interested in how people of this ethnicity or people with this belief system or women or children or people from Canada are treated in this movie, that's your viewpoint, and you're entitled to it. If the most important thing for you to get out of the movie experience is to see a reflection of your personal beliefs, you probably won't get that with any of my movies because they don't even consistently line up with themselves._\r\n[...]\r\n> _I am not looking for films to express values. That's getting dangerously closer to an 'agenda movie', which is a movie in support of its thesis statement. My characters drive my movies._\r\n\r\n- S. Craig Zahler\r\n\"The Director Who Doesn't Care What You Think of His Movies\" (Scott Tobias); _The Ringer_ (March 22, 2019)\r\n\r\nIn writer\/director S. Craig Zahler's superb feature debut, the horror-western _Bone Tomahawk_ (2015), a man is held upside-down, literally split down the middle with a machete, and his body pulled apart by his legs; another man has a hot metal flask pushed into a gaping wound in his stomach; and a group of pregnant women have their eyes gouged out and their four appendages removed (off-camera, thankfully). In his second film, the fatalistic but excellent prison drama _Brawl in Cell Block 99_ (2017), a man has his face dragged along a concrete floor, until the skin quite literally rips away from his skull. In his third film, the epic crime drama _Dragged Across Concrete_, a man has his innards pulled apart and examined in an effort to find something he has swallowed. I guess the fact that he's already dead when it happens represents a degree of artistic maturation on the part of Zahler.\r\n\r\nOkay, so I'm being flippant. The fact is that I loved both of Zahler's previous films, so much so that I sought out a few of his novels. And I loved them too. Apart from the technical proficiency with which his films are made, I admire how they represent a throwback to true Grindhouse, embodying the phrase, \"_they don't make 'em like that anymore_\". Synthesising several disparate genres, and featuring sudden and extreme violence, both _Tomahawk_ and _Brawl_ have an air of self-seriousness bordering on narcissism, and methodically paced narratives (they each run 132 minutes). In _Dragged_, the gore has been toned down considerably (although not the violence), the nihilistic worldview is even more apparent (the fictional _milieu_ in which the film is set makes the Baltimore of _The Wire_ look like Beverly Hills), the genre mashup is more complex, and the pace is even more languorous, with the film running a whopping 159 minutes. Not so much about the horrific things that can happen to you on the street (although it is certainly partly about that), _Dragged_ is more concerned with the horrific things you have to do to survive, and how in such circumstances, you can rationalise and justify pretty much anything. And make no mistake; this is a morally repugnant piece of utter trash cinema, ugly and stoical in equal measure. However, it has also been made with extraordinary craft and a tacit disregard for prevailing taste. Sure, it's crude, exploitative, and demoralising, but it's also immensely enjoyable.\r\n\r\nSet in the fictional city of Bulwark, the film begins with Henry Johns (an excellent Tory Kittles), recently released from prison, returning home to find his drug-addicted mother Jennifer (Vanessa Bell Calloway) turning tricks in her bedroom, whilst his wheel-chair-confined younger brother Ethan (Myles Truitt) is kept quiet with PlayStation videogames. Disgusted with the situation, Johns determines to get his family out of Bulwark, and asks his old friend Biscuit (Michael Jai White) if there is any work going, the kind that pays cash and doesn't ask questions. Meanwhile, Det. Brett Ridgeman (Mel Gibson) and Det. Anthony Lurasetti (Vince Vaughan) bust a Latino drug dealer, with Ridgeman standing on the man's head, unbeknownst that he is being filmed by a neighbour. Called before their boss, and Ridgeman's former partner, Chief Calvert (Don Johnson, still effortlessly cool), he has little choice but to suspend them without pay until the media lose interest in the story. However, this couldn't have come at a worse time for either man; Lurasetti is trying to save up money in preparation to propose to his girlfriend Denise (Tattiawna Jones), whilst Ridgeman wants to move his family out of the bad part of town in which they live, where his daughter Sara (Jordyn Ashley Olson) is being harassed by a local gang, and his wife Melanie (Laurie Holden), a former cop now suffering from MS, is miserable. In desperate need of money, and bitter about being suspended, Ridgeman contacts Friderich (Udo Kier), a criminal fixer, who puts him onto an upcoming score being run by Lorentz Vogelmann (Thomas Kretschmann). Telling Lurasetti he plans to rob the crew once they've carried out the job, Lurasetti says he's on-board. Meanwhile, Kelly Summer (a heart-breaking Jennifer Carpenter) is reluctantly returning to work after maternity leave. Suffering from severe separation anxiety, however, Summer's husband literally has to lock her out of their apartment to get her to leave. How these three storylines (Johns, Ridgeman\/Lurasetti, and Summer) collide is what makes up the majority of the narrative.\r\n\r\nIn North America, _Dragged Across Concrete_ opened in only a few theatres on the same day it was made available for streaming, and with next-to-no advertising (it doesn't have an official website and its Facebook page has only a few posts), it earned a paltry $144,000 against a $15 million budget. Rumours at the time suggested that Lionsgate, who distributed the film theatrically through their Summit Entertainment subsidiary, had demanded Zahler cut the film to an \"audience friendly\" 130 minutes. As he had final cut, however, he refused, and they cancelled plans for a wide theatrical release (not entirely unlike what happened with _Snowpiercer_ (2013), when director Bong Joon-ho refused Harvey Weinstein's demands to cut the film by 20 minutes).\r\n\r\nNarratively, although Dragged is easily Zahler's most densely plotted film thus far, much like his previous work, it's predicated on character rather than story. Spending considerable time on relatively inconsequential conversations that do little to advance the plot, but add layer upon layer of character information (think the \"_royale with cheese_\" scene from _Pulp Fiction_), Zahler takes this style directly from hardboiled crime fiction. Traditionally the first scenes to go after the assembly edit, it's an easy technique to misuse (just look at all the failed attempts to emulate Quentin Tarantino post-_Pulp Fiction_), but Zahler knows when and how to employ it, and he's in no rush to get from one scene to the next. One particular example depicts Lurasetti eating an egg salad sandwich in near real-time, as Ridgeman becomes more and more irritated by the noise of masticating, eventually growling, \"_a single red ant could have eaten it faster_\".\r\n\r\nNo spoilers, but one plot strand in particular benefits greatly from the accumulation of slowly-revealed background information, so when it erupts in sickening violence, the emotional impact is all the stronger, because we've gotten to know this person; think of the character of Breedan (Dennis Haysbert) in Michael Mann's _Heat_ (1995), think of how soul-destroying it is when we see his girlfriend Lillian (Kim Staunton) watch the news report about the score, a scene that works as well as it does because Mann spent time introducing us to the characters despite them seemingly having nothing to do with the rest of the film. Zahler takes it much further than Mann, however. If the Breedan subplot was a pseudo-novelistic detail, Zahler seems to have edited in something from another movie entirely, an altogether more surreal film where people are overly friendly to one another, completely at odds with the world inhabited by the rest of the cast. He drags these scenes out to the point where they almost become infuriating (almost) - but when he lets the hammer fall, its impact is earth-shattering, and probably the emotional highpoint of the film (and by highpoint, I do, of course, mean low-point; there are no highpoints in Zahler's films).\r\n\r\nThe script is also dynamite from start to finish, with some fantastic lines sounding like they were ripped directly from Michael Mann; Johns, for example, tells Biscuit, \"_before I consider that kind of vocation, I need to get myself acclimated_\", whilst he reminds Ethan, \"_pops is a yesterday who ain't worth words_\". This kind of highly expressive overly literal way of speaking is exactly the way the aforementioned Breedan speaks (\"_there ain't a hard time been invented that I cannot handle_\") or Frank (James Caan) in _Thief_ (\"_I got some A-B-C type information for you, lady. I was state-raised, and this is a dead place. A child in eight-by-four green walls, after a while you tell the walls \"my life is yours\"._\"). This kind of dialogue has two main functions; obviously, it keeps things lively (not easy to do when you have so many long dialogue scenes), but it also illuminates character; Lurasetti, for example, is easily the more laidback of the two cops, saying things like, \"_it's bad like lasagne in a can_\", which is not the kind of simile one would image Ridgeman coming up with.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, _Dragged_ is exceptionally accomplished. Working with his regular cinematographer, Benji Bakshi, Zahler stages most of the film either at night, or in shadows (or both), so much so that a central scene in a well-lit building in the middle of the day seems completely washed out and garish by comparison. Brian Davie's production design is also worth mentioning, with the characters' living spaces completely soulless, all muted neutralising colours and generic furnishings, like they've moved into a showroom and haven't bothered to bring their own stuff or repaint; the places that are supposed to be the most personal and intimate are instead completely anonymous (it's telling, for example, that Calvert's office gives off a warmer vibe that either the Ridgeman or the Johns apartments).\r\n\r\nWearing his influences very much on his sleeve (directors such as Jules Dassin, Don Siegel, Jean-Pierre Melville, Arthur Penn, Sidney Lumet, Michael Mann, and Quentin Tarantino; and novelists such as Charles Willeford, Elmore Leonard, Donald E. Westlake, and George V. Higgins), and given what his films say about masculinity, violence, revenge, and justice, it's no surprise that Zahler is often singled out as a quintessential right-wing filmmaker in a very left-leaning Hollywood. Although he claims he's not especially interested in politics, and asserts that he didn't vote for Donald Trump in 2016, nor does he plan to do so in 2020, the _Daily Beast_ still referred to him as \"the Hollywood filmmaker making movies for the MAGA crowd\", which is not only unhelpful and reductionist, it's not even accurate, as there is nothing in his films to suggest he subscribes to Trump's hateful and divisive rhetoric (it is possible, after all, for one to be a right-wing conservative without being an advocate of Trump's self-serving politics).\r\n\r\nThat said, with _Dragged_, if Zahler isn't explicitly engaging in socio-political commentary, then he is epically trolling the left and baiting outrage culture. This is a film partly about two racist cops who complain about political correctness, trial by social media, and metrosexuality (amongst other things), and who use (gun) violence to try to set their world to rights. And who plays these two cops but noted Hollywood conservatives Mel Gibson (still somewhat under the cloud of his 2006 anti-Semitic rant and his 2010 \"raped by a pack of niggers\" comment and domestic violence charge), and Vince Vaughan, who rather amusingly believes the way to tackle gun violence in the US, is to introduce more guns as \"_deterrents_\". This casting seems like provocation in and of itself (one assumes Clint Eastwood, James Woods, Roseanne Barr, Tim Allen, and Hulk Hogan were busy), and one can picture Zahler getting not inconsiderable satisfaction from watching SJWs losing their minds trying to parse the metatextuality of casting Mel Gibson, of all people, as a violent racist; as, probably by design, it's legitimately difficult to tell where Gibson ends and Ridgeman begins.\r\n\r\nHowever, to be completely fair, it's in relation to this point where _Dragged_ is most open to divergent interpretations. Namely, does Zahler simply depict the characters' racist and misogynistic antics, or does he sympathise with and therefore condone their toxic mindset? Either the film confirms what Zahler's previous work only hinted at, that he's a far-right reactionary, or it demonstrates his satirical flair, ridiculing such accusations by leaning into and foregrounding the tropes of an ideologically to-the-right paradigm. Of course, many will have made their minds up on this issue without even seeing the film, especially given Gibson's involvement, whose casting is either a stroke of ironic genius or a tell-tale sign of an inherent retroactive conservatism.\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to the film's socio-political stance, or lack thereof. Despite Zahler's claims that it's not political in any way, it's hard to deny that some of the dialogue and events seem to have a political flavour (and, as some have argued, if Mel Gibson is playing a racist in your movie, then your movie, by default, cannot be apolitical). So, for example, racism is played for casual humour when Lurasetti proclaims, \"_I'm not racist. Every Martin Luther King Day, I order a cup of dark roast_\". Even more telling is Calvert's claim that\r\n\r\n> _being branded a racist in today's public forum is like being accused of being a communist in the 50s, whether it's a possibly racist remark made in a private phone call or the indelicate treatment of a minority who sells drugs to children. The entertainment industry, formerly known as the news, needs villains._\r\n\r\nThis comment will instantly call to mind Trump's never-ending refrain of \"fake news\", and it returns us to the question of Zahler's personal stance. True, he certainly doesn't outright condone Ridgeman and Lurasetti's behaviour and opinions, but neither does he outright condemn them. Neither man is presented as a hero, but neither is presented as a villain. Indeed, the case could credibly be made that this is Johns's story before it is Ridgeman or Lurasetti's, and were Kittles a bigger star, one assumes he would have had top billing. But this doesn't change the fact that the two are unapologetically cruel to non-Caucasians - seen most clearly when they throw a drug dealer's partially deaf girlfriend into a cold shower and refuse to give her a towel. In relation to the area in which the Ridgemans live, in an early scene, we are shown a gang of black youths cruelly hassling Sara, and later, Melanie says, \"_I never thought I was a racist before living in this area_\". That's a hell of a loaded statement in a film that's apparently not interested in issues such as race relations.\r\n\r\nMoving away from racial issues, as Ridgeman and Lurasetti sit in a diner, Ridgeman is listening to the song on the radio, and they have this exchange;\r\n\r\n>**BR**: _Is that a guy or a girl singing that song?_\r\n\r\n>**AL**: _Can't tell._\r\n\r\n>**BR**: _Not that there's much of a difference these days._\r\n\r\n>**AL**: _I think that line was obliterated the day men started saying \"we're pregnant\" when their wives were._\r\n\r\nAnd then there's this statement by Ridgeman to Calvert about the broken system in which they find themselves (a system to which Calvert has adapted, whereas Ridgeman has not);\r\n\r\n>_for a lot of years I believed that the quality of my work, what we do together, what I did with my previous partners, would get me what I deserved. But I don't politic and I don't change with the times, and it turns out that shit's more important than good honest work. So yesterday, after we stop a massive amount of drugs from getting into the school system, we get suspended because we didn't do it politely._\r\n\r\nIt's hard not to hear Zahler himself behind an impassioned sentiment like this, someone who may believe (and may be correct) that PC culture has gotten to a point of unworkable absurdity. This, in turn, raises the most difficult interpretive conundrum of the film - does he endorse old-fashioned _Dirty Harry_-style anti-authoritarianism, where hatred for politicking is equalled only by the belief that guns are a necessary part of life? Does he lament the fact that the traditional patriarchal aggression of white conservative America finds itself at odds with the rest of the world, or does he just understand people who feel that way?\r\n\r\nRunning parallel to ambiguities concerning racism and political correctness is a perceived misogyny in his work. All three of his films depict relatively helpless women who must be saved from evil men by righteous men. However, what the female characters experience in _Dragged_ is much harsher than in his previous work; not only are they again presented as victims who need saving, they are brutalised and murdered without much of an afterthought. So again, is Zahler himself part of a patriarchy that thinks of women in this way, as inherent victims who require men's protection, or is he simply in a position to understand such a mindset? In relation to all three ambiguities (race, political correctness, misogyny), I don't have an answer, but the line between critical commentary and ideological endorsement is razor thin, and it's a line that Zahler walks throughout. Which is one of the things that makes the film so fascinating. The first film he's made that is more likely to alienate audiences because of its perceived ideology than its violence, Zahler takes risks that other filmmakers would never dream of, and whereas most artists would be falling all over themselves to ensure there's not a hint of racism or misogyny about their work, Zahler's \"death-of-the-author\"-style tactic and refusal to do so makes this his most politically interesting and ideologically complex film thus far.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are a few formal problems. For starters, although this is ostensibly Johns's story, compared to either Ridgeman and Lurasetti, he receives a relatively light backstory. The two cops are simply better-written characters; their dialogue is sharper and more revealing, their arcs more thought-out and interesting, their motivations more complex and relatable. You could say that this is because of the strength of the actors; Gibson brings a brooding cynicism to Ridgeman - he never even hints at smiling \u2013 that's virtually metatextual, and Vaughan is all sarcasm and one-liners. Kittles, on the other hand, is essentially reprising his role as Laroy from _Sons of Anarchy_. But the fact is that Gibson and Vaughan have a lot better material with which to work - they're written as people, whereas Johns is written as an archetype, void of much in the way of interiority. Another problem is that because of the way the script is written, no one is ever put in a position of challenging Ridgeman and Lurasetti's prejudiced views; so there's never a scene, for example, where Johns calls them out on their casually racist language, forcing them to justify it. With their views unchallenged, and Johns not actually in possession of much of a worldview, there's a sizable imbalance in the film, an imbalance which doesn't equate with endorsement, but doesn't encourage criticism either.\r\n\r\nThat said, however, I thoroughly enjoyed _Dragged Across Concrete_, and much like _Bone Tomahawk_ and _Brawl in Cell Block 99_, the fact that I enjoyed it so much left me wanting to have a shower afterwards. It's not Zahler's best, but it is his most complex, and his most socio-politically interesting (and whether he likes it or not, his films are going to be read through a political lens). Easily dismissible as a right-wing manifesto, a championing of a bigoted worldview in which white men backed into a corner must use violence to reassert their dominance, there is much more going on in the film than such binary politics would suggest. It's certainly more to the right than the vast majority of Hollywood output, and there is a case to be made that Zahler is positioning himself as a conservative ideologue railing against cookie-cutter Hollywood political correctness. That doesn't necessarily mean, however, that he's avowing a white supremacist doctrine, or that the film is a hate-filled, alt-right diatribe, a paean to intolerance. Instead, both in terms of content and style, there's a lot more going on, which is exactly what makes it so fascinating and so engaging. It's not a message movie; it's a Grindhouse B-movie character piece, with terrific dialogue, a trio of strong central performances, and a rising sense of dread that gets into your bones. Is it self-indulgent? To an extent, yes. Is it unapologetically incendiary? Absolutely. Will you find it offensive? Possibly. You may see it as shining a not unwelcome light on a culture of inherent racial intolerance in law enforcement. You may see it as commenting on a world where women are expected to be mothers and full-time workers. You may find it appallingly racist itself. You may shake your head at its endemic misogyny. You may refuse to engage with it at all because of Gibson's presence. And that ambiguity, more than anything else, speaks to its quality as a provocative work of art.","id":"5d670ff5b5bc2100126f17ed","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d670ff5b5bc2100126f17ed","movie_id":438674}
{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nThis is the third canon (or official if you\u2019re not familiar with anime terms) Dragon Ball movie, after Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods and Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection \u2018F\u2019. So, unless you kept up with the anime, this film isn\u2019t for you. Just letting you know right off the bat.\r\n\r\nI would love to be able to describe in words what Dragon Ball means to me, but I can\u2019t. It\u2019s impossible to create a sentence that seamlessly lets you know how nervously excited I was right before the movie started. Yesterday, it was my first time watching my favorite anime on the big screen, and oh my God, it was AWESOME! Finally, I watched a film that I was highly anticipating, and I actually enjoyed it. Finally! I was tired of expecting big things from movies I really wanted to become a huge success, just to get ultimately disappointed. Broly is everything I wished for and more. Nevertheless, I must advise you: this animated flick is NOT for a casual moviegoer! \r\n\r\nIf you stopped following Dragon Ball after Z or you don\u2019t even know what DB is, you\u2019ll basically be lost. You won\u2019t recognize certain characters, you won\u2019t understand how and why some guys are still alive, and you\u2019ll have no clue about how strong our warriors became. This is for the fans. I\u2019ve seen critics bashing this film to shreds, and they start their reviews stating \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the anime.\u201d Then why would you watch a movie that clearly follows the anime\u2019s story and review it? Just leave it alone! It\u2019s like watching Avengers: Endgame without ever watching a single one of the 21 previous installments. It\u2019s just nonsensical. So, with that out of the way, and assuming I\u2019m writing for fans of the anime \u2026 \r\n\r\nThis is the best Dragon Ball film ever, by a long shot. Yes, the track record wasn\u2019t that good to begin with, and most of the movies released aren\u2019t even canon. Still, Battle of Gods and Resurrection \u2018F\u2019 were pretty great, especially the former. Broly easily surpasses these two, in almost every aspect. Of course, I need to be fair to those first films. Dragon Ball Super elevated the anime once again and brought it back to the mainstream, so obviously, Broly had a lot of advantages since the studios offered everything they could so that the movie would be a major success. When the first two films were released, Super didn\u2019t exist yet. Basically, these first movies were trying to bring back Dragon Ball to life while Broly is all about keeping it alive and showing it still has tremendous potential.\r\n\r\nThankfully, it all worked out perfect. The box office results are mind-blowing which will surely guarantee the continuation of Super (I\u2019m waiting every single day for the news of the series renewal), and the film is, in fact, astonishing. The animation quality is absolutely jaw-dropping. You know when you go with friends to watch a movie and something so awesome occurs that you just look at each other in awe of what just happened? That\u2019s Broly every single minute from the moment the fight begins. Super gave the fans a glimpse of what the animation level could be if time was not an issue for the animators. The Tournament of Power arc is undeniable proof that when the production leaves the animators work with no pressure, the end result is outstanding.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s just so freaking awesome. This is the only word in the dictionary that can reflect how crazily good the animation is. Awesome. There are so many long sequences of choreographed fights, with the animation always on-point, and with exceptional editing. The aspect I love the most is probably how fast it all is. Finally, I can understand Krillin when he says \u201chow are you following that?!\u201d Everything flows in such a flawless style: the characters, the blasts, the environment, everything. The sound design is incredibly powerful, as well. From the get-go, you know you\u2019ll feel every punch, kick, \u201cKamehameha\u201d and \u201cGalick Gun.\u201d Goku, Vegeta, and Broly provide so many amazing action scenes, and I know I\u2019ll constantly rewatch them once they become available. God, Super ended a year ago, and I still find myself watching the final fight with Jiren every week or so.\r\n\r\nHowever, Dragon Ball isn\u2019t about the fights. Yes, everyone loves them, and there are a lot of fans who only care about the actual moment when our heroes fight their enemies. As a hardcore fan of the saga, it\u2019s so much more than that. If characters like Goku and Vegeta, but also Piccolo, Gohan or even Frieza didn\u2019t exist, their battles wouldn\u2019t have the same impact. They mean something because these characters are important to me. I care so much about them because they were beautifully-developed throughout hundreds of episodes. I know that fillers can be a bit boring, but for me, they were just another way of getting to know these characters. Give me twenty minutes of banter between Goku and Vegeta, and I\u2019ll be the happiest man on Earth, right now.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll put it this way: if you enjoyed Battle of Gods more than Resurrection \u2019F\u2019, you will love DBS: Broly as much or more than I do. If it\u2019s the other way around, the first half of this film might leave you a bit disappointed. If you\u2019re one of those fans who only care about the fights, you can leave the first 45 minutes with barely any Goku or Vegeta to me and the other fans who care about the story. I heavily praise Akira Toriyama\u2018s screenplay. This is the big difference to the other non-canon movies: they weren\u2019t written by someone who really understands the characters at their disposal. Toriyama knows exactly who Broly is, where he comes from, and how he lived through his young years.\r\n\r\nHe wonderfully flushes out Broly by giving him an emotionally captivating backstory, filled with parent abuse, violence, and isolation from the rest of the universe. The history of Saiyans and Planet Vegeta is (finally) told entirely, by showing us characters that we all know and love, but that we were never able to see for more than a few minutes. Nevertheless, the standout character of the film is Broly. He has more screentime than any of the other warriors, precisely due to the reason I mentioned above: for us to care about him. Truth is, when they start fighting, I don\u2019t want anyone to win or lose, because I genuinely care about all of them. Toriyama wasted half of the movie to develop this \u201cnew\u201d character, and I 100% support his decision. Not only it generates more build-up to the inevitable climax, but it offers more layers to it. It stopped being \u201cjust a fight.\u201d\r\n\r\nObviously, there were going to be nods to the past adventures. I almost dropped a tear when Goku and Vegeta show up for the first time due to the soundtrack alone. You\u2019ll love every single \u201cflash\u201d regarding previous moments of Dragon Ball history, including the latest series and arc. Toriyama also does a remarkable job in helping fans that never watched Super trying to understand what happened after Z, even if he didn\u2019t need to. The comedy bits are hilarious, as they have been with the latest series. From Vegeta yelling at Goku for doing or saying something dumb, to Bulma\u2018s interactions with Beerus and Whis, every joke lands in one way or another.\r\n\r\nAs much as I love this film, it does have some issues regarding its mixing of CGI with animation. One of the things I didn\u2019t like at all in Resurrection \u2018F\u2019 was how some sequences felt like a video game. Unfortunately, there are a couple of moments like that in Broly. In order to keep the scenes flow without any cuts, CGI is necessary so the camera can change to another angle, and sometimes there\u2019s this feeling that you seem to be playing one of Dragon Ball games. However, my biggest gripe has to be with the overuse of visual effects. Using VFX to build rich environment and help the battles have more impact, not only doesn\u2019t work well but it\u2019s just not Dragon Ball.\r\n\r\nAs we reach the climax, the VFX overpower the animation, and that is never a good thing. The fight loses its animated essence, and it becomes something that I don\u2019t even know how to describe, except that it isn\u2019t what it was supposed to be. In addition to this, even though I stated that this movie is about Broly and Broly alone, I would have loved to see more from Frieza. He acts purely as a plot device, and there\u2019s barely anything for him to actively do, but he\u2019s still important to make the plot move forward. Finally, the pacing could have been more balanced. Since the ending is predictable from even before the fight begins, it feels that the film was a bit stretched to try to reach the two-hour runtime.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you\u2019ve seen all the trailers, you basically know the entire movie. That\u2019s why I keep advising my followers to stop watching trailers or at least all of them. If you really need visual confirmation that the film deserves your time and money, watch the first trailer and decide from there. Dragon Ball Super always gave spoiler-heavy previews of the next episode, and the movie literally shows everything. Even without watching a single clip from it, I couldn\u2019t escape the spoilers regarding the appearance of specific characters, which pretty much ruined any surprise the film could have offered me. Even with that in mind, I still think the ending felt a bit rushed, contradicting the somewhat slow pace during the first two acts.\r\n\r\nIn the end, there\u2019s no doubt about it. Dragon Ball Super: Broly is, by far, the best Dragon Ball movie to date, and it\u2019s really freaking awesome! It beats any other installment of the franchise, including the latest films. Akira Toriyama working together with a phenomenal team of animators is a match made in heaven. The story is remarkably well-written, with a full half dedicated to introduce and develop Broly as a mentally troubled child who had to deal with so much pain during his life. The animation reaches its peak quality-wise, demonstrating that when time is given to the animators, their work can be a visual masterpiece. With such an intriguing backstory on the history of Saiyans and a brilliantly structured build-up to an epic fight between Broly, Goku, and Vegeta, there was still time to cherish the nostalgia with some nods to previous moments in the beloved saga, as well as some hilarious comedy bits.\r\n\r\nWith more control over the use of CGI and visual effects, this could very well be one of 2019\u2019s best movies. It still can be, but the climactic final battle lost of a bit of its impact due to the overwhelming VFX which completely overcame the animation itself. The ending is predictable before we reach half-runtime, and the spoiler-heavy trailers didn\u2019t help to keep surprise as a factor. I have to repeat what almost every critic has been saying: if you\u2019re a fan of the saga and you kept up with Super, this will give you everything you want and more. If you\u2019re just a casual moviegoer or if you stopped watching after Z, it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t \u201cpoison\u201d social media with opinions on a film that simply wasn\u2019t made for you. \r\n\r\nThank you, Toriyama! Thank you for giving me the chance to see my favorite anime on the big screen for the first time, and for making it epic. Can\u2019t wait for the announcement of the series continuation \u2026\r\n\r\nRating: A-","id":"5c8bd9a8c3a3686465103c28","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c8bd9a8c3a3686465103c28","movie_id":503314}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I have to say that I liked this movie a lot. It is kind of fantasy, science fiction (emphasis on fiction here) and steam punk (or perhaps I should say diesel punk) mixed together.\r\n\r\nThe world is a fairly dark post apocalyptic world where moving predator cities prays on each other. The entire concept is really quite ridiculous of course but it makes for some really fantastic and spectacular special effects and I am a sucker for spectacular special effects.\r\n\r\nIn addition the overall story holds together fairly well. That is, in the context of the ludicrous world that is the background of this story in the first place of course. It is quite straightforward without too much annoying social or green preaching that plagues so many movies nowadays. Somewhat predictable but overall a good vehicle for the plentiful action.\r\n\r\nI also liked most of the characters. Both the bad guy and the good guys had decent charisma with the exception of Tom who was a bit of a naive whiner although he got it together towards the end.\r\n\r\nThere where  few flaws. Nothing really major except that, in one scene at the end, the city of London was shown against the wall and it was bloody tiny compared to the wall. The main bad guy\u2019s last resort was to pummel London against the wall and was expected to break it down. Before in the movie London was depicted as really huge. That scene really screwed that and made him delusional.\r\n\r\nApart from that, end Tom\u2019s whining and naivety, I really liked this movie. It was the kind of over the top, fantasy\/fiction movie with a big budget that you do not see every day.

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"_**A gentle, albeit very pedestrian drama about the importance of family during times of tragedy**_\r\n\r\n>_you never think it will happen to you. It was just a Friday night at a rock show. The atmosphere was so happy and everyone was dancing and smiling. And then when the men came through the front entrance and began the shooting, we naively believed it was all part of the show. It wasn't just a terrorist attack, it was a massacre. Dozens of people were shot right in front of me. Pools of blood filled the floor. Cries of grown men who held their girlfriends dead bodies pierced the small music ve__nue. Futures demolished, families heartbroken. in an instant. Shocked and alone, I pretended to be dead for over an hour, lying among people who could see their loved ones motionless. Holding my breath, trying to not move, not cry \u2013 not giving those men the fear they longed to see. I was incredibly lucky to survive. But so many didn't. The people who had been there for the exact same reasons as I \u2013 to have a fun Friday night were innocent. This world is cruel. And acts like this are suppose to highlight the depravity of humans and the images of those men circuling us like vultures will haunt me for the rest of my life. The way they meticoulsy aimed at shot people around the standing area i was in the centre of without any consideration for human life. It didn't feel real. I expected any moment for someone to say it was just a nightmare. But being a survivor of this horror lets me able to shed light on the heroes. To the man who reassured me and put his life on line to try and cover my brain whilst i whimpered, to the couple whose last words of love kept me believing the good in the world, to the police who succeeded in rescuing hundreds of people, to the complete strangers who picked me up from the road and consoled me during the 45 minutes I truly believed the boy I loved was dead, to the injured man who i had mistaken for him and then on my recognition that he was not Amaury, held me and told me everything was going to be fine despite being all alone and scared himself, to the woman who opened her doors to the survivors, to the friend who offered me shelter and went out to buy new clothes so i wouldn't have to wear this blood stained top, to all of you who have sent caring messages of support \u2013 you make me believe this world has the potential to be better. to never let this happen again. but most of this is to the 80 people who were murdered inside that venue, who weren't as lucky, who didn't get to wake up today and to all the pain that their friends and families are going through. I am so sorry. There's nothing that will fix the pain. I feel priviledged to be there for their last breaths. And truly beliving that I would join them, I promise that their last thoughts were not on the animals who caused all this. It was thinking of the people they loved. As i lay down in the blood of strangers and waiting for my bullet to end my mere 22 years, I envisioned every face that I have ever loved and whispered I love you. over and over again. reflecting on the highlights of my life. Wishing that those I love knew just how much, wishing that they knew that no matter what happened to me, to keep believing in the good in people. To not let those men win. Last night, the lives of many were forever changed and it is up to us to be better people. To live lives that the innocent victims of this tragedy dreamt about but sadly will now never be able to fulfill. RIP angels. You will never be forgotten._\r\n\r\n- Isobel Bowdery; _Facebook_ post written on November 14, 2015, immediately after the Paris terrorist attacks which took 130 lives and left 413 injured, 97 seriously. Two years later, one of the survivors committed suicide and was officially recognised as the 131st victim\r\n\r\nWritten by Mikha\u00ebl Hers and Maud Ameline and directed by Hers, _Amanda_ is a tender and gentle study of the importance of family in the wake of tragedy. Heartfelt and sincere, it shuns traditional filmic methods of eliciting emotion, instead presenting its story in a _cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9_ style as a series of semi-connected moments taking place over several months, rather than a tightly focused narrative with forward momentum and rising pathos. The pacing certainly won't be for everyone, nor will the absence of much in the way of psychological nuance, and the manner of the presentation does occasionally cross the line from passive observation into inconsequentiality. However, one certainly can't deny Hers's candidness and compassion.\r\n\r\nDavid (Vincent Lacoste) is a young Parisian who works part-time overseeing a letting arrangement for a local landlord and part-time trimming trees for the parks department. Not exactly the most ambitious person on the planet, his life is simple and uneventful, and he's quite happy with that. Estranged from his father, and having only sporadic contact with his English mother, Alison (a cameo by Greta Scacchi), his only real family are his aunt Maud (Marianne Basler), sister Sandrine (Oph\u00e9lia Kolb), and her seven-year-old daughter Amanda (an exceptional Isaure Multrier). David occasionally babysits for Amanda, and that's about as complicated and exciting as his life gets. Then, on a day like any other, Paris is rocked by a devastating terrorist attack, and David's world is turned upside down.\r\n\r\nThe attack in the film is a fictional composite of the real November 2015 attacks, and although it's very much the film's defining moment (in a narrative sense), it takes place off-camera; we only ever see the aftermath, and even then we're kept at a distance - no close-ups of victims, no scenes in barely-functioning hospitals, no grieving relatives anxiously waiting for news of their loved ones. Indeed, we never learn anything whatsoever about who's responsible beyond the fact that they're Muslim, nor are we made privy to why they did it, or the impact the attacks have on the city at large. The reason for such omissions is simple - _Amanda_ is in no way, shape, or form a political film. It's an intimate character study dealing with issues such as survivor guilt and the importance of family. But its focus is always on the micro (David and his family) rather than the macro (Paris at large).\r\n\r\nIn this vein, rather than showing us scenes such as the terrorists preparing, the resultant devastation, the police and\/or governmental response, or even the cultural effect of the attack, the film focuses on quiet moments of intimate domesticity \u2013 Sandrine explaining to Amanda what the phrase \"_Elvis has left the building_\" means; David and Sandrine discussing Alison; David's blossoming relationship with L\u00e9na (Stacy Martin), a tenant who he started dating a few weeks before the attack. Films built around events such as this are often dishonestly marketed as focusing on the \"_human stories_\" behind the headlines, but _Amanda_ feels like one of the very few that could legitimately make that claim \u2013 the family story at the centre of the film is very much intended as representational.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, the film is pretty straightforward. Although Hers shoots Paris in a _cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9_ style, so too does he play up the city's romantic connotations. He doesn't go so far as to recreate Jean-Pierre Jeunet's syrupy magical-realist _mise en sc\u00e8ne_ from _Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am\u00e9lie Poulain_ (2001), but there's definitely a whimsicality on display. So, for example, S\u00e9bastien Buchmann's cinematography is bright and wide-open, Caroline Spieth's wardrobe is airy and light, the sun always seems to be shining, people seem to have plenty of time to sit in caf\u00e9s drinking red wine, everyone appears to commute via bicycle, the roads never seem snared up with traffic, the streets are clean, the parks are vibrant etc. I'm not saying such tropes are in any way inaccurate or divorced from reality, but Hers overdoes it with the 'Frenchness' of the whole thing \u2013 all we're missing is someone selling cheese whilst playing the accordion and wearing a garlic necklace. We get it, Paris is a beautiful city. We don't need obvious reminders every eight seconds.\r\n\r\nThere is one particular scene, however, that's brilliantly staged. Unfortunately, it's the last scene of the film, so I can't say much about why it's so good. What I will say is that it connects back to an earlier scene beautifully, and Hers's shoots not what would seem like the logical focus, but rather keeps the camera locked fairly tightly on Amanda's face - thus the scene is about her reaction to a thing, rather than the thing itself. Multrier, who is exceptional throughout the film, is spellbinding in this moment, moving through a gamut of emotions, which she communicates despite having only five words to speak throughout the entire thing. Never once is it unclear what she's thinking or why she's reacting the way she is; her performance draws us in and we take the emotional journey she takes. It's easily the strongest scene in the film, and without it, _Amanda_ would have been a wholly forgettable experience.\r\n\r\nAs that might suggest, I have some significant problems with the film even aside from the clich\u00e9d visual design. To a certain extent, I admire Hers's refusal to deal with politics when looking at such a hot-button topic, but this refusal throws up a significant problem. The fact that the tragedy at the centre of the film is a terrorist attack is rendered irrelevant by how Hers handles the aftermath \u2013 replace the attack with a bad traffic accident, or a plane crash, or a gas explosion, or any other kind of incident that could cost so many lives, and you have pretty much the same movie. The film says nothing about terrorism, so why choose terrorism in the first place? If you want to tell a human story about dealing with tragedy, why do so in relation to such a politically sensitive issue with which you have no intention of engaging? It just seems counterintuitive to me, drawing attention to itself and away from the experiences of the characters.\r\n\r\nTied to this is that Hers doesn't completely ignore politics \u2013 there is one scene in which he touches on socio-political reactions to the attack, but it's a strangely written scene that not only feels out of place in the context of the apolitical material elsewhere but which is strangely handled even in and of itself. Walking through a park a few weeks after the attack, David and Amanda see a Muslim couple being harassed by some white people, who are demanding the woman remove her hijab. Amanda asks David to explain what's happening, and he starts talking about why religion is stupid. And then the scene ends. However, this woman isn't being harassed because she's religious \u2013 we're not shown scenes of people haranguing wimple-bedecked Catholic nuns \u2013 she's being harassed because she's a Muslim. So how does David's esoteric nonsense about why he thinks hell doesn't exist explain to Amanda what she has just seen? Are we supposed to infer that he's simply evading the question? If so, the film gives us no indication of such, and as this is the only moment where religion is explicitly addressed, we're not given any hints from anywhere else. Honestly, it would have been better not to include this scene at all and stick rigidly to the avoidance of politics and religion, as by including it, there's a feeling of evasiveness, of issues raised, only to be immediately and unsatisfactorily dismissed.\r\n\r\nSome other problems would include a real absence of any kind of psychological depth in any of the characters \u2013 we feel empathy for David and Amanda, but we never really get to know them, with much of what they do and say feeling like the machinations of a writer rather than the organic interactions of real people. Another issue is that the film has a strange habit of introducing characters almost at random, with little in the way of context, only for them to disappear after a single scene. The film is also limited in terms of how far it can go with the representational nature of David and Amanda's grief. Which is not very far at all \u2013 it always feels like we're watching a film specifically about an individual's response to tragedy rather than a film with anything to say about collective grief.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, although this might sound like I hated _Amanda_, there is a lot to admire in a film that is such a delicate, tender, and compassionate depiction of grief and trauma. The most memorable moments are the quietest ones \u2013 the impact of removing the toothbrush of a deceased loved one, for example, carries an emotional fallout that plays out over several scenes, which is not only relatable and understandable but, for anyone who has had to do something like that, it's wholly accurate. And although the film is, perhaps, too focused on understatement, which some will read as blandness, it remains a heartfelt depiction of the importance of family during times of tragedy.","id":"5e23cec38f26bc001377fd5f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e23cec38f26bc001377fd5f","movie_id":485166}

{"author":"moovies","content":"\"Don't Shoot, That's my dad!\"\r\n\r\nThese words still resonate days after I've watched this film. It's the first one in it's kind that addresses a dark page in Belgian history, you know the hellhole\/Chocolate factory.\r\n\r\nThis takes us back to the mid 80's when a local gang committed several robberies on supermarkets, all with excessive violence and low loot. This 'Gang of Nijvel' always made a lot of casualties with military grade weaponry and precision.\r\n\r\nStorywise this focuses on one family and their pain as they are all gunned down except the little boy who survives after he witnessed the murder of his entire family. A this is a true story, this is also very real as this person is still alive today and fighting against all odds to get it solved.\r\n\r\nThe movie does a great job in recreating these events and you can't help to cry a couple of times to the injustice in the investigation. You really feel the pain of the lead characters. Stijn Coninckx is truly our greatest director and once again he proves his worth in the shooting of this terrible tragedy.\r\n\r\nMain lead is Jan Decleir, our greatest actor, and does a fine job as the grandfather who takes care of his grandson after the murders. Jonas Van Geel however does a terrible job as the grandson, he is a comedian and not suited for a drama role. Terrible miscast and the only downside in the best flemish movie of the year(s).\r\n\r\nConspiracy has always surrounded the dossier, the movie also shines a light on the several 'errors' in the investigation and the lack of goodwill to solve it. Since the tragedy the police has been rearmed with better material and a political drama was in the making. It seems there is some truth in this and that there were greater powers at work to destabilize our country. The movie doesn't end in a closure as it's still not solved.","id":"5bf81c859251415cc80e86a7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bf81c859251415cc80e86a7","movie_id":550244}

{"author":"Larry","content":"Viewed this film at the theater this past weekend. From previous reviews we had read, we were truly expecting a great film.  When the film finished we were left with \"a that's it\" attitude.  At best a mediocre film.  The sound for the film was terrible, hardly audible in parts. Scenes did not seem to flow.  The actors were not a distraction, but they left us with the feeling that this was just another movie they are getting paid for.  Did not go to the movie for a religious perspective.  Open minded to any possible correction to beliefs assumed through the years.  It was amazing that I later found out that Mary Magdalene was considered a prostitute, and that it was not until 2016 that the Catholic Church changed her status to Apostle of Apostles. This did not come out in the film.","id":"5cb9100ac3a3683abf84382d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cb9100ac3a3683abf84382d","movie_id":407439}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is one weird movie. I have to confess that I am quite a fan of Nicholas Cage. I know he has made more than his share of really crappy movies but I can not help myself. When I see a movie with him in the lead role I still have to watch it. This movie is one of those.\r\n\r\nThere are definitely some interesting cinematic aspects to this movie. As a piece of cinematic art I would say that it is not bad at all. However, it is definitely weird and whoever wrote this script, well he was on drugs when he wrote it, there is no doubt in my mind about that.\r\n\r\nIt is part a grindhouse movie in the spirit of Tarantino and Rodriguez and part a far out  psychedelic visual experience. I do not regret watching it. It was a experience if nothing else. Was it a good movie in general? No, not really. The 3 out of 5 score from me is barely and it is largely due to the cinematics, a few cool (and violent) scenes and Nicholas Cage.\r\n\r\nThe movie seems to focus on delivering one weird scene after another. There is not really any explanation to most things. I especially would have liked to know more about and get more of a conclusion on this (supernatural?) bike gang. But they just show up and then they kind of disappear from the story.\r\n\r\nThe main bad-guy is an absolute nut-case but we never really get to understand what drives this weirdo. He has created some cult with a few followers but that is about it. His demise, although satisfactory, is just a show of insanity.\r\n\r\nIn short the movie is a mix of heavy metal, horror, violence and psychedelic weirdness and I would say that the audience for this movie is a quite small group of people. I\u2019m not really sure that I am in that group.","id":"5c9f37590e0a265977f837d8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c9f37590e0a265977f837d8","movie_id":460885}
{"author":"EmkEyen","content":"Ok, I can see what Panos Cosmatos is going for; riding the 80s vibe but going for heavy metal instead of synthwave. Set in the eighties, there are plenty of references to the cultural conglomerate of the era with glam\/speed\/heavy metal and fantasy art, b-action machoismo, outsiderness and self-imposed isolation. It is even haunted by the counter culture seventies with the vicious religious hippie cult and their LSD fueled motorcycle gang lackeys. \r\n\r\nThough anachronistic, I can see Mandy as an attempt of a drone or sludge metal album in a movie format or concert experience, as said were more a nineties evolution. The key elements are there for all senses; excessive slow tempo, cross processed colors, heavy distortions, huge delays and massive reverbs. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately it loses itself in this gloss and ends up superficial and pretty with more tiresome slow motion that an entire season of sport of your choice. The story churns from A to B with little character or evolution. The raw expositions become flat and pretentious. The violence that should be shocking becomes a tedious grind without any build up or tension. \r\n\r\nHonestly, I wanted to like this movie. I tried to watch it as a art flick by an auteur director, as a hommage to an era and even as a deadpan pastiche. I don't know what I'm missing, because for me it ends up not a denim and studs speedball but rather a pubescent fever dream through an instagram filter. \r\n\r\nHad it not been for the multiple credible names involved and the over the top stylistic finish, I think it would have passad as a retro exploitation revenge flick without much attention.","id":"5c3a936d0e0a2644370224ea","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c3a936d0e0a2644370224ea","movie_id":460885}
{"author":"tmdb36829509","content":"If Gulshan Devaiah came to me and told me that he wants my house I would willingly give it to him. Such is his magical charisma in the film (and in almost all) that I can't resist but start this review of Vasan Bala's second feature, Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota (The Man Who Feels No Pain) by singing his praises despite it being a masterful work of superb cast performances (including the lead Abhimannyu Dassani and Radhika Madan). He comes second in the silly yet full-of-life plot that narrates the story of Surya (Dassani), a young man born with a life-threatning rare disease which prevents him from feeling any pain, who yearns to push evil off the face of at least his small world. Helping him in his venture are the characters that I am in love with. In addition to Devaiah, Mahesh Manjrekar is the man who helps in making the film more memorable as you end the film humming that one number from the indie, upbeat soundtrack that has stayed with you and reminded you of a time when fun was simply watching a video of your favourite kung-fu hero in a VHS tape at your wealthy friend's house. Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota is brilliantly crafted by Bala with some of the best action choreography and music mixing I have seen all year this year. The humour is local, original, and bang-on ROFL material. If you are okay with shedding all threads of realism and watching a film for what it is (ultimate silliness) you will love this action comedy film more than I did. It is made for the generation of cinema consumers who would get it more if I use a certain term, so I will: it's on fleek.

{"author":"geekr","content":"_By JD Phillips, geekr.org_\r\n\r\nI think this is the strangest review I might ever write. Mostly because the film in question is a strange experience, unlike most others. It's simultaneously a brilliant piece of 80\u2019s horror art and an overindulgent mess that never figures itself out outside its influences. Basically, it\u2019s a film where it makes perfect sense for Nicolas Cage to scream, cry, laugh menacingly, and chug a whole bottle of vodka while on the toilet, wearing a tiger t-shirt and his tighty whities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf that sounds horrible to you or if it sounds brilliant to you, you\u2019re right.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can tell within seconds that this movie is going to be a trippy arthouse ride like you\u2019ve never seen before. Anyone familiar with director Panos Cosmatos knows his films are basically like falling through a portal on the side of a heavy metal album cover. It\u2019s a dark 80\u2019s grindhouse fantasy horror fest that is powerfully immersive in ways that most films don\u2019t come close to.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether you are watching scenes that take place within the Charles Mansonesque Jesus Freak cult, the animated tripfests, or Nicolas Cage chainsaw fighting (yes, you read that right) with a Mad Max style BDSM demon, you will find it nearly impossible to take your eyes off the screen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say that what you are watching will entirely be worth that attention. In the end, the film definitely feels like it\u2019s more style over substance. It never feels like it ever reaches the heights that it sets up. It relies too much on cliches from the genre it loves to ever truly be more than a beautiful homage. If you don\u2019t have a special place in your heart for heavy metal music and grindhouse action, there just won\u2019t be much here for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say that the cast doesn\u2019t give their all to prove themselves. Nicolas Cage gives his most insane performance to date. Fans of his from films like \u201cRaising Arizona\u201d or \u201cAdaptation\u201d won\u2019t find that actor here. Fans who love to watch clips of him being a mad-eyed psycho in \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d or \u201cFace\/Off\u201d will want to watch this film immediately. The man forges a battle axe and takes on the forces of evil with bloody rage as you\u2019ve never seen before.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe film drives into the actor\u2019s wackiness and this time it really works. This is definitely a film that needed Nicolas Cage. Maybe if \u201cGhost Rider\u201d would\u2019ve embraced the B-movie potential of its star, that film would be more memorable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is pretty excellent too. Andrea Riseborough shines as the titular Mandy. She brings a unique but grounded style to the character that makes you understand why these men fall in love with her so heavily. Speaking of, Linus Roache\u2019s cult leader Jeremiah Sand might be the best part of the whole movie.\r\n\r\n\r\nFans of \u201cVikings\u201d will be pleased to hear that Roache once again throws himself into a creepily sexual role with both feet. It\u2019s hard to match the level of weird Nicolas Cage can bring, but Roache gives him a run for his money. It doesn\u2019t hurt that Jeremiah Sand is the best-written character of the bunch.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rest of the cult members are pitch perfect in their roles. They all look like the director went to a bunch of real-life cults and picked his favorites. Each one brings a different kind of creep factor that really elevates the film.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the end, \u201cMandy\u201d is a wonderfully made love letter to its genre even if it fails to redefine said genre as much as it potentially could have. Its particular brand of artful bloody wackiness may not be for everyone, but those that love that sort of thing will have one hell of a good ride.\r\n\r\n\r\n**6.0 OR 9.0**\r\n_(DEPENDING ON WHICH WAY YOUR BREAD IS BUTTERED)_\r\n","id":"5bf2fae40e0a26266f084ded","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bf2fae40e0a26266f084ded","movie_id":460885}
{"author":"LachieD","content":"Being very intrigued and in parts fascinated with Beyond the Black Rainbow from a pure cinephile perspective, I was quite eager to see a new film by Panos Cosmatos. After learning about Mandy and what it was about, and seeing it being a bigger budget and more thought-out endeavour, I was of course very eager to see it. After finally watching Mandy it feels to me that Panos Cosmatos failed to deliver on the promise of his first film's virtues, and actually re-established his weaknesses as a director. Not that this is a negative opinion on this film overall. Just explaining how and why Mandy failed my high expectations. Take those sentiments as you will. Besides elements familiar from his first film, with very carefully stylized and mostly beautiful shots and scenes overall, a dreamlike, menacing and off-worldly setting, slow and meditative pace, Mandy also managed to surprise me on several levels. I really appreciated how Mandy, the character, was written and performed, like sort of a person who naturally dislikes and distrusts people. I think Andrea Riseborough did a brilliant job here, although physically, she appeared a bit anorexic to me. I don\u2019t know if she had weight issues that year, and I usually don\u2019t care about those things, but in this particular case her appearance felt a bit jarring to me. But I digress. Other things that majorly surprised me is how the cult was realistically portrayed (if we ignore the biker gang), for better or worse. It's like they were very purposely demystified, in every possible opportunity. And all that in the setting of mystification and stylistic painting of the world as fantastical, which confused the hell out of me. And nothing in this regard changes toward the end. The director, I feel, even chooses to emphasize on this more and more as the movie goes on. It's worth mentioning that Cage's performance, while excellent, was not \"baroque\", how he calls some of his wild performances, but very controlled, adding little to film\u2019s unearthly atmosphere. Most importantly, Mandy felt like a film with huge problems in both pace and elements that are tonally very disjointed, while each of these elements separately is excellent (faux fantastical setting versus the ugly reality of cult members' character and actions). Also, the part with the chemist really breaks down the narrative, in my opinion. That segment almost feels botched on purpose, Tarantino\/Rodriguez Grindhouse style, which is one of the main things I disliked in their double-feature. Still, Mandy contains plenty of fascinating parts for the film to be worthy of re-watching, and is not dull or tedious in anyway. There is some point to Mandy\u2019s fascination with pulp fantasy novels, and Red\u2019s subsequent revenge portrayed as a fantastical quest, but this curious idea alone doesn\u2019t help to liven up the film. Like I said earlier, this approach just doesn\u2019t chafe well with the cult remaining a group of barely threatening and very flawed individuals. Especially given the fact Red managed to overpower a much more dangerous and menacing group earlier in the film. The movie simply fails to ramp up in any manner toward the end, while the story and style demands that. Finally, it\u2019s just not the cult film I expected to see, and I think a lot of people felt the same, given the lukewarm scores. A kinetic, relentless, wild film, what it should have been. At least in its last third. It's just too...stilted. And sadly, I sense this is more a limitation of Cosmatos, than a strong, firm decision on his part. I am now much less excited after seeing Mandy about Cosmatos\u2019 next film, and I think he failed to put himself on the map with Mandy. The future will show.","id":"5be7742e0e0a263bf301c627","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5be7742e0e0a263bf301c627","movie_id":460885}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"The original Mary Poppins was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid and it kind of still is. Thus I was indeed a bit worried when I sat down to watch this one with the kids yesterday. After all there is really so many ways a incompetent writer could have screwed this one up. Especially one with an agenda.\r\n\r\nLuckily this was not the case and I have to say that I quite liked this movie.

The days before every easily offended retard tried to make every movie into a preaching mouth piece for their personal crusade.\r\n\r\nI think I liked the first half of the movie best. It was an explosion of song, magic and, for me, nostalgia. Apart from the hugely improved technology this movie had available to make the magic bits it actually felt like it could have been made back to back with the original. They really managed to capture the atmosphere from back then.\r\n\r\nIf I had to compare the two directly I would still go with the original as the best one. It was more imaginative and it just felt a bit better two me.\r\n\r\nThe story is a bit of a rehash of the original. They could have come up with something more original. Also, the second movie seemed to fizzle out a bit compared to the first half. I would have liked to see some more Mary Poppins coolness and magic, like we saw in the first half of the movie, instead of, mostly, conventional stuff.

The second feature from director and co-writer Panos Cosmatos, after the interesting, but not entirely convincing _Beyond the Black Rainbow_ (2010), _Mandy_ is a psychedelic experience in pretty much every way, and as midnight-y as a midnight B-movie could possibly be. And although it would be impossible to recommend to everyone, there is an undeniable brilliance here. An insane brilliance. But a brilliance none-the-less. Although it could (somewhat legitimately) be accused of too much style and not enough substance, Cosmatos pitch-perfectly mixes an expressionist aesthetic with horror tropes, a generic revenge narrative, and comedy beats. But let's face it, the reason most people will see the film is for Nicholas Cage, and in that sense, _Mandy_ joins the ranks of films such as Robert Bierman's _Vampire's Kiss_ (1988), Werner Herzog's _Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call \u2013 New Orleans_ (2009) and Brian Taylor's _Mom and Dad_ (2017) in giving Cage an organic, narratively justified reason to go full-Cage, digging deep into his reservoir of batshit insanity. And that's never a bad thing.\r\n\r\nSet in \"1983 A.D.\", the film tells the story of Red Miller (Cage), and his girlfriend, aspiring fantasy artist Mandy Bloom (Andrea Riseborough), who live a simple secluded life in the Shadow Mountains, in a cabin on the banks of Crystal Lake. Hugely supportive of one another, it's hinted that Red may have been an alcoholic and\/or drug addict in his youth, whilst Mandy has a significant facial scar, possibly the result of a troubled childhood, which she alludes to from time to time. All is calm in their life until Mandy is spotted by the Children of the New Dawn, a religious cult led by failed folk singer Jeremiah Sand (Linus Roache). Taken with Mandy's beauty, Sand tells his right-hand-man, Brother Swan (Ned Dennehy), that he wants Mandy, saying \"_you know what to do_.\" Using the \"Horn of Abraxas\", Swan summons the Black Skulls, a trio of demonic bikers addicted to a highly potent form of LSD, and along with the Skulls, the Children invade Red and Mandy's cabin, tying Red up in barbed wire outside, and leaving him for dead. Meanwhile, two female Children, Mother Marlene (Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9) and Sister Lucy (Line Pillet), drug Mandy with LSD and venom from a giant wasp, before presenting her to Sand. Singing his own song, \"Amulet of the Weeping Maze\", Sand attempts to seduce Mandy, but things quickly go awry when he proves unable to get an erection. Unbeknownst to the Children, however, Red has survived and set out in pursuit of both the cult and the Skulls.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that will jump out at you as you watch _Mandy_ is that Cosmatos packs the narrative with an extraordinary amount of cultural references, some oblique, others more obvious. Prior to hearing any dialogue, there is an audio extract of President Ronald Reagan speaking about how the vast majority of Americans are disgusted by porn. Mandy's art is not dissimilar to the work of Roger Dean, whilst the film's animated sections (of which there are several) recall the kind of material found in _Heavy Metal_. Indeed, the general aesthetic of the film is equal parts _Bat Out of Hell_ and Iron Maiden. The Children of the New Dawn cult is obviously inspired by the Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ and the Manson Family, with Sand himself part Jim Jones, part Charles Manson, and part Dan Fogelberg. The home invasion scene bears more than a passing resemblance to similar such scenes in Wes Craven's _The Last House on the Left_ (1972) and John McNaughton's _Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer_ (1986), whilst the revenge narrative has something of George Miller's original _Mad Max_ (1979) about it. The film also recalls Nicholas Winding Refn's _Valhalla Rising_ (2009) in places. Sand's \"Amulet of the Weeping Maze\" is inspired by the work of The Carpenters (which he admits himself). Red is seen wearing a M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce t-shirt, and tells an awesome Erik Estrada\/_CHiPs_ (1977-1983) joke. During a discussion about which planet is their favourite, Mandy selects Jupiter, but Red argues for Galactus. The Black Skulls are obviously inspired by the Cenobites from Clive Barker's _Hellraiser_ (1987). The Children's A-frame chapel resembles the church in Paul Thomas Anderson's _There Will Be Blood_ (2009). This is as culturally-literate a film as you're likely to see all year, and as much as the narrative exists in a kind of shattered-mirror version of reality, these references do help ground it, even if many of them are purposely anachronistic.\r\n\r\n_Mandy_ gets off to a cracking start by using the old Universal logo, complete with scratches and dirt on the celluloid. It follows that up with the most pseudo-John Carpenter 80s music imaginable, composed by J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson (_Sicario_; _Arrival_; _mother!_), in one of his last compositions prior to his untimely death, with guitar chords played by Stephen O'Malley of Sunn 0))). To give you an idea of the type of music featured throughout the film, there's an early shot moving across the forest scored to King Crimson's \"Starless\". Indeed, the score is almost another character entirely, and the film simply wouldn't work half as well if the music wasn't as good.\r\n\r\nAside from the music, the most immediately attention-grabbing aspect of the film is the use of colour, with director of photography Benjamin Loeb's compositions bathed in deep purples, reds, indigos, yellows, greens, and oranges, with the occasional blue (primarily associated with Mandy herself). Often the colours are non-diegetic and unexplained (for example the Horn of Abraxas always appears in green light, irrespective of location). The cinematography also employs a plethora of subjective techniques, such as double lens flares, animation, slow-motion fades and dissolves, telephoto shots, what can only be described as psychedelic lighting, and a hell of a lot of dry ice.\r\n\r\nVery much a film of two halves, if the first brings us the gates to hell, the second pushes us in and slams the gates shut behind us. The first half runs up until just prior to the beginning of Red's revenge, whilst the second depicts that revenge. The first half focuses primarily on Mandy, with Red very much a supporting character, whilst the second, obviously, focuses on him. However, it's not just in terms of narrative content in which the two halves differ, they are also aesthetically different, particularly the editing rhythms. The first is languid and dream-like, almost graceful, whilst the second is like something out of Dante Alighieri or William Blake, filtered through H.R. Giger on acid. The two halves are divided by an extraordinary single-shot 45-second scene of Red (wearing only underpants and a t-shirt) pouring vodka all over his wounds, drinking what's left, and screaming. It's a scene of extraordinarily raw emotion that works brilliantly, partly because scenes like it are so rare. You simply don't often see a male protagonist this vulnerable. This is _Mandy_'s \"suit up\" scene, and here is Cage crying like a starving baby. It's a brave choice by both actor and director, and it works perfectly both as a stand-alone scene and as a transition from the first to the second half of the film. Indeed, it's not beyond the realms of possibility that one could read _Mandy_, at least in part, as a meditation on the destructive nature of profound grief, and if so, that interpretation begins right here. Yes, there is more than a hint of an archetypal dualistic cosmology underpinning Red's revenge, particularly Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism, but so too is it a deeply personalised quest.\r\n\r\nEspecially in the second half of the film (and particularly in the last few minutes), Cosmatos strives to place us in Red's head, which has the effect of elevating the carnage beyond that of your standard ultra-violent revenge movie. As Red's mission progresses, and he becomes more and more unhinged, so too does the film become less and less interested in what we would refer to as reality, introducing such aspects as cannibalism, a bow named \"The Reaper\" and arrows which \"_cut through bone like a fat kid through cake_\", a chemist who can smell where the Black Skulls are, a stoned tiger, eels, a cigarette being lit via a flaming body part, choking via knife, (several) decapitations, a chainsaw duel, a church in the forest with secret underground passages, a skull crushing, hallucinations, even a cosmic event.\r\n\r\nThere are some problems, however. For starters, it's kind of disappointing when you realise that for all its technical prowess and fascinating aesthetic gymnastics, when it comes down to it, _Mandy_ is just a revenge flick, and at just over two hours, it tends to drag a little in places. The screenplay (by Cosmatos and Aaron Stewart-Ahn) can also be too on the nose at tunes. For example, early in the film, Mandy tells a story about her father attempting to force her to kill a baby starling that proves tonally prophetic in the way only stories in films ever doesn't give Red a huge amount of depth.\r\n\r\nIs there an element of the emperor's new clothes about the entire endeavour? Yes, to a certain extent there is.

{"author":"Stephen Campbell","content":"_**Earnest and heartfelt, but narratively awkward, and emotionally unengaging**_\r\n\r\n> _They say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. The problem with being human isn't really so temporary._\r\n\r\n- Nic Sheff; _Tweak: Growing Up on Methamphetamines_ (2008)\r\n\r\n> _Anyone who has lived through it, or those who are now living through it, knows that caring about an addict is as complex and fraught and debilitating as addiction itself._\r\n\r\n- David Sheff; _Beautiful Boy: A Father's Journey Through His Son's Addiction_ (2008)\r\n\r\nBased on the memoirs _Beautiful Boy: A Father's Journey Th__rough His Son's Addiction_ by David Sheff and _Tweak: Growing Up on Methamphetamines_ by Nic Sheff, written for the screen by Luke Davies (_Life_; _Lion_) and Felix van Groeningen (_The Broken Circle Breakdown_), and directed by van Groeningen in his English language debut, _Beautiful Boy_ is a film about the horrors of addiction, told from the perspective of both an addict and his father. Focusing primarily on David's attempts to understand and fight against his son's addiction to crystal meth, the film aims for a no frills _sans_-sentimental authenticity (Davies is himself a former heroin addict, who based _Candy: A Novel of Love and Addiction_ (1997) on his experiences; he also co-wrote the script for the 2006 film adaptation, _Candy_, directed by Neil Armfield). Serving as something of a showcase for the two lead actors (Steve Carell and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, both of whom are exceptional), there's little in the way of plot, with the film instead adopting a non-linear cyclical structure designed to mirror the repetitive nature of addiction-rehab-relapse-addiction-rehab etc. And whilst it is certainly heartfelt and respectfully told, there's little in the way of emotional engagement. The structure is also problematic insofar as because there's no real cohesive plot providing forward momentum, the highs and lows are undifferentiated, becoming repetitive. Van Groeningen also overuses flash-backs. So although the film may have an inherent degree of authenticity that's to be applauded, as drama, it isn't especially compelling, with the structure tending to work against the actors, blunting any emotional impact, and keeping the characters always at one step removed.\r\n\r\nLiving in Marin County, Nic Sheff (Chalamet) is an intelligent, popular, and kind teenager, who has a close relationship with his father, David (Carell), his stepmother Karen (Maura Tierney), and his two younger half-siblings, Jasper (Christian Convery) and Daisy (Oakley Bull). He is less close to his birthmother Vicki (Amy Ryan), who moved to LA after she and David divorced. David is a journalist for the _New York Times_, and Karen is a painter, with the family enjoying a comfortable bohemian middle-class existence. The film begins as David attends the offices of a drug counsellor and psychologist, Dr. Brown (Timothy Hutton). Explaining that Nic has become addicted to crystal meth, he wants to learn everything he can about the drug in order to best help his son. The story then cuts to a year previously. Nic has been missing for two days, and when he nonchalantly re-appears, David insists on taking him to rehab. He initially responds well, and soon requests to be transferred to a halfway-house, to which David agrees. A few days later, however, he flees the facility, and David later finds him strung-out in an alley. Taking him to hospital, Nic reveals he has been abusing not only marijuana and alcohol, but cocaine, ecstasy, and, especially, crystal meth. Back in rehab, Nic makes a full recovery, and heads to college to study as a writer, beginning a relationship with a fellow student, Julia (Stefanie Scott). However, having dinner in her house one evening, Nic finds a bottle of painkillers in the bathroom, and once more relapses, except this time he turns to heroin. With David still determined to help him overcome his demons, Karen tells David that he is neglecting his two younger children, and that Nic might be beyond a father's ability to help. Heartbroken, David agrees she is probably correct.\r\n\r\nThe most notable aspect of _Beautiful Boy_ is the structure, which is both cyclical and non-linear \u2013 the film is made up of a series of high and lows following Nic and David through relapse and recovery, whilst at the same time, there are multiple flashbacks, with scenes in the present giving characters occasion to think about moments from the past. For example, as David sits in a diner waiting for Nic to arrive, he thinks back to a much happier meal he had with his son in that same diner many years previously. This technique is used throughout the film, often flashing back to happier memories of Nic's childhood. The problem with this non-linear structure is that it's overused; there's barely a scene that doesn't have some kind of temporal cutaway. This overuse also dulls the impact of such editing, as after 45 minutes, you're just yearning for the film to stay put for a while. Sometimes the flashbacks do work, revealing something interesting, juxtaposing the past and present evocatively, or changing how we view the present, but a lot of the time, it feels like an unjustified piece of trickery, an end unto itself, insofar as there often isn't a great deal of establishing context. This leaves the viewer wondering, \"how did we get from that scene to this one. Why did what happened there make David think of this?\" This is pretty much the last thing you should be thinking about in a narrative of this nature, and it completely pulls you out of the film. Indeed, there are parts of the movie that so overuse the technique as to seem like a montage rather than a collection of actual scenes.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the timeline itself becomes confused within all of this, especially in the sense of where the movie's present is supposed to be. For example, there's a scene where we see David dropping Nic off to college, and the two of them enjoy a joint. As I understood it, this scene came after Nic had owned up to his meth addiction and gotten clean, but before he had met Julia and relapsed. Which obviously makes no sense, as the scene gives the impression David has no idea that Nic has been using drugs, surprised he even knows how to smoke a joint. So is his trip to college much earlier in the narrative? But if so, when, as it doesn't seem to fit anywhere else in the timeline? Again, these are not the kinds of things you should be concentrating on when watching what is supposed to be an emotive story, but more often than not, the editing foregrounds itself (the film is cut by van Groeningen's regular editor, Nico Leunen), pulling you out of the narrative.\r\n\r\nAs regards the repetitive nature of the story, I understand what van Groeningen was going for \u2013 it is supposed to mirror the back and forth nature of addiction (\"_relapse is part of rehab_\" as David is told), a two steps forward, one step back staccato motion. However, the film falls into a pattern of Nic showing up looking a little more dishevelled than he did before, followed by David doing everything he can to help, followed by his failure to get through to Nic, followed by Nic disappearing, followed by Nic showing up looking a little more dishevelled than he did before, etc. And whilst this may lend itself to a certain authenticity, it doesn't make for very effective drama. In any case, other filmmakers have found ways to depict the repetitive nature of addiction without compromising the story, not the least of whom would be Darren Aronofsky in _Requiem for a Dream_ (2000), who constantly uses a quick montage of the characters doing drugs to suggest the habitual nature of addiction.\r\n\r\nObviously enough, the main theme of the film is addiction, and in this sense, it gets a lot right. For example, in his journal, Nic outlines the vicious-circle that addicts fall into; he needs drugs so he does things of which he's ashamed to get money with which to buy them, but then because he feels so guilty about what he's done, he needs more drugs to cover the shame, so he does things of which he's ashamed to get money with which to buy them, and so on. He's also especially clear when describing the fact that after you've done crystal meth a few times, you don't get the same high from it, and so the addiction becomes all about attempting to recreate that first high (which Nic describes as making a black-and-white world appear in Technicolour).\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most fascinating aspect of the movie is that Nic is a prosperous and intelligent middle-class young man with a strong support system. He is a child of divorce, yes, but he has a good relationship with both of his parents. This is a far cry from the typical addict we see in film and TV, who are usually at the extreme ends of the monetary spectrum, either poverty-stricken and destitute (such as, say, Bubbles (Andre Royo) in _The Wire_) or extremely wealthy and high-functioning (such as Caspar (Geoffrey Rush) in _Candy_). Additionally, as he explains himself, he first tried drugs to see what they were like, and when he liked how they made him feel, he kept on doing them. As he says at one point, the first time he did hard drugs was the best feeling he'd ever had. During the aforementioned scene where Nic and David share a joint, Nic summates this, telling David that marijuana \"_takes the edge off the stupid all day stuff_\". There was no precipitating event, no great emotional trauma which made him turn to narcotics; his addiction is just something that happened, a disease to which anyone could succumb\r\n\r\nThe other main theme is that of the father-son relationship, and this too is well-presented. With both actors giving superb performances, one really sees the bond between the two, and how much Nic's addiction is destroying both of them. In this sense, the real tragedy of Nic's situation isn't the rehabs and relapses, it's seeing him drift further and further away from a man who would literally die to protect him. Given the source material, one does wonder a little if the relationship is idealised somewhat, but irrespective of that, Carell and Chalamet give a masterclass in acting, and I was genuinely shocked neither of them was nominated at the 2019 Oscars.\r\n\r\nWith lesser performances, the film would crumble under the weight of van Groeningen's heavy-handed direction. Thankfully the performances are strong enough that the style distracts rather than undermines. That said, the benefit of the non-linear storytelling is that it allows Chalamet and Carell to really drive home how much their relationship changes, with their playful and happy earlier scenes contrasting heart-breakingly with the fraught and destructive times of later years. Chalamet's is the more physical of the two performances, conveying so much via his body language. It's a world apart from his work in Luca Guadagnino's _Call Me by Your Name_, Elijah Bynum's _Hot Summer Nights_, or Greta Grewig's _Lady Bird_ (all 2017), as he completely inhabits the character, alternating between playing Nic as a sweet, loving, almost immature teenager, and a stressed addict, old before his years, and capable of anything to get money for his next hit. When he is rehabbing, there's a regret and humility in his performance that is nowhere to be seen when he relapses, as he becomes more manic and unpredictable, and much less self-aware.\r\n\r\nCarell, for his part, does most of his best work with his eyes, conveying the sadness and desperation he feels. His helplessness is written across his face, conveying how little he can actually do for his son. He initially approaches the problem in a logical manner (he does methodical pseudo-journalistic research on crystal meth to better understand it, he snorts cocaine to try to put himself in Nic's shoes), before eventually realising there is no logic at play here, and tackling the subject as he would an article for the _New York Times_ is not going to work. Carell plays David as confused, haunted, and desperate, with Nic's addiction, specifically his inability to break it, having as profound a psychological effect on David as it has a physical effect on Nic.\r\n\r\nDespite all of these positives, however, as indicated above, there are a number of problems. For one, van Groeningen chooses not to present some of the darker aspects of Nic's story. For example, he turned to prostitution at one point to fund his addiction. Additionally, as his hits from crystal meth continued to diminish over time, he started shooting it up, which is insanely dangerous. Leaving out aspects such as this gives the film a kind of sanitised feeling, as if we're looking at addiction through a gauze which the director refuses to pull back to let us see it directly. This kind of heart-breaking sordid detail would have helped the film immeasurably, especially in relation to its lack of emotional engagement.\r\n\r\nThis lack is probably the most egregious problem. A film of this nature, detailing something like this, and based on a true story, should be an emotional rollercoaster, but the audience is always removed, the emotions are seen rather than experienced, as if we're looking at the rollercoaster instead of riding it. Because the film introduces us to the characters mid-crisis, and because there's literally not a single scene that isn't either related to Nic's addiction, or a flashback from a scene related to his addiction, we never really get to know David or Nic outside this situation, with the script never really moving beyond David as \"dutiful father\" and Nic as \"desperate son\". Any sense we have of these two people comes almost entirely from the acting, and even then, although you certainly feel empathy and sympathy for them, you don't feel a huge amount else. The problem is that the plot (such as it is) never seems compelling, partly due to how narrowly focused the film is. It's also not a good sign that, for me, the most emotive part of the whole thing was hearing Nic himself reading a monologue from his book over the closing credits.\r\n\r\nThis dearth of characterisation is even more pronounced in relation to the two women, who may as well not be there. Karen has nothing to do but wander around in the background painting trees, whilst Vicki doesn't even get that much \u2013 she's a disembodied voice on the phone most of the time, and although I know she appeared in a couple of scenes, by the next day, I'd forgotten what she did in either of them. It's a real waste of two extremely talented performers.\r\n\r\nThere have been some truly great films made about addiction; Otto Preminger's _The Man With the Golden Arm_ (1955), Blake Edwards's _Days of Wine and Roses_ (1962), Jerry Schatzberg's _The Panic in Needle Park_ (1971), Gus Van Sant's _Drugstore Cowboy_ (1989), Danny Boyle's _Trainspotting_ (1996), Mike Figgis's _Leaving Las Vegas_ (1995), Scott Klalvert's _The Basketball Diaries_ (1995), Darren Aronofsky's _Requiem for a Dream_ (2000). Beautiful Boy is absolutely nowhere near anything of this calibre. In fact, it's probably more successful as a kind of instructional installation for relatives of people going through addiction than it is as a film evoking emotions. Told from the perspective of people living through this nightmare, the story is incredibly straightforward and forgettable, when it should be shocking, disturbing, and emotionally devastating. And whilst the film is definitely heartfelt, its lack of emotional engagement, its repetitiveness, its distracting structure, its lack of a plot, all serve to grate against the incredible performances.","id":"5d27f03e5f6c4965105dfd88","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d27f03e5f6c4965105dfd88","movie_id":451915}

His Character is this which must be worn as a Lamen before thee &c._\r\n\r\n- \"_Ars Goetia_\", in _Clavicula Salomonis Regis_ [_Lesser Key of Solomon_] (17th century)\r\n\r\nWhen her secretive mother dies, miniatures artist Annie Graham (Toni Collette), is almost relieved, as the two had a deeply fraught relationship. With two children, 16-year-old Peter (Alex Wolff) and 13-year-old Charlie (Milly Shapiro), and a loving husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), Annie is determined to do a better job of raising a family than she felt her mother did. However, when she suffers another, far more devastating loss, Annie's mental state becomes increasingly precarious, as a series of terrifying revelations about her ancestry are slowly revealed.\r\n\r\nHereditary is writer\/director Ari Aster's debut feature. However, what's worth noting is that the film is produced by Lars Knudsen, who also produced _The VVitch: A New England Folktale_ (2015). This is significant insofar as _Hereditary_ bears more than a passing resemblance to Robert Eggers's film. Mood, tone, theme, pacing, narrative structure, shot composition; all recall _The VVitch_ at times. Even the plot shares some important beats, most evident in the last shot, which is both narratively and compositionally identical to the shot in _The VVitch_ when Black Phillip speaks for the first time - a BCU on a possessed character as a disciple speaks off camera. And like _The VVitch_, you either go with the plot and let it burrow under your skin, or you remain detached and most likely find the whole enterprise unintentionally hilarious.\r\n\r\nIn a more generalised sense, there is quite a bit to praise here. For a start, to say the film is a horror is to basically give away the last 20 minutes, as up until that point it's a superbly realised semi-realist study of the crippling psychological disintegration that can accompany bereavement. Speaking of giving things away, very unusually for a Hollywood film, _Hereditary_'s trailer brilliantly misdirects the audience, making it seem as if the film revolves around the death of Annie's mother, when in actual fact, this plot strand is abandoned at the end of the first act, after which the death of Charlie becomes the central focus.\r\n\r\nOne thing the film does especially well is reward viewers who are paying attention. There are multiple hints and signs throughout of what is going to happen in the last act, and one especially well structured reward involves by far the creepiest moment in the film; the blond man standing in the shadows of the doorway, barely visible, smiling manically at Peter. This is actually the second time we see the character; he is also at the wake early in the movie, watching Charlie approaching the coffin, and, again, smiling unnaturally. This can be easily missed if you're not paying attention, and it's an extremely well realised pseudo-Easter egg. Also worthy of praise is Toni Collette, who gives a superb performance that partly recalls Shelley Duvall's hysterics in Stanley Kubrick's _The Shining_ (1980). Collette's ability to communicate everything in her psyche by simply changing her facial expression is outstanding, and somewhat reminiscent of that extraordinary piece of wordless acting by Halle Berry in the last scene of Marc Foster's _Monster's Ball_ (2001). This is especially noticeably towards the end of the film, when Annie is alternating between being herself and being controlled by Paimon; Collette's mastery of her own facial expression tells the audience everything it needs to know about what is happening.\r\n\r\nJoshua Rothkopf, in his review of the film for _Time Out_ calls it \"_a new generation's_ Exorcist.\" That's a bit over the top; it won't have half the same kind of societal impact as William Friedkin's film did, and it's nowhere near as good as the best horror film of the last few decades, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S\u00e1nchez's _The Blair Witch Project_ (1999). However, it's very well made, is creepy as hell, dares to put real grief on screen, and features excellent performances (and, thankfully, only a couple of jump scares). Well worth seeing.","id":"5cc15019c3a368708f80ad23","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cc15019c3a368708f80ad23","movie_id":493922}

{"author":"Max Tyrone","content":"While psychological horror movies seem to be a thing of the past, with movies of this nature cropping up once every little while, _Hereditary_ creeps along with the force of looming evil. This isn't an average Halloween, popcorn-at-the-theatre moviegoing experience. Instead, what we are presented with is palpable heaviness for the better half of two hours while tensions rise in a dwindling household and with some burgeoning Satanic undertones encapsulated in some of the darkest, most isolating atmosphere that contends with the likes of _The Witch_ and _Rosemary's Baby_.\r\n\r\nToni Collette plays Annie Graham, mother of two children - eldest son in high school, the youngest a girl possibly at the tail-end of middle school. With the recent death of her mother, Annie attempts again and again to reconcile with the misfortunes - to put it lightly - that befalls her family. Annie's psychological state dances between the forefront of the film, while the backdrop of lingering family turmoil boils to the top.\r\n\r\nThis is an unrelenting experiment in acceptance, both placed on the key figures in the film, as well as those watching. When watching, keep in mind the word \"control\" and discern whether Annie had any at all. This isn't a movie for anybody - I'd go far as to say that this movie isn't for the average moviegoer.

{"author":"moovies","content":"\"Style over substance\"\r\n\r\n'Gangsta' tells the tale of four friends who are out to make a quick buck. What better way than to deal coke in Antwerp, Belgium, the so-called coke capital of Europe. In doing so the four dealers trigger a war between them, two Amsterdam drug lords and a Colombian cartel.\r\n\r\nAdamo (Matteo Simoni), the main character and his three buddies look and behave like gangsters but are far from it. To them their new way of making fast money is a fantasy and that's what directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah want to make you feel. They glorify the whole gangster life and it shines through in the distinctive look of the film. It's a different take on the classic gangster movies but that doesn't mean it's better. While 'Scarface' is being referenced a couple of times the movie has more in common with Michael Bay's 'Pain & Gain'.\r\n\r\nIt all looks and sounds flashy but there's little underneath that shiny surface. The plot is rather simple and the characters are flat and sometimes downright annoying. The directors pull all sorts of tricks (visual and with the narrative) to blow you away but eventually it's overkill. El Arbi and Fallah have shown with their two previous movies ('Image' and 'Black') that they're capable of making dark gritty movies. I get that they want to show that they have more up their sleeve (the duo wants to break through in the US) but sometimes less is more. Take away half an hour of the runtime and it would have been easier to digest.\r\n\r\nAlthough all the blitz and glam can't hide the shortcomings of the movie it's still quite a fun ride. I can see it doing well among youngsters.\r\n\r\nKudos to Matteo Simoni who really shines as Adamo. Simoni who is known more for his comedy parts in Belgium is quite impressive. Debuting Nora Gharib is a gem and Dutch rapper Ali B is a great addition as the twisted Hassan Kamikaze.","id":"5bf85da39251412f3508b2c1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bf85da39251412f3508b2c1","movie_id":483552}

{"author":"narrator56","content":"Dirt Road to Lafayette is a low key film about grief, and using music to work through it. It follows teenager Murdo as he travels from Scotland to Alabama following the death of his mother. Murdo plays the accordion, but the tragic disruption in his life has caused him to set it aside for a while. It starts out as a sort of road movie, then, before settling down a bit.\r\n\r\nDuring a lull in the trip by bus to Alabama, Murdo hears accordion music being played. He seeks it out and finds Queen Monzee-ay, a regionally well-known cajun singer performing. He gets to know her and she invites him to perform with her in an upcoming event. Her attention and his experience with her people awakens Murdo's interest in his music. This causes a slight rift between him and his father, who out of good intentions is perhaps a bit controlling of his son.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed this movie. The story is strong and told simply. No flashbacks or dream sequences - what we get is a drama about grief and family, strong characters in an ensemble cast, and a lot of music. It doesn't hurt that I really enjoy Cajun music.\r\n\r\nIf I could suggest anything, I would like to have seen a bit more conversation between father and son. There is a lot of silent staring and halting tidbits which do convey their sense of loss. But as someone who lost my father and a brother at a young age, and whose family didn't talk a lot about it either, I felt I could almost have written some strong scenes of dialogue to show more character growth. But that is a minor observation. I would recommend the film to anyone, as long as they also enjoy or at least tolerate the music.","id":"5e8728449974ee0015b14835","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e8728449974ee0015b14835","movie_id":525931}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Moving ending, but the least of the Avengers movies IMHO***\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" chronicles events when the Avengers team-up with several allies to defeat the cosmic despot Thanos, whose goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones to attain unimaginable power and radically solve one of the Universe's most challenging problems.\r\n\r\nThe story focuses on Thanos, Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy, especially Gamora, as well as Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man. The rest of the cast members are more peripheral, e.g. Black Widow, Captain America, Black Panther, Vision and Scarlet Witch.\r\n\r\nThis is easily the least of the Avengers trilogy. Not to mention \"Captain America: Civil War\" (2016) and \"Thor: Ragnarok\" (2017) are significantly more compelling and all-around entertaining. Actually, all three Thor flicks are palpably superior, as is \"Iron Man 2\" (2010). If you haven't already, I encourage you to watch these movies prior to viewing \"Infinity War,\" as well as \"Black Panther\" (2018) and the two \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" flicks (2014\/2017); otherwise you'll likely be lost because all these movies lead up to this one.\r\n\r\n\"Infinity War\" is certainly an ambitious comic book movie in that it notably juggles so many super-beings, but this lack of focus isn't conducive to suspense or great drama. It's merely decent with overkill CGI. The big battle in the closing act with the easily slaughtered four-armed dog-creatures is curiously dull; moreover, the attempts at humor sometimes feel forced and fall flat, but several jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, e.g. \"Rabbit.\" Thankfully, the film adds moving drama and gets extra points for a bold, poignant climax, which sets up the 2019 sequel \"Endgame.\"\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 29 minute and was shot in New York City, Scotland and Philippines with studio work done in Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia.

As the world's Catholics cry out for concrete change, the pope instead provides tepid promises, all of which we've heard before._\r\n\r\n- Anne Barrett Doyle (_BishopAccountability.org_); quoted in the _Boston Globe_ (February 24, 2019)\r\n\r\nWhen one thinks of contemporary French cinema, few names seem as ill-fitting for a docudrama about an ongoing real-life case involving the abuse of children by a Catholic priest than Fran\u00e7ois Ozon, the prolific and formally inventive filmmaker best known for erotically-charged films such as _Sitcom_ (1998), _Les amants criminels_ (1999), _Swimming Pool_ (2003), _5x2_ (2004), and _Jeune & Jolie_ (2013). Originally planned as a documentary, _Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 Dieu_ [_By the Grace of God_] is a partly-fictionalised account of the case of Fr. Bernard Preynat and the formation of La Parole Lib\u00e9r\u00e9e [known in English as Lift the Burden of Silence], an advocacy group for victims of childhood sexual abuse. Probably Ozon's most formally conventional work, with none of his usual visual panache, the film was modelled after Tom McCarthy's exceptional _Spotlight_ (2015), which examined the Boston Globe's 2002 investigation into sexual abuse in the Boston Archdiocese going back decades. This comparison is important insofar as it speaks to Ozon's lack of formal gymnastics; in short, as with Spotlight, the conventional style is matched to the thematic seriousness, wherein neither director wants to run the risk of elements of the form distracting from the content (not that any visual or aural trickery would help either to tell their particular story). _Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 Dieu_, however, is not a Catholic-hit job; rather it depicts the institutional dissembling and prevarication as coming not necessarily from a place of evil, but from a desire to avoid another scandal. Nonetheless, the Church as depicted very much talks a lot about forgiveness and redemption, but seems to have very little understanding of justice or punishment. It's weighty stuff, and although it courts a narrative objectivity and stylistic restraint that often suggests a void of emotion, for the most part, this is undeniably powerful cinema.\r\n\r\nThe film begins in 2014 as Alexandre Gu\u00e9rin (Melvil Poupaud), a respected banker and devout Catholic, discovers that Fr. Bernard Preynat (Bernard Verley), the priest who he believed to have been defrocked for sexually abusing him, is not only still a priest, but is still working with children. He contacts the Archbishop of Lyon, Cardinal Philippe Barbarin (Fran\u00e7ois Marthouret), and is urged to meet with Preynat. He does so, hoping for Preynat's resignation, but although Preynat openly admits to molesting young boys, he refuses to apologise or admit to wrong-doing publicly. When the church says it can't take the matter any further, citing the 20-year statute of limitations, Alexandre, who has raised his five children in the faith, feels compelled to act, and so, very reluctantly, he takes his story to the press. He is soon contacted by Fran\u00e7ois Debord (Denis M\u00e9nochet), who also claims to have been abused by Preynat. Now an atheist, the more militant Fran\u00e7ois advises marshalling the power of social media, and has formed an advocacy group which he hopes will be able to stand against the church and see Preynat not just defrocked, but criminally convicted. Soon, Alexandre and Fran\u00e7ois are joined by a third man, Emmanuel Thomassin (a heart-breaking turn by Swann Arlaud), whose entire adult life has been negatively affected by his childhood.\r\n\r\nOzon originally planned _Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 Dieu_ as a documentary, and the screenplay is based on much of his own research, including interviewing the founders of La Parole Lib\u00e9r\u00e9e. Although the film's central trio are fictional composites, the sequence of events is closely based on real-life, whilst both Preynat and Barbarin are very real. Using his position in Saint Luc Scout Group in the parish of Sainte Foy-l\u00e8s-Lyon, Preynat is believed to have molested up to 85 boys over a thirty 30-year period, most between the ages of 9 and 12, and in July, primarily as a result of the events depicted in the film, an ecclesiastical tribunal imposed the maximum sentence by defrocking him. A criminal trial is scheduled for 2020, delayed partly because of the film itself, which Preynat's legal team tried to block from release, arguing it would prejudice a jury against their client. However, the fact that we're discussing the film at all should tell you how that ended. In March of this year, Barbarin was convicted of failing to report abuse, receiving a six-month suspended sentence. He offered his resignation as Archbishop of Lyon to Pope Francis, but Francis, \"_invoking the presumption of innocence_\", rejected the resignation, telling Barbarin to take whatever action he thought best. Barbarin subsequently announced that Fr. Yves Baumgarten, Lyon's vicaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral mod\u00e9rateur, would temporarily replace him until a more permanent successor could be found. In June, Bishop Michel Dubost was appointed Administrateur apostolique [Apostolic Administrator] _sede plena_, meaning that although Dubost is in charge of the Archdiocese, Barbarin, who's appealing his sentence, retains the title of Archbishop of Lyon.\r\n\r\n_Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 Dieu_ is a broadly dispassionate film, and one of the results of Ozon's shunning of directorial flourishes is that there's never anything even remotely sensationalistic. However, although his flamboyant inventiveness is largely absent, the narrative structure is aesthetically interesting. Rather than telling the stories of Alexandre, Fran\u00e7ois, and Emmanuel concurrently, Ozon structures the film in the style of a relay, giving the narrative over to each of them in turn. So at the end of act one, Alexandre meets Fran\u00e7ois, who then takes the narrative reigns, with Alexandre largely absent from act two. Fran\u00e7ois, in turn, then gives way to Emmanuel. Of course, there is overlap, and towards the end, Alexandre re-emerges as the protagonist, but what this style allows for is a slightly different story-telling technique for each man. Alexandre's act is largely epistolary, with the letters between himself and Barbarin read in voiceover. The formality of such a style nicely captures his formal relationship with the Church \u2013 he has no desire for a public scandal and believes in going through the proper channels. Once the far more bullish and theatrical Fran\u00e7ois takes over, the style becomes more confrontational (at one point, Alexandre has to talk him out of hiring a plane to sky-draw a penis above the Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Lyon, one of the film's few moments of levity). Then, in the third section, which focuses on the emotionally fragile Emmanuel, the film is at its most empathetic, with the formality of the first section and the rugged directness of the second replaced with a stronger sense of humanism and emotionality. In a film noticeable for its director's formal restraint, it's a well-handled and subtle way of matching form to content without necessarily foregrounding it. This structure also lends itself to exploring the psychological specificity of each man, making for a more ruminative narrative than would have been possible via concurrent editing.\r\n\r\nThis is important because Ozon is also interested in the mechanics of healing, with all three men dealing with their experiences in different ways, which, in and of itself, reminds us that whilst we tend to think of outrages such as this with a kind of collective mentality, the actual scars of abuse are as unique as each victim is from one another. Although Alexandre found strength in his faith, he has been forced to compartmentalise (\"_this is about morality, not faith_\"), which has put him constantly on the defensive about how his actions are not intended as a form of attack against the Church, arguing \"_it's about justice, not revenge_\" and \"_I'm doing this for the church, not against it_\", as he points out that \"_families need to know the Church will always protect children_\". However, whereas Alexandre reaffirms his faith, Fran\u00e7ois rejects his, arguing, \"_my faith is human, not Catholic hypocrisy_\", and whilst Alexandre urges forgiveness, Fran\u00e7ois argues, \"_if you forgive him, you'll be his prisoner forever_\". For Emmanuel, the process of healing seems barely to have begun, if it ever will. However, the film is especially unequivocal in asserting that for all three men, and by extension all victims of childhood sexual abuse, the trauma will never leave them, it's a part of who they are, not necessarily the main part, but a part nonetheless, a part with which they will always wrestle, with references to how \"_the burden of silence is heavy to lift_\" and how difficult it is to \"_live in the shadow of what he did_\".\r\n\r\nThematically, Ozon makes no bones about his disgust that Preynat sees himself as a victim, tearfully telling Alexandre, \"_I've always been attracted to children \u2013 it's caused me such pain._\" Indeed, he even intimates that the real villain is the Church itself for not stopping him. This is certainly one way of looking at things; the Church is unquestionably at fault for covering up and ignoring the actions of men like him, but that doesn't somehow absolve those men of blame. The institution is culpable, of course, but the responsibility for the act is non-transferable. The hesitancy of the Church to act in cases such as this is represented by Barbarin, whose failure to properly respond is sharply mocked when Ozon details his ridiculous focus on trivial aspects of the case \u2013 he's especially worried about the term \"paedophile\", arguing that because, etymologically, the word refers not to abuse but simply to loving children (it comes from the Greek \"pa\u00ees\" or \"paid\u00f3s\", meaning \"child\", and \"phil\u00eda\", meaning \"friendly love\"), it should be replaced by \"paedosexual\". Because that's what's important.\r\n\r\nFrom a more critical standpoint, Ozon overuses the epistolary format in the first act. I understand why he went with this approach, as (apart from establishing Alexandre's more formal relationship with the Church) it has to lay down a lot of background. But, for me, he goes overboard \u2013 at times the first act feels less like a coherent narrative held together by the epistolary form and more like a series of letters occasionally interrupted by \"on-screen\" events. This creates an occasional sense of dramatic inertia that wouldn't be a problem in a non-visual medium, but which can drag a film down. The film also occasionally finds it difficult to escape its origins as a documentary, with some scenes, notwithstanding the universally superb acting, feeling more like respectful yet clinical reconstructions rather than scenes in a narrative drama hoping for a degree of emotional connection. The fact that the case is still ongoing also robs the film of a natural structure, as if the story ends before we get to what we would expect to constitute the final act, and one wonders if perhaps Ozon wouldn't have been better waiting until the conclusion of the criminal trial.\r\n\r\nBut given the overall strength of the non-intrusive direction, the brilliance of the acting, and the clearheaded portrayal of such an emotive topic, criticising Ozon for such things seems almost churlish. Less procedural than the investigative journalism-basis of _Spotlight_, _Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 Dieu_ is no less honest or unsettling a film. It may be too controlled for some, whilst the measured pacing and hefty subject matter will undoubtedly put off others. Nevertheless, uncharacteristically solemn for Ozon, it is another important document on a subject that, sadly, seems unlikely to go away any time soon.","id":"5dce074acc277c0012e40023","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dce074acc277c0012e40023","movie_id":509364}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Lame-axx butt of a joke no longer*** \r\n\r\nArthur Curry (Jason Momoa) lives with his father on the Maine Coast, a caretaker of a lighthouse. With the mentorship of Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and the revelations of Mera (Amber Heard) he discovers that he is the half-breed heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis. As the rightful successor to the throne, he must tangle with his brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) to save the surface world from destruction. Meanwhile Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) seeks vengeance on Arthur for the death of his father.\r\n\r\n\u201cAquaman\u201d (2018) is a colorful superhero flick featuring a flashy action scene for every 5 minute lull. It\u2019s reminiscent of \u201cThor\u201d (2011) and \u201cThor: The Dark World\u201d (2013), but with spectacular undersea realms instead of Asgard & realms nearby. Yet the drama was better in those movies whereas here it feels like the creators were in a rush to jump to the next action sequence, which might make \u201cAquaman\u201d \u2018thrilling,\u2019 but less compelling story-wise.\r\n\r\nStill, it\u2019s very eventful with loads of energy (maybe TOO eventful for its own good). And I liked the balance of underwater scenes to surface scenes with spectacular locations, including the Sahara Desert and Sicily. Meanwhile Amber is stunning as redheaded Mera. Even Nicole Kidman shows up as Arthur\u2019s mother, Atlanna. Speaking of Arthur, Momoa is magnificent as the protagonist and will forever change the public\u2019s generally weak perception of Aquaman.\r\n\r\nThe film is a bit overlong at 2 hour, 23 minutes; and was shot in Australia (Hastings Point, Amity Point, Southport, Main Beach & Currumbin Beach); Newfoundland & Labrador, Canada; and Morocco (Erfoud & Merzouga).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B","id":"5c28f1c192514138d7c0a503","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c28f1c192514138d7c0a503","movie_id":297802}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I just came back home from watching Aquaman on the IMAX theater in Balexert in Geneva and thought that I should write something up while it\u2019s still fresh in my mind. Something that happens all too rarely.\r\n\r\nI have to say that, overall, I had quite a blast watching this movie. It is indeed a good superhero and special effects extravaganza. In addition it is quite beautiful. A lot of the underwater scenes are very pleasing on the eye indeed. I am quite happy that I managed to drag my ass over to a theater and watch it on a IMAX screen. Some of the hype around it is perhaps a bit too much though. It does not quite reach the masterpiece level after all.\r\n\r\nStorywise, well it is a superhero movie after all so if you expect the story to be profound, logical and watertight you should lay off those mushrooms or whatever you are smoking. That said, the story was not too bad. Pretty straightforward and not too convoluted. A good, solid story suitable for a action\/adventure movie.\r\n\r\nI did quite like the main protagonists on the good side. Especially Jason Momoa as Aquaman. I mean his time-to-kick-some-ass-stare was just so\u2026evil. The script writer had put some stupid shit in there where he had to play overly dumb at times but on the whole he was a good guy throughout the entire movie. Almost no whining, angst and anti-hero shit like what have totally ruined most of the Marvel TV-shows lately.\r\n\r\nThe bad guys were not too bad either. Orm was lacking a bit in the bad guy charisma department but Black Manta was oozing despicable bad bad bad asshole from the first scene to the last. I probably should not say this because his weird helmet is indeed true to the comics but, well, it\u2019s weird and kind of looks better in a comics than on the big screen.\r\n\r\nSpecial effects? Well, there is not that much to say really. They are pretty awesome throughout the movie and, as I wrote above, a lot of the time they are also beautiful. The various creatures, underwater vehicles and gadgets are really cool and well designed.\r\n\r\nThe one gripe I have about the movie is the totally unnecessary green preaching crap. Luckily it is confined to a couple of scenes but in those it is really slapped in the audience\u2019s faces. A superhero movie should be entertaining, not preaching. If I want that shit I can turn on the news. It\u2019s a star off from me just for that nonsense.","id":"5c2e36e192514164516c81ba","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c2e36e192514164516c81ba","movie_id":297802}
