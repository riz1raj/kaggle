The brainchild of Steve Ross (Major executive at Warner Communications) and the Ertegun brothers (Founders of Atlantic Records), the Cosmos got off to a rocky start in 1971, but things changed in 1975 when the world's most celebrated soccer star, the Brazilian champion Pele, signed with the Cosmos for a five-million-dollar payday. With the arrival of Pele, the Cosmos became a hit  and the players became the toast of the town, earning their own private table at Studio 54. A number of other international soccer stars were soon lured to the Cosmos, including Franz Beckenbauer, Rodney Marsh, and Carlos Alberto, but with the turn of the decade, the team began losing favor with fans and folded in 1985.","poster_path":"\/ubgZkHS1KoVILTH051zr47vMfDv.jpg","release_date":"2006-01-01","title":"Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":10,"popularity":2.546,"id_imdb":"tt0489247"}

This 60-minute documentary explores why some feel the \"Fed\" is a \"bunch of organized crooks\" (as John Adams put it) and others feel some of its practices \"are in violation of the U.S. Constitution.\" Discover why experts agree the Fed is a banking cartel that benefits mainly bankers, their clients in need of \"easy money\" and bailouts, and a Congress that would rather go deeper in debt than seek funding from its constituents. Long-term studies indicate the Federal Reserve System encourages war, destabilizes the economy (by causing boom and bust cycles), generates inflation (a hidden tax) and is the supreme instrument of unjust enrichment for a select group of insiders. If you are fed up with an ever-expanding state and corporations that are \"too-big-to-fail,\" look no farther than the fiat currency printed by the Federal Reserve System.","poster_path":null,"release_date":"2006-04-30","title":"Fiat Empire","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":2,"popularity":1.4,"id_imdb":"tt2040348"}

In 2003 filmmaker Tigre Hill chronicled the Philadelphia mayoral race between Democrat incumbent mayor, John Street and Republican challenger Sam Katz. Early polls showed Katz with a small lead. Hill had inside access to the Katz campaign and although rebuffed by the Street campaign, managed to get footage. Twenty-seven days before the election an FBI bug was found in the mayor s office. It looked like 1904 all over again-blatant corruption. The discovery of the bug at first seemed like a death knell to the Street campaign and a near certain victory for Katz. How did the mayor react to the bug? This powerful documentary shows how-drum up support by polarizing the electorate.","poster_path":"\/lBNvTnKUQzjMqcZnGqz69d6wyRJ.jpg","release_date":"2006-04-06","title":"The Shame of a City","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"popularity":0.6,"id_imdb":"tt0956309"}

Even without much in the way of drama at first, an at times nightmarish reality intermingles with nightmares, and, typically for a movie from this region, state bureaucracy and the absurdities of a semi-legal order play a role in moving developments along. So what is it that awaits our hero down the informal road he is officially sent? Complete deconstruction? Or the 'unbearable lightness of being'?

The artist who was killed in a car accident in 1999 steadily built, averse to conventions and trends, an autonomous oeuvre, indefatigably looking for the ultimate beauty. In daily life, he did so too; the artist wore out a throng of girlfriends, although in a sense he stayed faithful to both his wife and his only muse. He did not have the time to be a real father. 'With my father in the train with a Nuts bar', is the best childhood memory his sons have of him. Kees Hin tries to get closer to this complex man, who imputed a profoundly melancholic soul to himself, like the writer Marcel Proust, whom he admired so deeply. In three films, that play on the screen alongside each other and alternately appear in the foreground, via interviews - with people like his wife, his muse and his sons - and archive footage, we get to know more about his daily (emotional) life, his work and ideas.","poster_path":null,"release_date":"2006-08-24","title":"Jaap Hillenius, Trying to Get Closer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"popularity":0.6,"id_imdb":"tt1159538"}
