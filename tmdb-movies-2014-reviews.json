{"author":"Reno","content":"**The actors and their generation difference, evolution of cinema and the beauty of nature.**\r\n\r\nThis is about a middle aged actress who spends in the Swiss Alps with her personal assistant while preparing for the upcoming project. During that time, she receives a news that the author of the book which was adapted for the screen 20 years ago where she play a main role and now in its remake, she's doing another part, while a young sensation playing the main part. This is more like the evolution of cinema. The 20 years is too soon for her, while the cinema and its trend advanced rapidly. Precisely to say, the commercial films and young actors taking over the art films and true artists' places respectively.\r\n\r\nIf you at least 30 years old, you would get this film more than others. Because while I was growing up in the 90s, the cinema was so different. I'm not talking about the technology like computer graphics, but the story and how it was narrated for the screen. Now the science- fiction and dystopian themes taking over with the young audience and social media support. I think it was a quite meaningful film, particularly if you adore films like the recent evolution in cinema was so faster than ever.\r\n\r\nThe negatives were, the film was too long, slow pace and too simple drama. The positives were, the actors and their performances, the locations, theme and some of the dialogues. Directed by a French filmmaker, this is an international project with a few guest appearances. Most of the film was set in the Alps. Totally different than what I was anticipating, but I still like, except in a few parts where I got bored for its weak development. So this is for the selected audience, that mean it will be appreciated by a very few and I'm kind of neutral with mostly in its favour.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"581cfa52c3a3685ac90000d1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/581cfa52c3a3685ac90000d1","movie_id":246860}

{"author":"Max Tyrone","content":"On the way to accept an award from the playwright that discovered her - the very same man who suddenly passes away before the ceremony - acclaimed actress, Maria Enders, is forced to reconcile both her age and her role in contemporary art. While rehearsing for a role, of which she has no choice taking due to her age, she has to reckon with the young actress playing her old role.\r\n\r\nThis is a slow-paced movie, that is, it takes its time revealing the deteriorating confidence of an aging actress. What accentuates her strife are the locations: the lonesome mountains, long winding roads, both straddled by rolling, ground-smothering fog and clouds. Great lingering shots and cinematography eases the eye, as Maria rehearses and incrementally loses her mind with her young assistant, Valentine. Although her assistant attempts to defend what her boss deems as insufficient art (or cinema) and unprofessional (particularly the young costar of the upcoming play), Maria threshes with the stifling fact that her roles - both her role in the play and in the world of art - are changing without her control or consideration. \r\n\r\nThe acting in this film is commendable, with a solid performance from Juliette Binoche (as always) and a surprising effort from Kristen Stewart. These two carry the movie with palpable chemistry - so much so that every turn in their relationship dictates not only the environment of the film, but also the audience.\r\n\r\nThis film is for the patient, and for those who don't mind huge questions.","id":"58d1a66fc3a36838d500e0d3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58d1a66fc3a36838d500e0d3","movie_id":246860}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Every city has its own history and hidden secrets.\r\n\r\nIt's not the first time the actors who reach a certain stage of their acting career to shift their gear to the direction mode. So this time it is none other than the Canadian import, Ryan Gosling. He produced, wrote and directed this fantasy-drama-mystery which looks like a semi apocalyptic film. Very interesting concept and the cast as well. Quite impressed by the narration with those suspenses, decent story as well, but kind of complicated to understand the mix its genre.\r\n\r\nActually, it was not a bad film, except the story won't go deeper into the characters to uncover them completely. Especially no details about the earlier years at the place where it sets in which what the title denoting. The rest of the developments are unpredictable yet created enough curiosity to hook with. The location was awesome, I mean it was kind of a wasteland, though perfectly matched to what script wanted. The overall idea of the film was like when 'Beasts of the Southern Wild' meets 'Goonies'.\r\n\r\nThe story did not deliver a satisfying ending after all those promises were made in the first two acts, but overall film was a much better than any fancy twist we would expect. So the film is not for everybody, only if you ready to accept any kind of turnover at any stage of the narration, even it is a very plain, then you can consider it. Not an ideal directional debut for Ryan, but definitely a fine first step to explore the field in the coming years. Surely he would come out with a masterpiece and I'm looking forward for that.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"5760301c925141665400160a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5760301c925141665400160a","movie_id":167810}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> You can't respect the friendship by denying the facts.\r\n\r\nDefinitely a modern love story. The movie covers the story of the title character, Rosie's 12 years of life. From the night when she celebrates her 18th birthday till becomes the 30 year old mother. It's a long journey in the real life, and the movie report only the romance side of the life as it is a romantic comedy. Based on the book named 'Where Rainbow Ends', but lots of changes have been done to make a youthfully celebratible movie for the young generation.\r\n\r\nUsually, the famous romantic dramas are slow, lengthy, and well developed characters. Of course, this one was a romcom, though, much better in many aspect with less emotions and swift pace. About the characters, it was Rosie's perspective and having Alex as a counterpart, the rest are not given much importance other than permits a fair display. Nowadays I kind like Lily Collins, she's cute, maybe it is a crush. But that does not the reason to I like this film, not entirely true. I find it somewhat atypical with many convincing scenes and lines.\r\n\r\nThe story is intensifyingly frustrates us as it takes extreme turns all the time just to make a further riddle and complicate. But that is how the screenplay survives or there won't be any story to tell. It might be Rosie's romance, but you don't have to be a woman\/girl to enjoy this film. I don't believe such kind of categorisation, because in the earlier time everyone believed animation is for children only and then it proved wrong. So if a man can watch a movie without damaging his brain, losing his eyesight, or becoming paralysed, then I don't see an issue rather making up everything himself. Hope you all enjoy the movie as I did.\r\n\r\n7.5\/10","id":"55e749d2c3a36837830006de","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55e749d2c3a36837830006de","movie_id":200727}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Account of the troubled production is far more compelling than the movie***\r\n\r\nThe making of the 1996 version of \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" was such a disaster that articles, books and documentaries have been made about it, like this 2014 documentary \"Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau.\" Stanley championed the film, wrote the screenplay and was set to direct, but was fired after a few days of shooting after conflicts with Val Kilmer, who wasn't in the best of moods due to being served divorce papers while on set. \r\n\r\nActually that wasn\u2019t the main reason Stanley was fired. He was fine for small indie productions, but he was out of his league with a blockbuster like this. In his defense, the movie didn\u2019t start as a blockbuster, but simply a few notches more swanky than Stanley\u2019s previous two Indie flicks. Veteran filmmaker John Frankenheimer had to be brought in to save the production from being an utter loss. He got the job done, but his tyrannical approach didn\u2019t help matters. \r\n\r\nThe situation was so bad that Fairuza Balk (the cat-lady, Aissa) literally tried to escape the remote set in Cairns, Australia, but she was caught at the airport in the nick of time. Add to this constant rewrites and Brando's well-known eccentricities, not helped by the recent suicide of his daughter, Cheyenne, and you have a formula for cinematic chaos!\r\n\r\nThe fact that a semi-coherent, somewhat entertaining movie was made from such a debacle is remarkable. But this documentary is far more interesting and amusing. It\u2019s on par with similar docs, like \u201cHearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker\u2019s Apocalypse\u201d (1991). Some notables of the cast & crew unfortunately weren\u2019t interviewed (Kilmer, Ron Pearlman and David Thewlis), but more than enough were to accurately and entertainingly paint the picture of what went down.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 37 minutes. \r\n\r\nGRADE: A","id":"5e49ba949b86160018627cbc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e49ba949b86160018627cbc","movie_id":279992}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"Oddball indie about a drifting musician and a girl at a ranch in eastern Montana\r\n\r\nA guitarist (Gabriel Sunday) traveling through Montana to Portland gets a job on Falcon Ranch where he helps the granddaughter (Rainey Qualley) of the patriarch (Jim Storm) discover her heritage and true talents. The three are soon caught in the middle of a land war linked to the shifty Cap Davenport (Martin Kove). Doing the math, the events take place in the late 80s.\r\n\r\n\u201cFalcon Song\u201d (2014) is a micro-budget indie flick with the production quality comparable to that of \u201cThe Legend of Tillamook\u2019s Gold\u201d (2006). These kinds of flicks usually involve semi-competent local filmmakers creating a movie that takes place in their beloved location; in this case, the Billings, Montana, region (which I\u2019ve been to a few times and have a couple stories to tell).\r\n\r\nThese kinds of indies usually run anywhere from $50,000-$150,000, give or take, depending on how much was spent on cast, lodging, catering, travel and so forth. \u201cAnother Kind\u201d (2013) was made for $120,000 and is a superb example of how a professional-class film can be made for this kind of micro-budget. Even spare-change films, like \u201cA Bothered Conscience,\u201d which only cost $2300, can be effective if the filmmaker & crew are talented enough and efficiently make use of their resources.\r\n\r\nSo how does \u201cFalcon Song\u201d stack up overall? Too often the filmmaking seems amateurish, such as the sometimes awkward or curiously abrupt editing. A few scenes run too long and should\u2019ve been cut by half or, at least, one-third (e.g. the couple walking to the barn near the end). Thankfully, these flaws are somewhat made up by the hearty cast, quality locations and a story that generally keeps your interest despite some questionable quirks, e.g. Carrie Jr. (if you get my drift) and the giggle-inducing secret society. As a cat person, I also appreciated the several cats in the cast.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the cast, Gabriel Sunday is cogent as the likable and amusing protagonist; he\u2019s a little reminiscent of Hugh Grant. And Rainey Qualley is quite fetching as the lass and I\u2019m usually not attracted to thin women (she has just enough curves).

{"author":"Reno","content":"> What we're, won't be the same at the end of the level.\r\n\r\nThe film had more hidden facts than one gets in his casual viewing. If you were really focused, you would start to dig for some answers. The opening of the film was very smooth in a comedic sense. But that's not how the entire film going to be. When the story's purpose begins to roll, with an unexpected event the narration moves to a single location for almost the rest of the film with the limited cast. So it is where our guessing game commence.\r\n\r\nI must agree the writing was a bit cleverer than I projected. The film characters were not so complicated, but towards the end it looked like unavoidably becomes that way. At first, it promises to be a good entertainer and then turns to be smarter with the story development, but in a low key. The film does not say anything about its timeline, but seems it was in the 70s that inspired by the real deprogramming.\r\n\r\nI did not get the last 10-15 minutes of the film, but you know by guessing and visiting various film discussion forums on the net about what others thought about it gave more perspectives. But we still won't reach anywhere near what the writer intended to tell all of us. Compared to the opening, the end was totally a different contrast. In fact feels turned to be another genre and theme. So you would end watching it with the possibilities of like this and that. That means not all the viewers end up happy for what they just saw.

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Writer-director Riley Stearns masterfully concocts the sinister dramedy \u2018Faults\u2019 that registers with a bizarre blend of terror and off-the-cuff cheekiness. Stearns\u2019s caustic yet cockeyed vision into the exploration of cults and mind-control methods is gloriously wacky and makes for one of the most unique psychological dramas to register with forthright nerve within recent years. The peculiar appeal found in \u2018Faults\u2019 rests on the beleaguered shoulders of the film\u2019s desperate and dysfunctional lead protagonist Ansel Roth (played with harried brilliance by Leland Orser), a one-time notable authority on cult activities. However, in the aftermath of some success comes the lean times when this so-called shifty deprogramming expert, now in the dumps financially and otherwise, needs to rise to the challenge and ironically escape his own self-inflicting trance.  Hence, \u2018Faults\u2019 roams into tricky territory and manages to juggle the sensitive themes of psyche imprisonment with spirited, naughty ribaldry.\r\n\r\nDeliciously dark and twisted, \u2018Faults\u2019 resonates because of Stearns\u2019s off-key fascination with his shady characters and the compromising predicaments that ensue. As the ringleader of the crazy-minded goings-on, Orser\u2019s Roth is seriously flawed and this serves as the devilish foundation for Stearns\u2019s chaotic universe of unstructured disillusionment.\r\n\r\nThe easy thing to do is automatically label \u2018Faults\u2019 Dr. Ansel Roth as a down-and-out loser with questionable ethics. Sure, his credentials are somewhat boast-worthy in that he has authored a book on the subject matter regarding his expertise in the un-brainwashing of cult victims as manipulated prey.  Still, the pitiful Roth is in a precarious pickle and the only way he can redeem his dire circumstances is return to what he does best regarding his trade as a renowned psychologist. Thankfully, Roth does get that golden opportunity when an older middle-aged couple requests his services in retrieving their jeopardised daughter Claire (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, \u2018Scott Pilgrim vs. The World\u2019) from the cult faction known as Faults.\r\n\r\nFor the concerned parents of the missing Claire, there is a remote sense of hope for Roth to reclaim his own disruptive existence. After all, the hapless soul needs something to overcome his personalised demons. Unfortunately, Roth fell into a tailspin in the aftermath of a former patient\u2019s suicide during his deprogramming watch. So now this justified Roth\u2019s jerk-like tendencies and pauper way of living. The recounting of Roth\u2019s sad \u2018way of life\u2019 includes living out of his broken-down vehicle, mooching breakfast from an already used food voucher at a cheap motel restaurant or forcing his book on disinterested parties at scarcely attended hotel seminars. With eating packets of ketchup as a substitute meal or getting a beating at one of his hosted sessions, it appears that Ansel Roth cannot get a decent break.\r\n\r\nNaturally, coming to the aid of the abducted Claire on behalf of her worried folks is a golden given for the weasel Roth. He can both exploit the couple\u2019s emotional emergency for financial gain and embrace a semblance of redemption and legitimacy as the prominent professional mind-bending problem solver he once was revered in his field. Besides, his paid assignment to rescue the imperiled Claire depends on his own mortality. It is revealed that Roth owes some serious loot to his ex-manager (Jon Gries from \u2018Taken\u2019 and \u2018Napoleon Dynamite\u2019 fame) and in the process has to avoid the shakedown from one of his enforcing goons (Lance Riddick) looking to collect big time.\r\n\r\nThe notable revelation in \u2018Faults\u2019 stems from the complicated consciousness of both Orser and Winstead as the tandem trapped in an anguished grip of psychological hostility. Orser\u2019s Ansel Roth is the broken man at the helm of self-destruction and despair. Stearns\u2019s ironic presentation of a psyche \u2018fixer\u2019 that requires his own brand of mental repairing is oddly compelling and comical in off-kilter fashion. Orser conveys Roth as a walking disaster area whose arrogance and misguided morality shrewdly begs for some sense of sympathy and remorse. He is the main key to the orchestrated mind-numbing madness that Stearns injects into this crafty, cockeyed caper. Winstead\u2019s Claire is transfixing as the brainwashed beauty battling the scars of bleakness. She is convincingly haunting despite her sorority girl freshness look. The supporting players in the aforementioned Gries and Riddick as well as other participants in Stearns\u2019s concentrated center of creepiness skillfully balance the wickedness and wit felt so piercingly realized.\r\n\r\n\u2018Faults\u2019 is a resourceful black comedy that works effectively and never strays away from its pedigree of outrageous misfortune. This is one psychological character study that demonstrates its motivation for unconventional strife with devilish conviction. The inspired insane-induced performances from the film\u2019s detached duo of Orser\u2019s Dr. Ansel Roth and Winstead\u2019s Claire is proof enough to not find any ounce of  perceived Faults with Stearns\u2019s risque roller-coaster on-screen examination of violated distraught boundaries.\r\n\r\nFaults (2014)\r\n\r\nScreen Media Films\r\n\r\n1 hr. 30 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Leland Orser, Mary Elzabeth Winstead, Jon Gries, Lance Riddick, Chris Ellis and Beth Grant\r\n\r\nWritten and Directed by: Riley Stearns\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: NR\r\n\r\nGenre: Psychological Drama\/Cults and Deprogramming Caper\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)","id":"5619fac1c3a3686c410011ed","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5619fac1c3a3686c410011ed","movie_id":243526}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"It is not often that we get to be pleasantly surprised by a film and Yennamo Nadakkudhu is the surprise of the season. It is directed by a debutant director and features no A-list stars, but still keeps you hooked from start to finish. The film opens with the hero being battered almost to death by goons who demand something from him. And, the entire first half tells us what happened till that point in gripping fashion. Generally, thrillers tend to lose some bit of the tension after the revelation but this film manages to keep you on the edge of the seat till its climax and it is certainly its biggest triumph.\r\n\r\nThe plot revolves around Vijay, a lower middle class guy, who falls in love with Madhumitha, a nurse with plans to go to Canada for her higher studies. Her father borrows a huge sum from a loan shark for the same but it is only latter that he realizes that the agency which promised to take his daughter abroad is a racket. Viji decides to repay the amount to save Madhu and seeks help from Uthaman, a lawyer who works for Burma, a gangster and a rising politician. They use Viji for their elaborate scam, which involves lending out money deposited in a bank and making a profit out of the interest. All that Viji has to do is take the money and distribute it to the various middle men. However, Viji is tricked en route and the money is stolen. Burma is in a fix and thinks Viji has cheated him but he goes into a coma after being beaten up by Burma's henchmen. Where did the money go and who has stolen it?\r\n\r\nThere is a lot to like in Yennamo Nadakkudhu and first and foremost among these is the script. The film is tautly written with one scene leading into another or informing the other so that there is hardly a wasted moment. We have seen films where a young man gets caught in a power struggle between two powerful individuals, and yet, this film manages to feel fresh.\r\n\r\nEven the characters are familiar and still feel new to some extent. At first glance, Viji seems like the wayward young heroes that our directors seem to be fixated on these days. He is crude, drinks with his friends, stalks the heroine and beats his mom in public. But then he is also somewhat responsible. He has a job even if it, as he says in a scene, doesn't leave him with any savings. He loves his mom and only beats her up because she is sympathetic towards a prostitute who lives in the locality. The mom-son relationship, despite Saranya Ponvannan playing the naive mother for the hundredth time, is what makes us root for Viji. And, he genuinely loves Madhu and earns her respect. She, too, isn't the normal love interest as it is her character which sets the plot in motion. She also becomes a stake in the conflict in the latter half of the film. As for Burma, he is an immoral man but at the same time, he also has boundaries that he cannot cross and has to play the game by its rules.\r\n\r\nThe film also shows how it is more important for a director to get the right actors; they need not even be strong performers or stars but should look the part. So, when we see Sukanya, we readily believe that she could be the brains behind such a scam and with Prabhu, we instinctively realize that he will not be too bad. The same goes for Thambi Ramaiah. Even though he is seen with Burma all the time, we know that there will be some goodness in him. As for the lead character of Viji, a star like Dhanush would have added to the visibility of the film but that would also have meant additional scenes to justify the star power. Given that Viji isn't around for at least 20 minutes in the film, a non-star like Vijay Vasanth feels just right. And, he does full justice to the character.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of scenes that make the foreshadowing very obvious \u2014 one involving a mobile phone with tracking feature and another that takes place during a film shoot \u2014 but even these are woven into the screenplay in a nice way. The mobile phone plays a part in furthering Viji's contact with Madhu while the latter is mentioned at least in a couple of instances in conversations to make it seem organic.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to pick on the film, you could say that the songs are speed bumps, given that they aren't even that catchy, but even in these, Rajapandi gives us minor variations to make them somewhat interesting. Doesn't it feel unique when the hero's mother becomes part of a duet song? And, a song in a flashback sequence has the male dancers dressed in MGR's costumes from his popular films. The film also doesn't really transcend its genre but when a director has managed to genuinely thrill us for two hours, should we really be complaining?","id":"53baae5a0e0a2676d300b97d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baae5a0e0a2676d300b97d","movie_id":264055}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"For a movie that has romance, murder, supernatural elements and even Christian imagery, Endrendrum is quite bland. A better filmmaker would have whipped up an exciting film out of these elements and we did have one in the not so distant past \u2014 Arivazhagan's Eeram, which was about the ghost of a dead girl guiding her erstwhile lover towards solving her murder. This one too is somewhat similar with certain modifications. The girl here, Diana, is not dead but is in coma and her spirit, which is in a sort-of purgatory, tells Charles, the young man who is staying in her flat (and who falls in love with this spirit), the reason for her predicament, which involves a murder.\r\n\r\nWhat is truly disappointing is that the film fails to deliver on all three fronts and the writing is muddled. The romance is not only underdeveloped but also insipid (talk about the irony of naming the lead characters as Charles and Diana), the murder mystery (with a track involving two cops) is reduced to just a few scenes and lacks and the supernatural element is laughably executed. Charles doesn't even react shocked when Diana's spirit appears on the screen and when he tells of a ghost at his place, a church priest tells him that he shouldn't be bothered as it is only a \"good spirit\".\r\n\r\nThen, there are the irritating fillers involving a group of pubescent school boys reading porn and being bossed over by Pappu, a kid who is a cinematic cliche, and an overlong segment involving Charles's friend and his roommate. Calling them comedy tracks would be a sin as they are not even remotely funny.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning we are told that the movie deals with chaos theory and the opening scene unsubtly features a butterfly moving towards the sea while Charles, in a voice-over, wonders why he stayed in Diana's house. We wait for a revelation and never get one even after the end credits get over. Instead, what we do get is a spirit film that is dispiriting.","id":"53bb1aa00e0a2619740002f3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bb1aa00e0a2619740002f3","movie_id":260747}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"It seems Chimbudevan just cannot make a film without an element of fantasy. Oru Kanniyum Moonu Kalavanikalam ( OKMK), like last year's Naveena Saraswathi Sabatham, opens not on Earth but in the celestial abode of the gods. We see Bramha sitting atop a giant lotus and Naradar meeting him just in the nick of time before he goes to sleep. This talk about time makes them approach Shiva, who, to show them how every minute is important (every day has many fates in it, is how he puts it), chooses one random person in the real world to prove his theory. \r\n\r\nThat person happens to be Tamizh ( Arulnithi), a cash-strapped young man, who we see plotting a kidnap with his friends Malar ( Bindu Madhavi) and Ramanujam Esakki ( Bagavathi Perumal). They have been promised Rs 30 lakh by Hippie Lahiri (Nasser), a bling-sporting Malaysian businessman, to kidnap Isha (Ashrita), the daughter of his rival. And, oh, incidentally, Isha also happens to be Tamizh's girlfriend and so, for Tamizh, this is \"Ore kallula oru manga oru thenga\"! \r\n\r\nThe first hour of OKMK is a terrific, nail-biting black comedy cum thriller. We get a gun-toting, Siruvar Malar-reading cop, a chase that intercuts with a romantic backstory, a gun that is in orange, pink and yellow, and superb turns from a dozen recognizable character actors, atmospheric cinematography (by SR Kathir), sharp lines (\"Kovakkara yezhai dhaan thirudan\") and what seems to be an interesting development \u2014 Tamizh is shot at and we are genuinely shocked; a hero dying midway through the film? \r\n\r\nAnd, then, the director cuts back to the gods and we realize his true intentions. The film instantly turns into a what-if movie \u2014 what if Tamizh had started a minute late or another minute later? The director, to his credit, acknowledges Tom Tyker's Run Lola Run, in the end credits. But, suddenly, the fizz goes away from the film as we are shown reiterations of the same set of circumstances playing out differently. And, for a film that is all about the value of time, the director takes a rather longer time to tell this story; there is even a stab at melodrama (thankfully, it is only half-hearted). \r\n\r\nTo be fair, Chimbudevan at least manages to make these scenes interesting, with his humourous lines and inventive writing (even the interval point arrives when there is an interval on screen) but we realize we have nothing more to expect from the film other than the amusement of seeing the same scenes taking place differently. But the one what-if that the directors fails to explore is much more fascinating \u2014 what if Tamizh had managed to somehow kidnap Isha, despite being wounded? We cannot escape the feeling that Chimbudevan got stuck at this point while writing and decided to take the easy way out by turning this into a genre that he is familiar with \u2014 fantasy.\r\n\r\nThe lead trio are competent and do make us root for them, but it is supporting actors like Nasser, Delhi Ganesh, Mano Bala, Aadukalam Naren, Jayaprakash and VS Raghavan (who gets the cheekiest line in the film after uniting Tamizh with Isha: \"Naama serthu vekkalaina, marupadiyum modhalla irundhu varuvaanga\", taking a dig at the script's construct) who are the real stars here. They are all just so perfect in their parts and create a memorable impression despite the miniscule screen time and that is certainly Chimbudevan's triumph.","id":"53bab0140e0a2676cf00bcd5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bab0140e0a2676cf00bcd5","movie_id":262699}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Family defines unity, in whatever circumstances.\r\n\r\nA Swedish dark comedy film, about a family and their vacation on the French Alps. It is not my favourite flick, but liked it a lot because of the refreshing theme. A satisfiable storytelling with the beautiful visuals of white planet.\r\n\r\nIt does not feel like a dark comedy, I had some good laughs, I mean the louder ones. I was surprised how cleverly the phases changed in the narration. Starts off like a normal family on the trip, but slowly reveals their hidden natures of the individuals.\r\n\r\nSometimes, vacations are not to relax, it will change the course of your life. What we do, how we behave and presence of mind are the key factors. Being a member of a family requires extra alter, especially if you are a man of the family.\r\n\r\nIt was just a brief story that was divided into five episodes and each covers one whole day event of the family that spends. Each day was different than the others. All the good, the bad and the weird days sliced into the happy, emotional and embarrassing incidents of the day.\r\n\r\nMost of the story is a debate over the matter that happened in the earlier part. How a happy middle class family affected and progressing to be a dysfunctional was told in the later parts.\r\n\r\nThe scenes take place either in the resort or in the skiing expedition. A couple of other characters join the family and makes much more interesting developments. There were some unwanted scenes, but it quite gives the vacation atmosphere.\r\n\r\n> \"I spent two years in therapy... And it did not do a damn thing.\r\n> Then I screamed for five minutes and felt a hell of a lot better.\"\r\n\r\nWhenever I thought it almost concluded, the new twists approached. The last quarter makes this film special for giving an unexpected decent solution. But all the laugh riot is in the opening half.\r\n\r\nI will be happy if the family returns for a sequel that set somewhere on the other continent. Not without the character Mats, because I liked that role. Better to say the red-beard-man inside that character was awesome. It was a small appearance, but so good.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing this film, I think, definitely men would be cautious for the similar kind of situation in their lives. It is a lesson to learn without being in the actual scene. Enjoyable flick, and again not for everyone due to the sluggish pace.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"55ba61cac3a3684aed004f84","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55ba61cac3a3684aed004f84","movie_id":265189}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> When the home, the safest place isn't safe anymore.\r\n\r\nJust remember that this is not a film to entertain you, but it is here to open your eyes on the child abuse issue. This is one of the major problems today we're facing around the world. All the governments had taken the strict actions on the matter, yet somewhere without being noticed domestically these things keeps happening. Such a theme was this film, which is not easy to digest the ugly truth it reveals.\r\n\r\nLooks like a B movie from the Denmark, the production quality was decent, but the topic of the film was very strong and that makes it a must see even if you think you're not made for the micro-budget, not-so-popular films.\r\n\r\nI've seen films like 'Trade', 'Taken', 'Eden' et cetera, but this is something a new angle about when parents are directly involved in the such dirty affairs. This story was about two brothers and their miserable childhood. After their mother died of an accident, they end up in the custody of their abusive father. Life won't be the same as it was before to them, but the eldest takes all the measures to protect his little brother. Unfortunately, it looks the fate is not on their side when a terrible thing unfolds after one bad evening, which leads to a chain of events before concluding the narration with a twist.\r\n\r\n> \"When I grow up I won't hit my kids.\"\r\n\r\nI am really lucky to find this film, which is yet to open its wings to reach the wider audience globally. I know this is not a film to have some good time, but might disturb you with its strong contents. Yes, the film has some of the bold scenes which strongly restricts for the adult's viewing. The film was shot in some of the beautiful locations, but what the story was dealing makes us to focus only on the cruelty the two minors are encountering.\r\n\r\nJust watch it to believe what's actually happening in the families of child abuse history. If this is what the fate of innocent children in the first world nation's lower class families, then imagine what about the second and the third world. If you had seen 'Trade of Innocents' and 'Graceland', you will get a clear picture.\r\n\r\nThe director and actors are all the fresh faces, but given a one good product as the theme wise. One of the few things I did not feel comfortable was the camera work. It was very shaky and in the initial part it had given me a hard time to get used to it. Because of that kind of screenplay, it looked like it was shot with a camcorder.\r\n\r\nThe others were the nude parts which were a bit unnecessary for a little film like this, but they went for a bold statement and I appreciate that effort. And finally the story, in some segments it did not convince me, as they were way too off from real like the accident in the beginning and dragging climax. If you won't mind these things considering it is a B movie, this film is definitely worth seeing. So here it goes my recommendation for the grown ups only.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"576d86c0c3a3685701000727","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/576d86c0c3a3685701000727","movie_id":395940}

{"author":"SkyGemini","content":"The synopsis on this page is very accurate so I won't do a rehash of the plot. However...\r\n\r\nThat \"therapist\" seemed more interested in her wardrobe change, like 5+ times in 10 minutes, than actual therapy. She was totally clueless and I couldn't wait for the boogeyman to get her too. Highly improbable a hospital would let this happen--she wasn't his doctor and didn't even know him. The kid was becoming more traumatised by the minute. She spent more time sleeping, looking at herself on her tablet or watching tv than any actual therapy & even that was odd. It was just ten minutes of Ryan having convulsions. She'd start seeing things and completely ignore her own eyes. And when the therapist starts taking drugs, you know there's a problem. The therapy that \"worked\" was three lines of a lullaby which in itself was laughable. And how you could hide from said boogeyman, was hysterical. \r\n\r\nThe fat guy was ultra ridiculous, not funny & we are to believe after 5 years, a house would look like that. Even if you had it \"cleaned\" the day before. Like a fully furnished model home. This is after an entire family save one, was horrifically slaughtered. Just a silly mess. Nicely shot but that's all.

{"author":"Kenneth Axel Carlsson","content":"Where to start with this movie, with **Frank**? Should I start with describing the man inside the giant head, or maybe the very head itself? I could also try and describe the plot, or maybe the music, the weird wonderful nonsense that Frank sprays from inside the head? No, perhaps it would be even better to start with the actor playing the man inside the giant head, or maybe the entire cast, who tries to cope with their friend, the world and their own problems?\r\n\r\nActually, I think I might start here, with myself. I mean, who of us haven't felt like hiding inside a giant head? And yet, I am not sure that if I ever did hide inside a giant head, that I would be able to lifv as normally as Frank actually does. To him, the head actually helps make him more human, or maybe just... human. Thunk about it for a second, Frank is wearing a giant head, and not just while he is on the stage, singing, no this guy wears his head ALL the time, even when he is sleeping or taking a bath. And we accept it, in fact, while I watched the movie, I found myself hoping that he would never be forced to take it off. We simply don't need to know what is inside, because Frank IS the head.\r\n\r\nOK, let me try and break the plot down for you without giving too much away. A young man (Domhnall Gleeson) wants to make his own music, but honestly, he is beyond bad, he would need a miracle to break through in the music industry. That miracle comes one day, when a band arrives at his small village, Sonorpfbrs. Apparently the keyboard player wants to kill himself, which leaves a spot open for Jon (the young man). They manage to almost play a whole song before the band breaks up, in chaos. This is not your average punk band, but something a bit more... out there.\r\n\r\nThe guy goes home, thinking that he wasted his one chance, but then one day, the manager (Scoot McNairy) calls him again. They are going to Ireland to record an album. The young man packs his back, thinking that he will be there for a day, but really, it ends up being closer to a year, and he ends up spending all his money to keep the band going. They have secluded themselves in the wilderness, and here Jon gets to learn the stories of all the bandmembers. Frank might be the one with the big fake head, but trust me, all the members have their own mental problems.\r\n\r\nNo more plot for you, but you see where this is going. Everyone needs to figure out who they are, and if they really need to hide inside giant heads, big beards or nasty and unwelcoming personalities.\r\n\r\nOnce the movie gets going, this is actually a less weird movie than I had expected, and that is not a bad thing. There is enough weirdness here for a lifetime, but there is also something very human here, and that is what drives the movie forward. Frank, of course, is the soul of the movie, and played with perfect execution by Michael Fassbender. And yet, the rest of the cast acts with the same careful precision as Frank, living their life on a knife's edge. You simply feel as if they could tip over at any moment and escape reality completely. Maybe I should also note here that no drugs are involved whatsoever, these guys are as clean as snow, they just have... issues.\r\n\r\nLast words... original, and yet, not as original as I had thought (or maybe even feared). The story here is one we've seen in many movies, but the package is just... so much better. Don't try and overthink it, just sit back and listen. If you are lucky, you might just learn a thing or two about yourself.","id":"54a523f4925141236b00b3c5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54a523f4925141236b00b3c5","movie_id":171372}

{"author":"mattwilde123","content":"'Fury' has fantastic set pieces. The special effects are incredible and the sound is brilliant. The film is very gory and there are lots of explosions and body parts flying all over the place.\r\n\r\nI could tell that the movie was trying to follow in the footsteps of 'Saving Private Ryan' by stealing a lot of the characters and trying to recreate the depth and heart of that film. However, it didn't realise that 'Saving Private Ryan' took a lot of ideas from old war movies and paid homage to them whilst delivering awe-inspiring and moving scenes of battles.\r\n\r\n'Fury' did not have this. A lot of the dialogue and interaction between characters was laughable. The romance that tried to be thrown in at the middle of the film did not work and just seemed bizarre, The characters were one-dimensional and just seemed like walking stereotypes.

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"WWII through the eyes of a Sherman tank crew\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2014, \"Fury\" details the exploits of 'Wardaddy' (Brad Pitt) and his Sherman tank crew during the final month of the European theater of World War II. A meek new guy who knows little about tanks, Norman (Logan Lerman), joins the crew and must learn to kill. Making a final push into the heart of Nazi Germany, the Fury crew makes a heroic stand when their tank breaks down. \r\n\r\nWriter\/director Dick Ayers wrote the screenplay for 2001's excellent \"Training Day.\" In \"Fury\" he successfully shows the soldiers\u2019 view of WWII through the eyes of a Sherman tank crew. I know of no other war film that sets out or accomplishes this; Oddball and his crew from \"Kelly's Heroes\" (1970) perhaps comes closest.\r\n\r\nI mainly judge films by whether or not the story keeps my attention. After all, what good is great action, thrills and incredible special effects if the story (or the way it's told) is dullsville, like, say, \"The Mummy Returns\" (2001) or \"Man of Steel\"(2013)? \"Fury\" kept my attention from beginning to end and the characters are all memorable. Speaking of which, the three remaining crewmembers are 'Bible' (Shia LaBeouf), 'Coonass' (Jon Bernthal) and 'Gordo' (Michael Pe\u00f1a). \r\n\r\n'Bible' is fittingly an evangelical who strives not to lose his spirituality while brutally annihilating people in the name of war, whereas newcomer Norman is a mainline Christian (Episcopalian). A handful of scripture passages are quoted during the course of the movie, including a couple near the end by Wardaddy. This is an interesting revelation because Wardaddy has become hardened by the war after three years fighting from North Africa all the way to the nucleus of the Nazis. This implies that he was a devoted believer before the war but only a glimmer of his former spiritual affection remains. There are other quality character bits interspersed throughout the film, like how annoying drunk bastages may not be so bad once they sober up.\r\n\r\nBeyond the above, the film offers the typical tragic insights about the nature of war. The long final stand in the last act may be unlikely, but it makes for a heroic and thrilling ending to a war movie (yes, it's a MOVIE, not a friggin' documentary). At the end of the day \"Fury\" arguably ranks with the best WWII movies, like \"Where Eagles Dare\" (1968), \"Enemy at the Gates\" (2001), \"The Eagle has Landed\" (1976), \"Bridge on the River Kwai\" (1957), \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), \"The Thin Red Line\" (1998), and \"Inglourious Basterds\" (2009). As far as comparing it to the overrated \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), the first half hour of that movie is great, but the rest of it leaves much to be desired (remember the lame dog tag sequence?); \"Fury\" is leagues better IMHO. \r\n\r\nThe melancholic and moving score by Steven Price is a highlight. Alicia von Rittberg (Emma), Anamaria Marinca (Irma) and Jason Isaacs are featured in fairly notable roles. Speaking of Emma, the brief romance between her and Norman is decidedly forced, which is one of the few negatives of \"Fury,\" but I get the point of that sequence.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 134 minutes and was shot in England. \r\n\r\nGRADE: A-","id":"5b32ab53c3a368533200efbc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b32ab53c3a368533200efbc","movie_id":228150}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The future is always there to fix the past errors.\r\n\r\nI don't know where to begin, it was a quite pleasant watch. I would have not seen it if I had never liked the director's previous film 'Quirky Guys and Gals'. A simple, low budget flick, that betters any normal comedy with its quality of the narration. The beginning was not that good, when I started to watch, it did not interest me much. Suppose I needed time to get adjusted to it, like knowing all the characters, the backdrop of the story, the type of the comedy it is et cetera. Especially foreign movies need this kind of focus, because sometime everyone looks alike and comedies would be a thoroughly native brand. So after everything becoming familiar, it was quite a joy ride and second half was much better than I expected.\r\n\r\nThe movie opens with the two sets of narration told one after another. An early 30s chubby man named Fukuda, who is a painter professionally and passionate about his hobbies lives in the Fukufuku flats. An average, but by the heart a very kind guy leading a regular life. In another layer, around a same aged woman discovers her interest in the photography. When it won't go as she believed, her life begins to shatter. The two layer merges once these two people meet and forms a single line narration. These two have a connection from the past, the movie explains it. Despite their past, the reentry to each others present lives showcases how their fate would change forever.\r\n\r\n> \"Everyone ends up hurting someone\r\n> throughout their life.\"\r\n\r\nI have seen a few typical Japanese comedies, sometimes you won't get them if you don't know the culture and the language. This is the case for any language films other than Hollywood and your native ones. Especially dialogues won't be the same when it is translated into the other language or subtitle. But this one was exceptional that has an international standard appeal. The common language, the language of friendship, parents who cares for their unmarried children, forgiveness, neighbours, and many more. All the above, well written screenplay and equally supportive performances. An example for how a movie should be made, not only for the natives, but for the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nWell, if we are going to talk about the performances, we should begin with the title character. The character Fukuda was played by an actress, a comedian. How I could I know that, so I waited patiently and got confirmed after a few minutes in the opening. The other lead character, Chiho was cute and perfectly filled the shoes of that role. In some parts the storytelling was dull as a plain wall. There are some compelling scenes as well that balanced the elements.\r\n\r\nThe overall product was satisfying. I think the director, who is also the writer of this film is to appreciate. The sufficient length of the scenes, the timing of the comedies, the cool presentations in a tension scenario, all these made the movie a better entertainer. It might not reach every corner of the earth, but must reach the world movie fanatics. So if you are one, just consider putting it into your watchlist.\r\n\r\n7.5\/10","id":"55cce775c3a3681beb000378","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55cce775c3a3681beb000378","movie_id":266508}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I knew that quite a few people had complained about the realism in this movie even though it hold high ratings on most movie sites. I was hoping that the complaints were mostly nitpicking like wrong model of Sherman tank and such like. Well, I am afraid that it was a bit more than that. I would say that this movie is clearly written by some Hollywood writer sitting in his comfy chair and never ever having been close to any military activities, not to mention live action, in his life.\n\nI can live with a movie being inaccurate or somewhat unrealistic if the rest of the movie is good but I have to say that I did not really like the movie even after trying to filter out the unrealistic nonsense.\n\nThe movie is very dark and gritty and there are really no likeable characters in it whatsoever. Well, the clerk that got thrown in as a tank machinegun gunner was perhaps somewhat likable but then him getting assigned as a tank machinegun gunner in the first place was one of those nonsensical bits. In this movie the \u201cheroes\u201d are not really any better than the Nazis. The scene where \u201cWardaddy\u201d forces previously mentioned clerk to shoot an unarmed POW is just disgusting. I am sure this is not too far from reality in some cases during the war but I\u2019ll be damned if I am watching a movie to be entertained by it.\n\nHaving said that I must also say that the movie was very well done in terms of acting and cinematography with one exception. The ridiculous overuse of tracer bullet effects. Tracer bullets do not look like you are in a Star Wars movie and yes I have been using tracer bullets during my military service, obviously unlike the producer and consultants (if they had any) of this movie.\n\nThe pacing of the movie was somewhat uneven. Some of it was fairly fast paced but then some parts, like the part in the apartment of the two German women was quite slow and somewhat dull.\n\nThe \u201clast stand\u201d at the end was just silly and nonsensical. It started pretty much right away when the poor clerk spots the arriving German infantry just using his eyes. Then it just takes forever until they actually arrive so our \u201cheroes\u201d have all the time in the world to prepare. There would of course be no way for a lone Sherman to hold off an assault like that and the Germans would of course not be charging around shooting useless fine caliber weaponry against said Sherman. Also when they had all this time to prepare why the f\u2026 did they leave some of the ammo outside the tank? Obviously because some dumb scriptwriter thought it would make for a good scene. And do not get me started on the fact that the Germans apparently just stops in their tracks every time the director thinks it is time for some slow scene inside the tank.\n\nThe ending? Well I do not like bad endings and this one certainly did not give me any feeling of reward for having suffered through over two hours of this movie. Needless to say I am a tad disappointed.","id":"5adad958c3a36803fa0051d1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5adad958c3a36803fa0051d1","movie_id":228150}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Back to normal is sometimes not good.\r\n\r\nThe movie did not reach my expectation, but still I enjoyed watching it. A story like this I never thought would do fairly, a better movie from the average section. I think not without the Aubrey Plaza, she as a Beth was excellent. Not a career defining performance, but funny enough. The story looks only faintly different from other similar films, but a few good scenes saved it. If it had a couple more good jokes and maybe a twist, surely would have been done greatly at the box office.\r\n\r\nThere's no surprise material in it, I thinks that's negative about it. Easy to read the situation and predict the story within the first 15 minutes, but the second half was drastically changed its pace as well as the atmosphere in the story. If you've not seen many zombie films, especially comedy ones, then you may find it better than average.\r\n\r\nDefinitely a decent direction for a first timer, got a good support from the cast. For a small budget, this is a wonderful production quality. It surely upset you if you expect like 'Warm Bodies' or 'Shaun of the Dead', but if you know all about it before giving a try, the disappointment will be lessened and you may have a decent time pass with it.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"56e6f46ac3a36807b2003e5b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56e6f46ac3a36807b2003e5b","movie_id":244566}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Being pro nanny isn't an option to babysit some kids.\r\n\r\nI don't know how many you will agree with me that it was an underrated movie of the year. This film was so poetic, very unusual theme, but you have to understand it, otherwise it will be a plain babysitting movie. I believe as the filmmaker said, it was inspired by the real and so tried to be true as much as possible. The entire film was shot in just 20 days and there's no compromise in quality or the performances.\r\n\r\nIt was a tight call, to label it as a coming-of-age movie, because the definition does not match as the boy in the film was very matured, but only the end answers for that. It all begins with a 23 year old Eleanor, who broke-up with her boyfriend, at a same time lost the job. Standing in the middle of the street knowing nothing about what to do next, luckily a job offer comes her way. A temporary nanny job, to look after a 12 year old wealthy prodigy, Reggie. Subsequently the true narration begins where these two spend those two months together.\r\n\r\n> \"Welcome to the weirdness. I'm just trying to navigate\r\n> a course towards safety & sanity best way I know how.\"\r\n\r\nI have seen many movies of Leighton Meester, but not that at least one pops-out of my mind, other than maybe 'The Roommates'. This film might not bring her any awards, but definitely remembered for her simple and perfect character display. I have never seen this boy before, he was just a movie old and awesome as a genius boy. The screenplay was very naturalistic, sensitive, no twists, no sideshows, whatsoever to distract from the main focal point. There's only one perspective where the story flows in one direction, i.e., these two characters. Only the end splits as similar to the opening sequences like the before they came together.\r\n\r\nThe movie reminded me 'Uptown Girls', except the boy in place the girl. Only for the one reason, because in both the film the kids were very smart and matured more than their nannies. One film was a comedy-drama and the other one was a music-drama. But like I earlier mentioned, the end scene leaves a new dimensional meaning of the movie you have watched and understood from the initial parts. \r\n\r\nIt runs at the pace of a snail, so requires patience, but the music was so sweet that you might adapt the slow narration and drift till the end like I did. The film is not proving anything, but just an another perspective of one of the human emotion from the millions relating to the relationship and its uncertainty. The best way to get the movie is trying to understand the fusion of the characters from their mentality, not by the physical appearances. I suggest simply to skip it if you are looking for an entertainment or the inspiration, because it is none of that. An ordinary flick with an emotional conclusion and only a very few would end in happy of seeing it.\r\n\r\n7.5\/10","id":"55f719b19251415852001ec2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55f719b19251415852001ec2","movie_id":225044}

Just now destined to meet the life partners, which actually threatening a life long friendship. Yeah, it is kind of reminds plenty of films from the past, but never too old to enjoy, especially if you are a 30+. It was like the next level of the life story to the films like 'Ginger & Rosa', 'Little Birds', 'Very Good Girls'. One knows the life cannot go on, being with friends forever. The friendship could still remain, but when someone comes between them, it won't be the same. That's what this film is about.\r\n\r\nWhat worked for this film was the two main characters. A straight and a gay friend, and how their love life or still looking for their life partner portrayed fantastically. The actresses were impressive. They are not like from list A. The director too. I wish her to flourish. Yeah, they talked about 'The Big Leboswsky' in the film, honesty, I thought too as well it an average film. The film was shot within a three weeks. Lot better than I was expecting. I love films about the life. The life transition between youth to middle-age. The lesson one learns from self-experience. So definitely a good watch. I don't see a reason to dislike it.\r\n\r\n**7\/10**","id":"5a1ec2a8925141033907acfc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a1ec2a8925141033907acfc","movie_id":260001}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Farming, cooking, culture and the nature.**\r\n\r\nI like arts, but not an artist or a crazy collector. Whenever I visit art galleries or the photo exhibitions, I keep staring each one of them for a very long. Not that I'm looking for something as everybody says they do like the meaning or hidden message\/contents et cetera. But I'm an observer. I observe every corner, every detail. Not just me, anybody who prefers to be left alone (private persons) would have developed such skill.\r\n\r\nThe point is what if the same art has a motion. I'm talking about this film. I've already mentioned several times for such films I've come across that they are true art, a motion art, with an audio commentary. The 110 minutes of pleasure, where man and nature connect. I did not move for a second, and at the end, I felt it was too short. But I'm not expecting the same result from anybody else who give it a try. Since from a person to person, the taste and anticipation vary.\r\n\r\nThis is not the first time I was overjoyed for a film. Despite it came a couple of years ago, I was very impressed with the recent films like 'Midnight Diner' and 'Sweet Bean' which led me to this flick. There are many other films too. I've been a film fanatic for close to two decades, I've seen many world cinemas, but it's just the Japanese who are the best at  this kind. At least that's what I've seen so far. To the west, it's always the Italian food, but nothing is healthier than the Japanese food. That's a well known fact. This film is not just about the food, but also about farming and other related things. From the fresh perspective about our food. The food we make and its root.\r\n\r\nThe nature provided us food for the past 200 thousand plus years. Full of natural and nutritional. But the art of preparing our own food using those items was not that ancient. As the time passed by, we the humans discovered many new ingredients and methods to make very healthy food by removing unwanted parts. From untasty natural food to tasty cooked food. We developed such skill over thousands of years. There are unhealthy foods too, like perhaps sugary, oily and fried items.\r\n\r\nEverybody has to eat, so everybody knows to make at least one dish. It could be just bread and jam for some. Why I'm saying all this! Because the people from the cities use most the ready to use ingredients. Even in the off the season they get what they want. Those were preserved using the chemicals, which's bad for health. That's one of the highlights of this film. How to make your own from using naturally available items around you. And to prepare the food according to the season.\r\n\r\n\u275dCooking is a mirror that reflects your mind.\u275e\r\n\r\nVery inspiring. Makes us to see carefully what we're eating. Besides, there are experimental cookings, as well as myth buster. The difference between someone expert and ours cooking. The taste and methods. Most importantly the assumption that we think the dish is our family's or the local or the nation's, but the time will come you to learn the truth. Maybe because as a kid, we had believed everything what the elders had said to us, while making fun out of us.\r\n\r\nThe details were awesome. More like you are watching a documentary film. The majority of the film was a background narration like a documentary film. When the direct dialogues between the characters appeared occasionally, it was like the narration shifting its phase. Such change was good, particularly moving on to other topics.\r\n\r\nIt was based on the manga of the same name, and from the genre called slice of life. Truly a perfect, most realistic slice of a rural Japanese life. This is the first part of two films called 'Summer\/Autumn'. The other one called 'Winter\/Spring'. The story begins at the end of the spring during still the atmosphere was foggy and the lands are wet, when it is a good time to cultivate the rice. The next half are the summer, maintaining the crops and following the harvest takes place.\r\n\r\nIn between these periods, there are many sub topics, the topics about each dish that prepared according to the season and availability of the items, I mean the seasonal ingredients in a remote place of Japan called Little Forest. If you are a food lover, you will be mouthwatering for several times in your watch. But there's no detail on how they are prepared like that shown in any cooking programmes. If you are good at cooking, luckily you would get most of the procedures.\r\n\r\nThe actress was brilliant. The locations were amazing. For every few minutes the film picks a topic in the form of a new dish and makes progress on that. So the lead character, Ichiko, was like a mystery. But as the story goes on, reveals enough about her to us. I'm expecting more in the next part, as seeing how the film had ended. I meant the final scene that gave a fresh hint about some earlier life events of hers.\r\n\r\nShe was alone, and that's the best part of this story. Because everything she said were directly to us. Not that two people having a conversation. Besides, cooking for two or two plus are always hefty job. Sometimes the life will be very joyous when you live by yourself. I mean not for the entire life, but for some period, like when you are set to discover yourself. On that aspect, in many ways the film boosts our confidence to go for what we desire to do in our life.\r\n\r\nThere's no story in it. You should not expect one. As I said earlier, it was a semi-documentary and all you would witness are like the real life, real thing. The nature documentaries are always best, but while watching it, I thought this flick was much better than those. You know, most of the todays nature documentaries are not truthful. If they see a lion wondering, they run out of patience and put a zebra, so they can capture a most magnificent lion hunting a zebra.\r\n\r\nThis is not a BBC, Nation Geography or a History Channel programme, but you can compare it to that level. Except it was all pre-planned. Cooking, farming, culture and the nature, this film was a whole pack. All in one as what those tv channels produces. Not a history, but as I said in the very first paragraph, an art. This is not like a must see film, but ignoring it even after learning about it will be a mistake, especially if you are a film fanatic or a Japanophile.\r\n\r\n_9\/10_","id":"59bd93e992514135250183ba","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59bd93e992514135250183ba","movie_id":294682}

{"author":"Reno","content":"The movie was delayed a year to hit the screen due to the copyright issue. A biographical picture from Britain set in the late 1840. The movie revolves the story of Euphemia Gray shortly known as Effie Gray and her married life. She was from Scotland and only 19 when she married to the British art critic John Ruskin. But she was kept under certain limits of space by her laws. It makes her a lonely soul in the house, which surface a serious threat to their loveless marriage. Can it be held or not is the movie's final conclusion.\r\n\r\nDakota Fanning, like I saw her yesterday in teen movies, but now she's in a grown up movie. Felt kind of hard to accept, and then after a while begin to like her performance. That does not mean it was a powerful act, somehow convincible to the viewers. That is mainly because of the story. Actually it's a simple story, if it was set in the today's world. For those periods, it was a big affair to deal publicly as well as family's prestige.\r\n\r\nThe movie's settings and locations were good. As usual in a period drama the costumes are very good. It's always pleasure to learn the history through movies than the school textbooks. Other than that it was an average or just above. The thing is, it was a too slow and a little long movie, thus its not a commercial film. Many people aren't ready to pay watch it in the theatres, that is understood. So in my opinion, it should have been a television movie instead, with sliced into 3-4 episodes. Anyway, not for everyone, but for those who love slow presentations would have a good time.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"55380a7dc3a36842ae005874","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55380a7dc3a36842ae005874","movie_id":114155}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**From the streetlight to the spotlight.**\r\n\r\nI know who's the director, but not the actors. Maybe that's the reason the film did not do as expected at the box office. But still theirs performances are not forgettable. Every one of them was amazing, they are the real singers and so the jobs done easily. I mean the filmmaking who understood the story and its characters and delivered accordingly. You might have seen many similar biopics and this is almost the same, but still there's lots to inspire from what you see.\r\n\r\nSince this music genre is different compared to the todays trend in the music industry, this film quite clearly brings back the 50s, 60s eras for us. So that's how this story appeals to its viewers. It was about the four member music band and their journey through the success and struggles for decades. What inspires is that, they are nothing like we see in todays musicians like drugs and sex stuffs. But the story had its share in those things, which might have been a huge for that time.\r\n\r\nThe family, friends and music, the films very beautifully defines the differences. Between professional and personal life, how they lose grips is what obviously we see regularly in all the musician's biopics, but I'm talking about 50 years ago society and lifestyle. The things are different and how they managed or did they is the film to reveal. I really liked it and I wanted to rate higher, but I was bored a bit because it was a very long film.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Ignorance brings chaos, not knowledge.\r\n\r\nLucy is one of those films that brings about furious reactions, it is after all a science fiction type action thriller. They always divide film fans right from the off. It's a film that to all intents and purposes needs to be viewed just as a cinematic experience, as a piece of popcorn fodder that may try to be something more cerebral, but ultimately is a daft - but hugely fun - piece of film.\r\n\r\nLuc Besson writes and directs a film that sees Scarlett Johansson duped into being a drug mule, with the transportation of drugs sewn into her abdomen. It's a new drug, boy is it a new drug, and when things go belly up and the drugs are unleashed into Scarlett's system, she's a threat - or hope - to mankind.\r\n\r\nIt can be, and has been, called pretentious et al, such is the science factor, which is perfectly understandable, so any hope of tight science fiction musings will only end up in a crushing disappointment. Undeniably Besson and his backers thought they had something to say, to open up the film watchers' minds to something deep and probable, to be relevant and viable. But unlike the makers we the viewers didn't have access to donepezil, so we sadly couldn't all turn into Bradley Cooper and be limitless in our viewing capabilities.\r\n\r\nPersonally, it's a rollicking fun film for two thirds, when it's about Scarlett kicking butt, a revenge driven babe, it grips and shakes all the genre compliant cinematic senses. The ending, the grand finale, infuriated me, and by the looks of Morgan Freeman (coasting for easy money), he was also a little frustrated. But I had fun, yet on the flip side if anyone fronted me up and said they hated the film with a passion?

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"A lot of people appears to have gotten into some hate-mode when watching this movie. I guess they did not check up what the movie was really about before watching it. The movie is not perfect, it has its flaws, but a 1 or 2 star bullshit rating is hugely unfair. Personally, I really liked this movie. It is science fiction, pure and simple. If you expect science without the fiction, well then you should go and see some other movie. With Luc Besson both writing and directing and statements like \u201cmerciless warrior evolved beyond human logic\u201d in the blurb \u2026 well I got pretty much what I expected.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts off making you think it is a \u201csimple\u201d revenge story with science fiction elements in the form of the superhuman Lucy. However it gradually evolves into something else. Lucy knows that she cannot survive in her new state and it becomes a quest to preserve the knowledge that she has acquired while she still has the time and at the same time dodging the drug dealers that are the cause of her situation in the first place.\r\n\r\nLucy is great. Her powers and how they develop are awesome. I really like surprise effects in movies and books of the kind that you get when someone like Lucy reveals her powers to the \u201cmundane\u201d. Especially when the revealing means swatting a few bad guys. This movie is full of moments like that. It is quite a roller coaster ride of action with Lucy exhibiting her growing powers. Not too surprisingly the movie is also full of scientific bullshit and plot holes. I do not really care. I\u2019m in for the ride and it is a fun ride.\r\n\r\nScarlett Johansson is very good in her role as Lucy. Most of the other actors are ok although the Asian drug boss could have been better. He came out more like a brainless thug than anything else. Certainly not as the mastermind of a criminal organization.\r\n\r\nThe ending was a bit unsatisfactory compared to the rest of the movie though. I was a bit disappointed that the big fight at the end more or less was done without Lucy. The long cinematic sequences where Lucy wondered about in time and space felt a bit like yawn-filler-material. The actual ending, well that \u201cI am everywhere\u201d bit was really been there, seen that, done that. Also, if she was indeed everywhere, why the hurry to create that fancy memory stick?\r\n\r\nAnyway, apart from that I really enjoyed this movie.","id":"5af5f3390e0a2631b700238a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5af5f3390e0a2631b700238a","movie_id":240832}

He goes to Coimbatore to patch up his sister with her husband (she has eloped top marry the guy but has returned after a minor tussle) and there, he meets Pavithra, the girl living opposite his brother-in-law's house. He, not surprisingly, falls in love with her and with the help of his friend Mayilvaganan tries to woo her. But she thinks she loves Gautham, her friend who is actually a rogue. There is also an enmity between her dad and Kathir's brother-in-law. And, then, there is Kathir's dad, who, already betrayed by his daughter, expects his son to stay true to him.\r\n\r\nIf Udhayanidhi wanted to play it safe in his debut Oru Kal Oru Kannadi, he continues in the same vein here and so, your reaction to this film, obviously, is OK OK. He is the happy-go-lucky guy who is not above going after his girl (read stalking) but is decent enough to wish her happiness even after she rejects him. And, with a plot that feels only too familiar, director Prabhakaran (who earlier directed Sundarapandian) loosely strings together scenes that are funny in parts (largely due to Santhanam's one-liners) and sentimental enough to bring in the \"family audience\".\r\n\r\nThe film isn't bad per se but displays very little ambition and is only mildly interesting.\r\n\r\nEvery conflict is resolved in a matter of two or three scenes \u2014 and in very convenient fashion \u2014 that nothing seems to be a serious-enough obstacle. Gautham only wants to bed Pavithra, while she has fallen in love with him, but this sub-plot gets resolved through a scene in which Kathir overhears Gautham's intentions and warns Pavithra. The long-standing enmity between Kathir's brother-in-law and Pavithra's father, which could come between their romance is resolved lightheartedly with a mimicry artist, in a cinematic manner! Even the final problem \u2014 of convincing Kathir's dad \u2014 is resolved with a couple of heavy-handed sentimental dialogues. In one scene, Santhanams exclaim how many flashbacks he will be made to suffer, and it is as is the director is telling us that he realizes these problems, and assuring us that as long as it is entertaining, we needn't bother.","id":"53bb18ce0e0a261971000267","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bb18ce0e0a261971000267","movie_id":255421}

But he gets fired from his job and clueless about raising a child and maintain the family. Then a strange phone call gives him a series of challenges to win with a greater reward.

{"author":"Alex Wen","content":"Director Steven Brill\u2019s last film was my least favorite movie of 2013 (Movie 43), so expectations were not exactly sky high for Walk of Shame. At first glance, the comedy starring Elizabeth Banks appears to be a mix between The Hangover and Anchorman. Unfortunately, it lacks the jokes or the charm that the former two films had.\r\n\r\nAfter having her boyfriend leave and thinking she lost a once-in-a-lifetime job opportunity as an anchor in a major station, Meghan reacts as any young adult would, by getting sloppy drunk and engaging in a one night stand. After a successful night, she wakes to find out that she\u2019s now the top candidate for the anchor job, she just needs to get to work on time. \r\n\r\nForgetting her wallet and phone, Meghan proceeds to embark on the longest walk of shame ever.. On the way, she makes unlikely friends and goes through zany adventures to make it to the newsroom in time for evening news. That was the intention. Instead, Walk of Shame is a misogynistic, racist, unfunny escapade that fails to bring anything new to the comedy genre.\r\n\r\nThe issue with the film is that the derivation of humor stems from how different Meghan is from everyone else. Early on, Meghan encounters three black men, and sure enough she\u2019s scared that they\u2019re drug dealers evading the cops. Not only is her character racist, Brill\u2019s perspective encourages the audience to be racist. It turns out that these guys, Scrilla, Pookie, and Hulk, are nice gentlemen that\u2019s willing to help Meghan. This is suppose to be funny. The contrast from the expectation of how these gangbangers would act towards an attractive white woman and how the it plays out in the movie is suppose to be hilarious. These presumptions just come off senselessly offensive.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not an isolated incident either. Meghan encounters an angry foreign taxi driver, a bunch of incompetent cops, and most damaging, the film paints Elizabeth Banks\u2019 character as a bumbling idiot. Foreigners can\u2019t be trusted, minorities are stereotypes and women are useless, Walk of Shame is an embarrassing concept built on damaging assumptions.\r\n\r\nPoor writing, unoriginal jokes and predictable characters are just icing on the cake for this crude attempt at humor. Steven Brill will have the audience leaving the theaters in a walk of shame with this one.\r\n\r\nRead more reviews at artisticritique.com","id":"53d6cb1ac3a3683a2000014a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53d6cb1ac3a3683a2000014a","movie_id":187596}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***A town of werewolves in the Northeast with Jason Momoa***\r\n\r\nA popular teenager in the Northeast (Lucas Till) discovers that he\u2019s a werewolf and escapes to the road after a tragedy at home. Upon getting a tip from Lemmy (John Pyper-Ferguson), he ends up in Lupine Ridge where he obtains a job at a farm and develops a relationship with a young bar owner (Merritt Patterson), which offends the wolfish town leader (Jason Momoa). Stephen McHattie plays the friendly farmer who takes the boy under his wings.\r\n\r\nThe creatively titled \u201cWolves\u201d (2014) is a quality werewolf flick that\u2019s reminiscent of the Marvel comic book Werewolf by Night. (Even the werewolves resemble Don Perlin\u2019s versions a little). It has elements of The Howling franchise, but with better production values than the sequels, as well as a dash of \u201cTwilight\u201d (2008) and \u201cThe Messengers\u201d (2007). (I hate mentioning \u201cTwilight\u201d because it will automatically turn off loads of people, but I mean the good aspects of that infamous movie).\r\n\r\n\u201cWolves\u201d has the right choices for the main cast, enough gore, some decent action, beautiful women, notable songs and exquisite Ontario locations with great nighttime sylvan ambiance. Yes, it\u2019s thoroughly comic booky, but it\u2019s well made for what it is and delivers the goods. I saw the theatrical version, but I heard the unrated version is a vast improvement with additional exposition.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes and was shot in Ontario in the greater Toronto area.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+","id":"5c9529630e0a2645f150c4a0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c9529630e0a2645f150c4a0","movie_id":290555}
{"author":"Gimly","content":"**From a review written in 2014:**\r\n\r\nI\u2019m sure if I really thought about it, I could easily fault _22 Jump Street_, second in the recent reboot of the 1987 TV series. But I don\u2019t want to think about it, \u2018cause I had a good time and that\u2019s how I choose to remember it.\r\n\r\nTo Hell with what so-called \u201cprofessional\u201d critics are saying, _22 Jump Street_ is not dumb. It\u2019s actually pretty bloody smart. It\u2019s not particularly deep. Or thought-provoking. Or fresh. Or original. Or mature. Or cultured. Or subtle\u2026 But it is smart! And funny. Which for a comedy is more important than anything else.\r\n\r\n_22 Jump Street_ is very aware of itself, and that can be a tough line to walk, but I think it just managed to get right, brining in some serious meta-humour rather than coming across as arrogant or lazy.\r\n\r\nJust.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not particularly big on comedies, and American comedies are certainly pretty low even on that list. But I have been known to come across the odd pleasant surprise. _21 Jump Street_ was one of them (especially considering I assumed it would be akin to the original series, which was a straight laced procedural crime drama\u2026) and now 22 Jump Street is another I can add to that list.\r\n\r\n_75%_\r\n\r\n_-Gimly_","id":"5b10fa9b9251415e9c00e4a9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b10fa9b9251415e9c00e4a9","movie_id":187017}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Some people're destined to meet the secret friend.\r\n\r\nFrom the director Hiromasa Yonebayashi of 'The Secret World of Arriety' fame. Based on the 1967 English novel of the same name and so the important characters borrowed the western names. This is what I call a fine adaptation, great transformation from the words to the motion picture. Actually, it suited for the narration from the standpoint of Japanese culture and lifestyle, especially for this anime version with the beautiful fictional coastal landscapes. Whenever I remember this film in the future, that Marsh house would be the first thing to pop out in my mind, an unforgettable landmark for sure.\r\n\r\nThe movie promos were damp. The posters were not that impressive, but okay and the trailer was very ordinary. Studio Ghibli was the reason to go for it, so I expected nothing spectacular from the movie. Even while I was watching, I thought it was just an enjoyable mystery flick, but you know sometime the value of the whole movie comes at the end twist. Once the end was near my stance changed, especially after the hidden truth revelation. Some movies need a re-watch to terminate any doubts regarding characters and scenes. As for this movie, if your focus is straight, then it's does not require.\r\n\r\nNot a technical brilliance like the director's previous movie, but the story was strong and twisty. The characters were very interesting, suspense was the movie's influence for the audience to stick till the end. There is no loose end, certainly gives a few topics to discuss about, but the narration moves on a circular track and hits back like the boomerang. That does not mean it is a time travel or something. The narration bends and blends with the time. To realise what is real and what is not, you have to wait till the end. After seeing the film, I understood everyone's childhood memories could monopolize if we encounter same object, place, person and other things again in the later life. Yes, I had few minor experience in my life as well.\r\n\r\nThe opening dialogue itself a hint of what kind of movie it is going to be. There are two prominent girls, Anna and Marnie in the story, like the Anna and Elsa from 'Frozen'. The narration flips on a regular basis to tell the multiple layered story. As this film was a puzzle in portrayal, obviously viewers try to solve it, including me. I tried my best. I thought Anna's childhood toy was something to do with all the fuss, but I was terribly wrong. That was a perfect divert if you observe it closely. In another perspective, I kept 'The Others' and 'The Orphanage' in mind, but was not even close to where this story was heading. Whether you succeed or not, very fun to solve a mystery, you know. Finally, it gave me full satisfaction like that indirectly I saw 'The Uninvited' once again.\r\n\r\nFeels like the Oscars was concluded yesterday, but I am already thinking about the next one. If I am not wrong this movie is definitely one of the contenders for the best animation race, along with 'The Good Dinosaur' probably. Absolutely, I would be disappointed if I don't see it in the final five. There is lots of time between now and then, so anything might happen, who knows. After all, this film has already won my little heart and millions of other's. I know no one can replace Mr. Miyazaki, but feels like Hiromasa Yonebayashi could come near if his future projects as much effective as his one. Best of luck to him and he's only a 41. But remember Isao Takahat is 80 and still in the race, yet to announce his retirement. And this film was very close to his 'Only Yesterday'.\r\n\r\n> I love you more than any girl I've ever known.\r\n\r\nStudio Ghibli is like Disney Studio from the east. As we know, narrating a fairy tale having the tween girls in the lead is what they're famous for. The previous couple of movies were out of their trademark, so, happy they are back with this masterwork. At a same time I am very very very very sad, because it's their final movie after the 30 years of triumph. Since Hayao Miyazaki's retirement everything falling apart from the studio's management. They've given reasons and it is only a temporary, though hope the rise of 3D animation is not the one to halt the production, praying for the pause to be lifted soon.\r\n\r\nThis film is not just passing through from this giant anime production house, but it is a masterpiece. As usual, it is a girly movie and that does not stop grownups, especially men from a watch. I loved it, everytime when I like a movie I express my desire for a sequel and so I did for this film. Though it was one time story with nothing left over for further development, possibly some new thing can be attached to it. Whatever happens this movie will remain as one of the best from the studio and can compete with any modern animations and live-shot masterworks. Highly recommended, not just for anime or animation fans, but for mystery and who love the layers in story narration.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"55804e55925141274b0000ba","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55804e55925141274b0000ba","movie_id":242828}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Taste the defeat, and once again inspire to rise back to the glory.\r\n\r\nInspired by the real story of a high school American-football coach and his team's participation in the 2004 season. The fall and rise of one of the most consistent team, especially after holding a record for the longest winning streak, what happens when it was broken unexpectedly? Do the players lose the confidence, coach be clueless, parents go crazy and media annoys them, is what neatly this film narrated. It looked nice to me and I had a good time, but it was too long and not inspiring as the other sports film based on the true events.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'Coach Carter', another decent sports film. I am not disappointed because I was not expecting to be a masterpiece, though not bad for once viewing. All the actors were good, especially it is Jim Caviezel's one of the major roles and he was amazing. American-football was always been an Americas sport, so I never interested in it except watching films based on them for inspiration. Especially after 'Conccusion', my interest on them dropped further.\r\n\r\nWhatever I said is not a reason to skip the film. As a film, it did the right thing to portray the real life achievers on the screen to boost the young sports persons. Only to me it was just an above average, but for many others, it is one of the best sports film of the year. Forget the American-football, what I liked was, achievements are good for our progress and make a career, but sometimes there's much more than making records in the games. So it's a good moral lesson film than a fine entertaining film. I won't recommend it, but definitely not a waste of time.\r\n\r\n6.5\/10","id":"57a37394c3a3682fa7006e2d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57a37394c3a3682fa7006e2d","movie_id":232679}
{"author":"Matthew Brady","content":"\"There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job\".\r\n\r\nWhiplash follows are main character Andrew Neyman who is a young jazz drummer, single-minded in his pursuit to rise to the top of his elite east coast music conservatory. Plagued by the failed writing career of his father, Andrew hungers day and night to become one of the greats. Terence Fletcher, an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods, leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, forever changing the young man's life.\r\n\r\nOK let me just start off with this. You had no idea how much I was really looking forward to Whiplash. This was on my movies to check out list, because I heard nothing but positive things from this movie and I heard a lot of people described this film has the \"Full Metal Jacket\" but with no war or guns, but with music and well... drums. I think Whiplash and \"Birdman\" was the two movies I wanted to see before making my best movies of the year list, because who knows they might make the list. I haven't seen \"Birdman\" yet but will do soon, but I finally had the chance to see Whiplash and my god this movie was just so spectacularly flawless in many ways. Whiplash is the best move of 2014.\r\n\r\nJ.K. Simmons in this movie probably pulls of the best performance in his career. Every word that came out of his mouth didn't feel like he was reading from the script then act it out. I felt every angry punch of words that came out of him, because it was so real. I didn't see J.K. Simmons just playing a movie character in this movie, no he was the freaking Fletcher.\r\n\r\nNow let's talk about Terence Fletcher: The best way to describe Fletcher to those who haven't seen the film yet, well his like Sgt. Hartman from \"Full Metal Jacket\". When he's on screen your locked on and he's also the kind of person that would be somebody's worse nightmare to have for a boss. This guy doesn't just like music, he breaths music and he wants his band to do perfect. His opinion and his look on music is another thing why I didn't flat out just hated him, I actually understood him. He made a very good point about how people will comment on you act and say \"You did a good job\", and yes I did use the words \"you did a great job\", in my past reviews but now I'm never going to use it ever again after this movie.\r\n\r\nMiles Teller was another stand out performances in this movie, and just like \"Foxcatacher\" where Channing Tatum was so over looked by his performance, well Miles Teller has proved himself to be more then a teen in a movie that will be forgotten and so would he, but no Miles Teller played this character so brilliantly he could become the next big thing. Now his character in this movie has the love of the true art of music and you can see that he wants to tell people his love for music, but when the harsh life of reality comes crashing into him it's truly heartbreaking to see his struggle and effort just not being good enough. Teller played this character so realistic and so brilliantly flawless.\r\n\r\nThe directing and the writing in this was just....perfect. Damien Chazelle gave this movie style and passion to tell a story about two strong music buffs battling out and he freaking nailed it.\r\n\r\nThis movie also had probably the best finale that I've seen in years. My nails were digging into the seat. I didn't dare to look away not for one moment, not for one second. I was simply locked on and when it was over... I'm kidding you I actually clapped towards the end of this movie. Now the biggest cliche that I always hear from critics when their talk about a different movies and their use words like \"You will clap at the end\", but you don't, or \"You will feel inspired after the film\", and I you don't. But Whiplash actually did make me feel inspirited towards the end and made me clap. It's message of not giving up and the dream that you been chancing for isn't just going to come to you. Movies like Pride, freedom Writers and all that such never ever give me that inspiring feeling inside of me, until I watched this movie.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: Whiplash is a movie that everybody needs to see. This isn't just a popcorn movie where you come and put you legs up and laugh a couple of times, no this movie reaches out to people out there that have the same problems that these character's have, with their passion of what their what to do in life get's over shadowed by something you don't want to do and this movie get's it right. So go and see if you have the chance.","id":"5e2f2a96326c1900121c0682","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2f2a96326c1900121c0682","movie_id":244786}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> The video document of the life of the vampires.\r\n\r\nA documentary style horror comedy based on the short film of the same name by the same directors. I would say it is an interview with the vampires in the Kiwi style. The film follows a group of vampires living in an old mansion and their everyday routine, including how they manage to get blood and confrontation with other mutants are documented.\r\n\r\nDefinitely a wonderful comedy, but feels like a mix of 'Dark Shadows' and 'Addams Family'. The title implies the nightlife of these creatures, especially adapting the modern way of lifestyle. So their exploration begins here for their video document. Being different is how much struggle is what the film focused. Threats from various quarters and getting over from every disastrous event is revealed.\r\n\r\nQuite an interesting vampire film with the awesome characters and of course the entire film was shot in the dark time. It is not a clich\u00e9, but just a spoof of the typical vampire theme. Cleverly written screenplay and direction with the well supported performances. Looks like many people had loved it, I'm slightly on the different side that I enjoyed watching it but did not like much. Because I have seen better film in the similar concept.

{"author":"mattwilde123","content":"'What We Do In The Shadows' is an hilarious mockumentary film by the makers of 'Flight of the Conchords'. The movie is filed with brilliant homages and references to vampire films such as 'The Lost Boys', 'Twilight' and 'Let The Right One In'.\r\n\r\nThe directorial style is very similar to the hit TV show 'The Office' as it is able to create humour in the realism and personal interviews and monologues.

{"author":"MJM","content":"DISGUSTING NONSENSE...\r\n\r\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\r\n\r\nI find it very sad that so many people - including so-called professional reviewers - have rated this crap so highly. I did not walk out (although I was greatly tempted to do so) but saw it to the end. A total waste of time.\r\n\r\nHere's what might spoil it for you, should you believe the BS that's being spread around this stinking pile of excrement: It could have actually been OK if it hadn't been so laughably impossibly ridiculous. Perhaps if it had been set in the fifties or the forties when people had much less developed consciousness of human rights? But even so... \r\n\r\nI suppose the moral\/lesson we are supposed to learn is... if you can't warp your students enough by abuse to force them to become great musicians then it is perfectly alright to discard or destroy them in the attempt. \r\n\r\nThis glorified tyrant and bully can himself only produce music at a grade one level and so because he cannot 'do' he 'teaches?'\r\n\r\nHe does not teach, he does not inspire; he withholds approval, negatively reinforces and rules by fear, and is feared rather than respected. I would have a difficult time to point to a single (pedagogical) scene in the film that had any merit whatsoever or was worth watching for any reason. Maybe I should say that its evident popularity may be evidence that we are truly living in the end times... ha! \r\n\r\nSee the film if you want to be current, but please decide for yourself from watching it and don't believe the hype about its 'genius' or 'brilliance.' It is not either of those things; it's a poorly written, sad joke. \r\n\r\nI would expect that those people who rate it so highly A) want to seem cool because 'it's about jazz' B) have never actually been in a teacher\/student situation and therefore, can only imagine how its done C) see all the other positive reviews and so must follow the herd D) don't really know their ass from their elbow or E) thought the the actor had truly grown because in Spiderman he only yell, but it THIS one, he throws chairs.... or F) all of the above.\r\n\r\nSave your money or see something uplifting instead rather than this horseshit.","id":"54c82e03c3a36870ba000a3d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54c82e03c3a36870ba000a3d","movie_id":244786}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The age of digital gang war.\r\n\r\nA German cyber-thriller from the director of 'The Silence'. The second half of the title 'Kein Systen ist Sicher' means 'No System is Safe' in English. So far, lots of films were made on this theme, but nothing was quite delightful as this one. Mainly because of the young cast and the depiction of the contemporary cyber world. With its incredible pace and the exciting storyline, in addition to that, some unexpected twists and turns, the film would easily surpass anybody's anticipation.\r\n\r\nIt hits the right chord at the right time to bring some of the wonderful scenes. But as usual like any thriller films, the third act was its strength where it peaked that caused to flip its narration to the different facet. There are positives and negatives in the hacking business, but what I witnessed in this was some kind of digital gang war which directly affected the law-enforcement agency. A virtually conflict between two gangs for their superiority over the cyber's underworld. That means don't imagine like an online game between two, but beyond that.\r\n\r\nUsually the hackers are the sidekicks for the film's main characters. That's how most of the films depicted them and we know it. But there are some films that highlighted them on the first priority base, yet no film convinced me their genuine acts, both, virtually as well as physically to achieve their goals as in this one. I meant this film was not all about programming, cracking passwords, stealing data, releasing viruses, definitely not about a computer geek,\r\n\r\nBut yes, it was something like that whose world changes after encountering a small gang like him. They're all experts in different fields and together unstoppable, who later form a team nicknamed CLAY to make friend with the world's number one hacker MRX. After under-appreciated and humiliation, the CLAY dares their icon and urge to take his place, but the plan terribly fails. That's how the story takes a grand venture that brings the secret police into frame to expand its plot to a more interesting conclusion.\r\n\r\n> \"When the life gives you lemons, ask for salt and tequila.\"\r\n\r\nThe balance between all its contents were awesome. Not the whole time they sit in front of the computer and do the stuffs, but there many real outside world adventures. Because there's a belief among us that everything can be done playing with the computer keyboard which proved wrong here. Besides, there was a small slice of romance, and the magic trick which briefly illustrates the film's important phase that holds the key to understand the happenings. The overall narration was a flashback that opens in a police station where our main hero of the story was investigated. He himself compares with the superheroes and the hacking ability is his superpower.\r\n\r\nIts not only the racy pace, but the energetic performances by the young actors was also the reason for the film's uplift. From the technical aspect, it was superbly written, directed and edited film. In some way, the film also resembles 'Fight Club' and 'The Usual Suspects'. Looks like the lead character was a big fan of those films and that's how it got influenced. I would have said many things about this film comparing with those two, but I'm trying to avoid the spoiler and it is possible only if I never brought this topic into here. But anyway, this film was one of the hardest nuts to crack what's coming next.\r\n\r\nTalking about the twist, it feels like the same old tricks from some of the old Hollywood blockbusters. But you should be patience till the film to end, because that part matters a lot. Probably that's where anyone who watched it will decide how much they liked it. The film generated its own trademark with the black hood and the white mask which already got a cult status among its fans. The  rock music was awesomely matched with this theme.\r\n\r\nThere is a Hollywood version is coming, but I'm hoping for not to mess it up like the majority of remakes does. In the mean time, I'll look forward to an announcement of a possible sequel, because films like this should end in a trilogy. Especially in the todays film business, trilogies are the greatest achievements that followed by the original film's success. If you had loved this film and after seeing the way it ended you won't say no to that. This film is not for IT techies alone, but anyone would enjoy it. Surely I recommend it for who're interested in crime, thriller.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"5752fcfbc3a3685207003157","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5752fcfbc3a3685207003157","movie_id":284427}

He is a nasty tyrant and an incident from his past comes back to haunt him.\r\n\r\nMiles Teller plays Andrew Neiman the put upon jazz drummer in the Shaffer Conservatory in New York. Neiman is eager to impress Fletcher but nothing he can do is good enough and withstands all the effluent Fletcher throws at him until one day he snaps.\r\n\r\nDamien Chazelle unleashed an unethical monster in Fletcher with Neiman providing the film's heart but I am not convinced that this is a good film. The rest of the students in the class are silent to the abuse taking place right in front of them. They are young adults, not kids and they do nothing about it.","id":"58b352d5c3a368525400c173","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b352d5c3a368525400c173","movie_id":244786}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> An inspiring theme, but too much of cinematic than realistic.\r\n\r\nI came across after an unexpected glance at its inspiring title, and a good looking poster. But it is just a hit and miss. First, I wanted to clear the view whether it was a religious related subject or simply an inspiring movie. The answer is merely yes to the second one. Because it was a brilliant platform that failed desperately with all the usual cliches.\r\n\r\nFor the normal people, it might be an uplifting flick. But for the movie fanatics, it is one of those attempts from their watch that terribly fallen short. No doubt, it is a good theme, a little boring as well to see the same old formula with the new cast. In the end it did not work for me. The way it handled to solve the personal and social issues that depicted in the film characters is not persuasive.\r\n\r\nThe twist at the end was the dumbest one. I can't understand why a movie like this need one. Those are for the smartest scripts and this one should have focused more on the friendship and father-daughter relationship rather trying to imitate the commercial films. Though the actor did well, and the production design was way better than many mainstream films from the recent time. Definitely a go for it, but what do you expect from it will decide how much you're going to like it.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"56e6f60f9251417ea20012c0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56e6f60f9251417ea20012c0","movie_id":243352}
{"author":"mattwilde123","content":"When I sat down to watch this film, I didn't know what to expect. I am not usually a fan of films about musicians but this was a brilliant and tense masterpiece. The story is of a very ambitious boy named Andrew (played by Miles Teller) who is a music student in New York. He aspires to be noticed by a prestigious music teacher named Fletcher (played by J.K. Simmons). As his wish starts becoming a reality, he realises the brutality of this teacher who continually pushes him with questionable methods. Damien Chazelle's direction is almost of a tense boxing or war action drama in that it constantly uses the music of the drumming to build the tension whilst using violent and sharp editing whilst the jazz band play.\r\n\r\nChazelle's screenplay is very well written. It is filled with humour, tension and heartbreak. The way in which Fletcher switches during Andrew's first lesson is expertly done. Fletcher relentlessly insults Andrew in a very shocking way which really creates a huge sense of sympathy for Andrew's character as he struggles to respond. The insulting dialogue is very similar to Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' in that it is both humourous and disturbingly distressing.\r\n\r\nThe performances in this film are remarkable. Miles Teller is a relative newcomer but takes to this character with so much depth and understanding. The drumming scenes look like incredible and torturous workouts and Teller really shows the pain and agony his character is going through to reach his dream. The chemistry between the two central characters is flawless. J.K. Simmons is perfect as the abusive music teacher. Simmons manages to combine Fletcher's distinguished persona with his terrifying unpredictability. Simmons reminds me of his character in Valve's 'Portal 2' in which he continuously spouts insults at the player in a darkly hilarious way.\r\n\r\nOverall, 'Whiplash' is a fascinating study of passion, ambition and love. The film asks questions about the morality of getting one's dreams and the acceptable methods of acquiring them. Full of amazing performances all around, and created with such intensity and spirit, my final rating for this film is 4.5 stars.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd","id":"58c14edac3a368265b009826","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c14edac3a368265b009826","movie_id":244786}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Four kids go missing in a zoo. There is a gargantuan snake on the loose inside the grounds. The kids are speech and hearing impaired and so finding them is doubly difficult. Meanwhile, there's a media circus outside the place. With a plot like this, all we expect is a tense thriller (with a bit of satire and dry humour) but Enna Satham Intha Neram is tone-deaf. Rather than be a thriller, it wants to be a comedy (hey, after all, that's the trend, right?) and what we get is a dumb film that passes silliness for comedy and implausibility for thrills. \r\n\r\nOne scene in particular highlights everything that is wrong with this film. We are told that the kids might try to find a way out by climbing over an electric fence. So, the zoo keeper and the kid's school teacher rush to turn off the power while the director cross-cuts between their attempt and the kids climbing the wall. This is the Jurassic Park moment of the film and we must be experiencing nail-biting tension. But the scene is so insipidly written and staged that the moment barely makes any impact. \r\n\r\nThe characters are as inept as the writing \u2014 incompetent zoo keepers, incompetent cops, incompetent school staff, and, yes, even an incompetent snake that cannot kill a prey even if it stands before it! Some of the characters are also major irritants as well \u2014 a TV news journalist who will never be let within a mile of a mike, a zoo keeper who cracks the blandest PJs when he is supposed to be searching for the children (Poor Nithin Sathyaa is made to do things that you normally associate with Premgi Amaren). \r\n\r\nIn fact, no adult character is serious about finding the kids. Right till the climax, instead of actually doing something, everyone keeps talking about mundane matters \u2014 the journalist talks about the impending divorce of the kids' parents, a minister comes in only to expose the journalist's sleazy side, a Blue Cross official tells the cops not to harm the snake, the zoo keeper and the school teacher fight over sleeping tablets... It would have been better if the snake had swallowed one of these annoying characters. \r\n\r\nThe only sensible beings in the film are the kids themselves, and they seem more than capable of taking care of themselves, despite their age and disabilities \u2014 when one of them falls in a pit, they rescue her all by themselves, intelligently signal their location with balloons, and even use the tab that they have to find their way out of the place. And, it is only for them that you even endure the film.","id":"53baaa740e0a263588002ab6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baaa740e0a263588002ab6","movie_id":279280}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> The day when the dogs stopped wagging their tails.\r\n\r\nThis movie was a tricky one, because everyone cannot understand and everyone cannot enjoy it. In this modern world, the computer graphics are easily available to illude the audience, so who would still use the silly old practical trickery in a film making. Must have been the hard work to manage plenty of the dogs during the shooting. But I believe there are hardly any major CGI works other than the bluescreen works. If you get the movie, then that's fine, if not, you may get some ideas through this review. Before proceeding I just want to alert the readers the review might contain some spoilers which is not measured.\r\n\r\nThe Hungary's entry for the last concluded Oscars. The movie talks about a girl Lili in her early teenage, aspiring musician and her mixed breed dog name Hagen. When a circumstance forces them apart, the individual life journey begins for both of them. The girl becomes rebellious towards her father and the dog towards the human society like a piece of iron bar pulled away from the magnet. Will they unite again? Is the rest of the story with the breathtaking second half.\r\n\r\nThis dark fantasy (like dark comedy) film was like the old days, like the black and white beast or the monster films similar to 'King Kong' and others, where animals can think like humans, execute like humans, but still not a fairytale nor the science fiction. Because sci-fi applies theoretical probabilities, animal psychology et cetera, while fairytale is a magic. It will come between sci-fi and fantasy, most likely an adult version of the fantasy tale. Comparing it with 'Birds' is one hundred per cent not agreeable, because unlike the dogs, the birds' behaviours were unknown. But 'Conquest of the Planet of the Apes' was the closest one, and you can compare Caesar with Hagen.\r\n\r\nIt does not end there, I believe you all have seen the last year's genuinely written screenplay 'Lucy'. You may wonder why this comparison, because this film is about dogs, yet the title strangely pronounced as 'God'. What I understood was that Hagen was drugged with cocaine (white powder) like the blue powder in the other film and he started to change his personality. So that explains the coke was the 'White God' and the rest follows the story of revenge, leadership and ultimately the revolution.\r\n\r\n> \"It's hard to lose someone you love.\r\n> Things don't work out the way we imagined.\"\r\n\r\nOff the record: Most of us know that the dogs are derived from the wolves. Yet they have lost the freedom compared to a few centuries ago who walked freely on the human streets. Every dog must have a master\/owner or it will be put to sleep rather keeping and feeding them forever in the dog pound. So I think dogs are suffering more than the apes and they deserved the revolution (according to this film).\r\n\r\nAnimal abuse was highlighted in the movie. The story was descended from there and what happens if they takeover us is the movie's view. One of the weirdest movie of the year, but different and good. If you ever had a dog, you will know they were adorable, even in the violent scenes. Because they were just playing, but that does not the case for children and those who never been with dogs. Every shot that had dogs were cleverly achieved, the outcome was very convincing.\r\n\r\nI have heard the crew used two brothers for the Hagen role. They both were awesome, equals to any main human characters from the movie. Another 250 mixed-breed stray dogs were participated in the film making and later most of them were adopted. Believe me the movie was a good one, but some people had a hard time accepting the oddity of the theme. It won a couple of awards at Cannes film festival, including one for the Hagen's character performance.\r\n\r\nThe Hungarian film industry to make into the international level, they should take the cue from this success and must bring the sequel with a broader cast. Nowadays, experimental movies like this are welcomed by the moviegoers around the globe. Definitely, an interesting story with the striking scenes and dialogues would make everyone turn toward the eastern Europe. Obviously I recommend this one, but never expect the style of Hollywood, it had approached its own way to give a pleasing movie.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"55e74f809251416c120006c5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55e74f809251416c120006c5","movie_id":267999}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A tale of two sisters.\r\n\r\nWhen two nations and it's two different culture meets. Well, I have been waiting for this movie since not so long. It's sad that it was released only in the domestic circuit, but international market would have popularised it. Usually audience welcome this kind multi-cultural themes. I would say poor promotions for such a wonderful movie. It's not a celebratable film, very artistic with the slight touch of Bollywood. The film was based on the book of the same name which deals with the contents on the basis of facts, mostly, about rural India to the first world.\r\n\r\nIt talks about how quickly the life changes. Whether it is good or bad, easy or hard, decisions have to be taken in some tight circumstances. So when you reach a certain point of your life and you look back, you would realise those turning points pulled you to this current life. This film about two sisters who forced to separate at an early stage of life, later who grown up in the different world reveals how they take the truth.\r\n\r\nThe story was short, which suits perfectly to be a short film. But this film managed to run long as the 90 minutes. The stretch was the only issue in this narration, because kind of teases being close to the conclusion but it does not. The topic was powerful, so all the lag are exploited to demonstrate the character bahaviours. More like discovering yourself, your past and your origin and all.\r\n\r\n> \"What is painful is to wake up every single day\r\n> not knowing if she's okay.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the ideal cast, I liked each and every character, well classified. But all the focus was on the two sisters and a slightly lets in the romance track as more like a subplot or to fill the void that much needed to stretch the story briefing. The story had a strong initiation and its ends with the same intensity. In the middle, it leaps too long ahead, leaving those journeys in the life that one must go through till to set free him\/herself. That means to be an adult, so that you can determine your path.\r\n\r\nThe film's goal is to signify the two sister's stories together as much as possible, not individually. In some part of the movie, emotionally appeals. The end was good, though disappoints from the other side of the family. The solution was either way, but curiosity arises what might happen after the end. The scientists are looking for who we're and where did we come from, but many among us have their own identity crises. This kind of identity research films feels so good to watch. I recommend it for everyone, but remember you can't be me and you can't feel it as I did.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"55b1384ac3a36872650087cb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55b1384ac3a36872650087cb","movie_id":286250}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> When the source followed straight to the isolated lab.\r\n\r\nIt looks like been ages. I know the movies (the previous three), but can't remember the scenes. A quick recap would have been helpful, but I did not do that and went ahead with this. That's the reason I hate to follow television series on the broadcast which drag one season for over 6 months. This was the fourth film in the [Rec] film series and third in the story continuation after first two. The third installment was set in the parallel timeline to that before one, but off the track narration. In this, an old woman character was brought on-board to make sure the third film was not an offbeat from the series.\r\n\r\nExcept the opening few minutes, the rest of the story takes place on a moving ship. Kind of similar to 'Sector 7', though both the flicks are entirely different. The ship is used as a laboratory to develop a vaccine for the deadly disease which turns humans into the flesh eating zombies. It is protected by the armed paramilitary force. Somehow the virus breaks loose, the infection spreads out quickly through the various platforms like lab monkeys and foods. How the survivours fight to remain alive in the nowhere of the ocean is the remaining narrative. If there is a way, how they make it out that comes with the intensified gore battle between the undead and the living.\r\n\r\nI never expected another film in the series, I thought it was a trilogy, but after seeing this I felt the idea was not that bad after all. Just like the 'Jurassic Park' movies, the fourth movie puts the franchise back on the track after the third was derailed. The first film was so good and a bit scary too, followed by another decent movie. Like I mentioned the third flick was different, but a sustainable one to the theme and title.\r\n\r\n> \"I don not know what was going on,\r\n> but luckily I was not there.\"\r\n\r\nThis story starts off with a slow, until the third act where the pace picks up rapidly. Not scary, but towards the final sequences, it was very fast and edgy. The way it concluded, the outro scene was a hint for another film in the franchise. But in my opinion, it should have ended with three films or with this one. Hoping for a better one if there is going to be another [Rec], because my rating in numeral declining by one point following the each sequel.\r\n\r\nI think the suspense should have maintained well. There were some tiny twists and turns on the weak movie plot, but I anticipated the final twist and it did not deliver with that effectively. I know the theme was built on the situation, not depended on prolonged story. Because the action speaks more than any kind of development to give a clean vision on happening. After all, most of the horror movies follow the same sutra, but sometimes the horror-dramas exclude it and this is not one of that.\r\n\r\nIts a collective performance, individually, not noticeable. Because it does not follow any particular character. Though the character Angela, the television reporter was the centre of the attraction as it marks her comeback who was main in the first two films. The filmmaking was compromised, I mean it was not 'found footage' style movie as should have been. Because where this story set in does not demand such kind of cinematographical portrayal. Also avoids the dark atmosphere that used to scare us, especially the night vision screenplay was critical in the earlier two films to creep out the viewers.\r\n\r\nThe title for this installment was 'Apocalypse', but that does not make any sense what they show in the exit scene. Should have called it 'Zombie Ship' like 'Ghost Ship'. I feel it is worth a watch, only to keep updated the [Rec] film series, because if they make a phenomenal 5th movie, we don't have to go back to 4th for continuation.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"563a4e71925141439c002db8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/563a4e71925141439c002db8","movie_id":185341}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> When the gangsters from the west meets the east.\r\n\r\nI don't recall that I have ever seen a Lithuanian film prior to this. Well, it was jointly produced with the Britain and an English language film. But most of film sets in the Lithuania, so there are many dialogues in the local and other eastern European languages. The cast was brilliant from both the countries, and an awesomely shot film too. The pace was excellent with a simple story, there are no boring parts.\r\n\r\nIt totally surprised me. You know this film got a mixed response, so I was not sure about giving it a try. Anyway, I went on, but now I feel it is worth suggesting others as well. It is a road film, gangster theme as well, especially clash of the two gangs from the two different nations. It all begins when a group of friends decides to rob a criminal gang and leave the country for once. But due to their flight was redirected to Eastern Europe the misadventure begins.\r\n\r\nIt was similar to 'Lost in Thailand'. I had so much fun watching it. Sometimes a film like this does not need a good story, but performances really counts and that's why I liked it. It is not a multiple times watchable film, but for once and twice, the entertainment is guaranteed. There is a possibility for a sequel and I would definitely yes for that.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"573760f1925141136e004500","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/573760f1925141136e004500","movie_id":190469}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Return to where we've come from to revive our life.\r\n\r\nEver since the movie 'Dallas Buyers Club' grabbed the three golden statues at the Oscars, the director has been in the spotlight. But I was enjoying his movies before that and yet this one is another remarkable adventurous-drama based on the real expedition into the wild. Cheryl Strayed whose story was this film based upon appeared in the beginning scene where she drops off her version of the movie character and wishes her a luck.\r\n\r\nThe world is round, you can't runaway with your problems. If you do, you might end up where you have started. That's why its called a circle of life, goes round and round and round. You can hide your issues with yourself, but it may lead to a depression. Sometime when an experiment goes wrong, it's better to restart from the scratch with a different method. Here in our (human) lives some people do the same, return to where we've come from to restore the lost life. Of course I said all these, because this flick was inspired by such real incident.\r\n\r\nI prefer this film was very close to the Australian movie 'Tracks' than bringing 'Into the Wild' into the frame. Obviously the Australian movie and this one are about the two young women, but the thing is, the story deals with the different motivation for their decision to take part in the quest. The Aussie flick has an edge over this when it comes to the challenges faced during the journey and also I loved from narration to photography, music and performance.\r\n\r\nSince they both inspired by the true story, I appreciate the filmmaker's effort to bring them into the screen and salute to those two magnificent ladies. In both the films, both the women psychologically affected by their earlier stage of lives which was one of the reasons to step into the wild. I feel, 'Tracks' should have been nominated instead this movie for the Academy Awards.\r\n\r\n> I've always been someone's daughter or mother or wife.\r\n> I never got to be in the driver's seat of my own life.\r\n\r\nIt was a wonderful 2014 for Reese Witherspoon. Back to back career reviving; biographical and inspiring human emotion movies in this graphic, sci-fi and fantasy dominated era. The year's sweetheart for the critics and I doubt there will be another same year. Remember, she was nominated for the Oscars for her role in this film.\r\n\r\nThe disappointment was the adventures. Not what I expected. The struggles were unable to reach for our deep heart compared to other self-discovery voyage films. Weight she carried and losing a toe nail, I don't see much impact because those are supposed to happen. This PCT (Pacific Crest Trail) is well planned and partially protected the hikers with all the needs supplied all along the route. The only thing they have to do is stay away from the wild lives and watch-out for the intruders between the checkpoints.\r\n\r\nIn other end coping with depression was what I loved in the movie. Without those flashbacks this film was nothing. Literally, this story all about the mental healing. The pain she carried, she just wanted to eject it from her body and mind, and the journey helped it. The funny thing is I liked Laura Dern a lot than anybody in the movie. Her character as well as her dialogues was very inspiring. Her nominee for the actress in a supporting role was justified. I can watch this film again and again, only for her alone, sadly she won't appear for a long stay.\r\n\r\nI loved it, but not completely pleased with the product. The reason is 'Tracks'. I think the film came at the wrong time or maybe I saw this one when the other flick was still hot and fresh in my memory. An achievement is an achievement, I respect both the films. You like the movie or not, that's a secondary thought regarding movie's outcome.  But it's a must see for disclosing the extraordinary adventure of an ordinary young woman.\r\n\r\n7.5\/10","id":"5592c387c3a36869e80004b1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5592c387c3a36869e80004b1","movie_id":228970}

When he crosses a line with her, she sees no other option but to run away and try to get home to Seattle. The problem is, she can't get in contact with her mom and she lacks the means to travel back home. \r\n\r\nAt this point, Mackenzie begins to shadow a lone backpacker, Rene Bartlett, in the hopes that he'll help her return home. Bartlett, grieving the recent loss of his wife, is initially closed off and reluctant to assume responsibility for the persistent teenager who won't reveal what she's running from. But he can't in good conscience let Mackenzie wander around Denali Park alone with no food or equipment, so their journey together begins.\r\n\r\nIt's in the vast, quiet, and gorgeous Alaskan wilderness that both Mackenzie and Bartlett begin to heal from their respective hurts, and slowly develop a level of trust. For Mackenzie, Bartlett becomes the surrogate father figure she desperately needs, especially after her damaging experience with her uncle. And Mackenzie provides for Bart a chance to see past his grief.\r\n\r\nAll the while, Mackenzie's troubled by the persistent texts and phone calls from her uncle, a master manipulator who tries to lure her back home. She and Bartlett are bound to cross paths with him at some point as he searches for his niece.\r\n\r\nUltimately, though, the story is about Mackenzie and Bart and their journey of healing through a landscape that seems to dwarf their problems. It's worth watching for a tale of human connection as well as the lush scenery.","id":"58b35223c3a368522000c01b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b35223c3a368522000c01b","movie_id":300654}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is a good and very enjoyable movie which, to me, was a bit surprising since I generally find that time travel is akin to sticking your foot in some messy and smelly stuff. It almost always screws up the movie in some way or another. This one was not without its faults but it did survive becoming too screwed up by it.\r\n\r\nThe opening scenes are indeed somewhat impressive throwing the viewer directly into an apocalyptic future where mutants as well as human are rounded up by sentinels. I could not help but think about Terminator during these scenes. Maybe not very original from a general point of view but the dark and gloomy opening was not the opening scenes I would have expected from an X-Men movie.\r\n\r\nThen we, unfortunately, dive straight into some time travel when they send Wolverine back to 1973. This is of course a opportunity to make yet another twist of the mutant scare, mutants hunt, a good mutant is a dead mutant etc. story that we have seen in so many movies now. The main adversary changes but the general story idea stays the same and the arguments for hunting down the mutants are as silly as ever. Quite frankly, I find that angle a wee bit overdone and boring by now.\r\n\r\nLuckily the story is fairly well implemented. The scene were Wolverine wakes up and disposes of the three thugs are rather funny. Pretty standard stuff but pretty funny nevertheless. The part where they retrieve Magneto is quite nice and the scene down in the Pentagon where the guards and everything else is \u201cfrozen\u201d while Maximoff calmly walks around and rearranges things is outright hilarious.\r\n\r\nI quite disliked the cheap twist where Magneto just decided to go amok and screw things up just when they were about to retrieve Mystique though. They could have spent some time coming up with a better way to twist the story at that time. The idiotic stuff with Wolverine getting a fit at the same time was just adding to my annoyance with that scene. This part is the main reason I will not give this movie a top score.\r\n\r\nApart from this scene the movie is a very well done superhero movie with lots of nice special effects. Sure it is also rather predictable but most people, including myself, do watch these movies mostly for the effects after all. As long as the plot is not downright stupid it get to pass.\r\n\r\nTime travel. Okay, I have to harp a bit about time travel. I do not like it in movies because there are too many things that just does not add up. In this movie it is not too bad and most of the time the actual time travel aspect is kept out of the action. Wolverine goes back in time, does his stuff with a lot of action, and saves the day. Sure the dialog often comes back to the \u201cI\u2019m from the future\u201d aspect but not much more. One thing annoys the hell out me though. Wolverine affects a lot of events while he is back there but not a single things seems to change in the future until one single event passes at the end of the movie. Then everything changes and it is happy ending. That is the kind of nonsense that time travel in movies ends up with.\r\n\r\nBottom line is that this is a very enjoyable movie. Without the rubbish plot twist in the middle it would have gotten 9 or 10 stars.","id":"543a3207c3a368198900215d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/543a3207c3a368198900215d","movie_id":127585}
{"author":"JayDeeMac","content":"**Year of release** 2014 **Directed by** Bryan Singer **Written by** Simon Kinberg **Starring** Hugh Jackman James McAvoy Michael Fassbender Jennifer Lawrence Peter Dinklage Ellen Page\r\n\r\n**X-Men: Days of Future Past** (rating: 4 ++)\r\n\r\n**Plot** - In a dystopian future of 2023 where mutant-kind has been all but wiped out by powerful robots known as Sentinels the last surviving mutants launch one final attempt to save their species from extinction. Hiding out in a monastery in China, Kitty Pryde (Page) sends Wolverine's (Jackman) consciousness back in time to 1973. His task is to prevent Mystique (Lawrence) from murdering the Sentinels' creator Bolivar Trask (Dinklage). His murder made him a martyr and ensured that his destructive creation went into production. In addition, Mystique is captured in the process and her DNA used to engineer even more powerful machines. By stopping the murder the hope is that they will change the future and save their species. Seeking out the young Charles Xavier (McAvoy) Wolverine is despondent to find that he is not the man he will come to know decades later. With Xavier a broken man, Wolverine's first challenge is to help him find his old strength. The next challenge isn't one that sits all that well with Xavier; they must break Magneto (Fassbender) out of a prison cell beneath the Pentagon. To do so they enlist the aid of Quicksilver (Evan Peters), a mutant with superhuman speed. With Magneto and Xavier once again standing side-by-side they head to Paris to attempt to stop Trask's murder at Mystique's hands, but will they make it in time?\r\n\r\nIn a fitting move considering the storyline of this film allow me to go back in time to the year 2000 where I can still remember going to see the first X-Men film in August of that year. Hard as it may be to believe, the big superhero film was not the guaranteed box office success they are nowadays. Following the disastrous reception that met 1997's Batman & Robin the superhero genre was on life support, and another big failure could have seen the plug pulled. Thankfully for all us fanboys out there the film proved to be both a critical and commercial success, kicking off a surge in comic book films which has seen them come to dominate the box-office. Well somehow 14 years have passed since then (and I can't quite believe that :eek:) and we now have the 7th film in the X-Men franchise. Now since the solid start of X-Men the series hasn't exactly been the most reliable in terms of quality and has been rather overshadowed by the Batman's, Spider-Man's, Iron Man's and Avengers' of this world. In truth you could probably split the previous 6 films evenly into 'the good' and 'the not so good'; though to be fair to The Wolverine which I'd put in the latter category it's pretty decent. Well as the 7th film in the series this was always set to break the tie and the good news is that it has swung the pendulum very much towards the positive side of things. \r\n\r\nThat said however I didn't find that I was quite as high on the film as many other people seem to be. As seems to be the case for just about every other superhero film these days, the release of DoFP has seen many people instantly jump on the bandwagon of proclaiming this the best superhero film ever. While I certainly wouldn't go that far this is an extremely entertaining entry into the X-Men franchise, and one that continues the upswing of First Class. The film does open in absolutely thrilling fashion and ends quite strongly as well. In between these wonderful bursts of action though I just found that the film had a tendency to fall into a lull on a couple of occasions. With its complicated story the film has to spend a lot of time trying to keep things clear for the audience, which sadly results in the situation and the stakes being reiterated time and time again. It just threatens to get bogged down by becoming overly talky, derailing the momentum and in general I didn't feel it was as well paced as Captain America: The Winter Soldier for example. An additional action sequence or two I don't think would have gone amiss. I also feel that it perhaps lacked the colour, energy and sense of fun of X-Men: First Class. Some of that comes from the fact that I didn't feel DoFP embraced its period setting to the degree that First Class did which on more than one occasion felt like a Sean Connery Bond film. A few snazzy outfits and some brief touches upon the Vietnam War aside I don't think it really exploited the 70s era to the fullest. And I think the Vietnam sequence was actually amongst the film's weaker moments; an unnecessary detour which could easily have been left on cutting room floor.  \r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, the opening sequence of DoFP is a terrific way to kick the film off; in fact I think its got to be one of the best opening gambits of any superhero film. The film instantly drops us right into the middle of a Sentinel attack upon the X-Men in the future; making for an absolutely thrilling opening. It's a wonderfully creative sequence that features  some genius choreography as the hitherto unknown Blink (played by Fan Bingbing), with her ability to create teleportation portals, emerges as one of the most visually dazzling mutants we've seen so far throughout the series. It's a terrific set-piece that the film arguably never matches for the next two hours, at least in terms of action and excitement; there is a sequence however that is fantastically entertaining which we'll get to later. The big finale then aims to be and mostly achieves feeling like a suitably epic affair that encapsulates Sentinels, the White House and the RFK sports stadium. At the same time the film is also jumping back and forth between this and the future where the Sentinels have once again launched an assault upon the X-Men. The only problem, and one that is in complete contrast to other superhero films such as Man of Steel, is that I didn't feel its concluding battle was quite long enough. The two competing sequences feel like they are slightly lacking in action and drama, and are over too soon.\r\n\r\n**Film Trivia Snippets** - In reference to the X-Men member Kitty Pryde, and her importance to this particular film, DoFP was shot under the working title of \u201cHello Kitty.\u201d \/\/\/ Days of Future Past is based on a storyline of the same name that appeared across two issues of Uncanny X-Men in 1981, and was written by Chris Claremont. It is now the fourth film to be based on a story penned by legendary X-Men writer Claremont. X2 was adapted from 'God Loves, Man Kills'; X-Men: The Last Stand was based on his 'Dark Phoenix Saga'; and The Wolverine was based on his comic of the same name. In the comic the future world was set in the year 2013, the same year in which filming for the movie version began. \/\/\/ The bullet wounds that appear on Wolverine's chest on his arrival to the 1970s is in the form of the Big Dipper. This is an homage to the 1980s anime series, Fist of the North Star, whose protagonist Kenshiro has the same scar pattern on his chest. \/\/\/ Prior to making the film, Bryan Singer had a two-hour discussion with James Cameron abut how to make a time-travel concept feasible and workable within the film. Thanks to Cameron's experience as the director of The Terminator and Terminator 2 the two discussed concepts including alternate universes and string theory (a field of quantum physics that define multiple universes). \/\/\/ It's quite clear just by looking at the credits that this is one hell of a cast that's been assembled. If you're looking for more proof however then how about this; the four main female X-Men in the principal cast (Halle Berry, Jennifer Lawrence, Ellen Page and Anna Paquin) are all Academy Award nominess, while the six principle male cast members (Hugh Jackman, Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart and Peter Dinklage) are all Golden Globe nominees.\r\n\r\nWith such a prestigious cast at Bryan Singer's disposal it's no surprise to find that performances across the board are generally of a high standard. Though the sizeable cast means that not everyone gets an equal chance to shine; Halle Berry's involvement for example is little more than a cameo. In fact I'm struggling to think if she even had a single line throughout the whole film or if all she did was make it rain a little bit. And the whole future ensemble are almost completely sidelined, meaning that the established regulars are given little to do other than spout some exposition, while the various new additions (Bishop, Blink, Warpath, Sunspot etc) are given absolutely no introduction whatsoever so we have little reason to care about them or mourn their demise. In fact for the majority of them I'm not even sure there names are known until we get to the closing credits. The lack of exposure given to the future timeline was certainly a disappointment. As a result it's in the past where the most noteable performances come from with solid efforts coming from Lawrence, Fassbender, Jackman etc. However the one individual who is able to stand out from the crowd for me would have to be James McAvoy who I thought was just excellent as the young Charles Xavier. The fact that he is given the strongest characterisation and the most to work with certainly helps. We initially find him as this supremely broken individual who is in great pain both physically and emotionally, but with help from Wolverine he is able to find his way back onto his path. \t\t\r\n\r\nThe two most notable additions to the X-Men world this time out were Evan Peters' Quicksilver and Peter Dinklage's Bolivar Trask. And as it turns out the end result for both was completely flipped from what many were predicting beforehand. The promo images for Quicksilver had fanboys already sharpening their knives before the film had even hit cinemas, ready to tear into him with the kind of fervour reserved for Batsuit nipples and Ben Affleck. And yes I have to say that his appearance still comes across as rather bizarre and stupid, kind of like Julian Assange as styled by Lady Gaga. As a character however he kind of kicks ass, his introduction arguably being the coolest addition to the franchise since Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler back in X2. And just like Nightcrawler had with his incursion into the White House, Quicksilver is given the spotlight all to himself at one point to really make a name for himself. This time it's a break-out from the Pentagon where his incredible speed comes into its own with a terrifically fun and inventive set-piece that allows him to steal the film from his more illustrious co-stars before sadly disappearing shortly afterwards. The way he is just written out is rather disappointing and feels like it's only been done to help free up space for everyone else. It does however leave the audience wanting more, so it's good news that he's going to be starring in X-Men: Apocalypse. My only concern about the character is whether they've actually made him too powerful. They show his abilities as being so strong that you imagine he could destroy any mutants, even the likes of Magneto and Xavier, before they even had the chance to respond.\r\n\r\nThe real disappointment amongst the cast is Dinklage's Trask. Now Dinklage is a great actor, no doubt about that, and I think he personally does good work here. It's just that the character he is lumbered with here I felt was a little bit dull to be honest (particularly for the film's supposed 'big bad'), giving him very little to really sink his teeth into. That also creates one of the film's few main flaws in my eyes; the lack of a strong villain. Trask kind of takes the place of Senator Kelly from the first X-Men film, but that film also had Magneto and his Brotherhood of Mutants as villains. While the future X-Men do face off against the considerable threat of the Sentinels they are a fairly blank entity devoid of an actual character or personality that can interact with the X-Men. Which is not to say they are not effective foils for our mutant heroes, you just get the feeling that there should be big bad in charge of deploying and controlling those machines. In terms of design the Sentinels may disappoint and likely anger the real X-Men fanboys out there, baring little resemblance to their comic book counterparts. In fact they aren't a million miles away from The Destroyer as seen in the first Thor film. However I don't think there's any denying that they most certainly do make an impact; in fact they are rather chilling, unsettling creations. The fact that the X-Men suffer some very violent, nasty deaths certainly heightens that feeling.\t\r\n\r\n**Film Trivia Snippets** - Bryan Singer talked about \"changing history\" in an interview with Empire Magazine(May 2014). The director stated \"I don't want people to panic about us erasing the movies. I believe in multiverses,\" explaining the possibility of certain events as they would be part of the history of alternate universes. \/\/\/ In the \"Days of Future Past\" comic it was Shadowcat (Kitty Pryde) who went back in time; in the film it's Wolverine. According to writer Simon Kinberg, Kitty was intended to be the time-traveller but it didn't work out: \"Kitty in the era of young Magneto and Xavier, would have been negative 20 years old. The reflex response to that was a character who doesn't age. Wolverine is the only character who would look the same in 1973 as he does in the future.\" Thus, Wolverine was picked for being an ageless immortal character who would bridge past and future. \/\/\/ To create the sensation of Quicksilver's incredible speed ability Bryan Singer filmed his scenes in a special format of 3600 frames per second. This means that Quicksilver will be moving 150 times faster than normal. \/\/\/ Josh Helman was originally going to be cast as a young Cain Marko\/Juggernaut. But Juggernaut was written out of the film, and Helman was offered the role of a young William Styker. \/\/\/ Bryan Singer based Bolivar Trask on Adolg Hitler; \u201cAs Hitler used the Jews as a scapegoat to bond the darker parts of Europe, he's doing the same thing with mutants. But he wasn't a six foot, perfect blond Aryan - he was a short, funny looking fellow!\u201d \t\t\r\n\r\nNow considering the fairly dense and complicated storyline that encompasses two timelines and what feels like dozens of characters I think that the film's writer, Simon Kinberg, actually does a fairly commendable job of keeping everything in some kind of balance and managing to just about ensure that it all makes some kind of sense. And considering the twisted mess of continuity that he has had to deal with it would perhaps be unfair to poke holes at it. But hey these are films for comic book fanboys, what do you expect but for us to nitpick! :D The film is still unable to address a few niggling questions, perhaps because that continuity mess makes it almost impossible to actually do so. However questions still linger such as how exactly is Charles Xavier still alive after being killed off in X-Men: The Last Stand? What's the deal with Wolverine's claws and their constant shifting back and forth between adamantium and bone? Still no explanation as to why Xavier and Mystique didn't appear to know each other in the original trilogy, but were so incredibly close according to these films etc. The script has to spend so much time just trying to establish the story that there is little chance to focus on the actual characters at its heart. As someone who loved the Magneto-Xavier relationship and interaction in First Class that's a shame. And it feels like there is barely a single line of dialogue in the whole film that isn't exposition\t\r\n\r\nThe script also fails to address a few new issues, just completely glossing over them perhaps in the hopes that we just won't notice. For example when and how exactly did Ellen Page's Kitty Pryde get the ability to send people's consciousness through time? And perhaps it's just me but the whole plot point (and it's a very important one) about Mystique's blood being so vital in the development of the Sentinels seems rather vague and questionable in its logic. If they were going to go down that route I feel Rogue would have been a somewhat more logical choice given that her ability is to replicate the powers of other mutants, not just change her physical appearance. It kind of came across as them just trying to shoehorn Mystique into being as important as possible to the film, largely inspired you suspect by the meteoric rise of Jennifer Lawrence since First Class. In fact with Hugh Jackman getting on in years, and his days as Wolverine coming to an end, the search is on to perhaps try and find the new face of the franchise. With Channing Tatum set to take on the character of Gambit he seems like a decent bet to take over that mantle. However with Days of Future Past they certainly seem to be positioning Jennifer Lawrence as another possibility to take on the role if she were to extend her current deal. I doubt anyone would ever have predicted Mystique being pushed to the fore in such fashion. Oh and just as another little nit-pick; was I the only one who thought the make-up job for Mystique looked rather s*itty this time out? I think it looks a lot more fake now than it ever did even 14 years ago.\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJust a few more thoughts to wrap up. After the fresh start that was First Class, bringing Wolverine back and once again making him a central figure feels like a little bit of a step back. While he's only had two official solo films this almost films like the 6th Wolverine-focused film we've now had in the series. And if you're going to bring him back I think you should at least use him correctly. His strongest feature for me is as a brutal, kick-ass warrior, but DoFP actually gives him surprisingly little opportunity to unsheathe those iconic claws of his, placing him more in the role of a diplomat trying to keep the peace between Magneto and Xavier. The fact that the film kills so many of the mutants introduced in First Class offscreen I found quite disappointing. And the use of Blink's portals aside I didn't think the film quite captured the same team dynamic that was present in First Class, with several of the team going off on solo missions or taking their enemies out all by themselves. And now a couple of other little things that I liked. While we get to see very little of it the wasteland that the Earth has become in the future dystopia is a very effective and stirring touch, and one that evokes the future war as seen in the Terminator films. Oh and one little touch that I really loved was the film recreating newreel footage of the decade to match actual footage from the era. It comes off looking like the Zapruder JFK film. \r\n\r\nAmongst fans of superhero films, 2008 is seen as a bit of a holy grail for the genre; the release of both The Dark Knight and Iron Man, two of the most acclaimed and loved entries so far, gaining it that reputation. 2014 has so far seen the release of two great efforts (The Winter Soldier and Days of Future Past); if Guardians of the Galaxy lives up to the promise of its trailers then we could have a new contender for that title of comic book movie's holy grail year. \r\n\r\n**Conclusion** - I know I've been pointing out a lot of flaws with the film in this review (perhaps as a response to all the gushing over it) but the truth is I did still find it to be an extremely entertaining addition to the X-Men series. As a result of some of those flaws however I'm not quite as high on it as many other people seem to be. For the moment I would have it in 2nd place amongst 2014's superhero flicks behind the excellent Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and after one viewing it would slot into 3rd place amongst the X-Men films.\t\r\n\r\nOne thing I should definitely add however is my condition when watching it. As I have been for a great deal of time recently I wasn't feeling particularly great when I went to watch it; feeling rather run-down and a bit yuck. So that perhaps hindered my enjoyment slightly,meaning there's a chance that score could rise on a repeat viewing.\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bonus Film Trivia** -  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen were performing in a touring production of \"Waiting for Godot\" when Bryan Singer approached the actors about reprising their respective roles as Professor X and Magneto. According to McKellen, both men were utterly shocked as they thought they'd passed their roles on to James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, and would never play the characters again. Both Stewart and McKellen were delighted to return to two of their most popular roles, and to work with the younger actors playing the same characters as well. \/\/\/ When Matthew Vaughn was going to direct, he was going to make the film a direct sequel to X-Men First Class and have it set in the 1970s. Early ideas included an opening with the Kennedy assassination being caused by Magneto, and mutant encounters set in the Civil rights movement\/the Vietnam War. When Singer took over, he integrated these concepts into a viral marketing campaign to set up the action of the film. In this alternate history, Magneto is arrested and imprisoned for the assassination of Kennedy, but maintains his innocence. The \"Bent Bullet\" Theory (a reference to the real life \"Magic Bullet\" Theory criticized by conspiracy theorists) holds that the Warren Commission determined that Magneto manipulated Lee Harvey Osawld's bullets to kill the President in retribution for the murder of the mutants Azazel and Tempest by the CIA. Conspiracy theorists, based on Magneto's testimony, insist however that Magneto had tried to prevent the murder of Kennedy, and that the true shooter was not Oswald, but Mystique in disguise who, with the help of Emma Frost framed Magneto, and manipulated Jack Ruby into later murdering Oswald. The theory also posits that Mystique offered to double as Kennedy in an attempt to grab power, all of which backfired horribly, leading to anti-mutant hostilities.","id":"53821f910e0a2624cb00a4ab","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53821f910e0a2624cb00a4ab","movie_id":127585}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Focuses on the best characters and an interesting story***  \r\n\r\n\"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" (2014) starts in an apocalyptic near-future where mutants are being wiped out by Sentinels, government-made robots created for this very purpose. The X-Men and Magneto decide to send Wolverine's consciousness back to his body in 1973 to prevent the Sentinels from attaining their mutant-killing powers.\r\n\r\nThis is easily one of the best X-Men films because of the interesting plot and the focus on the most interesting characters. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) has been the top X-Men since day one so you can't go wrong with making him the focal point. James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart are excellent as Professor X, as are Michael Fassbender as young Magneto, Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique and Evan Peters as Quicksilver, the latter in a small but highly entertaining role. Nicholas Hoult as Beast gets an honorable mention and Bingbing Fan is notable as Blink, particularly her stunning face. \r\n\r\nThe plot is convoluted and yet easy to follow if you're familiar with the franchise's story arc. The film is all-around compelling. It has the confidence to slow down and be pensive while throwing in the requisite thrills and not forgetting to be entertaining. For instance, the creative and amusing way Quicksilver takes down a bunch of security guards at the Pentagon, which is one of the movie's top scenes. Lastly, I like the way Magneto\u2019s great power is illustrated (you\u2019ll see what I mean).  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 11 minutes and was shot in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. \r\n\r\nGRADE: A","id":"5bf4dfa70e0a26265e0b324c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bf4dfa70e0a26265e0b324c","movie_id":127585}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"The rugged and feisty Liam Neeson (as on-screen alter ego ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills) is back in fighting form for a third and supposedly final go-around in \u2018Taken 3\u2032. This tired and tepid action-packed crime thriller is directed by French filmmaker Olivier Megaton (\u2018Taken 2\u2019, \u2018Transporter 3\u2019) with screenwriting credits attributed to \u2018Taken\u2019 producer Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. Clearly Neeson and company want to squeeze the remaining strained juices out of the \u2018Taken\u2019 film franchise as this movie series trilogy ends on an exhausting whimper. Uninspired, toothless and motoring on empty impishness, \u2018Taken 3\u2032 has run its kinetic course for the aging Neeson to aim, shoot and take down some serious repetitive butt-kicking numbers.\r\n\r\nAfter the last two energizing installments where flashy foreign locales were a major part of the appealing \u2018Taken\u2019 universe, \u2018Taken 3\u2032 is reduced to unraveling in the uneventful backyard of familiar Los Angeles that definitely lacks the exotic excitement and visual vitality that were previously showcased in posh landscapes such as Paris and Istanbul. In fact, star Neeson reportedly nixed the idea to partake in the \u2018Taken 3\u2032 production if there was another concept of kidnapping involved. Huh? Why avoid the element of kidnapping when in fact it was the soundly running gimmick that made the \u2018Taken\u2019 experience palpable and pulsating? Still, this is the least of \u2018Taken 3\u2019s bothersome problems as the movie delves in the manufactured mockery involving cliched car chases, sketchy gunplay and the inclusion of countless Russian mobsters parading about in obligatory fashion. Importantly, even Neeson seems quite disengaged as his robotic Bryan Mills goes through the motions trying to find some upside in the forced upbeat shenanigans that seem to trudge along scene after scene.\r\n\r\nThe very first outing in \u2018Taken\u2019 took audiences by surprised as it featured a matured Neeson as an avenging former CIA human weapon Mills committed to his fatherly duties in manhandling the Albanian human traffickers that dared to abscond his teen daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). In \u2018Taken 2\u2032, the hostile adversaries want Mills\u2019s head on a platter after he tore up their territory in his crusade to rescue his precious offspring from the opportunistic ruffians. Now Mills finds his neck on the line in the connection with his ex-wife Lenore\u2019s (Famke Janssen) brutal murder. Look out LA\u2026the harried Bryan Mills is out in survival mode. The question remains: whose blood will be spilled in the process?\r\n\r\nPrior to Lenore\u2019s senseless demise, she had visited her ex-hubby Bryan and the feelings between the former spouses are still strong. Mills still carries an emotional torch for Lenore but he cannot act upon his affections for her. Poor Lenore is trapped in her current unhappy marriage with an insufferable moneybags misfit Stuart St. John (Dougray Scott). In the aftermath of Lenore\u2019s death, the distraught and beleaguered Mills finds out the trouble that he is embroiled in so convincingly. As a result of his former lover\u2019s slaughtering Bryan Mills is reeling with outrage. Yes, folks, it appears that Mills is on the run and must prove his innocence and bring to the forefront the murderers that butchered Lenore. Mills has on his mind the need to protect his exposed college-aged daughter Kim from potential harm as well.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the LAPD lead investigator in Franck Doltzer (Oscar winner Forest Whitaker, \u2018The King Of Scotland\u2019) must track down the defiant Mills and make some sense out of the Lenore Mills St. John slaying.  Mills proves to be elusive and crafty as usual while leaving behind his trademark trashing of battered bodies and bouncing bullets in the chaotic southern California streets.\r\n\r\nSeemingly, the catchy novelty act of a hulking middle-aged Neeson exploding at the seams in action-oriented fashion resonated with glorious forethought. After all, \u2018Taken\u2019 single-handily resurrected Neeson\u2019s box office cred and made him a cinematic hipster to the young folks and his aged contemporaries alike.  However, the third time is not the charm in revisiting the gun-toting \u2018grandpa\u2019. Sadly, \u2018Taken 3\u2032 is mindlessly played out as Neeson\u2019s Mills or the handlers behind this hollow hedonistic actioner have dipped their toes in an empty well of ideas to conclude this three-part crime caper.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s face facts\u2026we all were \u2018Taken\u2019 in by this pseudo punchy action yarn that no longer generates the destructive heat it once punctuated with carefree confidence.\r\n\r\nTaken 3 (2015)\r\n\r\n29th Century Fox\r\n\r\n1 hr.  49 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Liam Neeson, Forest Whitaker, Famke Jannssen, Maggie Grace and Dougray Scott\r\n\r\nDirected by: Olivier Megaton\r\n\r\nRated: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Action and Adventure\/Crime thriller\/Mystery and Suspense\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** stars (out of four stars)","id":"5622f26ec3a3680e1900c550","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5622f26ec3a3680e1900c550","movie_id":260346}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I was looking forward to this movie and I have to say that I was a wee bit disappointed. It is a decent enough action movie but the script leaves somewhat to be desired. A good chunk of the movie is quite good, actually it is very good, but there are some crucial scenes that, in my opinion, really drags it down to a rather mediocre level.\r\n\r\nThe plot is a fairly classical, not a very intelligent nor a very original, one. When trying to push the third sequel in a series Hollywood have a tendency to fall back on certain \u201ctrusted\u201d elements. Like, make the hero haunted by the law and \/ or the government (no I do not consider the government to be the same as the law) or kill off some of the main (or at least likable) characters.\r\n\r\nIn this movie they are doing both. I do not know why this always seems to be the standard solution because I certainly do not like it. Are the general movie going audience really falling for these, in my mind, cheap scripts? I guess they must be since this formula is repeated over and over again. Well, it is not for me to judge other peoples tastes and if I would have been a bean counter for the movie industry then it would really have been my duty to squeeze out as much money as possible regardless of whether I thought it would make a good movie or not, However, I am not. I am a consumer of movies and my personal opinion is that these plot elements are pretty cheap and not really to my liking. But then, that is just me.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the movie is not really bad. It is a decent enough action movie and, in general, I quite like the performance of Liam Neeson. He is the half-sad, silent and, most of all, ass-kicking hero that I like. He is pretty much what holds this movie together. Well, that was perhaps not entirely fair. Forrest Whitaker is doing a quite good job as well. Most of the other characters are mostly fillers. The main bad guy started off fairly good but he really never got the chance to shine and the ending scenes with the big confrontation was\u2026well I would say pretty pathetic.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to my man gripe with this movie. Up until this point Liam Neeson was really playing the big bad, and really skilled, killing machine. The way he, with the help of his friends, entered the bad guy\u2019s stronghold was perhaps not very innovative (seen that, been there, and done that) but at least it was professional. After that however it turned into a bloody joke. Not only does our hero walk into a heavily defended stronghold carrying only a small pea shooter but every time he manages to liberate a decent weapon from the hopelessly incompetent bad guys he throws it away and, occasionally, picks up another pea shooter. What the f\u2026?\r\n\r\nThen we have the fairly ridiculous big fight at the end where the bad guy runs around in his underwear. That was just embarrassing. Maybe I could have swallowed the underwear thing if it was not for the fact that Lieam Neeson suddenly lost all kind of professionalism. Apart from the pea shooter syndrome mentioned before he just gets himself wacked by this maniac until, in the last minute, he miraculously recovers and gets the upper hand. There were a few minor glimpses of intelligence in the whole scene but they were never really exploited.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, if would say this was a fairly decent and enjoyable action movie but I was expecting more from it. If the last third of the movie would have matched the first two thirds then my rating would have been higher. Maybe Liam Neeson is not a big enough star, although I like him a lot, to pick his roles like he wants to but I would say that he should indeed be a bit more picky and read the scripts before signing on.","id":"5b02add492514109a7016b0a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b02add492514109a7016b0a","movie_id":260346}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Independently a fine movie rather being associated with TAKEN.\r\n\r\nActually, it was not a bad movie, I really enjoyed it. But associated with 'Taken' and being the third film in the series was the setback. Because unlike the first two films, this one was somewhat detached from the original theme. Except the cast from the previous two, the story takes place in a completely different platform. From all the three films, the phone call between father and daughter was retained, but was not effective as the first one which became just a trademark of the series, that's all.\r\n\r\nThe first half creates the puzzle and next half solves it. As expected, it was a typical structure in this trilogy, but the last quarter was turned into something like 'Mission Impossible'. In 'Taken' films, Bryan Mills (our lead guy) works alone, but he formed a team with a tech guy and others. That does not sound good, at least tried to be different from the original movie.\r\n\r\nIt is a little disappointment for 'Taken' fans, but you will have a best shot if you see it as an independent one off movie. Yes could have made a better action flick if it was not linked to it. Hope it all ends here like they have said. As a trilogy, it failed, or maybe we can call it a 50-50. But the first one was a masterpiece, a trendsetting piece.\r\n\r\n6.5\/10","id":"55de1205c3a36827d3000333","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55de1205c3a36827d3000333","movie_id":260346}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> I found TAMMY was so funny, but everyone isn't like me.\r\n\r\nI did not get what all the whining about this movie. This film was nominated for the worst actress and supporting actress at Razzie Awards, but I found they were awesome. You can't blame performers for the bad story, in fact the screenplay was okay, but again the story did not influence to build a better screenplay. Hard to predict the scenes, though one would know where the story is heading and that's the difference in this movie. Keep in mind when you're going try it, that you're not watching a Bond movie or a Peter Jackson's, but a small budget comedy. Anticipate as much what the movie weighs, overall and you would never regret for watching it.\r\n\r\nAs usual a perfect role for Melissa McCarthy, but Susan Sarandon was surprisingly good. It was just a fun road-movie, mostly a semi-fictional to the reality, but who knows there might be people out like these film characters. Like I said, a decent story, it had all the ingredient to be a good comedy flick except one serious scene at the end needed to turn over. Yep, I would have liked to have an unexpected twist, that could have been a game changer in the movie's success. Anyone can enjoy it, if he's\/she's open minded. I am already expecting the next movie from the same cast and crew combo which is due early next years.\r\n\r\nP.S, there's something between Melissa McCarthy and prison. In the next film I mentioned as well she will be seen in the prison.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"55c6531292514105d80004f3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55c6531292514105d80004f3","movie_id":226486}

{"author":"Reno","content":"The director might be soaring after back to back success. Interestingly, both the films dealt with writers, but the main themes were romance. He's just a two movie old and now the movie goers can expect eagerly for his next venture. This movie was based on the teen novel of the same name about a 16-years-old cancer patient.\r\n\r\n     Hazel Grace, who is battling between life and death is also a strong fighter against all the odds. When her mother sends her to attend the group therapy she meets Augustus Water, a fellow member. As she is being sarcastic, Waters finds an interesting character in her. A friendship develops and they spend more time together. Even knowing there will no future together, the relationship progress and how everything ends is the rest.\r\n\r\n     Usually cancer themed movies are called tearjerker films. Surprisingly, this movie's aim was different. Of course emotion strikes, but the story narration and character developments were the basic goal. Three-fourth of the movie was well told story about teen romance. The afterwards account begins with a twist which were portrayed in the usual manner. Like all the movies, kept sentiments in the last part. The last quarter was very predictable, but they avoided cliche as much possible.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u2018Apparently, the world is not\r\na wish-granting factory.\u2019\u2019\r\n\r\n     The parents' role was kind of mysterious one, that diverts viewer from their anticipation. Interesting it also creates some doubts. Compared to the previous movie 'The Spectacular Now', Shailene Woodley looked completely different. That means the physical transformed to look a perfect 16 year old was amazing. Her performance as well gives an impression that the Hollywood's future Academy award grabbing the female lead is on making. At this rate she can do that like Jennifer Lawrence did.\r\n\r\n     As for the lead actor, it is a good breakthrough and expecting the same result from his next movie as well. This movie, which runs over a 2 hour was smartly sliced the contents and organized those on the right spots. Many had agreed it was a fine cinema transformation from a book. So you can try this, but be careful because nowadays most of the teens movies are overrated because of the overwhelmed teen audience. The warning meant only for the older people. I'm sure the youngster will love this movie, I mean most of them.","id":"5463804a0e0a267810002575","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5463804a0e0a267810002575","movie_id":222935}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Thirumanam Enum Nikkah is like the romance dramas in which there will be no story at all if the leads talk to each other in a frank manner and so will have to keep pretending for the plot to go on. It is based on a single construct \u2014 two lovers belonging to the same religion (and even the same sect) mistaking the other to be of a different religion and so pretending to be of the same religion. It all starts when Vijayaraghavachari aka Raghavan ( Jai) approaches a tout for a ticket to Coimbatore. He is asked to pretend as Abubacker and on the train, he meets Vishnupriya (Nazriya), who is actually travelling under the name of her colleague Aayisha. He earns her confidence and both think of the other as a Muslim. On their return to Chennai, they realize they are in love but carry on the pretense of being a Muslim. He lies to Shaukat Ali, a respected Unani doctor, to get to know about Islam, while she learns about the practices followed by Muslims from Aayisha. Meanwhile, both their families are fixing a match for them and Shaukat's daughter, Naseema (Heebah), falls for Raghavan. When they realize their true identities eventually, they are left confused as the both seem alien to each other given that they now looking at one another from a different lens. \r\n\r\nThe case of mistaken identity isn't new in the romance genre and director Anis tries to lend some freshness to this oft-seen premise by using religious identity as the point of conflict for a romance. He comes up with scenes that are mostly plausible to show how such a misunderstanding could occur. He nicely parallels the lives of the two leads to show how similar they are. Both Raghavan and Priya's have large, traditional families; both have a friend at office who informs their decision; both use details from their lives to make their lies believable (he uses Shaukat Ali's words while she gets her awareness of Muslim religion from her friend Ayesha); both have a character whose only purpose is to be the third wheel (if it's a colleague for her, it's Naseema for him) and so on. At times, he takes this too far \u2014 Raghavan and Priya are not just Hindu, they are also Iyengar Brahmins, as if the director wanted to avoid the minor inconvenience that might arise if either of the two were a non-Brahmin or even an Iyer. \r\n\r\nThe leads, too, are likeable, though the falling-in-love aspect should have had a little more depth. But the first half is breezy enough and the humour that arises out of perceived religious differences provides some moments of levity. Even the attempt to spread the message of communal harmony doesn't come across as too preachy. The director also ups the stakes a bit in the second half by not wanting to provide a simplistic ending. When many would have ended the film once Raghavan and Priya realize their true identities, he reaches for something profound in the second half. Can you continue to love a person even after you realize that you have created a different image of them in your heart? \r\n\r\nIt is definitely an interesting angle but it is here that Anis slips. The events that follow the revelatory scene are muddled and leave us frustrated. Given that they hardly talk to each other after realizing their real identities, it is hard to believe that in a matter of moments, Raghavan and Priya agree to get married because their parents are OK with their match. It doesn't help that the characters in their families are written in such a non-descript manner that they could be perfectly interchangeable. And so, when the two decide to call off the marriage, it feels like an over-reaction. Similarly, the sub-plot involving Naseema and her angry relative who wants to exact revenge on Raghavan feels forced. All it does is lead to an unnecessary stunt scene which is indifferently shot (even the location changes midway into the fight!). Similarly, Ghibran's songs, which are the film's calling card, are thrust into the narrative in random to stay true to the five-song formula. But most importantly, we never get a convincing answer as to why the lovers finally decide to get together.","id":"53d6ae150e0a262838007c29","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53d6ae150e0a262838007c29","movie_id":264058}
{"author":"CRCulver","content":"Wes Anderson's THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is the director's celebration of Central Europe culture and fashion in the years between the World Wars, and an elegy for what was lost with the rise of fascism and communism. Set in 1932 in a fictional country called Zubrowka, the streets, military regalia and (ersatz) German names we are shown could have come from anywhere between Germany and Estonia. Its protagonist Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) is a concierge at the eponymous luxury hotel, the splendour of which disappeared, we are told, with World War II. Gustave H. is known publicly as one of the best concierges in the business, able to dash around the hotel at lightning speed to satisfy the most varied guests of the elite clientele. Privately, he's a rake with a rather foul mouth, and fond of bedding the rich old women who patronize the establishment. When one of those old ladies, Madame C\u00e9line Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton) dies and Gustave is framed for her murder, he must evade the law and unmask the true culprit, with the help of newly hired lobby boy Zero Mustafa (Tony Revolori).\r\n\r\nThe films of Wes Anderson are known for their immense visual detail, and THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is no exception. The elaborate framing of shots, the myriad cute items to look at on every set, and the architectural detail are like a diorama blown up to the big screen. Curiously, that visual detail is matched to a real slackness in the human characterization. Anderson has brought in a large number of actors he had worked with before, including Adrien Brody, Jeff Goldblum, Ed Norton, and Bill Murray, for roles that range from the main villain to little more than cameos. These characters are never fleshed out like Gustave H. or Zero Mustafa, and the actors don't even try to pass themselves off as Central Europeans from the entre deux guerres. Instead Adrien Brody plays Adrien Brody, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are two supporting roles that I felt were stronger. William Defoe plays a nearly mute henchman whose look is a nod to early vampire films (Transylvania was Central Europe, too). More remarkable is Harvey Keitel's turn as an old prisoner: when so many handsome leading men try to hide the effects of time after they enter their sunset years, 75-year-old Keitel was not afraid to show the ravages of old age here.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I found the 21st-century Americans strutting about (and a few speaking in rough New York accents) in a historical drama to be jarring. I was also disappointed by the resort to Hollywood tropes here, when Anderson's earlier films managed to be very quirky and sui generis. For example, did we really need not just one scene where a character is hanging off a cliff's edge as the villain stands over him, but two? And the amount of plot details that are introduced but never really explained makes one feel that the work was subject to some heavy cuts to please a studio.\r\n\r\nStill, if you liked Wes Anderson's earlier films, you'll find much to enjoy in his dollhouse approach, and it is amazing how every one of his films has a completely new and fresh visual theming even if his quasi-autistic obsession with prettiness never changes. Another thing I liked about the film is its \"story within a story within a story\". The entire plot of Gustave H. is, we are shown, taken from a fictionalized treatment by a writer who met a middle-aged Mustafa (F. Murray Abraham) in the 1960s. Befitting this novelistic layer -- and the work of Stefan Zweig that Anderson credits for inspiration -- this framing story is written in stilted, unrealistic dialogue like an old-time novel. And the aspect ratio changes for each layer of the film, a little treat for cinema anoraks.","id":"5b0ae8550e0a260dad009f7d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b0ae8550e0a260dad009f7d","movie_id":120467}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A man's stand between 800 lives and corruption.\r\n\r\nIt was another Russian film just like the Oscar nominee 'Leviathan' that highlighted the corruption in a city administration, except it had no depth in its narration like that one did. A simple tale that takes place within the 24 hours, but strongly told. From the domestic violence to the political targets, the film extraordinarily portrayed its each character and some of theirs double-cross. Besides, it discloses what the higher and lower class expects from each other, like it is already in order and those who disturb it will be seriously get affected.\r\n\r\nWhen a public utility worker Dima Nikitin finds an enormous crack in an apartment block, initially he ignores it, but later thinks something terrible going to happen. As his duty, he notifies the higher ranked authorities in the middle of the night when they were partying. At the time when it was going to be declared emergency in the town and to take all the precaution measures, the tale takes a twist that changes the fate of many who were involved in the matter. So the dark side of the story comes into the display.\r\n\r\nShowcasing Russia in such a bad light really hurts if you're a Russian. More than that, the outsiders judging a country from what the film depicts is very sad. It was neither true story, nor inspired by the true story, but this kind of things happens in every other countries. More or less the experts agree with the film to the present state of the Russian political landscape. It was financially co-supported by the ministry of culture that tells us they're going tough against such action. So this film was received well from all the quarters thinking such kind of portrayal might lead to transformation in the struggling society.\r\n\r\n> \"A fish rots from the head down.\r\n> If I am tainted, then so are all of you.\"\r\n\r\nIn this, the main event was given the prime focus than any of the film characters. That's why the happy or the sad ending won't matter. But there was a character who was preferred the most for his involvement in the plot. In the meantime, it also followed other characters to add more complication in its narration and the story to get going. Overall, it was something like a chain reaction that began with a domestic violence and moved to the public service till it reached its highest end, I mean the head of the each department and the politicians.\r\n\r\nWhat the film's end was outlined is something the negative side of the society. The lack of the knowledge of the lower class families and the negligence of the civil servants is the reason for most of the tragedy that could have stopped before it to happen. The title is a metaphor for one who unnecessarily raising his voice in a matter where others were being quiet. All the above, knowing what's coming at you and taking an improper way to tackle it is what's going unnoticed. Unless every citizen join hands to fight against the corruption, this thing will go on.\r\n\r\nThe film totally captures our attention. Obviously a slow start, but you could have not expected the way it ended. I haven't seen a single Russian film at the recent time, but very pleased with this. It was a double strike, delivering a message as well as a fine story for a film who seek only the entertainment. In some way, it was so much simpler and better than that Oscar nominee I mentioned. Because unlike that film, in here majority of us who always root for a particular film character mostly won't end in disappointment. That's the cleverness of this narration. If you had liked that film, then you should not miss this film as well.\r\n\r\n7\u00bd\/10","id":"57437a0c9251414c0b0000b9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57437a0c9251414c0b0000b9","movie_id":285700}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Thegidi is the latest in the list of new-age Tamil films that are popping up at regular intervals since Karthik Subbaraj's trendsetting Pizza. It has all the elements that characterize these films \u2014relatively new but familiar actors, impressive cinematography, likable music, competent direction, recognizable locations, and a little of envelope pushing (though nothing radical). There is even a Pizza-like post-climatic twist here that leaves the film an open-ended mystery.\r\n\r\nSo, it comes as no surprise that the film works. The plot has the feel of a 80s Rajesh Kumar\/Subha\/Pattukottai Prabhakar potboiler, in which an intrepid detective finds himself in an intriguing situation and solves a mystery with his daring and (a little bit of) cleverness. Here, Vettri, a young criminology graduate, lands a job in a private detective agency (Radical Detective Service), and is given a few subjects to track, observe and report. Like any beginner, Vettri is enthusiastic and passionate about his work and does a flawless job, impressing his employers Sadagopan and Sailesh. But when he given the task of observing Madhusree, Vettri breaks the rules of his work, and falls in love with her. She too reciprocates and everything seems to be going smooth until one day, Vettri discovers that two of the subjects have died under mysterious circumstances. He senses that something is amiss and tries to warn a couple of them but they too are murdered in front of his eyes. Now, he becomes convinced of a sinister plot and tries to save Madhu, who doesn't know the actual nature of his work.\r\n\r\nWhat's refreshing about Thegidi is how director Ramesh manages to keep things understated even when the situations seem to turn overwhelming. Barring a couple of scenes, there is a matter-of-factness in the approach that keeps the movie from turning into a bombastic thriller in which everything is at stake. This is the film's plus and also its weakness. While this low-key approach helps to keep the events realistic and believable, it also takes away the nail-biting quality (even the fight that you get is more of a scuffle than a choreographed action scene) that we expect from films in this genre. But the earnestness in the actors' performances helps sidestep this flaw to an extent.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are some developments which are baffling. Despite realizing that Madhu's life is in danger, Vettri doesn't immediately try to inform her of the threat. Even when she walks out on him after coming to know of his true identity, he doesn't explain the situation to her. And, we can't help but question his bravado when he goes snooping inside an antagonist's house, after having taken the issue to the police. He even puts his life in danger at this point, which only makes the character seem like a rash person. And, given that he has only a handful of characters, it becomes easy for us to guess the master brain behind the antagonists' scheme, while the final twist is just rug-pulling for the sake of a twist.","id":"53bb195e0e0a26197c0002d5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bb195e0e0a26197c0002d5","movie_id":257423}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"The Lord of The Rings are still occupying the three top places of my top ten movies list. Needless to say I am a fan of Tolkien and his Middle Earth fantasy story. I never felt that The Hobbit series could match the original trilogy but then much of the story in The Hobbit is not really Tolkien\u2019s but produced by Hollywood scriptwriters to embellish the story enough to fill three movies. It is not a bad attempt by any means (for being a Hollywood one) but it does not really reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings.\n\nStill, I quite liked these movies. They are good adventure, fantasy, special effects movies. Thus it saddened me when I went to IMDb and the first things I saw was a bunch of people shouting crap and giving it one star reviews. That is just so much rubbish. This is the third movie and it is not vastly different from the others. If you disliked the first ones so much why go and see this one? Also, the harping about not following the book. At this point that is a nonsense argument. It was fairly obvious that it was not going to follow the book in detail when it was announced that there were going to be three movies and if you did not get it then then you should have gotten it from the other two movies. One star ratings looks more like trolling to me.\n\nAnyway, back to the movie itself. I definitely liked this movie better than the second one. It was on par with the first one for me. There was less silly stuff, less stuff that just felt like fillers and the special effects were generally good.\n\nThe story and the implementation is, as I wrote, less filled with fillers as the last movie. At least from my point of view. Still though, the story is not at all up to the standard of the original Tolkien works. It shows that it is a Hollywood product that favors effects and quantity before depth and quality. The battle at the end was epic but at the same time somewhat nonsensical in how people ran back and forth clobbering people and beasts right left and center. I did quite like the ramming troll though.\n\nI have to say that I did not like that weasel Alfrid. Sure he was meant to be disliked but he got tiresome rather quickly. He could have been left out after being pushed into the water as far as I am concerned. After that I just got annoyed every time he appeared and I got especially annoyed by the fact that everyone, even Gandalf, seemed to trust him to actually do what he was told. I was hoping all the way to the finishing scenes that he would meet a gruesome end.\n\nOn the whole I definitely liked this movie. It had a \u201cTolkienesque\u201d athmosphere, decent acting, decent story and loads and loads of special effects. Even though it does not reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings it is definitely great entertainment for the fantasy, not to mention special effects, lovers.","id":"5a50f6ef0e0a26026f00c1bc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a50f6ef0e0a26026f00c1bc","movie_id":122917}
{"author":"Grant English","content":"I like this genre of film plus with Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep, I was expecting more.  Bridges and Streep deliver top-shelf performances it's just there is not enough of them in the film.  \r\n\r\nThere's a scene where Streep and Bridges get into the conversation of whether free will is worth the hurt and pain that comes with it.  It's 10 minutes of acting every one should watch.\r\n\r\nThe problem is this scene comes near the end of the movie and it's not enough to offset the other 100 minutes of complete blandness.  There isn't this sense of dread or tension in the movie at all.  There really isn't any sense of drama or pace to the movie and what results is a movie that feels like a late night documentary.\r\n\r\nI'm tempted to blame the young actors on drawing the audience in but that's completely fair.  The film utilizes the voice of the main character - Jonas - as its narrator.  While this is a quick way to give the film its voice, it also diffuses all the drama out of the film.  We know that the narrator 'makes it out okay' since he's telling the story.  \r\n\r\nThere are so many themes - free will, destiny, joy, war, hope, emotion vs. rationalism - that completely get overlooked because the narrator is trying to get us through the story instead of just inviting us into the story. As a result, there isn't any tension in the first act to make you care about any of the characters.","id":"545905bdc3a368399d00204a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/545905bdc3a368399d00204a","movie_id":227156}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> It lasts only for the five minutes!\r\n\r\nRecently I saw a couple of other films starring Anne Kendrick,  I was not very impressed with them and so I got the same result for this one as well. I don't like musicals, especially not the modern ones, well, mostly. This is a short story that comes around 30 minutes, but with those nonsense songs, it became a feature film. Seems a few people liked it, I think they had a reason, but to me it was very boring.\r\n\r\nThere was no any decent performances, all I saw was the film characters singing facing in one direction. Maybe they were looking at the lyrics board. I suggest don't go for it seeking a normal romance-comedy. If you like the musical, you might enjoy it, other than that, I don't see this would satisfy any average guy. So no offense for those who liked it, but this is totally a skippable film the year.\r\n\r\n3\/10","id":"5795196ec3a36829200011e7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5795196ec3a36829200011e7","movie_id":206296}
{"author":"Reno","content":"I don't know what's really going on with Adam Sandler in the recent years, he was actually out of the league for a while from entertaining his fans. All he did was overdose comedies which were below par compared to his earlier movies. I said in 'Blended' review that I'm tired of his movie, but watched it only because of the director. All his films were very impressive and I believed him on this one, more than the Sandler. Otherwise, it would have been undoubtedly a skippable flick.\r\n\r\nAs expected the movie was good, but not without the flaws, I mean the major ones because there are many unanswered stuffs that leaves viewers go either way from thinking all the possibility to create their own imagination. Hope that's not the case, the writers do not want to be that smart otherwise it will be a messed up movie with having a wonderful theme idea.\r\n\r\nYeah, I liked the concept, but it should have been a bit detail while exploring the story and exhibiting the characters. I still feel it can be covered in the follow-up, so from that perspective, the movie was decent. Especially highlighting one of the social issue was a nice addition, but the portrayal of family affair was a disappointment. It's that kind of story demanded in a like manner, but that does not convince me at all.\r\n\r\nFrom the Adam Sandler's perspective the movie was much better, because of his series of recent fails. At the same time it was a bit letdown from the perspective of the director known for his cool works. Overall, it lays on 50-50, and mostly favours on the positive side because of the narration of the dark comedy in a style. And again, I felt the end was terrible with cliche. I definitely give thumbs up to go for it, even though the loopholes the creative concept draws our attention.\r\n\r\n6.5\/10","id":"5564a08ac3a368740e00406b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5564a08ac3a368740e00406b","movie_id":238215}
{"author":"Kenneth Axel Carlsson","content":"This movie is about three girls who are dating (other people... not each other), wait... that's not right, they are boys, who act like girls. Ok, lets start over. This is a movie about three boys finding life hard and troublesome, especially dating, since none of them can get girls, dammit, that's not right either. These guys can have whoever they like, and does, but they still complain and discuss the most amazingly childish things, in the most excrutiating and painful way.\r\n\r\nOk, plot aside, this movie is what is wrong with the world. The role of the man is changing (or rather the view of what a man is...), and it is a sad sight. It might be a very funny movie to some, but to me it was just painful to watch. The dialogue is written a little too perfect and delivered with perfect timing, not at all realistic, or like life... really... is. Life is indeed awkward, or can be, but what these three friends experience... has nothing to do with awkward. They are just spoiled brats who should grow up and pick any of these amazing women who throw themselves at them.\r\n\r\n_Last words... if you are a teenager who finds life a bit hard and awkward... don't watch this movie... ever. Instead, go watch **Juno**, which is everything that this movie is not._\r\n\r\n**Note:** I finished this review halfway through the movie, so if everything changes... I deeply apologizes for any harm I may have caused to the fans of Zac Efron, Miles Teller and Michael B.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> About a young boy from the wild middle-east.\r\n\r\nRight away seeing this film I was confident that it definitely would get nominated for the Oscars. Yesterday (14-01-2016) AMPAS announced the list and I got confirmed that. Born and raised away from their motherland, after learning filmmaking in the west they returned to the root to make films about the native culture and history.\r\n\r\nOne such example was the recent Ethiopian film 'Difret' that brought on screen the gruesome culture still practiced and now this. These films are the hidden gems, something we won't get regularly in Japanese, English, German, Russian, et cetera films, due to variation in culture, history and geographical diversity.\r\n\r\nThis film is set in the year 1916, exactly a hundred years ago from now. But due to take place in the hot desert with gun fights, it looked a lot like a western genre. A story about a young boy named Theeb. When he went along with his elder brother to guide a British officer to a classified destination, he gets stranded and had to face some troubles to get back safely to his tribe.\r\n\r\nRight from the beginning it focused only Theeb, but that's when he caught between during the World War I tension and some domestic conflict over pilgrim related. There's no clear picture what those are all about, especially if you got no knowledge about the history of this part of the earth. But something was sure that the British officer was looking for his regiment. So they became the subplots as the boy and his struggle was told through his eyes which is the prime plot. A simple tale, but everything was described through the actions, not the with the words.\r\n\r\n> \"The strong eat the weak.\"\r\n\r\nThere were sufficient violence in the tale, but still not that brutal as we've seen in some of the major Hollywood flicks about the two World Wars. Considering the timeline of this narration and revolutionary movement, all makes sense, especially knowing a child involved in it. I don't know whether it was based on the real, but the depiction was natural and that's the commitment paid off very well in the end.\r\n\r\nYou won't feel like you're watching some middle-eastern film, more like a Hollywood or British film that borrowed cast and story with the original language from that region. I felt that way for many reasons and one of that was the awesome background score. And the landscapes, nothing less than the recent CGI extravaganza 'The Martian'. It's not red, but actual Arabian desert that very well utilised to narrate the plot.\r\n\r\nCompletely in Arabic language, but there're a very few English lines. It's not anything about related to religion and culture, but survival and revenge. Incidentally, this story and 'Lawrence of Arabia' takes place in the same year. I feel there's a connection between these two, not by mean officially, but like all the WWI and WWII films has the connections respectively. The common thing here was the Arab revolution, so I think this one is only the other side of the story of the title I mentioned in a very small scale.\r\n\r\nInitially I thought it might be overrated like the last year's Oscars nominee 'Timbuktu'. But good to know it was much better, the opening 10-15 minutes looked so different and then I came to know it was only an introduction to what comes after.\r\n\r\nExcellently written and beautiful cinematography, as well it definitely does not look like the director debuting with this. It's great effort from both the cast and the crew. I congratulate the whole team for earning the Oscars nod. And for you guys, it is a very good movie and I hope you are going to watch it after reading my review.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"56a4cea3c3a368389e006953","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56a4cea3c3a368389e006953","movie_id":287628}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is a decent enough Danish-made spaghetti western. Nothing more and nothing less. It could easily have been a young Clint Eastwood in this movie. Instead the lead character is Mads Mikkelsen who makes a quite reasonable performance as far as I am concerned.\n\nI have to say that it felt a bit funny when the characters spoke Danish in the first parts of the movie. It did add a bit of special touch, at least for me, to the movie though. I guess that people who do not understand Danish may be less thrilled about that though.\n\nThe movie itself is a fairly straightforward good guy versus bad guy revenge story. It is a good old-fashioned Western without any silly complicated plot and without trying to make any attempts to show the \u201creal\u201d west or put a social spin on it. It is clearly made to entertain those who like classical spaghetti westerns. Personally I find it nice that someone are still willing, and can get funding, to make those kind of movies. I liked both Mads Mikkelsen and Eva Green, although her role is mute, as well as Jeffery Dean Morgan as the bad guy.\n\nHaving said that, the movie falls a bit short of being a great spaghetti western. It never really manages to create that grim atmosphere around the lead character when he embarks on the road of revenge and I have to say that the end fight felt a bit meh.\n\nNevertheless this is a decent enough movie which should please most fans of classical old Western movies. I for one consider it a worthwhile addition to my collection.","id":"5acf12750e0a2631a3059c4a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5acf12750e0a2631a3059c4a","movie_id":266285}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"It seems that Spider Man is doomed to receive mediocre to abysmal implementations on the big screen. Well, at least in my opinion. The Amazing Spider Man 2 currently have a rating of 7.1 which quite surprises me. This was not the worst Spider Man movie. The 2nd instalment, Spider-Man 2, in the first series with Tobey Maquire still holds that title firmly.\r\n\r\nThere are some nice special effect fireworks going on and there are some funny parts when Peter Parker puts on the mask and goes to action but apart from that I found the movie uninspired, with a mediocre plot and sometimes downright boring. The plot is perhaps suitable for a comics magazine with its standard set of unlikely events, backstabbing big-corporate employees and disgruntled scientists becoming super villains but on the big-screen one would expect a wee bit more effort going into the plot.\r\n\r\nThe main villain, Electro, was \u2026 well not really giving much of an impression. He never lifted above the pretty silly scientist letting everyone walk all over him and doing really, really stupid things like trying to put two high voltage cables together without turning off the power. Sure he tried to give a menacing appearance towards the end but to me he never really managed to elevate himself to a real super-villain. I almost got the impression that the director actually realized that Electra was not good enough and so decided to come up with some convoluted scheme to throw in The Green Goblin at the end. None of these villains are really bad, just mediocre.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the obligatory Peter Parker wallowing in self-pity that every director seems to just have to put in these movies. It is not funny and downright boring. And for the ending cliffhanger they throw in the Rhino\u2026as some jerk in a monster mechanical suit :-( . What the f\u2026? The Rhino is supposed to have a polymer bonded to his skin and augmented strength and speed. Not be running around in some silly mechanical Rhino toy!\r\n\r\nThe entertainment factor of this movie comes almost entirely from the SFX action and a few select scenes. Otherwise the movie was fairly (yawn) mediocre as far as I am concerned. Having said that, being the sci-fi and super-hero fan that I am, I will probably buy the next instalment anyway if one comes out.","id":"540d61cfc3a36879a800514a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/540d61cfc3a36879a800514a","movie_id":102382}
{"author":"mattwilde123","content":"'The Theory of Everything' is James Marsh's biopic of scientific genius Stephen Hawking. Eddie Redmayne plays Hawking as we learn about his early days at university, his diagnosis of motor neuron disease, and the rise to his now iconic status. Marsh's direction is very good and he uses many point of view shots to create a huge sense of empathy for the main character. Marsh uses stunning visual effects in order to express Hawking's inner feelings and torment whilst highlighting his genius. The choice of music is also uplifting and echoes the key themes throughout the film.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is a really interesting piece of work and tells the story in a funny yet intriguing way. However, it does seem to lack a certain something as it tries to alter the source material in order to create some very conventional scenes.\r\n\r\nThe performances in 'The Theory of Everything' are truly exceptional. Eddie Redmayne plays Stephen Hawking in a transformational and moving manner. You can barely recognise him as he highlights his illness with complete sincerity and plausibility. Felicity Jones plays his wife, Jane Wilde. I thought her role would be a simple one as she would work off of the powerhouse performance from Redmayne but the way she shows her strength and compassion is very moving and she does an excellent job.\r\n\r\nOverall, 'The Theory of Everything' is a fascinating film about a genius as he deals with his dibilitating illness. The maturity of everyone involved in this make it a remarkable movie.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd","id":"58c14f33c3a3687da8004a65","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c14f33c3a3687da8004a65","movie_id":266856}

{"author":"Reno","content":"It was a remake of the Israeli movie 'Mar Baum'. Kind of incorrect to call it a comedy movie when it is a dark comedy. Enjoyments from both the genres are different. You know it was one of the last movies of the legendary actor Robin Williams. That was not the reason for me to like it. The story begins to build on a silly reason, but it was a partially unique concept. Opens like a regular comedy and then turn over to the actual meaning for the contents it deals. Like the cancer theme movies it gets emotional in the later parts. There's no twists, but convinces the effort they had tried to end it on a high note. Sadly, it kind of depicts the actual life incident of Robin Williams. It is a great loss, I grew up watching 'Jumanji' and 'Flubber' and definitely he's going to live forever through his movies.\r\n\r\nHenry Altman is a man of impatient. He always angry at everyone for everything. It was no different one day when he decides to go see a doctor. He gets his turn after the long wait. As usual, he shows his anger at the lady doctor who just had a bad day. With a tension arise in an argument, a mistake will be made. So the adventure begins that takes us along all over the city which takes place in a 90 minutes. Like all the story, after realizing the what she had done was wrong, how it was brought into the sense for who affected by her mistake is the remaining.\r\n\r\n> **\u2018\u2018Anger is the only thing they left me.\r\n> Anger is my refuge, it's my shield. Anger is my birthright!\u2019\u2019**\r\n\r\nThe trailer itself said everything about the movie. Going for the movie without the trailer watch would be a great move, at least you will get something to enjoy. The cast was good, I mean everyone, including who came in short roles. It mainly focused on Robin Williams and Mila Kunis roles. These two characters take an adventure throughout the Brooklyn before the story comes to the conclusion. The movie was a lot better than I thought and what others said about it. It is kind of tearjerker movie. With the loss of Robin Williams in the real life, I got a little emotional to the end part. But the story was a bit let down. In the middle when the second half starts to undertake it really slows down and nothing happens in an exciting way. Frankly to say, it was an hour movie, but stretched for extra few more minutes to make comfortable for the theatre release. So that caused it to fall to a moderate pace. It should have been a short movie, though, as a feature film it kind of satisfied me. Somehow, with the nice direction and performances and places it was shot, all combined together gives an overall decent movie watching experience.\r\n\r\n7.5\/10","id":"540382850e0a2658ee00811f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/540382850e0a2658ee00811f","movie_id":152790}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> At war, it's not all about the manpower, but strategy.\r\n\r\nThe highest domestic box office ever as well as internationally as a Korean movie. Based on the naval wars of Japanese invasion of Korea that took place in the last decade of the 1500s. The battle was fought for six long years, but this film focuses only the final one called 'Battle of Myeongnyang' in the year 1597. The famous face from the Korean filmdom, Choi Min-sik can be seen in the title role. For the international market, he was badly needed than the role wanted him. But I don't say that, he was amazing as always, like the character was specially created for him.\r\n\r\nAs an important historical subject of the Korea, it was a very carefully made flick. But the product was more commercialised than being practical, especially in the battle scenes. You can't expect logic and accurate historical account, but entertainment is promised as the film's main intention. Awesome visuals, but as I said lacks the reality. Not a bad film either, because a very much acceptable for having interesting tiny bits in the battle. The first half was more a drama and as we are viewers, there is a chance to lose the focus. Barely generates any interest, kind of a setback to the movie. Not even the character constructive was handled that better in those sections where it should have been.\r\n\r\nExactly after the first hour the pace picks up as the war commenced. Then it was a non-stop action, one must buckle up his seat belt for onwards to enjoy. Mostly never seen before style, because it was exhibited in the Korean style of a sea battle. It involves some kind of oceanography like the second half of the title say, 'Roaring Currents'. But not in a theoretical calculation rather a practical by observing the pattern and executing the plans like any old civilization was doing in any field. In one of the dialogue, the admiral uses the word 'virus' about fears spreading among his men. I don't think so the virus was discovered not before the late 19th century.\r\n\r\n> \"Fear does not discriminate,\r\n> it can equally affect our enemy.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be a Korean answer to the '300: Rise of an Empire'. There are no similarities, one is a fictional war and the other one is a biographical war film, but deals on the same theme. Especially when the hundreds of soldiers fight against the thousands, definitely reminds '300'. Actually, it was 12 Korean warships against the 330 Japanese fleets. There are so many characters, the editing was much better to give space for everyone to show their parts in this 2 long hour run. The music was equally matched to the visuals. It includes some emotional segments too, but not the appealing one like you are going to have tears rather the narration demanded it and it worked.\r\n\r\nIn the last two decades, Korean filmmakers going after the untouched territories and their success were inevitable. The quality of graphics in the world cinema is the revolution. Something is sure that now it does not belong to Hollywood alone. Because of this technology the world cinemas can compete with Hollywood. When I was a kid, my frequent question was 'why its so gloomy?'. The one thing I liked in this film was they were not afraid to create the battleground (atmosphere in the sea) in the daylight. You can see sunshine, shadows as well as gloomy as the clouds passing by. This film was a spectacular piece, that does not mean I said it a masterpiece. Like I always say, knowing\/learning history through the films are easier than the textbooks. Hope there is a part 2, seems I want one.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"55e74e3fc3a368377c00073f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55e74e3fc3a368377c00073f","movie_id":282631}

Today to travel to another continent you've to pass so many formalities like visa, passport, security check, background check, check-up for latest fast spreading disease, body scans for smuggling, purpose of visit etc. It is better to turn into a bird and fly away than going through all this. That's why I am not a nationalist and call myself the citizen of planet Earth, which put me on debate with guys around on the several occasions.\r\n\r\nOkay. The movie was inspired by 'Lost Boys of Sudan'. The true story of four young Sudanese, after their elders were killed in the attack of their village they team up to escape. Henceforth living in the refugee camp in Kenya, looking for an opportunity for a better life. It lands, but struggle continues as to adapt the new place and finding the right employment. The journey from nowhere to the land of dream, but they had no dream at all, all they wanted was a normal life anywhere peacefully. On the other end, the rules and regulations begin to haunt them, which they were not used to it.\r\n\r\n> \u2018\u2018We found strength in sticking together\r\n>  But our hope of ever leaving was fading.\u2019\u2019\r\n\r\nDefinitely an inspiring story. For the meaning of the title, you have to wait until the last minute. Because all the great stories told in the history began or ends with the great sacrifice. That was a touching scene, I just imagined, in reality, how tough it would have been. You probably don't understand what I'm saying, but I'm trying to keep spoiler away. We had seen the similar theme from another angle in Gerard Butler starer 'Machine Gun Preacher'. Yep, about the same war, but set in a different place. The main difference is this movie is not a heroic tale like that where a white man fights for the innocent Africans. You know there are about 20.000 boys and girls orphaned and displaced during the civil war that lasted for nearly 25 years. The writer had to pick just one from the thousands of stories. So that's how 'The Good Lie' came, a story of complete integrity.\r\n\r\nFrom the filmmaker of Oscar nominated foreign movie 'Monsieur Lazhar'. One of my favourites from Canada. I loved all his previous films, so the expectation for this was same as always. It partially feels like a docudrama, but it was not. Leaping into Hollywood did not change his style of film making. He turned into an American movie in which something lacks today, reality and honesty with dynamic story than its characters. Reese Witherspoon's presence did not affect either, the narration was neutral from the perspective of character preference. In fact, Reese Witherspoon's existence helped to put some familiar face on the posters. Especially for the marketing purpose for the wide release, other than the film festivals. So this movie definitely is to go for it, only if you're not seeking entertainment.\r\n\r\n8.5\/10","id":"55258995c3a3687e11002143","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55258995c3a3687e11002143","movie_id":250538}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Revenge for a revenge.\r\n\r\nIt is a Danish western revenge flick set in the American soil, so 99 per cent it was in the English language. Well, in my opinion, it is underrated for sure. It was not anything stylish like QT's recent western films, but quite usual presentation yet very majestic. The story takes place in a couple of days in a small town in the 1871. The turnaround in the theme was great. Initially, it leaves an impression of a revenge based tale, but later becomes oil warfare, something quite resembles the original situation of the American at that time.\r\n\r\nIn the last few weeks I have been watching lots of comedies, dramas and other soft themed films, so suddenly I felt too much violence from this. But as always I get used to it after some time in the watch. Great cast and their great performances. The writing was superb along with the settings. I watched it quite late, but the best western I have seen in the recent time, so I strongly recommended for western fans and others who're seeking a fine entertainment.\r\n\r\n7.5\/10","id":"577aabf6c3a3682008001727","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/577aabf6c3a3682008001727","movie_id":266285}

It involves paranormal research that seeks to prove supernatural entities are in fact manifestations of the human mind.\r\n\r\nThe complete opposite of Hammer's hugely successful The Woman in Black, The Quiet Ones is set in the 70s (Oxford, England). The house the action is set in is naturally remote, though it lacks the Gothic chill required for maximum impact. The makers are more intent on jolts and screeches to get their scares, which sadly gets a bit tiresome come the mid-point. It's effectively chilling at times, with some well mounted spooky atmospheric moments - while Olivia Cooke as the focal point of the \"happenings\" gives a sturdy and impressive turn, but it feels old hat and fails to deliver on its promise. 6\/10","id":"571db3ddc3a3682042000465","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/571db3ddc3a3682042000465","movie_id":193612}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A mystery bag in the hands of an obedient man!**\r\n\r\nAs the title suggests, it's all about the bag, a mystery bag. An interesting angle of storytelling. It was a good mystery, though they did not get it right. The plot line had all the ingredients, but while developing it, they had lost the way. I was not impressed with the writing and also the direction. It is engaging with a fine pace, but visually all the crucial film scenes looked so flat or comparable with other classic films. More or less, everything is predictable, except the end twist.\r\n\r\nThis is a one day tale. Most of the film takes place in one night with full of mixup and going after the truth. A gangster boss hires a hit-man for an important job that he must safeguard a bag till he arrive to get it in an isolated motel. During waiting for his boss, the bag man goes through unexpected events which eventually taking many turns, that comes to an end with a twist. With the limited cast, everyone got a fair share of screen.\r\n\r\nThe actors like Cusack and De Niro are the advantage, but this is not an ideal film for such actors. Lately they and many other aged actors are into such films. So it is expected, but not expected to fail all their attempts. This film was okay, if you are not looking for a masterpiece thriller. Can be watched once, but instantly forgettable film. So film like this cannot be recommended, but if you decide to watch, don't expect anything other than just an entertainment or timepass. That is what it is good at.\r\n\r\n_4.5\/10_","id":"5887dba492514162f5004c64","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5887dba492514162f5004c64","movie_id":242076}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The message is to we be alert all time, no matter how friendly the society is.**\r\n\r\nThis is like an extended version of 'Prisoners'. Sets in a small snowy Canadian town where a ten year old girl was mysteriously disappeared and so the film focused on the life of her parents who are eager to see her even after 8 years past. The cops and parents, hopelessly look for any clue of her being alive. Happy or sad ending, that's what the film's conclusion decides. Maybe the director was inspired to make this by his previous film, which was similar and based on the real, but that ends differently.\r\n\r\nFilms like this scares if you are a family man. But I think if we keep watching them at the time of it comes out, it is to alert us about our family security lapse. No matter whatever the country is, how safety it is, as they say, still thing like this happens in an eye blink time. The film is really something big, I wanted to like it, but they did not make the film right.\r\n\r\nNot a bad film, only badly made, that's all. The characters, the concept had potential and the development ruined it everything. Nearly 75 per cent of the film was a drag. Everything we wanted to know is in first 15 and the last 30 minutes. In between, they have wasted in the name of development, hence the film failed to impress as what it promised, not from the message perspective and that's the point.\r\n\r\nNot all the actors were good, particularly Ryan Reynolds was the best. The remaining ones were okay, though Rosario Dawson was the next best thing in the film. I did not like the presentation, it was so random to move from and forth between in the 8 years time span, it totally messed the film. Not only confuses the viewers, it gained nothing from it. Because usually this kind of narration method used to bring twist and turns and audience to keep guessing till the final, but in this case, it did not work at all. Other than that the film was better than it was criticised, I still suggest it for the adults because of the film theme.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"57ed84f9c3a3686cfa00033e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ed84f9c3a3686cfa00033e","movie_id":244761}

{"author":"mattwilde123","content":"'The Voices' is a very dark comedy from graphic novelist Marjane Satrapi. It tells the story of a man named Jerry (Ryan Reynolds) who works in a bathtub factory. Jerry continuously sees a psychiatrist (Jacki Weaver) as he tries to live a normal life whilst dealing with his mental afflictions. He decides to pursue his office crush (Gemma Arterton) but soon finds himself in a murderous situation when she fails to reciprocate his advances. Jerry's schizophrenia means that he hears voices specifically from his pets who give him help and advice.\r\n\r\nSatrapi directs the piece with a surprisingly heartfelt and empathetic way. The lack of colour and light (such as when Jerry is on his limiting medication) contrast really well with the scenes where the main character is free and feels at peace. There are very graphic scenes of murder which highlight the brutality of his actions reminding the audience of the morality of Jerry's actions. The music is also very fitting and turns drastically into a horror-themed score when the drama switches.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is funny in a lot of places. Before I watched the film, I thought I would find similarities with HBO's 'Dexter' as it deals with a likeable killer whilst also being humorous. But, after watching, I feel that the film owes a lot to Mary Harron's 'American Psycho' as it shares similar themes of delusion and indulgence. However, the dialogue was a bit forced at times and I usually find myself cringing when watching a British actress (in this case Gemma Arterton) having to read lines written in a very stereotypical way.\r\n\r\nRyan Reynolds is fantastic as the main character and really makes the audience feel for his character. Reynolds completely embodies the main character's innocence and is a genuinely nice man. Even more impressive is the fact that Reynolds also performs voices for his pets which include a Scottish cat and a Texan dog. I had a slight problem with other members of the cast who I felt were not quite up to the standard that Reynolds set although Jacki Weaver was great as his psychiatrist and Anna Kendrick did a good job at playing his love interest.\r\n\r\nOverall, I feel that 'The Voices' was a surprisingly good film. It was funny and very well acted. 'The Voices' is a little hidden gem that a lot of people who are fans of small and strange indie comedies would love.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605","id":"58c1500ec3a36826500094f2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c1500ec3a36826500094f2","movie_id":244458}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> When the singing bird flies away from the nest...\r\n\r\nLooked like a normal drama, but I had a lot of laughs in the first half. And it was a completely opposite in the second part where it touched me deeper. It has been months I haven't had tears in my eyes for a movie. This was an excellent family movie with lots of good things about life and family in it. This was the closest one I ever got to one of my recent favourite music-drama from the Canada, 'Gabrielle'. There's no major comparison between the two, but similar movies with different characters and settings. The theme wise it was another version of 'Billy Elliot' for sure.\r\n\r\nThis was not about your typical rural family. It was a rarest where they are going to witness the next stage of the life's journey as a united family as well as individually. Being a member in a deaf family, especially when everyone somewhere, somewhat depends on you is a task needs devotion. But when you realise you are gifted with something valuable, what will you do and how your the family reacts. That's what the story is and illustrated with excellent bunch of characters.\r\n\r\nLike I said earlier, the end scene will test your emotional level, but hard to hold it back, especially you are a kindest in nature. If you are having it with a numerous disturbances and lost concentration, then it will become an ordinary movie. One of the reasons for the mean people to say 'I'm a grown up man'. Does not mean men won't cry, but some they just hide it, that's all. In a such occasion when you are uncomfortable showing your emotions, then I recommend you go for it alone and have a good time.\r\n\r\n> \"Being deaf does not excuse everything.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not unusual for a movie to have the flaws, some will be neglectably small, but some will be strongly visible. It was the sign language that leaves a blank page as an invisible dialogue that we never get. I had a tough time understanding some parts of the movie. Instead, understanding the lines that said with gestures, I managed to follow the situation of the story and the scene. It would have been the same even it was an English language movie, hardcore subtitle would have been a better solution.\r\n\r\nIn the middle, the narration failed to keep up the momentum. Barely any interesting stuff occurs. It was a time when in the storytelling to take place a leap. Apparently only for that instant, but once you complete your watch, it does not seem much affected portion in the film. Interesting, the story began to break into multiple and tried to move in all the direction. Election campaign, brother's crush on his sister's friend, like that. But cleverly held back to the one line for the sentimental conclusion.\r\n\r\nDoes not feel like it was the first film for the lead girl Paula. She might have missed the title in 'The Voice' competition, but she has won an award for her lovely role in this movie. I am not a French nor English nor from the other Euro zone, and I don't know the songs from the movie, but loved them all. The lyrics were so good, especially that final song. A highly recommended movie for the families.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"559d782392514125120003ac","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/559d782392514125120003ac","movie_id":304410}

This is very much a character based story about a small handful of people affected by crime, where they are chained to events occurring by way of law breaking. Roskam is in no hurry what so ever to spin his picture's literary worth, very much favouring a slow burn - even low key - approach. He deftly develops atmosphere whilst simultaneously ensuring we the viewers are very much a part of the setting and situations - something Lehane does so brilliantly in his novels. By the time the pic plays its hand, what appeared at first to be needless complexities, are valid and close the piece down with some considerable success. 7.5\/10","id":"58ab824b92514158c0006001","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ab824b92514158c0006001","movie_id":154400}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A father with a hope to find his missing sons.\r\n\r\nA fictional narration with the backdrop of the World War I. Precisely the story begins after the end of the war, about a father who goes after look for his sons who were last seen on the battlefield of Gallipoli, Turkey. The rest is the mix of drama, war, romance, flashbacks, and whether his mission is accomplished or not is the climax that decide.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I was a little disappointed. The story was not based on the real, but looked like one. The point is it was a wonderful and inspiring theme, but direction was not convincing along with bad editing. If you look at who's that, it was a direction debut for Russell Crowe, who played the main character in the film as well. Some of the historical facts were wrong, especially showing the Greeks in the bad light was the negativity of the film. Visually the films do not give the impression of the pre 1920s where the story set in. Instead, it looks more of the late 40s or the early 50s.\r\n\r\nSince it was set after the war, most of the characters were in a guilt attitude. Can't say whole film was predictable, but the scenes were. The performances were the only things that tried to lift the movie, as well as the music and screenplay in some parts. This, book based movie should have been directed by any top director, not for the freshers to try-out their skills in direction field, because of the powerful stuffs like anti-war elements.

The exaggerated scenes of violence and gore may be a bit too strange for those who do not appreciate the sentimentality and nostalgia of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe narrative is very straightforward and follows Dan Stevens, an ex-soldier, as he returns to his friend's family's house as a dying wish. He protects and helps them through their individual problems but all is not what it seems. The film does lose it's way slightly towards the end as it tries to drastically remind audiences that the film is meant to be over-the-top when it was already doing a subtly good job.\r\n\r\nDan Stevens is very good in the main role.

{"author":"Reno","content":"The second movie in the new Spider-man movie series that directed by Marc Webb. I doubt his potential after seeing this movie. I feel someone should take his position before it become too late. In the history of the Spider-man movies, from all the 6 this one is the worst. Commercially it has done a great business that grabbed around $800 million all over the world, but failed to deliver another quality movie for the fans. The movie engaged with the too much character and subplots. The subplots were not placed in the right spots, kind of random appearance brings the chaos in understanding the story. I had a high hope on this movie and it did not supply well. Frankly, I kind of lost interest in Spider-man. Maybe because it was too soon to reboot, I guess.\r\n\r\n> **\u2018\u2018You want to be the hero.\r\n> And now you gotta pay the price.\u2019\u2019**\r\n\r\nThe first movie gave a decent re-start for the refreshed Spider-man movie series. And what happened here in this second installment was a disaster. The first thing is it was nearly a 2 and half an hour movie that brought me lightly a headache to carry on thus far. Actually, it was 10 minutes shorter than what it is now, but in the end they have developed a bit longer to show the opening scene of the third movie. When a movie got a powerful hero, it should have equally matched antagonist. If they are matched, then the fight between them are the next thing to bring the best out of it. I think the Electro man did not click as they have expected, at least not to me. The strength he had was something beyond spider-man, but did not unleash him in a perfect manner. Though Jamie Foxx was not bad in that avatar, the filmmakers kind of wasted his presence for not so good scenes.\r\n\r\nRemember the original Spider-man was the modern superhero movies, I mean it was done using computer graphics. Afterwards 'Batman', 'Iron Man', 'Thor' and all were followed. I like the version with Tobey Maguire in it, though my rating declined by movie after another in the trilogy. This reboot series had a good opening, but failed to get the momentum going. Especially all the emotions were looked fakes that do not appeal like the original movie series did. Yes, it had a wonderful box office and that does not mean the movie is good, either worst. But expected a little better, especially in the negative characters. Andrew Garfield was good, not awesome, because most of his masked parts were CGI. Emma stone was another let down and could not help comparing her with Kristen Dunst, because she was no way near, at all. The Dane DeHaan role had the same issue and I don't know why people did not get better space in the movie that ran 140 minutes long. Like I said subplot spoiled everything I think. The digital 3D and stunts were poor. Yeah, there are many things to complain about it than to praise, but all the answer should come in the next sequel. If that makes bigger, not commercially, I mean with a good story, graphics and performances then there will be no problem. But if it fails, I had to say 'bring back the fourth installment of the original movie series'. Definitely not worth a watch, but anyway most of the guys going to watch it or already watched it.","id":"540381aac3a368437200537e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/540381aac3a368437200537e","movie_id":102382}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**We're surrounded by dangers, simply refused to see it.**\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw such documentary film was 'Food, Inc.'. In the mean time I have seen documentaries about different topics, but not food. It was a long gap indeed, because then I was in my early twenties and now watching this film made me realise how to look at the food I eat everyday. So believe me, if you are in your late twenties and above, this will inspire you. But for others, like the youngsters and kids, it will be an educational film.\r\n\r\nThis Australian film looks funny from the outside, but the information it gives can't simply be discarded. I liked the actor, who was the writer, director, producer of the film and the dedication was highly appreciable. Because it was not just go out and make a film, but he himself placed into the centre of the film plot. Initially I thought it was a crazy idea, but at the end I'm stunned. For everything, from what he did and what this film revealed.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the food, there are many things to be concerned. But this film was focused on sugar, about the foods we eat, which has a strong sugar presence and how it is affecting our health. Damon Gameau decided to experiment himself by consuming per day, forty teaspoons of sugar and from sugary products that easily available in the market. And monitoring carefully the changes in his body along the way his wife's pregnancy.\r\n\r\n> \"Sugar's not evil, but life's so much better when you get rid of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe film is not all about the experiment he's doing, it also gives some details about the people who are suffering big from modern foods. Especially I'm happy for openly giving opinions about the soft drinks from Coke and Pepsi brands. Damon also travelled to the US and he continued what he was doing, alongside collecting some new input from the experts, as well as meeting the victims. The rapid change in his physique and health gives a report on what direction the experiment is heading. From damaging the skin to the putting his internal body organs into various risks of diseases such as liver failure, heart attack and many more.\r\n\r\nThere's a brief appearance of Hugh Jackman, but don't expect more than that. It had no big impact, because the film's topic was much bigger than his part in the film. The film gave me some idea about how to deal with the food I consume. If you are concerned about your weight, particularly fat tummy, you will know what to do after watching this. I mean this does not guide you through, but opens your eyes. It points out where you are committing your mistake. It does not tell to completely cut off the sugary, but know your limit and behave.\r\n\r\nOne of the best documentary films. Do whatever you want after watching this, but before that don't think to skip it. You can call it an inspirational, educational or a message deliverer, but this film has committed to highlight what went wrong with the modern day diet. And how the food industry is responding to all the accusations. But you should know what's better for you, so think twice before touching any sugar products. Especially be aware of fructose (who is the villain of this story), which might not equate to nicotine, but the consequences are.\r\n\r\n_9\/10_","id":"585ea1b092514115c4010a51","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/585ea1b092514115c4010a51","movie_id":305091}

{"author":"Reno","content":"You know what, the movie's visual effects were better than its actors. The acceptable stunts and graphics for a B movie, but the let down came from the performances. I don't know what happened to the director, he used to make the better movies in his early career and now he lost his way. Maybe the big stars don't believe in him that may lead him to recruit second stream actors.\r\n\r\nThe romance portions were too bad, no chemistry, physics, mathematics, nothing, but just an ordinary without the feelings. When it comes to the game of throne, that's looked okay as it scripted like 'snakes and ladders' game. Anyway, it was a well known story among most of us which was altered and told somewhat differently. Disappoint is there though still somehow watchable.\r\n\r\nDon't force yourself for this, because you are not going to miss any masterpiece. It's becoming a habit in Hollywood, like I already mentioned in a review a year ago that two same thematic movies coming out of a same period. So this time Dwayne Johnson's movie wins the race, according to the ratings and reviews across the internet, but I still have to see it first before compare them both.","id":"545776d00e0a262977001ca6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/545776d00e0a262977001ca6","movie_id":188207}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> An unusual western road trip drama.\r\n\r\nA novel based film starred and directed by the 70 years old Tommy Lee Jones. An unusual realistic western drama with a fantastic cast. It sets around the time 1850 and the story of three mentally ill wives who were transported to a safe facility by a man and a woman who hired him in exchange of saving his life. During this both way road trip, what they go through is what finely told.\r\n\r\nTommy Lee Jones and Hilary Swank were excellent in their parts. She was the best, you would definitely feel her role's eagerness to get a normal life with a husband and children. Which is very important for the personal and the social life of that time. And at this old age, Tommy Lee did a great job in all the fields he had undertaken for this project. His vision was the most appreciable.\r\n\r\nFelt like I saw a wonderful western film after a long time. But some of the events were needed a good explanation like one of the deaths in the film. Since it was a tale of the cowboy culture era, few things were understandable, but not everyone going to get those parts. So the details were missing yet not a bad film.\r\n\r\nThe characters were not introduced in a usual way, it only goes forward by developing the story and by the end you would feel you know them enough. And at the final act, there was a couple of guest appearances and steals the show. It is not your regular western, totally worth a watch and that's my suggestion.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"5787c86e92514131cc00104a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5787c86e92514131cc00104a","movie_id":264656}

{"author":"Reno","content":"A movie first must get notice in its domestic circuit, then rest of the world come check it out on the curious. I don't know this was a blockbuster or not in the local market, but heard lots praise for it, especially, from the youngsters. I have seen only a few Filipino movies and this one was one of the good films. Very very similar movie to 'Before' trilogy and a fine beginning of the series. Yes, I heard the second movie is already in talk, so guessed probably it going to end as a trilogy.\r\n\r\nUnlike 'Before' trilogy, this movie is not set in the casual manner, between the two. Most importantly, it's a road movie, a travel tale. The one of two who meet are affected by the recent love failure. So, the narration concentrates mostly on romance and about mending the broken heart. A pair of two actors with a good chemistry and nicely shot in the beautiful places. Like advertising Filipino tourism, the movie takes us to the finest locations.\r\n\r\nIt commences just after the 8 years of romance ended for a woman. It does not show how, but later revealed by orally. Beautifully brought those heartbreaks and heartache on the screen. How the boys and girls mourn for their broken relationship was presented quite impressively. All the good times spent together pops out in the front and the rest of the stuffs are just pitch black. Even after breaking their heart, they feel they want to forgive them and give a second chance.\r\n\r\n> There are all kinds of love in this world,\r\n> but never the same love twice.\r\n\r\nI liked the honesty in the movie, I mean the characters talk as in reality, not the craps. If you ever was in love and saw the failure, you would know what I meant. Whatever the account between them, the animation narration was the plus point in this whole storytelling. The story begins with an arrow asking a question for a lost heart. And the answer is the movie itself that you are going know in the end. It might not understandable by the serious people, but morally appeals to the lover boys and girls, I mean to the guys who are insanely in love with someone.\r\n\r\nI thought it was about and for youngster, actually it's about the people who are on the leap from there to the middle age. So, the crisis here is, the chances are fading away to fall in love madly, crazily again. Those days, the playful younger days are gone, what should be done now onwards is the movie that chronicles with lots of fun, emotions and a simple twist at the end. Though, the end was not properly explained, but leaves open. I'd say save whatever you are going to predict it to be, because like I said the sequel's quest to fill it up. But I hope it makes the same impact as this one did to me.\r\n\r\nIt's more like a 'coming-of-age' for those who are between teen and middle age. I can't say it was the best, but a good movie. Since the loop is open, all I can do is wait for the follow up. Who knows, after the second and even better third movie, it might pop into one of the best romance-trilogies ever. So I'm keeping an open mind here. Hope they won't mess it up. In the meantime, you can give it a try because it was not any nearer to be called bad and I'm sure you would enjoy it if you like a simple romantic tale.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"55380b64c3a3687845004501","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55380b64c3a3687845004501","movie_id":302104}

{"author":"AJ Rehman","content":"Only two English-language journalists reported from Gaza as it suffered an all-out attack from Israel in late 2008 and early 2009. The War Around Us is a powerful, deeply moving new documentary through the eyes of these two reporters, Ayman Mohyeldin and Sherine Tadros.\r\n\r\nDirected by Abdallah Omeish (whose best-known film is Occupation 101), The War Around Us is just 75 minutes long. But that\u2019s enough. Tightly focused and intentionally restricted in its scope and aims, it follows in chronological order the course of the conflict, intercut with post facto interviews with Mohyeldin and Tadros. At the time both were reporting for Al Jazeera English. Mohyeldin was based in Gaza, but Tadros was there on an assignment to cover reactions to the election of US President Barack Obama.\r\n\r\nWith apparently free access to Al Jazeera footage of the attack, as well as images from the Palestinian news agency Ramattan, the film is extremely graphic and disturbing. Scenes include that of a mother and her two dead children lying side-by-side on a hospital floor; another man screaming with grief as the body of his little girl flops on a blanket; young men lying in the courtyard of a police station hit by Israeli air strikes, each with one hand raised as they say the final prayers of the dying. A victim of the horrific burns inflicted by illegal white phosphorous munitions (made in the US, fired by the Israeli military) lies in a hospital bed; huge pools of blood lie clotting on the steps of a school in Jabaliya refugee camp run by the UN agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA).\r\n\r\nIcy fury\r\n\r\nLess graphic but equally devastating is the interview footage. Rima, a beautiful and intensely dignified young mother, tells Tadros how her children no longer say they are afraid of dying \u2014 they just want to make sure that they die along with her so they\u2019re not left alone. John Ging, then a leading figure in UNRWA, speaks with icy fury as desperately-needed food supplies burn behind him. And 16-year-old Ahmad Samouni\u2019s face writhes in pain as he describes lying for days surrounded by the bodies of his family, waiting for the Israeli army to allow ambulances to fetch him.\r\n\r\nMany viewers are perhaps now inured to the kind of violence we regularly see on YouTube and activist media, but to watch news media footage \u2014 where cameramen have often risked their lives to chase the most graphic images, and which has been edited and soundtracked for intensity and impact \u2014 for over an hour is hard to stomach, even now.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, something of a relief that the film intercuts the material from the attack on Gaza with extended interviews with Mohyeldin and Tadros. They reflect on the roles and responsibilities of journalists in such a situation, on their \u201canger\u201d at finding that they were the only mainstream Western journalists reporting from inside Gaza, and on the personal impacts of covering such a horrific story.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere was the outrage?\u201d\r\n\r\nMohyeldin, already a seasoned conflict reporter when he was posted to Gaza, is the more political one in his comments. He is patently furious at the Western media for their failure to adequately deliver to their audiences the truth of what he calls in the film \u201ca story of great shame to humanity.\u201d American and British news channels, he says, \u201cneglected the story and then had the audacity to question the only journalists on the ground \u2026 they tried to spin it in a way that would marginalize or diminish what was happening.\u201d He condemns the \u201csilence of the international community. Where was the outrage?\u201d\r\n\r\nTadros\u2019s comments are more personal. A newcomer to frontline reporting, she is frank in saying that she will never put herself in that position again. Obviously hugely affected by the mothers and children she interviewed \u2014 in their homes and hospital beds \u2014 she recounts how, coming home to London after the attacks, she couldn\u2019t hold her one-year-old nephew because she imagined blood seeping through his clothes. She also describes vividly the difficulty of facing death day after day, not from one\u2019s own perspective, but from that of the family, thousands of miles away, who are powerless to help.\r\n\r\nTadros admits that during the attacks, Mohyeldin found her to be a \u201cprincess.\u201d But behind-the-scenes footage shows a drained, haggard woman working 19 hours a day, snatching sleep on an office floor, desperate to achieve her role of showing the human impacts of a conflict which much of world was seeing only from Western reports in southern Israel or the insidious lies of Mark Regev and Avital Leibovich, chief mouthpieces for the Israeli government and military.\r\n\r\nSpecific aim\r\n\r\nAyman Mohyeldin, in a question and answer session following a screening of the film in Amman, acknowledged criticism of the documentary for its focus on two mainstream journalists, rather than telling the story from a Palestinian perspective. Although Mohyeldin has a Palestinian mother, he doesn\u2019t labor this as a claim to authenticity. Instead, he insists that the film has a very specific aim \u2014 to speak to Western audiences, to use himself and Tadros, two Western journalists of Arab origin, as a bridge to the sympathies of Western viewers, and to \u201cmake people question their own media for not telling [the truth about the attacks].\u201d\r\n\r\nUltimately, The War Around Us is a damning critique \u2014 from within the industry \u2014 of the Western media\u2019s reporting of Palestine, as well as a powerful tool in the hands of Palestine solidarity campaigners. There is no way to walk away from this film not feeling angry and deeply distressed, but also with a visceral and fundamental grasp on the depth of Israel\u2019s denial of the Palestinian right not only to life and liberty but, in Ayman Mohyeldin\u2019s words, \u201cof the right to aspire.\u201d","id":"53ed4577c3a3681689000662","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53ed4577c3a3681689000662","movie_id":286714}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Ba Ba-Ba Dook! Dook! Dook!\r\n\r\nThe Babadook is written and directed by Jennifer Kent. It stars Essie Davis, Noah Wiseman, Daniel Henshall and Hayley McElhinney. Music is by Jed Kurzel and cinematography by Radek Ladczuk.\r\n\r\nAmelia is a single mother still haunted by the violent death of her husband, she is trying to deal with her young son Samuel's fear of a monster in the house. Initially tolerating it as a flight of fancy, the arrival of a book in the youngster's bedroom called Mr. Babadook, signals the start of a sinister presence that she herself can begin to fear as well.\r\n\r\nAustralia has been producing some great horror films in the last couple of decades, The Babadook is one of the best of the bunch. Jennifer Kent made it as a 10 minute short back in 2005 called Monster, itself a super piece of horror film making, now in full feature length form (Kent\u2019s first), the vision and intelligence explodes off the screen in every frame.\r\n\r\nThe premise at the core is not exactly fresh, but Kent manages to make The Babadook its own entity, skilfully steering away from formula jolts and terrors. Which in this day and age of horror retreads, sequel frenzies and blood for blood\u2019s sake, is most refreshing. This is a big character piece, a two hander of incredible emotional power, a mother and son dealing with their own demons before the eponymous Babadook enters the fray. We care about this pair of troubled souls, so much so that as we start to feel the dread, get the tingles down the spine, our hearts are also aching for them. The two performances of the actors quite simply magnificent.\r\n\r\nMr. Babadook is a pop-up picture book that suddenly arrives into their lives. The creature  is a sort of cross between a German expressionistic nightmare and Jack the Ripper. The book itself is creepy enough in its own right, more so as it starts to take on a more terrifying tone \u2013 and Amelia proves unsuccessful at getting rid of the thing \u2013 the picture starts playing its ace psychological cards. The monster is kept mostly to the edges of the frames, or just popping up for a quick glance in unexpected places, this is a great move and suits the narrative perfectly.\r\n\r\nThe tech credits are top notch. A key aspect to getting the most out of The Babadook is to make sure the sound is loud, for the sound mix is tremendous and can bring pounds of gooseflesh rising up on your arms. Ladczuk\u2019s photography is at one with the themes pulsing away in the story, the colours paled and cheerless, enhancing the fractured psyches of mother and son, but Mr. Babadook is a jet black presence in this landscape. All told the art design from the book to the house and the creature is excellent.\r\n\r\nUmbrella\u2019s Australian All Region Blu-ray Release has a super transfer and does justice to the sound mix. There\u2019s over an hour of interviews, which are a mixed bag of informative chat and back slapping, a 12 minute behind the scenes making of and some trailers. The bonus is the 10 minute short, Monster, The Babadook in its infancy but no less scary for it.\r\n\r\nThe Babadook is a superlative horror film for adults, like when Polanski met Kubrick and they decided to pay homage to Fritz Lang and George Melies. Yes it\u2019s that good. 10\/10","id":"546d25589251412bb3000075","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/546d25589251412bb3000075","movie_id":242224}

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"The Falling collapses its ambitious intrigue through overextended fainting spells. Puberty is a strong advocate for personable change. Experiencing the evolutionary adolescence that transforms sprouted children into blossoming young adults. Yet, the journey is rarely uncomplicated, demanding physical and mental energy that springs hormonal tendencies into action. None more demanding than the friendship between youthful girls, minor fraternities conjuring rites of passage to solidify bonds. Morley\u2019s distinctively bold mystery encompasses the pubescence of an all-girl school, experiencing synchronised mass hysteria after the tragic death of a fellow pupil.\r\n\r\nA psychological contagion enabling the exploration of sexuality, moulded by misty melodrama against an autumnal period backdrop. Disturbingly beguiling in nature, through metaphorical body possessions that highlight supernatural elements within the obtrusive sexual motives. Morley, for the most part, captivates when allowing her acting talent to shine through. An innocently naive Williams bravely controlling every scene in her leading role as a psychologically deterred student whom seemingly is a catalyst for the hysteria breakouts. Hospitalised, psychoanalysed and actively withdrawn from therapy, the spells of hysteria are never elaborated. An unexplainable mass psychogenic illness. Morley\u2019s intent in ambiguity enables her ostentatious narrative to visualise sexualisation. Hormonal chemicals invading the bloodstream and controlling the mind. A possession, if you will.\r\n\r\nConversely, her screenplay resorts to ethereal poetry and psychedelic narration, emphasising the connectivity between these girls. Unfortunately, several conversational scenes spoon-feed proposed metaphors for the assurance of acknowledgement, most notably the one-sided therapy session that Lydia and her friends endure. Diminishing the bold interpretations that preceded the conclusive act almost indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThen the final ten minutes commence and Morley outwardly encounters her own spell of hysteria. The tone alters. The mood unequivocally changes. The pace quickens. She dabbles into darker subjects, a territory that heavily contrasts with the predominantly mystifying narrative. The virginal Lydia interrogating her neglectful agoraphobic mother regarding her father, whilst developing an incestuous relationship with her brother. Discovering her true roots, subsequently offering a hereditary reasoning for her mental instability. It\u2019s at this point where Morley loses that tight narrative control. Explicitly presenting a shallow explanation that manages to resolve familial turmoil in a matter of minutes, allowing the supernatural aura to dissipate. Not to mention how under-utilised and misdirected Peake was. Fortunately Pugh\u2019s illuminatingly perfect performance makes up for lost talent. The editing imaginatively strings various images together during rapid flashback scenes, which proved effective for the most part. Thorn\u2019s soundtrack however was too audacious and overpowering, likening The Falling to a casual summer school trip rather than an existential piece of art.\r\n\r\nMorley is a credible director, and The Falling is one feature that uniquely tackles a variety of subjects in a mesmerisingly imaginative manner.

It clearly tries to expand on the bigger picture that we missed out on last time - but the fact is that past the initial frightening idea, _The Purge: Anarchy_ is an exercise in mindless bloodshed (as is the eponymous Purge itself), and lacks emotional depth or a coherent story.","id":"5a12ebb9c3a368628f06c530","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a12ebb9c3a368628f06c530","movie_id":238636}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Sometimes you gotta sacrifice a single sheep to save the rest.\r\n\r\nThe Salvation is directed by Kristian Levring and Levring co-writes the screenplay with Anders Thomas Jensen. It stars Mads Mikkelsen, Eva Green, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Eric Cantona, Mikael Persbrandt, Jonathan Pryce and Douglas Henshall. Music is by Kasper Winding and cinematography by Jens Schlosser.\r\n\r\n1871 and ex-patriot Danish soldier Jon Jensen (Mikkelsen) is, after 7 years of foundation building, welcoming his wife and son to a new life in America. But after they all board a stagecoach bound for their homestead, events will see that journey not be completed. And thus begins a tale of retribution and redemption. \r\n\r\nThere are few smiles in The Salvation, in fact viewers will need to grab onto the sparse offerings of such very early in the piece. For it's a film of blood, brooding and misery, of intensity and a paucity of the good side of human nature. Levring has managed to successfully blend the traditions of the American Western with the feel of the Euro Spaghetti Oaters. There is so much for Western fans to enjoy here. It's a classic revenger pumped by a good versus bad heart, yet as pared down and as simple as the story may at first seem, there's interesting asides of worth. \r\n\r\nThe issue of Euro immigrants trying to make it in the Wild West is noteworthy, while there's a delicious juxtaposition between two soldiers from different continents, and different wars. Jensen fought the Germans in Europe, while his nemesis, Henry Delarue (Morgan), has been through the Indian wars. A most interesting comparison, one where the characterisations are vividly opposed to each other. Add in a good old town in the grip of a tyrant theme, and a bit of carnal desires upon thine brother's spouse, and it's a spicy hot pot.\r\n\r\nFilmed at dusty South African locations, there's a scenic beauty surrounding the harsh story. Westerns don't have to be filmed in America to look authentic, and this is a case in point. The town of Black Creek has been called fake looking in some quarters, not so. This is a new up-coming town, it's meant to be wooden and sparse. Hell! The saloon is also the local store, the mayor is also the undertaker, this is a basic Wild West town without frills and fancy.\r\n\r\nElsewhere the costuming is splendid, especially Morgan who is nicely dapper in black hat and crimson mack, and there's a whole host of face fuzz on show, which is needed to keep up the whole mud and blood, hard West factor. Levring has an eye for a nice shot, such as a full moon bearing witness, even a traditional slow-mo piece. All that said, irks do exist, Green's character is sketchily drawn, but she's playing a heaving bosom mute (her tongue was cut out by the pesky Indians), so scope for development is admittedly limited. While Winding's score is a bit too modern sounding for the key shoot-out sequences.\r\n\r\nUltimately it's great to see the Western is still thriving in this day and age of CGI and blockbuster pandering. From the shattering and moody first quarter to the bloody and excellently staged finale, The Salvation keeps the Western genre well and truly alive. 9\/10","id":"56cefc80c3a3681e3c002716","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56cefc80c3a3681e3c002716","movie_id":266285}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Some prince charming is not after the princess.\r\n\r\nThe Brasil's submission for the last concluded American Academy Awards, the 2015's Oscar edition and as we know it did not make that far. Again, one more movie in the list of 'based on the short film'. It also retained all the prominent cast and their respective roles for this full length feature. A teen romance-drama, a gay theme as well as a love triangle. Very light and softly narrated tricky romance theme and obviously suited well as a complete picture.\r\n\r\nThe story was told from the perspective of a blind high school student Leo. He and Gi are the friends since childhood. She's always there for him like a pair of eyes, a companion who walks with him home, only until a new student Gabe arrives. The things are starting to change around them and they begin to realise how much valuable to each other. What comes after is the crux of the story. The same old jealousy story, but from the fresh cast it looked so good.\r\n\r\n> \"In our eclipse, Gabriel would be the\r\n> Earth and you, the moon.\"\r\n\r\nA successful domestic box office, critically acclaimed film and the better ratings in all the online movie database, but to me it was just a good movie. The story had adorable characters and the love tale was told in a cute way, though that was not enough for me to get excited. No offense, but the gay theme was the letdown, that doesn't mean I'm against the gay. I loved 'Love of Siam' and 'Bangkok Love Story'. Maybe because I'm a straight, though I had no problem with the movies like 'Water Lilies', 'Yes or No' and other lesbian movies.\r\n\r\nIt's a crazy world, full of crazy people and their crazy romances. Whatever the format is, the love is always sweet. I liked this film's concept, if it was reversed from the gay to the lesbian, probably I would have loved it more. Or the story structure and character development in the first half should have been improved. Because in the end part, looked everything hurried and forced to conclude. Don't listen to me, you might like it, but be cautious, especially don't go after it with a great expectation seeing plenty of praise everywhere.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"55a95a179251411e06003bf4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55a95a179251411e06003bf4","movie_id":237791}
{"author":"alym","content":"The End Movie Review:\r\n\r\nIt's not every Friday that a Telugu movie-goer get to watch a film like \"The End\". Helmed by an award-winning short filmmaker Rahul, the film's trailer succeeded in creating curiosity over the film. And yes, the movie lived up to its expectations. It's a breath of fresh air amidst a bunch of waste films churned out this week and turned out to be winner.\r\n\r\nPlot:\r\n\r\nThe End revolves around two couples Priya (Pavani Reddy), Rajeev Mathews (Sudheer Reddy) and Gautham (Yuva Chandra), Rekha (Gazal Somaiah). While Priya and Rajeev are happily married and staying in their own villa in the outskirts of Hyderabad,  Gautham, who happens to be common-friend of Priya and Rajeev, is a UK-return medical graduate planning to set up his own hospital. Meanwhile, few untoward incidents took place in Priya-Rajeev's villa. A female construction worker accidentally dies in a water-less pool in the villa. The story here takes a major u-turn as turbulence surfaces in Priya and Rajeev's personal life and marital life. That changes the life of Rajeev, Priya and Gautham forever.\r\n\r\nPerformances:\r\n\r\nDirector Rahul recruited reasonably good cast who genuinely performed well. Especially Pavani Reddy's acting as a ghost stands out in the film despite very short screen presence. Side-kicks like Venu (Watchman) tickles few funny bones with his \"Baahubali\" comedy. \r\n\r\nTechnicalities:\r\n\r\nIt's a director's film all the way. Right from its beginning to the end, director's mark is visibly seen throughout the film. As the movie has no crowd-pulling element, the director totally relied on the story and screenplay. The editing could have been tighter. Background score is up to the mark and cinematography is passable.\r\n\r\nAnalysis:\r\n\r\nKudos to first-timer director Rahul who carefully crafted the film making sure all logics are in place and there are no loose ends. He roped in good cast who played their parts well. Good story-line, a well-written screenplay, nice background score have worked in favour of the film. Among the cast, Pavani Reddy comes out flying colours despite her brief presence as the whole story revolves around her.\r\n\r\nHowever, what the debutante director can't avoid is the lagging in narrative. The director eats chunk of audience time and the real story begins only after a while. While the first-half of the film appears to have lengthy, it's the second half that stands the film as a winner amidst several other releases. Especially, the final twist in the climax makes the film a spell-binding, engaging. Although the makers claim it as a horror, The End is neither creepy nor horrific. It's rather a crime thriller. Still, it makes for a good watch. It is an honest attempt by newcomers. Hope The End will be the beginning of \"meaningful\" films and the End of \"logic-less\" films in Telugu Film Industry.\r\n\r\nThumbs up:\r\n\r\nClimax\r\nScreenplay\r\nTwists\r\n\r\nThumbs down:\r\n\r\nFilm's pace\r\nNothing scary\r\n\r\nBottom line: End makes for a Good watch\r\n\r\nThis review is by www.gulte.com, which is close to mine.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The pictures tell us all the story, and when it does, you'll be heartbroken!**\r\n\r\nThis was nominated for the Oscars, but did not win. I should have watched it earlier, but I don't know how I forgot it and moved on. Recently noticed that I've missed it, so finally gave it a try and I really liked, but very sad to learn what the film narrated. This is a biopic, an aged photographer who traveled world revealed his experience with those horrifying encounters the humanity ever saw. From South America to Europe and Africa to Pacific Asia, he takes us back to the 70s, 80s and the 90s. His pictures tell us all the story, but when he explain more surround those pictures when he had taken them, that's where not just me, anybody who sees this documentary would be heartbroken.\r\n\r\nInitially I thought it was just a photo exhibition from the past 40- 50 years of his life, but after the opening few minutes, it kicked off from Brasil to the different parts of the world, like how people suffered from our own mistakes. Also the nature like the oil fields in Iraq, polar and sea animals, tribes, all are very fascinating, as well as upsets with the facts that causing all those troubles. Before watching this I thought it might tell about actual salt of the Earth, the chemistry, to brief its past, present and future. But what the film revealed was shocking and at a time, thanks for being very bold, for the present world, it definitely needed.\r\n\r\nThis is just one man's experience, we don't know what might have happened behind when there is no camera to capture the moment and to tell the story to the rest of the world. A must see film, a documentary film like this is never late to see, even if it takes a lifetime to watch, you must take that chance and do that before you die. I have seen lots of documentaries like this, but this is not a message deliverer, it just finger pointed to our mistakes. You will learn some of the history that you ever learnt from your school, college textbooks or from your own journey around the world. So definitely these pictures are priceless. Not to admire, but to remind not to repeat in the future. I hope you watch it right away after reading my review.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"58013cc1c3a36848ec000b77","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58013cc1c3a36848ec000b77","movie_id":265297}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Being a child of a farmer and the rural life.\r\n\r\nI begin by saying it was a sweet little Italian movie. It is not here to entertain you, but to give an alarming message. The world's human population is growing rapidly, but within, the farmer's counts are shrinking. Hunger will be one of the future's biggest concerns to deal. This film is about a farmer family that depicted from the perspective of what's causing for the people like them to disappear. There are a very few movies on this theme, in that, all the farmer's movies won't illustrate harvesting and hardworks rather focuses on romance, revenge and other subplots. I think this was true to what it was promised and you would feel glad watching this if you are capable to realise the facts.\r\n\r\nA 12 years old girl, Gelsomina, with her parents and three younger sisters lives in a rural Italy. They are the bee farmers, living with a strict order of the life, especially when it comes to the profession. And this story was told from the Gelsomina's viewpoint about everything she and her family goes through. After her father who got no son, she has to carry on the family's tradition to the next generation. She's absolutely on it as she's naturally gifted and stronger than anyone in the family, including her father who's no match for her. Moreover, she's already running the family with moral. But when they reach a crossroad, some unexpected decisions have to be made which is basically the remaining portion.\r\n\r\n> \"You would need a slave.\r\n> Instead of 4 daughters.\"\r\n\r\nI can't say it is a must see, because it is still a movie and looks for an opportunity in between to amuse you. Either, it is not afraid to unfold the reality, that's the best of this film. It had an amazing cast, but I don't know anyone of them, of course, except Monica Bellucci in a cameo. Cinematography was great, they were not trying to seduce the viewers with the beautiful countryside scenic rather presenting as it is. Beside the film let you know about bee keeping and honey extraction. It is not an easy job, thinking bees do all the work and we just snatch it using protection costume. But surrounding environment and all matters. There's no CGI, some of the dangerous scenes were shot under the guidance of the real pros with a specialised documentary crew.\r\n\r\nIt proves a coming-of-age story can also be told in this manner. Urbanising, hunters, tourism influx, name it... all these are affecting peace in the rural life. This film covers most of the factors in a simple fashion, It was not that easy for everyone to understand the end part as it contained two way meaning, literal and metaphor. One is a report card for the actuality and the other one is a cinematic conclusion. Overall, it tackles on the matured contents and children are the part of it, especially the last quarter all about them. And finally, everyone won't desire for a movie like this, but IMO certainly worth spending time for it.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"55de13159251411c41000289","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55de13159251411c41000289","movie_id":265226}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"One thing that I liked about this movie from the start was that it was, in my limited experience at least, somewhat original. Yes it was an apocalypse story but I have really not seen anything quite like it before. Yes moving mazes and all that have been done but the story as a whole was new to me. That was refreshingly enjoyable in this age of more or less boring Hollywood remakes.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I quite enjoyed the movie. I would label it a \u201cyoung adult\u201d movie. Not only because the lead characters as well as almost the entire cast are teenagers but the story itself is clearly at a level directed towards a younger audience. But then, who do not wish they were young again? I quite liked the story. It clearly had its usual collection of illogical moments and plot holes but nothing really really annoying as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion all of the cast did a decent enough job of their roles. Some roles mostly consisted of standing around in the background of course but the lead characters was not bad. Teresa was more of a plot element than a lead character in this movie though that has to be said.\r\n\r\nI did indeed like the maze itself. It had a quite cool look and was well done from a cinematic point of view. The one thing that did not come out in the movie though was the reason for it all. I know that is supposed to be the mystery but it was rather frustrating nonetheless to not get any clues whatsoever. What on Earth could be the purpose of having a bunch of kids live through this experience in that way?\r\n\r\nSometimes the behavior of these kids where somewhat annoying of course. I especially disliked the plot element where that dumbass kid seemed to just want everything to stay the same forever. It is of course a classical element in stories like this but it still annoys the hell out of me every time.\r\n\r\nBottom line is still that I found this a rather enjoyable movie. I would definitely want to see the other two books made into movies as well. I have not read the books by the way so me thinking this was a new story experience is of course partly due to this fact.\r\n\r\nSHARE THIS:","id":"5a3d1dbac3a368148f0acd87","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a3d1dbac3a368148f0acd87","movie_id":198663}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"For me this was a very entertaining vigilante flick. Denzel Washington is excellent in his role as a cold and calculating yet compassionate vigilante. The movie is slower than a lot of movies in this genre but that does not make it boring and when the action starts it is measured (for a movie in this genre) and well done.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is a red thread, started by McCall\u2019s first act of vigilantism, running through the movie he also performs a few on the side jobs as well during the movie. I like the vigilante stuff so for me this was some nice fillers to round off the movie.\r\n\r\nThe main thread pitches McCall against a real psychopathic Russian enforcer. No one can say that this movie did not have a well done bad guy. The role is quite well played. The guy is creepy to say the least. Not to mention violent of course but then so is McCall when the time is right.\r\n\r\nOne thing I liked with this movie is that McCall it is not one of the usual run around, look dangerous and clobber the bad guys in periodic outbursts of violence stereotypes. McCall is always calm, calculating, behaving intelligently and the baddies almost never realizes the mistake they just did until it is quite a bit too late.\r\n\r\nSure, the capacity of McCall to clobber the bad guys, usually without getting hurt himself, is bordering on superhuman but what the heck, it is fiction after all. Totally realistic movies are rarely fun, at least not movies of this genre. Also, the end fight where the baddies are more or less running around aimlessly and get taken out could have been better. Especially since the Russian mobster had shown quite a bit of intelligence up until that point. Having said that, I did like that it did not degenerate into the usual 20 minute shoot anything that moves nonsense. McCall is continuing his cold and calculating rampage through the unfortunate individuals on the wrong side and the various ways of disposing of them are rather creative.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I found this to be a rather entertaining movie. In one sense it is the usual vigilante stuff, which I happen to like, but in one sense it is not your normal run of the mill vigilante movie thanks to Denzel Washington\u2019s cold, calculating and intelligent portrayal of McCall.","id":"5af47d740e0a263a770000fe","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5af47d740e0a263a770000fe","movie_id":156022}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A failed high school romance and one more chance to fix it in the later years.**\r\n\r\nBased on one of the Nicholas Sparks book of the same name. The story of a failed high school romance who meet again later in their lives. But the flashback comes right away after the initial segment to reveal theirs young romance and what made them part away. Between the present and the past, it keeps up the momentum and concludes the tale with a twist. Though you would know mile away what's coming.\r\n\r\nI did not like all the films based on the stories from the original author. But this one looked okay to me, not so good or too bad. All his films are romance theme, but in this film, that part was very weak. I did not expect that, particularly emotionless when compared to his other flicks. Still, the filmmaking was decent, with the good actors. But the casting was confusing at the beginning for having two sets of actors and then soon it cleared out all the doubts.\r\n\r\nKind of supernatural theme, but not a fantasy. Feels a bit long, because the story developments were slow and most of the parts are not interesting. This is not a romance film I was looking for, but different where everything was dragged to the final twist, especially since the accident that happened at the opening. I did not watch it till now, because I did not feel I wanted to after watching its trailer. But I knew some day I would see it and that is now.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Three crazy women for five weeks is a lot more than I bargained for. \r\n\r\nThe Homesman is directed by Tommy Lee Jones, who also co-adapts the screenplay from Glendon Swarthout's novel with Kieran Fitzgerald and Wesley A. Oliver. It stars Jones, Hilary Swank, Grace Gummer, Miranda Otto and Sonja Richter. Music is by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto. \r\n\r\nThree women who have been driven mad by pioneer life are to be transported East across the country to Iowa. When the men of the town refuse to stand up and be counted, single, pious and independent-minded Mary Bee Cuddy (Swank), enrols for the task. Recruiting scallywag drifter George Briggs (Jones) to aid the journey, it becomes an arduous journey that will make or break both of them. \r\n\r\nThe Homesman is a tricky Western, revisionist of heart and blood, and grim in nature, it's got a narrative that has (and will continue to do so) invited criticism from different quarters. It has been called misogynistic on one side of the fence, and feminist on the other! While there is a humongous narrative jump that has been lauded as great from some, and a film killer by others. The truth is that only each viewer can judge from their own personal perspectives. Personally I think that Jones has blended both the former angles to perfection, whilst the latter issue is to me an outstanding and brave piece of film. \r\n\r\nThe life of the pioneer women is shatteringly brought into sharp focus, right from the off there's brutality blended with utter sadness as Jones the director cuts no corners in setting up the film. Big question then hits us in the face - just how did the Old West deal with those suffering mental disturbance? In this instance it's to pack them off to the East where they will be tended by a minister and his wife (the latter of which played by Meryl Streep in little more than a cameo). The three women are vividly portrayed by Otto, Gummer and Richter, but this aspect of the film is only a side-bar to the crux of the story. \r\n\r\nThis is of course about Mary Cuddy and George Briggs, a man and woman at total different ends of the spectrum. She's sad at being alone without a man, he's more than happy to be without a woman. Everything suggests that this is going to be \"one of those films\" where opposites find a soul mate, but Jones and his backers may not be reverting to type? I mean for a start how interesting to find this journey going from West to East, that says much about the film right there, a pioneer journey in reverse. While the prominent ladies here may be mad, abused or needy, you will be searching far and wide for a decent man in this here tale.\r\n\r\nThe landscapes are deftly photographed by Prieto, eye opening but never to the detriment of the narrative thrust of pioneer hardship. Betrami lays ethereal piano and string arrangements all over the piece, while joining Streep in short bursts of cameo characterisations are James Spader, John Lithgow, William Fitchner, Hailee Steinfeld and Tim Blake Nelson, that's quite an armoury of performers. Even if you can't help but want more from them all. \r\n\r\nBut it's Swank and Jones, a superb pairing, who give the grade \"A\" performances. Jones lifts his old cantankerous ruffian character to greater heights, making Briggs the anti-hero to the anti-hero. While Swank hasn't been this great for a long time, making Mary Cuddy strong and inspiring, yet also evidently suffering inner turmoil. Swank's turn epitomises The Homesman, shrewd and insightful, humane and heartfelt. Top stuff all round, it's great to see modern directors confident enough to make biting moody Westerns. 9\/10","id":"56dc46519251413e2a001c62","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56dc46519251413e2a001c62","movie_id":264656}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A unique way to let go of your marriage problems!\r\n\r\nThis is a slow start, but the second half makes it worth a watch. You better know nothing about the film, just have it and enjoy your time. Because that was the case for me and then I found it a good one. I don't know this director, but Mark Duplass was doing such kind of unique concept small films. So there's no surprise, except I did know I would end up liking it very much.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the film theme, kind of resembles 'Coherence'. The whole film revolves around a married couple, except in the beginning. So it is a minimal cast film that is set in a remote place villa. As their therapist's instruction a couple who are on the edge of losing their marriage, tries a weekend getaway to patch the differences. But end up encountering the strange events that pleases them more than what they've expected. When they begin to realise the reality, comes the trouble to fix it once for all.\r\n\r\nThe third act was amazing. The pace keeps getting better and the tension in the story simply creates enough curiosity about the ending. But the conclusion was very basic and guessable. I liked the honest than too much fancy. Still the viewers look for the answers regarding how it ended which is kind of a wide open for the discussions.\r\n\r\nI love modern sci-fi dramas, especially in the last one decade, I have been enjoying them a lot, which are highly intelligent yet casually narrated on the screen that anybody can understand easily. If you had liked films such as 'Coherence', 'Another Earth', 'Her', 'Melanchony' et cetera, then surely would have a good time with it.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"57603571c3a3686cce000b72","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57603571c3a3686cce000b72","movie_id":242090}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"There are many kind of monsters in the world.\r\n\r\nThe Keeping Room is directed by Daniel Barber and written by Julia Hart. It stars Brit Marling, Hailee Steinfeld, Muna Otaru, Sam Worthington and Kyle Soller. Music is by Martin Phipp and cinematography by Martin Ruhe.\r\n\r\nIt's the back end of the American Civil War and 3 women fight to defend their home from 2 Union Army \"Bummers\"...\r\n\r\nUncle Billy is coming!\r\n\r\nAs genres go, the Western (Re: Southerns - Civil Wars) are primarily male dominated, but just occasionally female led pictures from this ilk come forth to shine bright. It's refreshing that in this modern era of film making, genre film makers are not afraid to pitch the female angle to remind all that women had a key part in the shaping of the frontiers all those years ago. Or as is the case here, they were not merely token fodder, but often women of strength prepared to take up the fight to protect themselves when under duress.\r\n\r\nDaniel Barber and Julia Hart have crafted a magnetic piece, that aside from a daft misstep at pic's finale booms with feminist wiles. Opening with a burst of shocking violence and sexual assault inference, this is merely an attention grabbing appertiser as the pic then settles into a languid realm. The makers are in no hurry here, those expecting an action fuelled piece are in for great disappointment. Not to say further jolts to the system are not forthcoming, they exist and are truly throat grabbing, but tone is set at earthy realism, the sparse locations sidling up nicely with the lives of the women functioning while their loved ones are lost to the war that rages on the edge of the frame.\r\n\r\nPerformances are top end, the girls superb, the boys frighteningly on the boil for the dark side that the war would bore out. As for the look as per tech credits? With the pic being shot in Romania it is natural to approach this thinking it will lack for period flavours, yet it very much does come up trumps there. Anyone familiar with the Barber and Ruhe collaboration Harry Brown 2009, and liked its aesthetical look, will appreciate the craft on show here, more so as Phipps' musical score compliments like some sort of edgy spectre. Barber has an eye for stunning shots, here with such things as a burning carriage in flight post crime committed, or our heroine on white horse in flight through a lonely tree laden pathway, there is beauty here in a world containing monsters.\r\n\r\n*SPOILER* \r\n\r\nResolution of the play is frustrating and rewarding in equal measure, the women strong and correctly earning our admiration - that they have to dress as men to escape the horrors of war just doesn't strike the right chord in a play with such a strong feminine bent - but that could just be me being picky...\r\n\r\nNot one for those lacking patience, or misogynistic geezers who expect women in Westerns to be token fodder or punch bags, The Keeping Room has much to offer genre fans embracing this sort of story telling as a whole. 8\/10","id":"5b5dc1170e0a262e9802a590","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b5dc1170e0a262e9802a590","movie_id":284284}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Twins and their failures, depression, suicide attempt, together overcoming.\r\n\r\nAfter the beautiful 'Hateship Loveship', I expected this one for Kristen Wiig. It was a brother-sister relationship theme. The main characters are twins and they have lots of common. The story begins when they meet for the first time after the ten years of no connection. The circumstance was strange as they both were depressed who attempt for a self kill. That does not end successfully, instead narration commence for us where they share each others memory of the past by trying to shape up the present life. But still the old habits won't let them alone as they encounter life changing decisions by the end of the story.\r\n\r\nKind of a rare movie, all about the twins' bonding told in a humourous way, mostly. Mistakes are the essence of the script. The fall and rise were cleverly constructed throughout around those two characters. The cast was the plus point. Since it was about twins, Wiig and Hader are perfectly fit for their respective roles. As for Bill Hader, I've never seen he donned in a higher ranked role like this. He was always been a co-star and in this film he's one of the leads. Everybody gets their time right like awesome Timothy Spall in 'Mr. Turner'.\r\n\r\nIn this movie, these two lead performers were absolutely spot on. But the lack of pace is a challenge. If you pass through it successfully, you would get a nice entertainment. If not, the movie would be dull, pale, even it could be worse film of the year for you. Anyway, still it falls short to be an excellent film, I consider it to be a just good movie. Worth a watch, but the movie won't stay in your memory for so long.\r\n\r\n6.5\/10","id":"55de0e939251411c3e000245","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55de0e939251411c3e000245","movie_id":244772}
{"author":"Reno","content":"I don't know where to begin, this movie was unexpected. It was a multi layered tale, somewhat all characters were connected, but all the story centers around the same theme and that is sexual fantasies. What happens when mismatch in desire get together for life. Counselling is the part of recovery nowadays, but everything lies in the effort that put on the practical side. So this movie takes such a wonderful journey with one less than half a dozen of pairs rides towards seeking solutions and answers for their wish. But the thing is, like the most of the movie's punchline say 'how far would you go for it?' is the movie that reveals to us.\r\n\r\nIt was a brilliantly written for the screen and so the actors, who did their parts impeccably. The narration was so distinct in each tale and also had very good twists before the wrap up. It was a better movie than most of the sex comedies that we got fooled for its promotions. I won't surprise if Hollywood or other film industry remake it. Why do we need to read 'Kama Sutra' while this movie is out there. Definitely there won't be a better movie for adults to enjoy whole heartily, especially not recently as I'm aware. Finally, without minors around, but for ourself to have a great time. Don't think it is a build-up because it delivers a good entertainment with lots of 'laugh out lauds'.\r\n\r\n''Also, I'm required by federal law to inform you that I am a convicted sex offender.''\r\n\r\nHonest, brave, funny, lust, awkward, the story adds up in a variety of things except there is no true spice like really spicy. Because its want to tickle you than taking up everything seriously. That's why the movie clicked very well, even though the story leaps were very tight because of the many layers to cover. All the five tales ends in (around) three random displays of the acts. The first one for the intro, then where the problem arises and ends with the solutions and twists.\r\n\r\nI would love to have part 2, not the follow up because I want new sex related words from its dictionary with freshened pairs. The 'phone sex' part was everyone's favourite. Its the talk of the movie related blog, reviews, database, IRC and apps, and I as well loved it. That does not mean other characters and stories are weaker than this one. The 'rape', 'role play' and others are all so good too. Different viewers enjoy different type, that is according to close to their sex fantasies from one of these, I believe. So are you ready for 'the little death'?.","id":"55185b11c3a3681552001114","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55185b11c3a3681552001114","movie_id":276844}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer was instrumental in delivering one of the most harrowing and heart-breaking documentaries in 2013\u2019s The Act of Killing. As an impressive result of the critically acclaimed documentarian\u2019s  gut-wrenching narrative, The Act of Killing deservedly earned an Academy Award nomination for its unsettling truth and revelation.  Killing concentrated on the frightening accounts involving the 1965 Indonesian genocide of over one million slaughtered people earmarked with \u201ccommunist\u201d labeling. \r\n\r\nWell Oppenheimer \u2018s The Act of Killing astutely offers a charged follow-up to this tremendous tragic tale with the revealing and devastatingly  insightful The Look of Silence. The sentimental cynicism is pretty much as unbelievable and incredulous as previously uncovered in Killing. This time, however, Oppenheimer does not focus on the mass destruction of imperiled human beings whose victimization can be traced to the Indonesian government. Instead, he approaches the subject matter on a more personalized, individual level as he emphasizes one specific casualty\u2014the late Ramli Rukun and his family left to ponder the senseless loss of life and love.  \r\n\r\nThe Look of Silence is one of those rare observational sequel -minded documentaries demonstrating a genuine psychological impact despite originally making its familiar mark in the first installment.  Anytime the showcasing of jeopardized humanity is profiled it is always an automatic cause to feel enraged and emotionally invested in the outrageous aftermath of the storm. Well Oppenheimer revisits the pain, resentment and frustration in The Look of Silence with convincing empowerment.\r\n\r\nIn The Look of Silence, Oppenheimer explores the regrets and quiet rage in the aftermath of Ramli\u2019s sadistic murder and gives undivided attention to the deceased victim\u2019s ophthalmologist brother Adi. Adi, not born yet when his brother Ramli suffers at the sinister hands of his executioners five decades ago, undergoes a tactical mission to approach his departed sibling\u2019s tormentors through eye exam visitations. If anything, Adi learns of the pride his brother\u2019s butchers took in claiming his life. More shocking is the fact that these now old-time killers are revered as heroes and have the audacity to live among the common folks whom they probably would have eradicated in their heyday back in the mid 60\u2019s.\r\n\r\nNaturally, silence is golden and in spite of the unshakable atrocities perpetrated on the million people that were sacrificed in the name of sanctioned governmental scrutiny it was expected that survivors and other citizens hold their tongues and simply go with the flow. This is why Adi\u2019s unassuming confrontation of Ramli\u2019s killers feels so radical because he dared to face the menacing messengers of evil through the guise of eyesight testing. For Adi to demand the truth and literally and figuratively see through the ruthless eyes of icy murderers that wear their deadly shame with honor is indeed quite unimaginable and challenging.\r\n\r\nIn questioning the matured monsters\u2019 motivation for silencing the countless sufferers they actually treasured in partaking in the nostalgic nihilism, Adi unravels the murderous mystery while witnessing the twisted joy of reminiscences that these pathetic patients of his puts forth. The question remains: did Adi really accomplish anything in his quest to unearth the horrific stories behind his brother\u2019s demise and that of other unfortunate souls lost in such national man-made destruction? Sadly, there seems to be no remorse or recourse for retaliation concerning the broken hearts of those that perished in such hopelessness. \r\n\r\nOppenheimer does his share of showing some inquisitive fortitude as well.  For instance, his interaction with Ramli\u2019s severely aging parents tells of the everlasting bitterness and disgust they still maintain for a country that has turned a blind eye to the historical horror show for which their beloved son paid a hefty price. It does not help the cause that they live in the shadows of such criminal proportions that their unapologetic nation refused to repudiate with political sorrow. Also, Oppenheimer manages to confront Ramli\u2019s actual killers and curiously they revel in glee as they recall fondly the termination of an individual that meant nothing more to them then a routine contracted killing--an eye on the prize if you will.\r\n\r\nAbsorbingly compelling and contemplative, The Look of Silence proves one thing that the act of repentance is not on any given eye chart of those powerfully ominous societal misfits vehemently refusing to visualize the ugliness of inhumanity even through a redemptive set of fresh new lenses.\r\n\r\nTHE LOOK OF SILENCE (2015)\r\n\r\nDrafthouse Films\r\n\r\nWritten and Directed by: Joshua Oppenheimer\r\n\r\n1 hr. 43 mins.\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Documentary\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s Rating: *** \u00bd stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n--Frank Ochieng","id":"562473fd9251417f4700dd4b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/562473fd9251417f4700dd4b","movie_id":267480}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Spider-Man stuffed once again.\r\n\r\nMarc Webb returns to direct what Sony had hoped was the second instalment of a longer running reboot of the Spider-Man franchise. Writing this now, I'm armed with the knowledge that once again the web slinger will get another reboot in 2017, which after viewing this sequel comes as no surprise.\r\n\r\nIt's not so much that it's a bad film, or a bad Spider-Man film at that, it's just that it feels all very familiar, whilst simultaneously hugging the same pitfalls as Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3. Webb tries to juggle a screenplay with 3 villains (well two and a half really), a tricky romance between Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), and of course there's school, a best friend and affairs of the home heart to deal with.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Electro (Jamie Foxx) is a good move, inputting a new villain into the spidey world is most welcome. Yet in spite of Foxx earning some level of sympathy with the characterisation, it never really works and unfortunately draws comparisons with a certain Mr. Freeze from another franchise. Dane DeHaan comes in as Harry Osborn, soon to be Green Goblin, again the tortured soul act is well performed, but come Goblin time the make up and effects work is laughable. While Paul Giamati as Aleksei Sytsevich - cum - Rhino, is having fun but is barely in the picture.\r\n\r\nStone is the best thing in it by far, while Garfield works hard, but there is no getting away from the fact that they both are - and look - too old for their parts. The action is fun and pulse raising, but there's not enough of it to sustain a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes. Though on the plus side Webb and his team are to be applauded for choosing a story line that is ultimately bold and contains a great emotional whack. All told it's a shaky entry to the spidey world, one that once again forced Sony into another rethink. Lets hope the next journey spidey goes on has some clarity and streamlined sense. 6\/10","id":"560456a5c3a368552b005d80","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/560456a5c3a368552b005d80","movie_id":102382}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Something positive to focus on.\r\n\r\nIt is considered as one of the best Kiwi films ever. Inspired by a real person with the severe bipolar disorder. The story centres on the character Genesis Potini, a chess prodigy. Despite his mental issue, he forms a chess club called the Eastern Knights where the underprivileged kids are trained. The film follows his own struggle, as well as his fight for other Maori descent youngsters not to fall prey for the wrong paths. In that perspective, it was very well told tale.\r\n\r\nIt is not another 'Once Were Warriors', but it had its moments. Especially the Maori people with their struggle between the good life and bad life was boldly revealed. Honestly, I did not enjoy much, but won't deny it is a nice film with a good message. I'm happy that I picked it, except I'm not the audience for it. Because the large portion of the film remained dull due to the 2 hour long stretch. I would have been very happy if it was around a 90 minute narration.\r\n\r\nSo the actors were the plus point. Some of them had no prior experience, but did well and was recognised widely. Whatever it is, Cliff Curtis is the man of the film. He won a couple of International awards for the role he played. Like I said the first half was boring, but once the chess theme come into play, the scenario changes and lots of good things happens. I feel it is an inspiring film at a different level. Worth a watch, but it is not a very cheerful screenplay. So I don't think everybody would end up happy, despite a very interesting theme.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"57a3718c9251410d2c003005","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57a3718c9251410d2c003005","movie_id":276496}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Easy to love other culture, but proving it isn't.**\r\n\r\nIt's very common in the western films about interracial romance, mainly because it's happening and that's how the societies are made, particularly the North America. And it's not same when you seek similar themed films from the east. It is a less explored concept as far I know. Even this one is a Belgium film that entirely takes place in Japan.\r\n\r\nI like this kind of film. It helps to realise what are all kinds of complications we could face in the same situation. In fact, I'm too a Japanophile, as well as Francophile. So this film is both of them. It's a cross culture, but fun to experience, especially if you adore that culture as much as your own life.\r\n\r\nThis film was about a young Belgian woman named Amelie, who actually was born in Japan, but later in her childhood she had returned to native along with her parents. Now in her 20s, she came back for the love she has for Japan. The first thing she does was advertising about her private French tutorial. Then she gets a student, a young Japanese fellow who already somewhat knows the language. They roam the city, experience the culture and society, and picks up the words, which is translated to French as part of learning\/teaching.\r\n\r\nAs expected, they fall in love and that's where the trouble arises. Because it's not America, where a Japanese man and a French woman has no complications, particularly culturally. But here the cultural significance stands between them. The language of romance is universal, but how to express it in behaviour is a series of obstacle.\r\n\r\nAmelie loves everything about Japan, even she climbs Mr Fuji to be a true Japanese and it helps her to rediscover herself in the tough time. Yet she finds a little hard to adapt the way of Japanese lifestyle. Possibly in every single thing. From raw food to falling in love, meeting her future in-laws, getting engaged and all.\r\n\r\n> \u275dA real Japanese has to climb Mt Fuji.\u275e\r\n\r\nI thought the film would be in the line of 'My Darling is a Foreigner', but it was like 'Am\u00e9lie' and 'Citizen Dog'. It's more a girlish kind of film, but can be enjoyed by all category adult audiences. The character Amelie is similar to those two titles from the above I mention. You will like her, probably fall for her. The film looks beautiful mainly because of her, the actress who played it was the backbone of the film. When everything was going quite nicely, then all the sudden an unexpected conclusion emerges. I really did not like it.\r\n\r\nMy first reaction was, how could possibly they ruin this beautiful film with such a bad end. I thought the writer failed to come up with something to make a better climax. I was disappointed with the finale, but my stance changed when I learnt it was a biopic, which I did not know earlier. Yep the film was based on the autobiographical book of the same name.\r\n\r\nThe story sets in around the time Fukushima nuclear disaster, but the problem is the dates does not match, as the book came years earlier. Anyway, that event has a big influence to this tale to wrap up. So when a film is based on the real, I like as it is than any alteration. From the outside, it looks like 'Before Sunrise', but there are lots of differences.\r\n\r\nWhat this film teaches us is, it's easy to love other cultures, but proving isn't. There should be lots of sacrifices to be made, especially if is a relationship, not love found in the culture as an individual person. The film was very enjoyable. You can learn many things about Japan through the film.\r\n\r\nThe casting was excellent and so the locations. Probably a bit underrated film, as well as not recognised widely. Those who saw it, considering it from the entertainment perspective, but most them are not aware that it was inspired by the real. I think it is worth a watch, especially if you love Japan and its culture, definitely not to be missed.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58c1eade92514104f70000b9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c1eade92514104f70000b9","movie_id":287509}

On the other hand, he's getting ready for the grand wedding with a reality star. But one day decides to give an interview for a journalist.

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Ardent followers of iconoclastic Japanese filmmaker Sion Sono will certainly rejoice in the continued surrealistic cinema that erratically meshes a combustion of various themes and genres thus generating a spicy spectacle of action-oriented exuberance. Sono, known for such colorful feisty-minded fare such as Guilty of Romance and Suicide Circle will have one scratching their bewildered noggins trying the grasp the latest twisted tale of sexual and violent gumption in the wildly impish and imaginative gang-bang musical street-tug-of-war crime caper Tokyo Tribe.  Outwardly frivolous, frenetic and fueled with a bizarre combination of opulence and outlandishness, Tokyo Tribe will indeed stimulate the senses with its hodge-podge of hedonistic heft in the realm of instantaneous insanity. \r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Sono's turbulent and tactical offering in Tokyo Tribe is a devoted salute to the memorable gang movies and notable musicals that have graced moviegoers' consciousness throughout the decades of cinema in general. The homage to the influences that Tokyo Tribe festively borrows from is delightfully thrown in one's exhaustive face in gaudy, grand fashion. From obvious gangster tributes to rousing gems such as A Clockwork Orange, Scarface, Ichi the Killer and The Warriors to finger-snapping sing-alongs that include West Side Story and Moulin Rouge, Sono's melodic meltdown of fists, firepower and fury is a serving of potent street turf stew ready to be sampled with sensory overload. Clearly, Tokyo Tribe is proudly off-balanced and curiously unstructured to the point that the free-for-all bombastic action and strife is celebrated with indescribable excitement.\r\n\r\nSono's crime and fantasy landscape of a dystopian Tokyo gone up for grabs in clashing ecstasy leaves some wondering if the overwhelming elements of its boisterous flavored parts are truly worth the powder keg production as a whole. Well, Tokyo Tribe dutifully captures the haunting and high-spirited wrath of its yakuza-style boiling point. Although at times seemingly uneven and over-indulgent in its zest for collaborative craziness, Tribe does manage to wink at its super-charged exploitation with a dynamic giddiness that wryly registers. Saddled with sadistic criminal gang-bangers, hip hop-induced tunes piercing through the film's booming soundtrack and skin-clad beauties for the hormones to race aimlessly at will, Tokyo Tribe is both caustic and cockeyed while reveling in its need for the featured Japanese rap musicians to convey a sense of creative yet corrosive urgency in the showcased horror of the furious Far East streets of mayhem. \r\n\r\nThere is something that can be said for Sono's energetic direction of a gun-toting narrative that could easily be dismissed as overblown and pretentiously shocking. This, however, is actually the appeal to Tokyo Tribe because it is willing to be unconventional, unnerving and unapologetic for its pumped-up presentation of wayward will and war on the mean streets and alleyways as carried out by larger-than-life machete-swinging merchants whose taste for blood is undeniable. Sono's frenzied fable of street-minded violators with a code for chaos and conflict is what feverishly steers Tokyo Tribe into a grinding and gritty guilty pleasure of a crime story peppered with dream-like delusion and confusion. Granted that Tokyo Tribe is not as high-minded or observant as Sono's moving The Land of Hope. Still, Tribe feels joyously experimental as a volt-oriented vehicle with reckless promise and panache.\r\n\r\nThe premise is set as twenty-three gangs are vying for ultimate control of the targeted tough streets in futuristic Tokyo in what appears to be a fierce face-off for the ages. Naturally, these gangs (or \"tribes\" as they are deemed) look to make their presence known within Japan's vulnerable capital city. In particular, the overbearing and menacing overlord Bubba (Rika Takeuchi) envisions taking over the entire region and having dominance over the other crime lords and their minions. The ruthless Bubba means business as he wants the existing tribes at his feet of mercy. Hence, Bubba calls for an all-out war in an attempt to challenge his equally evil-minded rivals. \r\n\r\nOf course when Bubba and his underlings (including his son) are not trying to take over the Tokyo street operations they look to hook the attention of pretty and prestigious Sunmi (Nana Seino). The jeopardized Sunmi just happens to be the daughter of a prominent local bigshot in the community. Nothing says complete triumph to Bubba and his backers should Sumni succumb to his personal needs within his felonious organization. Soon, the realization comes into focus--the rivals all over Tokyo must come in unison to stop the diabolical Bubba from becoming the master manipulator and prevent him for furthering any power hunger proclivities. \r\n\r\nSurely the audience will find themselves surrendering to the various devious angles that Tokyo Tribes turns its tricks towards in spontaneous, off-kilter fashion. Over-the-top characterizations, animated violent sequences, fleshy females, combative confrontations, flashy choreographed movements, the aforementioned inclusion of some well-known Japanese rap artists, dizzying colorized overtones, provocative wardrobes, both silly-minded and stirring gang-style antics--all are assembled with weary finesse that propels Tokyo Tribe as an overactive romp that knows its role all too well. And what role is that one might ask? Perhaps to be an entertainingly odd and ludicrous genre flick that acts as an unsettling messenger for our indiscriminate preferences in cinematic mob mentalities and musical musings. \r\n\r\nTokyo Tribe (2014)\r\n\r\n\r\n1 hr. 57 mins.\r\n\r\n\r\nStarring: Young Dais, Ryouhei Suzuki, Nana Seino, Shota Sometani, Riki Takeuchi\r\n\r\n\r\nDirected by: Sion Sono\r\n\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\n\r\nGenre: Gang-Related Fantasy and Suspense\/Crime and Drama\/Action and Adventure\r\n\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: ** 1\/2 stars (out of 4 stars) \r\n\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng (2015)","id":"56368ea0c3a3681b5201b0a8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56368ea0c3a3681b5201b0a8","movie_id":240566}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"For being a Hollywood attempt at ancient, non-American, drama this is a decent enough piece of entertainment. Unfortunately, as is too often the case when Hollywood tries to make these kind of movies these days, it is also underdeveloped, shallow and somewhat cheesy.\r\n\r\nThe movie have a decent enough cast and I have to say that their performances are generally good. At least as good as the script allows for. The story is pretty straightforward. Young slave is forced to become a gladiator and he is good at it. Beautiful woman enters the scene and Amor gets to work. Bad guy enters the scene and does what bad guys usually does to screw things up. It is a simple story which allows much freedom and which of course is spiced up quite a lot by being set against the backdrop of an exploding volcano.\r\n\r\nHowever, the movie could have done a lot more with the story. Even though the special effects are miles more advanced than movies like Ben-Hur with Charlton Heston or works by Cecil B. DeMille it somehow fails to achieve the same impression of awe and grandeur. If you cut out the volcano a lot of the scenes felt just ordinary somehow.\r\n\r\nWell, it is still a decent enough piece of entertainment. I quite liked the character of Atticus and the gladiator parts are not bad. Some of the volcano effects are reasonably impressive as well. However, why is it that Hollywood producers and directors totally lack any form of knowledge of the subjects they use in their movies? You take an exploding volcano, which in itself should be enough, and then all of a sudden you throw in a tsunami wave which movies towards the volcano. What the f\u2026? That is just so ignorant. I do not expect historical accuracy of a movie like this but Christ, you do not have to slap the faces of the thinking part of the audience like this. The scenes where the ships were coming floating through the streets of Pompeii was also the worst special effects of the movie, regardless of the ridiculousness of the entire tsunami thing.\r\n\r\nThe end? Well, anyone who has read a few of my reviews knows that I am a sucker for happy endings so you can probably guess that I am not overly happy about this one. I guess one have to say that, at least, it was realistic though given that, once the eruption had started, there would be little way to get away from the volcano by any means available at that time.","id":"53afbdccc3a3682eee004841","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53afbdccc3a3682eee004841","movie_id":76649}

Because he hasn't done any films lately since 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' critically failed. His role was awesome, but a struggling young single father. When he loses his inherited family house to the bank, he has no choice but to make a quick decision that can secure his family a roof over the head. But when the things get ugly, the new issues begin to appear, and with a narrow chance he tries to fix it.\r\n\r\nAnother excellent character in the movie that played by Michael Shannon. Not like you know this story very well, and wonderfully narrated story on the screen about what a desperate man can do with his small opportunity to rise again.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"In this age of hyper editing and ramping shots, SU Arunkumar's Pannaiyarum Padminiyum shows that there is still room for languid storytelling; that, lingering on a scene for long doesn't always get the audience restless. In fact, the film itself has just a single hook \u2014 the love a few characters have for a car \u2014 and every scene that unspools on screen is a reiteration of this one theme. And, yet, the film is always charming!\r\n\r\nA genial landlord (the unnamed Pannaiyar in the film) is captivated by a Padmini car the moment he lays his eyes on it. This car belongs to his friend and circumstances force him to leave the car in the Pannaiyar's hands. The Pannaiyar is thrilled that he gets to be the de facto owner of the car for some time (even though he doesn't know how to drive it) and so are his villagers. And that is where Murugesan enters. He is a tractor driver (who races \u2014 and loses \u2014 to kids on bicycles) but becomes the designated driver for the car and soon, the car becomes a cherished thing for everyone in the village, turning into an all-purpose vehicle. It becomes an ambulance of sorts when a person is bitten by a snake, is used to relocate a dead man, and even takes stranded passengers when the local mini bus breaks down. But, for the Pannaiyar, his wife Chellamma and Murugesan, it is a beloved family member. So, when it is taken from them, their world becomes colourless and only the car's return will bring back joy.\r\n\r\nExpanding his much-loved short film into a full-length feature, Arunkumar shows that he is a capable storyteller. He takes his time spinning his yarn but there is an assuredness in the telling that keeps you hooked. The film is filled with lovely moments (Gokul Benoy's burnished frames and Justin Prabhakar's soothing score only enhances the effect) and interesting characters, right from the Pannaiyar himself. He is a landlord, yes, and is always the person to introduce newer things in the village \u2014 including a toilet! In a montage to set up the character, the director shows the villagers looking in awe at the squat toilet, even as the Pannaiyar gets in to take a dump, and at that moment, sets the lighthearted tone of the film. And, Jayaprakash plays this character not as a privileged man but as a nice man who happens to be rich. His easygoing relationship with his wife Chellamma (an equally good Thulasi) is a delightful take on salt-and-pepper romance and fittingly, this duo gets the film's most romantic song, Unakkaga Poranthene. Vijay Sethupathi nails the little shades in Murugesan's character \u2014 he is fond of the Pannaiyar and the car but he gets insecure when the Pannaiyar wants to learn driving, and so, even tries to stop him from pursuing it. Then, there is Peruchali aka Peedai, the house-help, who bestows ill luck on anyone he wishes well and the role should be a breakthrough for Balasaravanan, who fits the part of comic sidekick pretty well.\r\n\r\nTrue, there are a few problems, and foremost is the length of the film. Yes, the storytelling has to be languid for this material, but the film is overlong by 15-20 minutes (the editing is by Sreekar Prasad) and even though things never turn dull, we, at times, get the feeling of going round in circles. The romance between Murugesan and Malar is perfunctory, probably included because the character is played by Vijay Sethupathi, and a hero needs a heroine in Tamil cinema \u2014 even if she is missing for large parts of the film. The character of the Pannaiyar's daughter (she is played by TV's Neelima Rani) is somewhat of a caricature, and we wonder how this sole character could be negative in a film brimming with positive characters (even the driver and conductor of the mini bus, who often indulge in a game of one-upmanship with Murugesan are shown as competitive but good-natured fellows). Did her father's benevolence and amiability towards everyone turn her into a needy, self-centred person? At least, with her (non-speaking) husband, we get that the character is there only for laughs. And, the framing device that Arunkumar uses to tell his story \u2014 a young man (Atta Kathi Dinesh) who has bought a car of his own looking back on the car ride that remains an unfulfilled dream (he is shown as a young boy who tries hard to save five rupees, with which he could ride in the front seat) \u2014 doesn't really carry any emotional heft.\r\n\r\nAnd, yet, when we exit the theatre, what we fondly look back upon are the genuinely feel-good moments that make the film irresistible.","id":"53bb18270e0a261971000260","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bb18270e0a261971000260","movie_id":251636}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**With this 'Searching for Bobby Fischer' is over for me.**\r\n\r\nI know Bobby Fischer a genius American chess player, in fact, after watching the 'Searching for Bobby Fischer', which is another biopic as this one. Other than that I know nothing about his life, so I'm very thankful for this film. From the director of many sensational flicks comes this to inspire you. Wait, did I say inspire, but I'm little confused over how this film to be considered. Bobby Fischer was a great player, but he had some mental issues. So you can compare him to John Nash from 'A Beautiful Mind', except they're from different fields, but very intelligents.\r\n\r\nThis film was a little patriotic abut the American nation, especially defeating the Russians in the chess game. So I'm being neutral here. Bobby was the one to focus how he makes his life big with the game that requires a brain. The story began with short span of childhood and then soon skipped to adult Bobby Fischer competing in a biggest tournament in the world, a championship against the best. Nicely filmed with lots of exciting scenes, particularly Tobey Maguire as the main lead was brilliant. Liev Schreiber was another surprise with his frequent on and off role.\r\n\r\nGood film, but feels it is not complete, there should have more to it and like I said earlier, it has impacted, but not inspiring way which is why I'm doubting the screenplay. A man like him and a film about him should have nominated for several international awards, including the Golden Globe and the Oscars. Sadly, it failed at the box office, as well as to get recognised at the film festival circuits. Still, it got praised, looks not for the artistic work, but as the compensation. If you watch it, you will know there's something wrong, otherwise a film like this won't go unnoticed. I hope someone else makes another film about him in a grand way. Meanwhile, it is a good watch, but what do you expect from the Bobby Fischer like his game or personal issues will decide how much you liked it.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"57ed859ec3a3686d050002de","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ed859ec3a3686d050002de","movie_id":245698}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A hope of flight to begin life again in the sorrow.\r\n\r\nSometimes we wanted to like the movie, because it was inspiring, family friendly, great cast, performances and so on, but something stops you. Not because of hatred, but the other end of the dislike, i.e., too much tenderness and packed with full of cliches. This Aussie film was one those, a very good concept and I would definitely recommend it, especially for children and families, but seemed everything was plain with no surprises.\r\n\r\nPartially based on the real events. A young boy named Dylan who lives in Perth, the Western Australia with his dad discovers his skills on the paper plane making and launching. Soon begins to focus it on the professional level by aiming for the junior level competition to represent his country in the upcoming world championship held in Tokyo. How far this unexpected success would take him and how it would help to fix his grieving family is the entire story.\r\n\r\nRight from the beginning you would know all those going to happen in the length x breadth of the movie. So the spoilers and synopsis won't hurt much if you are yet to watch it. Even the characters planned like that way. For example the boy's friendship with a hawk was not coincidental for this particular movie theme and also his grandpa was a world war 2 pilot. I already lost my interest at that point, but I was unable to dislike this little cute and rare film. I carried on because the boy's courage and passion for the paper planes was not just for his ownness, but everyone around him that gives a change to change.\r\n\r\n> \"Okay. Here's my advice.\r\n> Study everything that flies. (Snaps fingers)\"\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of mini sub-plots. Anti-bullying was one of the best things and the three different kinds of friendships; a boy from the neighborhood, a girl from the competition and with a bird. The father was kind of depressing and a bad example, but had a good reason for that. That boy's every action was directed to his father to make him look back. Well, the father was Sam Worthington, whose role was insignificant compared to his star value. It influenced to raise the movie value, especially the marketing which makes people come and watch it, but overall he was decent.\r\n\r\nOkay, fine, to this point all I said about, but missing realism was unable to accept. I'm talking about the flights of the paper planes. It's not like 50 years ago, today we got the very best CGI at production level, that mean you can't omit the actuality and go for the extravaganza. That would work well for commercial films, and this was not one of those. It was suppose to encourage the kids and it did in a way, I appreciate that. Not the best children or Aussie flick that I saw in this mansoon. Eventhough I had a mixing feeling on this, I quite enjoyed watching it and I hope your opinion would differ to what I said in this review.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"559d79a3925141251800038d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/559d79a3925141251800038d","movie_id":286875}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is a movie that you have to really watch. You cannot sit and divide your time between the movie and reading a book or glancing at your tablet. Doing that would be like watching half a painting. This movie is all about the graphical presentation. Its use of live actors yet with a cartoonish black and white (emphasize on black) look with some occasional splatter of colors is absolutely marvelous. Look down and you miss something. The background voice a\u2019la old fashioned detective story only serves to reinforce the feeling of being dumped into an old cartoon.\r\n\r\nThe story, or rather stories, are cartoon class material as well and not really much to write home about by themselves. They serve well enough to drive this particular movie though. The main actors where fitting right in and making a very enjoyable performance as far as I am concerned. Well, with the possible exception of Bruce Willis who mostly just stood around looking sad but then his role was a rather unrewarding one in the first place. I definitely liked Mickey Rourke as the rather exaggerated tuff guy Marv.\r\n\r\nThis is a violent movie. Like Kill Bill violent if you know what I mean. If this movie would have been made as an ordinary live action movie without the cartoonish elements and the timely switch to silhouette images it would be grossly violent. Again, the cartoonish setting of the movie makes it simply work. Still, the movie is not for the squemish but then, this is the second Sin City movie, it is based on an existing cartoon and Robert Rodriguez had his hand in it so if you are surprised you either went into the wrong show room or should start to do a bit more research before deciding to watch something.\r\n\r\nI did find the fact that the movie actually revolved around two different stories a bit distracting though. A minor complaint but I was really expecting them to somehow get intertwined all through the movie and was a tad disappointed when the second story finished and so did the movie.\r\n\r\nBottom line is that I quite enjoyed this movie. It is really a movie that stands out from the crowd in its use of black and white imagery and cartoon characters. It is black, grim and funny at the same time and for a photography interested person like me the imagery is really beautiful.","id":"5af1baa19251411ec200688a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5af1baa19251411ec200688a","movie_id":189}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is one of these movies which will always have its detractors because it is not historically correct. There are certain movies in which you expect a certain amount of historical accuracy and there are certain movies where you do not. This is one of the latter. You must be out of your mind if you ever expected any great deal of historical accuracy from this movie (or any Hollywood production nowadays for that matter). Therefore it pains me to see the reviews that slams this movie with a one-star rating and moans about how it is screwing with the (their) history. I would certainly not call this a great movie but, as a movie, it is far from the one-star range.\r\n\r\nThe movie is watchable, it is even somewhat enjoyable to watch but it is not really a great and epic movie. There are lots of action which is one of the good parts. Some of the scenery, especially the naval ones, are quite magnificent even though they are somewhat overdone in the usual Hollywood way. The bow waves make these heavy, wooden, oar-powered ships look like they are speeding ahead at 30 knots for instance.\r\n\r\nThe action is of the rather gory and blood splattering type. Given all the slow motion scenes with copious amounts of blood slowly floating in the air I would assume this was more out of intention than out of ignorance although the ease by which these ancient swords chopped through bones and necks seemed rather unbelievable. I do not mind blood and gore in my movies but I have to say that the blood and gore in this movie seemed to have taken precedence over the rest of the creative process.\r\n\r\nThe movie simply failed to inspire the awe that one would expect an epic movie of this type would do. Someone said that the movie played out a lot like a video game and to some extent that is true. I never really felt much for any of the characters when watching the movie. I found myself just waiting for the next action scene. The enjoyable part of this movie is really the action, the scenery and the effects, not the story or the characters.\r\n\r\nThe movie is watchable, even enjoyable depending on your expectations but far from great.","id":"53d49a140e0a2628380036a4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53d49a140e0a2628380036a4","movie_id":53182}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The two nations fighting each other, but not these two...**\r\n\r\nA romance-drama that's set in the backdrop of the world war two. It tells the story of a young wife whose husband fighting Germans during the 1940s war. When her village was taken control by the Nazi army, an officer was assigned to stay in her house. He's not like the other German soldiers, they both unexpectedly fall in love, despite all the troubles around. An affair to keep hidden from everyone, though it was the beneficial in a way to those who are suffering. Practically impossible to keep it going, so how long and how it lasts follows in the remaining parts.\r\n\r\nA completely different kind of the world war two drama I have ever seen. Not easy to accept, since we know how that war was fought. But it was really a good take, something softer and romantic side. Michelle Williams and Matthias Schoenaerts were too good in their respective roles. Well made film with the beautiful cinematography and music, especially the direction.\r\n\r\nThis film's special was its original source. That's an interesting story than this film. It was based on the book that published in 2004, but the manuscript was over 50 years old which was written during pre WWII. There are some tense moments, as well as romantically appeals, but the war influences all those to shape up the entire film. Surprised, because it was better than my anticipation. Only the end should have been improved. Like they concluded it by oral declaration, I would have liked them in the pictures, even it extends for another 15 or more minutes.

Not many people are aware of him, one more movie and its success may lead to the greater heights for sure. This animation technics are very unique, but not the first time in the use.\r\n\r\nThe character illustrations were cuter to enchant the young kids. Watching the movie is like reading a children's storybook with the large pictures everywhere and a couple of lines of words in the corner of the page. Like the anime in Japan and 3D animation in Hollywood, this would mark the Euro on the map. There are many animations are made and still making in Europe, but this one is the new perspective of hope to reach all the major and remote places of the Earth. Wish it moves in the right direction.\r\n\r\nIf you had known how all the fairy tales work, you would feel you can predict this story because, you know defeating evil, breaking curses, the happy endings are the usual part. So what matters is the storytelling, how well the stories are presented on the screen. This film excels in that point, and the music is the another highlight of the movie. Whoever the music director\/composer I must praise him. Almost a year ago I saw the trailer for the first time and I felt like I already loved the movie, mainly because of the music.\r\n\r\n''Hold this shell to your ear and listen carefully. You will hear the song of the sea.''\r\n\r\nIn his earlier movie the director told a simple and short story extraordinarily, and still I hum that beautiful 'Aisling song' sometime. This movie had a wonderful adventure story of a boy called Ben and his little sister Saoirse. In the journey of running away from an owl witch, the magical creatures and an ancient seashell guide them a path. On the right time the title song makes the way to delight next 10 minutes of the crucial segment in the narration. I love the original version, in Irish even though I don't understand. It was good and catchy, even for the grown ups as well. Feels like, want to visit those places from the movie, but sadly our only option is Disneyland, huh.\r\n\r\nDisney and Studio Ghibli are the king and queen of fairy tale movies. No one would, but if you are mildly fed up of those, here the new dimensional fresh tales from the Ireland's folklore. Though, it sets in the modern world, but does not abandon to bring the key factors. Like the ancient meet the modern world with the same intensity. Kind of new to hear the words like Selkie, Macha etc., but, brand new for the people who live thousands of kilometers away in the different continents. Animation movie fanatics would love it, but if there are any children like niece and nephew in your home or visits you, watch it with them on that occasion and you would feel differently.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"551ecd5dc3a3683a1400371f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/551ecd5dc3a3683a1400371f","movie_id":110416}

However, I liked his performance and this film is worth watching because of his presence. The two female leads were just okay, especially Salma Hayek looked much better over Jessica Alba which seems her career is almost over. This is a story of a Cambridge professor who moved to the States after fallen in love with an American student. But just after a few years later he comes crashing down with trouble in the marriage, but he decides to fight for his son at any cost.\r\n\r\nThe story was good, but should have been improvised a little. And the theme might make uncomfortable for some because of a man falling in love with both the sister. Yet very matured and a fine flavour for people with the open mind. There were some fun, especially comparing the booze culture and students' behavious between the two countries. This is a three year old film, but got released different market at different time and I saw it now that I think it was much better than I anticipated after knowing the respond it's got.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"57d309ebc3a3682003000726","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57d309ebc3a3682003000726","movie_id":253344}
{"author":"Reno","content":"There are no mass actors in this film yet fulfills with the quality of the A list movies. What a wonderful launch pad for an aspiring filmmaker. He wrote it, as well handled everything and everyone carefully. In the name of comedy, he did not go lousy, like most of the B movies do. One of the best main roles ever it was for Lucy Punch in her entire career as far my observation and she outclassed it. Daman Wayans also having a good time recently with movies like 'Let's be Cops', 'Big Hero 6' and this. Certainly his career graph mounting like any actor dreamt for.\r\n\r\nVery similar storyline to the movie 'Let's Kill Ward's Wife', but instead 'kill', it replaced with the word 'marry'. Yep, Barry is the character in the movie who is very annoying, so his best buddies plan to set up with a woman to get rid of him. The title character Barry was the most important in the movie and it went to the right person to play. I know him barely, seen in a couple of films and again he was splendid with a casual performance. I am pretty much sure, the sequel is on the card. It will be a double trouble for Barry's buddies, but all my concern is the filmmakers don't want to mess it up like 'Horrible Bosses 2'.\r\n\r\n> BARRY is everywhere, in your life, mine and in this film.\r\n\r\nSo hilarious, even though, consider it is not a so popular flick. Worry is people will miss this enjoyable movie due to the unaware of its existence. That's the reason I review not-so-popular-good-movie on the regular basis. In my opinion, disappointment is not on the card. Believe me, the movie might not be a good as I am stating, but definitely not a bad one. So in the end, it's up to the collective of the individual's statement that decides the fate of a movie which involves yours as well.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"55510aaec3a36834e10027b0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55510aaec3a36834e10027b0","movie_id":249923}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This movie appears to have many names. Vychislitel is the original Russian name but in English it appears to be called Calculator, in French Titanium and in German Titanium \u2013 Strafplanet XT-59. The English title is, as far as I understand it, the one closest to the original Russian name.\r\n\r\nI have to confess that I had some problems following this movie since the original language is, of course, Russian and my Russian is a wee bit rusty as in non-existent. Therefore we had to watch it dubbed which is something I normally never do. Unfortunately the French are lousy (arrogant) when it comes to foreign movies and even on a Blu-ray disc they can generally only be bothered to include a French sound track if the original movie is not English. Thus we had to watch it in French and my French is not really good enough to understand all the nuances.\r\n\r\nAnyway this is a fairly decent little science fiction movie. Not a great one but definitely decent. The story is perhaps not the most innovative around. On a planet rather hostile to human life with a totalitarian government controlling the inhabitant\u2019s lives in minute detail, including who they marry etc\u2026 a group of condemned prisoners are let loose on the planets surface where they are expected to die. Naturally some of them do not but manages to undertake a journey which brings them to a secret hideout with the means to escape. The movie tells the story about their journey.\r\n\r\nThe reason we bought this movie was because me and my oldest son saw the trailer on TV (I know, you should never buy a movie based on the trailer) and it looked quite cool with some original special effects. There are indeed some cool looking special effects in this movie. The black and hostile landscape are quite cool and it is filled with some rather original life forms. All of them very hostile towards anything biological that moves of course.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the movie did not appear to be made on a very high budget. The monsters and the scenery are quite cool as I wrote but a lot of the movie is spent on people walking, people talking or people arguing. A lot of the cool stuff was shown in the trailer though. Having said that, the scenery and the acting was still quite decent although, as I also said, I did struggle a bit to follow all of the interactions.\r\n\r\nAs a whole it was an interesting movie if you are a science fiction fan but people looking for a special effects and action loaded movie will probably be disappointed. I did not feel like a waste of time for me (I am a science fiction fan after all) but it was not a \u201cwow this movie was good\u201d moment either.","id":"55d6e48a9251416706001b7d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55d6e48a9251416706001b7d","movie_id":316269}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"There is new-gen and there is wannabe new-gen and Sarabham belongs in the latter category of filmmaking. It has the elements that we've come to recognize in the new-gen films of the past two years. The producer CV Kumar has become a brand himself by making these films while one of its actors has become a regular feature in such films. The story belongs in the noir genre, there are twists, and the film has an urbane vibe topped with slick cinematography and editing. \r\n\r\nAnd yet, the film feels somewhat empty \u2014 not hollow but empty, in the sense that its world doesn't really come as a lived-in one. Other than the three major characters, the other supporting characters seem to be there just to fill in the spaces. And the locations too, especially the houses of Vikram and Chandrasekar, seem like those artful settings we see in TV commercials. Everything is so clean, so sterile that there is no mess, even when there is murder, kidnapping and double-crossing involved. Ironically, the only thing that is chaotic is the electronica-influenced score, which needed to be minimalist. \r\n\r\nThe plot is about Vikram ( Naveen Chandra), an ambitious young architect, who is dejected when his wealthy client Chandrasekar ( Naren) rejects his plan. He wants revenge but comes across Chandrasekar's daughter, Sruthi (Salony), who says that she's trying to flee from the country. Vikram confides in her of his desire to get rich quick and tells her that he will do any crime, if it seems that he will never get caught (while in the background we see this caption on his wall: I'm the architect of my own disaster). So, the two hatch a plan \u2014 he tells Chandrasekar that he has kidnapped his daughter and demands a ransom, which they will later split evenly. Everything goes according to plan but it is only later that Vikram realizes that nothing is what it seems to be. \r\n\r\nFor a crime thriller, Sarabham is largely tension free. We are only mildly curious when the unexpected happens and there are too many twists that we stop caring after a point. Added to that, we never feel empathetic towards either of the leads, which stops us from being concerned. The actors, too, seem miscast \u2014 Naveen is dull while the Jolie-like Salony, despite capturing the femme fatale essence of the character in some scenes, is hampered by not knowing the language.","id":"53e4d89f0e0a262b8f006a26","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53e4d89f0e0a262b8f006a26","movie_id":280174}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I cannot help but wonder if this movie would have gotten better reviews if Schwarzenegger had not been cast in the lead role. I get the feeling that people had certain expectations due to the choice of actor. In any case, the ridiculously low one and two star ratings are rubbish. They are utterly undeserved as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I quite liked the movie. Sure it is not Oscar material and it will not go on any of my top ten lists but I found it rather enjoyable to watch.\r\n\r\nSchwarzy is not young any more so you should not expect him to play roles as he did at the height of his career before he made the unfortunate decision to wade into the dirty waters of politics. Still he performed quite alright in the various action scenes in this movie. And there are a fair amount of action in the movie as well as a fair amount of blood substitute. It is not really an all out action movie though and the story that underpins the action have a certain amount of drama in it.\r\n\r\nI would say that the actors in general are doing a god job of their roles. The drug enforcement team looks more like a biker gang than a police team but then, to work undercover in the world of the drug cartels you really have to be part crazy. There are no young sexy chicks in this movie, unless you count a few scenes in bars and strip clubs. Actually the two female lead characters can be said to be downright ugly which may be another reason why some people of the younger audience give the movie a low rating although that is of course pure speculation on my part :-) . In any case, I think the choice of female characters fits perfectly well with the rest of the movie (as well as Schwarzy\u2019s age).\r\n\r\nThe story is a mix of the fairly classical one of revengeful drug cartels and incompetent FBI directors with a bit of a twist from the money heist and the disappearing money. The implementation might be a wee bit imperfect at times but to me it was a good enough story. I did like the ending with the classical shoot out in the bar although I also did consider taking a star off due to the tragic last few scenes. What can I say? I am a sucker for happy endings.","id":"5426554ac3a3681c22000e38","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5426554ac3a3681c22000e38","movie_id":144336}
{"author":"Reno","content":"Not expected this from the director. For a title called 'Sabotage' which had one of our times greatest action hero in it the story drags with lots of drama than stunts. Arnold Schwarzenegger is not young anymore and he's not capable of heavy stunts, but still he handled well those crucial parts. No doubt he was good, and also the direction, but the story was not well written. Especially the twist was so pale and the supporting characters were hyped better than the Arnie's, but failed to hold and deliver when the story needed them.\r\n\r\nDue to create the suspense some of the assassins were kept undisplayed for the viewers and that is another let down. Because in the whole movie action sequences were the weakest except the opening scene and those murders were somehow produced expectancy. This movie was not bad, but an average. It can be watched once though it may not fulfill your thirst for fine enjoyment.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Like Karu Pazhaniappan's Pirivom Santhippom, Saivam is a celebration of the Chettinadu lifestyle. Nirav Shah's camera feasts on the magnificent architecture of the place while Vijay spins a simplistic tale in this backdrop that is both engaging and amusing. The family of Kathiresan (Nasser), a respected man in his village, has come from various parts of the globe for the local festival. Tamizhselvi ( Sara), Kathiresan's granddaughter, is an endearing presence in the family, and she is fond of her pet rooster, Paapa. After a minor accident, the family is told that they might have displeased their god and they believe that all their ill-luck (everyone comes with their own problem that needs to be solved) is because they failed to offer the rooster to the god as a sacrifice. Even as they decide to fulfill their vow, Paapa goes missing leaving the family in a tizzy.\r\n\r\nUsing a one-line that is perfect short film material, Vijay has created a two-hour-long feel-good film, which is part humourous and part sentimental but never delves into melodrama. The actors are the film's asset and they do a fine job; considering that most of them are new faces, they lend freshness to the film. Even though his character is underwritten and passive (he hardly does anything substantial except look worried until the final scene), Nasser makes us empathize with Kathiresan and also lends the gravitas that is needed for the role of a respected head of the family. Then there is the uptight Saravanan, who is essentially the film's punch bag, but Ray Paul doesn't over-do the spoilt brat aspect of the character. Malathi, as the family's maid, is terrific and the manner in which she breaks down with pride and affection after hearing her husband Raja's (a well-cast George) moving speech is exceptional.\r\n\r\nIn all of his films so far, Vijay has struggled with the pacing but here, he is bang on and the slightly laid-back pace of the film fits its setting beautifully. It is no surprise that Saivam is his best \u2014 not to mention, his most original \u2014 film yet. There is a pre-interval segment where editor Antony niftily cross-cuts between three fights that erupt over the rooster and it is one of the brilliant stretches in the film. The segment where the family members, who individually come to know about Paapa's presence, and try to keep it a secret for Tamizh's sake, is equally good. But the romantic track between the cousins Senthil and Abirami feels tacked on (though the two youngsters, Basha and Twaara are good finds) and also results in an unnecessarily extended climax.","id":"53baa9890e0a2676b800b9a3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baa9890e0a2676b800b9a3","movie_id":263476}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Sathuranka Vettai shows what good writing can do to a film. The film is an expertly woven tale of a remorseless con man, for whom, \"money is the ultimate\". The film narrates his story in six episodes which charts his rise, fall and redemption. In the first two, we see how he operates, the next two tell us why he is so and what his motivation is, and in the final two, we see how he tries to turn over a new leaf and how he has to rely on the very same talents that had made him notorious to redeem himself and shut the door on his past once and for all. \r\n\r\nGandhi Babu is an ingenious scamster who exploits the greed of people to makes loads of money with his get-rich-quick schemes that include topical ones like multi-level marketing (MLM) and emu farming. During one such attempt, he is caught by the cops, but despite the hundreds of cases against his name, he is freed. But he is kidnapped by a gangster who has been hired by a person he had cheated earlier. He agrees to return the money but his partners swindle the money leaving him in a precarious situation. He manages to save his skin by playing on the gangster's greediness and outwits them to shed his life of crime and begin one anew with the girl who loves him. But the gangster enters the scene again and demands what he was promised. With both his and his wife's lives at stake, can Gandhi Babu outsmart his adversaries? \r\n\r\nThe real hero of Sathuranka Vettai is its script, which, with its twists and turns, keeps us guessing for most parts of the film. The lines are razor-sharp (Nidhi irundha needhiya easy-a velaikku vaangidalam, Naama solra poi-la konjam unmai irukkanaum) and come thick and fast. The characters too are interesting and painted in different shades \u2014 a gangster who speaks in chaste Tamil (though this fluctuates now and then), a cop who understands this criminal's ideology and so on. Even Gandhi Babu is refreshingly compassionless for a leading man, and Nataraj nails the character perfectly. His body language and his modulation make us believe that this is a man who can get away from the toughest situation with his wits. The only character that is painted in white is the heroine, who seems too good to be true. The film is also self-aware \u2014 when Gandhi Babu narrates his flashback (which is presented in 2D animation), he tells point blank that he isn't doing so to gain sympathy; he tells mother sentiment has become a cliche and still goes ahead and uses it.\r\n\r\nBut there are places where the film isn't entirely successful. To begin with, it needs to have been sharper and shorter (the numerous reaction shots that Vinoth uses during the scams are not really needed). The craft is also not quite polished and there are instances when the filmmaking feels crude and we get a feeling that Vinoth is playing to the gallery. But considering this is a first film, we can look over these as niggles. But the manner in which the film turns melodramatic towards the end doesn't go with its irreverent tone (Gandhi Babu is made to dig his own grave by the villains who want to finish him off and this is intercut with his wife going into labour). For a film that is terrific for the most parts, the ending is less thrilling and tame.","id":"53d6ad5e0e0a26284a007b94","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53d6ad5e0e0a26284a007b94","movie_id":281992}
{"author":"Reno","content":"I have not seen a single Kollywood flick, in fact, any Indian movies from since 2 years. But recently saw a couple of Tamil films and this was one of them. Very much satisfied and I'm glad I went for it. Like I always say, the songs are what turns me off in Indian cinema, that is the reason stayed away. This movie had those, but I was not frustrated because they are blended very well to the narration. There is no sudden jump into the dance floor with colourful costumes, but most of the tracks are background song. I liked that classical soundtrack with the veenai, really catchy and the meaningful lyrics. That song called 'Azhagu' won two Indian Academy Awards for best playback singer and best lyrics.\r\n\r\nAn inspiring movie, a message teller, something we could learn or adopt from it. The adults are always, well, most of them obey the law without asking any questions that came from the previous generation to them and teach it to their kin as well. That's how the traditions passed to and survived till date. That is good, but in the modern India there are no actions taken to abolish the some of the brutal believes which are more than two millenniums old. The changes come from the children, who asks so many questions. This is such a movie takes place on that kind of theme, which is inspired by a true childhood event of the director's mother.\r\n\r\n> Then, do the god is like us?\r\n> Expects something in return to do us a favour?\r\n\r\nIt's a second movie of Sara Arjun's I'm seeing and she was so good. She was not the lead, but only the part of the movie. There is no particular lead character. The story simply based and follows after the incident that shocks a whole family when they unite for the native festival in their village. When theirs concern grows bigger over the issue and the tale reaches more tighter plot and faster in portrayal. And then bang, the end comes like suddenly everything goes silent for a moment.\r\n\r\nThe movie is not hard to predict, especially the end was as expected. It's simply a family entertainment, give comfort feeling and leaves no reason to complain about. Every role had a wonderful display, great performances by all the cast. The sub-plots like teen romance and kids fight, are all fine additions for the extra fun. This is actually a short movie even though it ran 2 hours because usually Indian movies reach the 3 hour mark and that's a plus point. As I consider my judgement on this product, I would say it's a must see movie. But that does not mean It's a genuine, the only reason I liked it for is this film wanted to say something good to the society. This kind of movies definitely good to build a better tomorrow around us.\r\n\r\n8.5\/10","id":"554641a5c3a36856e5003ec5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/554641a5c3a36856e5003ec5","movie_id":263476}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Frankly, most horror films made in Tamil cinema have only ended up as unintentional comedies. Director Deekay seems to understand this and though Yaamirukka Bayamey is a haunted house story, he goes for laughs more than chills. This approach (a very wise one) is what sets his film apart from recent successful films in the genre like Kanchana and Pizza. It is classier than the former and lacks the visual flair of the latter; there is a ghost-looking-for-revenge angle as in Kanchana, and like Pizza, it has some haunted house spooks, but, the film manages to carve its own space as both these tropes are used to generate humour.\r\n\r\nThe initial set-up is definitely tentative. We are introduced to Kiran ( Kreshna, who continues to pick interesting scripts), a schemer, and how he gets into trouble with a local dada Dorai by selling libido enhancement medicine. He comes to know about an ancestral property around the same time and goes to the hill station Kolliyur with his girlfriend Smitha ( Rupa Manjari), only to find that the property is a dilapidated mansion. On the advice of Sharath (Karuna), he refurbish his contact in the place, he refurbishes the place (with the money he windless from Dorai's son) and turns it into a lodge. Intriguingly, the guests who come to stay there start dying. What's the mystery behind the whole thing?\r\n\r\nNothing is taken seriously (when every statement made by a character comes true, we don't see others getting shocked but the scene, instead cuts to a dream sequence) or allowed to get too serious (the flashback sequence on ghost), and it could very well have ended up as downright silly (the ghost makeup looks mostly like facial gone bad) but the film somehow manages to keep us amused. A large part of the credit should go to Karuna, who manages to make Sharath both ambivalent and funny. We expect a supernatural reason behind everyone exclaiming that Sharath looks familiar and what we get is a sly and funny explanation. On the other hand, both the heroines are clearly there for oomph.\r\n\r\nThe horror genre's mandatory elements are all here \u2014 mansion in a lonely place, mysterious old man, mysticism, and even the quintessential dim lighting in the night scenes \u2014 but Deekay nicely subverts some of these cliches (we think we are getting the ghost's story during the flashback, but that isn't so). Also, he doesn't try to spoof the genre's tropes to elicit laughs but chooses to bring out the humour in other ways. It is this confidence that makes the film work.","id":"53baad760e0a2676bf00bc3e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baad760e0a2676bf00bc3e","movie_id":263497}

If only noble intentions can by themselves result in a good film! Even if we set aside the question of whether movies should really have a message, the sincerity in wanting to spread a message doesn't reflect in the inelegant filmmaking. The fault lies in the formulaic storytelling. The director chooses the tried and tested trope of a lighter first half with a mystery around the protagonist and a serious latter half where secrets are revealed and a point is made. But the problem here is that the initial set-up is very much non-existent.\r\n\r\nThe film begins with Vetri, Professor and Ganesan going to Ooty and sort-of settling there. We never get a sense of mystery around these characters even though we see them discussing their past in a guarded manner a couple of times. Instead, what we get is a mundane comedy track (featuring Ganja Karuppu) and a lifeless romantic track. The heroine, Sujatha, a criminal lawyer, gets friendly with Vetri and falls in love with him for now compelling reason. Nothing much happens during this long time (at least an hour) and it finally takes a disaster to get the plot in motion. Soon, the cops chase the friends and arrest them (Ganesan loses his life during this time) and it is only then we get to the real story \u2014 the three have actually escaped from a mental health institution and are wanted for the murder of a doctor there!\r\n\r\nIt is only when he gets to this serious segment that Rudhran displays his storytelling capabilities. We get an affecting story on the plight of the mentally insane, who are often at the mercy of others. And, there's suspense as well. There are people using the patients for their personal benefits in the place and when their eyes fall on Aarthi, a teenaged inmate, Vetri, Professor and Ganesan, who are attached to her, plan to flee from there with the girl with the help of a helpful warden. However, on the night of their escape, Aarthi goes missing and a doctor is found dead!\r\n\r\nEven here, it is the inherent drama that keeps us hooked. The prison break sub-plot isn't as tense as should be and there is inconsistency in how the place is portrayed. Vetri refers to it as a place where even animals will hesitate to enter but after an initial scene where we are shown the inmates being brutally treated, we are presented with a rather softer version of the place. Also, looking back, the introduction of the leads feels odd. They are shown in a merry mode but in the flashback we learn that they have escaped from the institution amidst great difficult and are worried for Aarthi.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of things which are interesting. Sujatha is not a passive heroine. In fact, it is she who solves the mystery and saves Vetri and Professor. And, Rudhran doesn't have an 'All is well' ending. Instead, he gives us a bittersweet ending, telling us loud and clear that how uncaring the society is when it comes to the mentally-challenged.","id":"53baaad40e0a2676bb00bbbf","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baaad40e0a2676bb00bbbf","movie_id":270782}
{"author":"Sriram","content":"Right in the opening segment, director Siva lays out his cards. There is a fight between two groups in a college and the new principal, who wants to put an end to this, goes to meet the elder brother of one of the parties involved in the scuffle. And, there, we see that the brother himself is a ruffian, who will feed people before beating them as he wants them to be strong to take the blows. But since this person is also the hero of the film, he is what we could call a genial rowdy, and the scene plays out mostly for laughs. The district collector, who is his friend, is present at the scene, happily requesting a similar \"entertainment\" the next day as well. If this is what your of idea of fun is, then, hop on aboard, the director seems to say.\r\n\r\nThe film is a template masala film \u2014 a superhuman hero, his cronies who will sing his praises all the time, a beautiful-looking heroine, a raging villain. It has no room for logic, moving from one hero-worshipping scene to the next and is aimed at our visceral tastes. The story is in service of its star and, it is unapologetic about it.\r\n\r\nThe plot, which kicks in only in the second half, and revolves around Vinayagam (Ajith) and his four brothers, who are do-gooders who will not hesitate to meet violence with violence. Vinayagam falls in love with Koperundevi ( Tamannaah), the daughter of Nallasivam ( Nasser), a pacifist. He tries to mend his ways for the sake of his lover, but when he learns that a revenge-seeking convict (Atul Kulkarni) wants to annihilate her entire family, he decides to stop him at all cost.\r\n\r\nThe very purpose of Veeram is to be a showcase for its star, Ajith, and that it does quite well. Right from the hero introduction scene, Siva creates moments specifically designed for his hero to shine \u2014 you see him being praised by those around him, mouthing punch dialogues, being nice to kids and elders, fighting on a running train, and in the climax, coming back from the dead to destroy the villain and his men. The best scene among the lot is one where Vinayagam goes to meet Vanangamudi, a goon with whom he has had a few run-ins, and orders him to do his bidding, all the while making it seem like he is begging for mercy, for the sake of the peace-loving Nallasivam. And, Ajith effortlessly conveys the heroic nature of his character and completely plays to the gallery.\r\n\r\nThe challenge with this sort of film is that it should keep moving forward without losing momentum. And that is where Veeram slips, at least in the initial stages. The entire first half involves the shenanigans of Vinayagam's brothers who, with help from their lawyer Bail Perumal ( Santhanam) try to get their brother fall in love with Koperundevi. Throughout these episodes, we are left wondering where the plot is heading and the film doesn't make it clear even by the interval point. The brothers too are uniformly uninteresting \u2014 all the four of them look the same and behave the same, and their characters are hardly defined. The romantic portions and Santhanam's quips, while entertaining, travel through previously trodden ground.\r\n\r\nAs for the second half, it coasts along once the plot kicks in and for a while, we are engrossed in Vinayagam's efforts to track down the various teams of hitmen sent to wipe out Koperundevi's family. But, even here, the villain doesn't come across as too much of a challenger to the hero, and, despite having an actor like Atul Kulkarni, Siva fails to build a truly terrifying character.","id":"53bb168dc3a368661a0001b8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bb168dc3a368661a0001b8","movie_id":247504}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Religious and children, is sometime uncool.\r\n\r\nIt was surprisingly an amazing movie. Related to the religious thing, but science had a fair amount of display in the narration. You don't have to be religious to watch this film. You know I enjoyed the movie as a subject that portrayed in a conflict manner. In the end, whatever happen or wins are the best conclusion for a cinematic story. The contents are supposed to be the path the human walked through the past 2000 years, not on the interest to raise the issue. The film was clear on the matter, that is how the movie had the upper hand to receive respect everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe story was told in the multiple episodes. The story deals on the basis of the each episode's title that I can clearly say it had something to do with the Christian faith. Because it follows the same order. Since I don't belong to any, it became a study material. From the introduction to the conclusion, it was well maintained pace, that is slow. But in the middle, I was almost drifted away from my concentration. Somehow managed to hold back my position like I always do and finished watching it by liking it very much.\r\n\r\nYou can take the movie and its contents in many angles. It is up to you, but either way the movie succeeds in balancing and revealing the facts. Leaves you make your own verdict, because you know what's right and wrong being a human to believe in religion or in science, which both were the creation of ours. Sometimes these both do not require to understand life, just like the animals which survived alongside us for very long without civilization revolution, religious faith and proper law and order. The point is the one who understands the life and those who don't bother about knowing it, lives better than being confused between the line and seeks the shelter of religious.\r\n\r\nAn easiest camera work for the cinematographer. All he has to do was to place the lens in a right position and that's it, the rest would be monitored on the television screen where the director seated, I believe. Because there is no camera panning except in a couple of places, other than that it was motionless and the characters appears in the front to perform. The cast has to memorise the lines of those scenes that covers up to non-stop 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n> \"My religion has put a ban on\r\n> running in circles in a gym.\"\r\n\r\nMore like a stage play where setting for one frame (view) is always there and keeps changing for each scene with the different backgrounds what the script demands. My initial thought was, it might have been based on the play, but I still don't know the answer to that. Probably not, because it won an award for the script at the Berlin film festival. Yep, I loved the presentation, it was so cool and beautiful.\r\n\r\nFrom this what I have learnt was the involvement of minors in the religious ceremony is kind of inhumane. It's okay to teach them, but some rituals and sacrifice are way beyond acceptable. Those innocent minds have no experience of the difficulty of life, they're yet to explore it. Being poor or someone in the family is very ill should not be the reason to force them to take part. It is the great issue in all the religion. I think physically and mentally affecting take part in the religious ceremony must not be allowed for the underage.\r\n\r\nI had mild doubt over opting it to view in the earlier, but went for it to refresh from my regular kind of cinema and it did not fail to have my full attention, well I managed, did not I? I am happy I tried to have a different cinema, in fact the filmmakers given the distinct one, so I appreciate them. In the todays world, young film fanatics are addicted to either Hollywood\/British or Korean films, but there are plenty of hidden gems in front of us that they're neglecting to have a glimpse. I would recommend this for the adults, they need to watch this more than children and young adults.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"55ba630b92514119cb003657","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55ba630b92514119cb003657","movie_id":254721}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> No gadget can edit the future, only hard work does.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I am not a Doraemon fan, I did not grow up watching the series. I was hooked up to the Cartoon Network and its all the shows. But this one, they never aired it, so I am not familiar with. However, I had a few glimpses while passing by when my niece watching it on the television set. She loves it and she draws it. It was an English dubbed version though, that did not excite me a much. Officially, this movie was my first encounter with this what millions of children love, Doraemon. I really, really liked it, almost loved it. Feel regret that I should have known it before the movie because it was so good like those I'd enjoyed in my childhood days.\r\n\r\n3D anime is a new market. It is an easy production compared to 2D animation where digital 3D is an optional advantage. That does not mean the regular Anime is losing its trade, but recent Studio Ghibli's decision to halt in production makes suspicious. Look, what has 3D animation done in Hollywood, a rapid growth in last ten years shrunk the 2D animations. The last film I remember I saw was 'The Princess and the Frog'. On one side, I am delighted because we are advancing, but in another it is very sad that Cartoons are losing its honour. The bright side is, all those flat characters we loved in our days are reshaping in the 3D avatar. The great successful example is the latest 'Asterix and Obelix' movie. 'Popeye' and many other films are too in the line, so something to cheer!\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst of all I did not know Doraemon is a science-fiction, in fact, I thought Doraemon is some kind of talking toy, like in the movie 'Ted'. Fans, don't mind, I am just a beginner, but quickly learning. The only criticism I heard so far from the Doraemon fans was that the story was not new, they have already seen it in the anime short version. This film was not a follow-up to any earlier films are TV series. It was a fresh beginning like from the scratch that really helped me to understand and would do same for anyone who are unfamiliar with this. It was based on the six Doraemon manga short stories. You would easily find splits between those parts while changing the phases, but overall, a fine assembles.\r\n\r\nUnlike television series, this Japanese Academy Award winner for Animated movie is for all. That mean adults as well can enjoy it besides the kids. There are many special things about the movie. Obviously it is very humorous, but unexpectedly so romantic and emotional with the matured materials used to tell the tale, even for the kids it is something to learn from. I loved many individual scenes, because those were not just beautiful and funny, but very clever indeed. Especially the end twist makes 'what the heck!', yet simple charmingly smart. Instantly I became the Doraemon fan, and now I want a sequel.\r\n\r\n> It's hard saying goodbye. But...\r\n> It's harder thinking that I'll be making her unhappy. \r\n\r\nThe character Nobita was just like the one from 'CJ7' who is obsessed with his new beneficial friend. Because he is not good at anything, sometimes he begins well, but ends it in a disaster, so he always depended on the gadgets from his beloved robot cat. Besides, he's lazy and always get bullied by his classmates Gian and Suneo. But he do has a crush on a girl called Shizuka, a brainy student Hidetoshi stands between him and her. Now he has a competitor and to win her heart, which as well helps to fix his future, whatsoever he must work hard. Those efforts are pleasantly illustrated in the movie.\r\n\r\nI liked all the 3D converted characters, especially Shizuka was so cute. Doraemon looked little bigger and like a giant blue ball, in a nice, funny, acceptable way. The same energy was maintained from the anime, like the law of gravity is not applicable. Such as in situations when someone jumps in the air, he stays there for a while when he\/she was in joy or shocked and tears drip sidewards. That's the difference between 2D and 3D animations, but it worked well in this film. After all, that's why the animations are for, making impossible to possible. Animals can talk and they can be our (generally children) hero. I enjoyed it as much any kid does. This movie is a revolution in Doraemon's history, an opportunity to get in to meet these adorable characters in the beginning itself if you're alien to this. I know Doraemon fans love it, hope others as well do the same.\r\n\r\n7.5\/10","id":"55898e8e92514152dc0007da","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55898e8e92514152dc0007da","movie_id":265712}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"We're all mad Dr. Newgate. Some are simply not mad enough to admit it.\r\n\r\nStonehearst Asylum (AKA: Eliza Graves) is directed by Brad Anderson and adapted to screenplay by Joe Gangemi. It's loosely based on an Edgar Allan Poe short story. It stars Kate Beckinsale, Jim Sturgess, David Thewlis, Ben Kingsley, Michael Caine, Jason Flemyng and Brendan Gleeson. Music is by John Debney and cinematography by Thomas Yatsko.\r\n\r\nStonehearst Asylum - Is nothing as it seems?\r\n\r\nFor his latest foray into the horror mystery realm, director Anderson provides a film that is away from conventionality's. The horror here is the blurry lines between sanity and insanity, and it has plenty of tricks and dark humour up its sleeves as well. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out quite early on what is going on at Stonehearst, the makers leave enough clues, but as the ungodly treatments show their hands, and the caustic observations on mental health and the treatment of such are made, there's a strong mystery element booming out of the screen.\r\n\r\nNaturally this is a tale full of weird, wonderful and scary characters, and with that comes equal helpings of brutality and tenderness. The key characters are very Poesque, all magnificently framed by the Gothic surroundings (where the design department have worked wonders), while Yatsko's photography is gorgeous or chilly as required. Cast come up trumps, the right blend of Gothic ham and emotionally driven portrayals. Savaged by many critics upon release, it has risen above that to gain a deserved fan base, the word of mouth on the street crucially preparing newcomers for the tone of the play. 7\/10","id":"588e3e0f925141184b00d92a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/588e3e0f925141184b00d92a","movie_id":207933}

The audio was fairly nice and the CGI is jumping out as the classy aspect of this movie. Impressive, really. The blue-key was not properly applied and it shows, badly.\r\n\r\nWe see a Jedi master, kind of Obi wan, and the prodigy, kind of like Anakin.

{"author":"mattwilde123","content":"'Still Alice' is a film that boasts a remarkable central performance from Julianne Moore. It tells the story of a University linguistics professor (Moore) as she is diagnosed a rare form of Auzheimer's disease.\r\n\r\nRichard Glatzer's direction of the movie can be viewed as a parallel to his own life and personal struggle as he lived with ALS disease. 'Still Alice' is full of emotive shots as the characters show care and support to Moore as she tries to continue juggling her career and family life with the disease. Aspects such as the music and cinematography is given a very straight-forward approach to allow the actors' performances to tell the story and to add a true to life direction.\r\n\r\nBased on the novel of the same name written by Lisa Genova, the screenplay is very faithfully adapted. The film really focuses on the story and the dialogue between the characters and some scenes and interactions are extremely moving thanks to how well it is written.\r\n\r\nJulianne Moore is perfect as the main character. She portrays her struggle with the disease with so much inner strength and dignity. Moore is supported by a solid cast such as Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart but are outshone by her brilliant performance.\r\n\r\nOverall, 'Still Alice' is a very good film. It is very touching and moving tale about coping with such a life changing and destructive disease.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"The one thing that this job has taught me is that truth is stranger than fiction.\r\n\r\nOut of Australia, Predestination is directed by Michael Spierig and Peter Spierig (who also scores the music). The Spierig's also adapt the screenplay from Robert A. Heinlein's story \"All You Zombies\". It stars Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook, Noah Taylor, Christopher Kirby and Madeleine West. Ben Nott is the cinematographer. \r\n\r\nIf we throw up a simple synopsis for this pic, it's about a time travelling agent who goes back in time to stop a killer known as \"The Fizzle Bomber\" - whilst helping a trans-gender man who has just told him a fascinating and emotionally wrought story. But simple is not a word readily associated with the Spierig's deliriously complicated mind meld of a movie. \r\n\r\nThe first half of film is the story being relayed by Snook to Hawke, and then the film spirals into a world of temporal loops and frazzled paradoxes. This demands the utmost attention from the viewer, a piece guaranteed to have you asking tricky questions, and also likely to have you rewinding some scenes for clarity - like I did!\r\n\r\nThis is not an actioner, this is very cerebral and sedate in tone, adult science fiction that's as audacious as it is clever. Snook is quite simply outstanding, the various layers she gives to her characterisations grip with intensity and emotional heart tugs. Hawke once again is reassuringly great - in that how he doesn't need to overact, he recognises the tone needed here, whilst knowing it's wise to let his co-star take the main stage.\r\n\r\nThematically the story blends its dizzying thoughts about time and its impact on the human race, with that of our basic human condition, that of identity. This is a very rewarding production for those who wont be popping off to make a cup of coffee during the viewing, it's hoped that in time this will garner more fans and be seen as something of a sci-fi gem. 8\/10","id":"573799f1c3a3682ae9000587","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/573799f1c3a3682ae9000587","movie_id":206487}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Robert Heinlein\u2019s classic short story \u2018All You Zombies\u2019 gets the big screen treatment as the basis for the Science Fiction time travel thriller \u2018Predestination\u2019, a notably imaginative film noir that craftily elevates the genre into an alluring confection. Australian cinematic siblings the Spierig Brothers (as in Michael and Peter) dutifully direct and adapt Heinlein\u2019s Science Fiction material into a twisty tale of search and suspense. It was reported that Heinlein wrote his intriguing narrative in one single day back in the late 1950s. Well, whatever the case is behind such speculation, it is clear that \u2018Predestination\u2019 is a competent and compelling time travel vehicle that deserves its inevitable comparison to the likes of Rian Johnon\u2019s solid and involving 2012 inventive spectacle \u2018Looper\u2019. \r\n\r\nThe Spierig Brothers and \u2018Predestination\u2019 lead Ethan Hawke (Oscar-nominated for \u2018Training Day\u2019 and \u2018Boyhood\u2019) collaborate once again as they bring together a surreal movie experience detailing with the agenda of a Temporal Agent going undercover as a barkeep known as The Bartender (Hawke) in an attempt to thwart criminal activities before they turn into actual crimes. It is worth noting that the Spierigs have coveted the zombies\/vampires sensationalism in their earlier films (\u2018Undead\u2019 and \u2018Daybreakers\u2019) but curiously side-swipe any references to these creatures in \u2018Predestination\u2019 despite the aforementioned \u2018All You Zombies\u2019 blueprint for inspiration. Perhaps this is a wise revelation as the Spierigs are allowed to concentrate on the ponderous SF aspects of human adventure within the varied dimensions of time, place and space.\r\n\r\nThe daring exposition gels both creatively and caustically because of the macabre mission being undertaken by the Bartender and feminine targeted scriber \u2018The Unmarried Mother\u2019 (as portrayed by Aussie actress Sarah Snook, \u2018Jessabelle\u2019). The agent Bartender is represented by a shadowy and roguish governmental outfit blessed with the ability to fight crime through time-traveling tactics. Unfortunately, the rough edges in preventing crime-ridden hedonism through time travel accessibility has not always been a smooth transition for the Agency. Also, it does not help that the constant policing corruption has spiraled out of control thus adding more pressure to the Agency to perform its watchdog duties tackling sinister plots.\r\n\r\nThere are revolving elements that shape \u2018Predestination\u2019 to become this enigmatic, head-scratching puzzle where the sense of encountering warped worlds are wondrous yet unsettling and weird. The Bartender (already a victimized and distressed pawn in the nefarious dealings of the id-70s New York City\u2019s elusive and crazed Fizzle Bomber) soon encounters a stranger betting him that he (or \u2018she\u2019 in certain cases) can provide the most outlandish story that he has ever heard to date. Soon the boastful stranger (Snook), a \u2018True Confessions\u2019 columnist for the written piece \u2018The Unmarried Mother\u2019, will figure into the Bartender\u2019s predestined existence in more ways than one.\r\n\r\n\u2018Predestination\u2019 is a complicated SF sideshow that touched upon some unconventional fodder that range from timely commentary pertaining to violence to topical issues of sexuality. The film skillfully presents the frailties of suspicion, apprehension and uncertainty within the tangled and playful web of time travel management. With all the nifty under-sized flashy special effects and Science Fiction trickery aside, \u2018Predestination\u2019 sparkles in large part to its committed and calculating performances by Hawke and Snook as the psychological bait that guides the audience into the transfixing insanity that persists within the confines of the storylines. In particular, Snook\u2019s \u2018Mother\u2019 is called upon to offer a complex characterization of an individual (both female and male genders) and take us into the nostalgic timelines of the past and present while conveying shades of toughness, vulnerability and mystique. She has a sordid backstory that unfolds and adds to the tormented trials and tribulations with the obsession of catching the scheming Fizzle Bomber. In a convincing supporting role, Noah Taylor\u2019s Mr. Robertson is instrumental in the development of Snook\u2019s triple identity crisis as Jane\/John\/\u2019Mother\u2019.\r\n\r\nThere certainly is an old-fashioned, spellbinding vibe about \u2018Predestination\u2019 that propels the Spierigs\u2019 trippy time-traveling spectacle to its climatic ambitions. The low-key production values are surprisingly engaging but overall the telling proof of acting, directing, writing and imagination seems to be a winning formula in conception. Of course, the other filmmaking strokes involving the crisp cinematography, soothing score and vibrant set designs further compliments this punchy actioner.\r\n\r\nDark, moody and visibly challenging, 'Predestination\u2019 gleefully plots and twists its way into a hearty submission of inspired Science Fiction contemplation. After all, time does not stand still for anybody especially in the realm of Australian noir SF sensibilities.\r\n\r\nPredestination (2014)\r\n\r\nSony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions\r\n\r\n1 hr.  37 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook and Noah Taylor\r\n\r\nDirected by: Michael and Peter Spierig\r\n\r\nRated: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction\/Time Travel thriller\/Sci-Fi crime caper\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** stars (out of four stars)","id":"5622f00d92514163d5000e97","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5622f00d92514163d5000e97","movie_id":206487}
{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"Predestination foreordained its paradoxical nature and exploited it with individuality. \u201cWhich came first: the chicken or the egg?\u201d. An evolutionary question, now the setup for many punchlines, that has transcended time itself. The causality dilemma that considers both cause and effect. Infinite regression. Unsolvable. What really shapes a person\u2019s biological anatomy or their metaphorical soul? Evolutionary diversity at birth or the nurturing of our surrounding environment? The aforementioned philosophical paradox is one which The Spierig Brothers held closely to the central plot that, on the surface may befuddle even the most avid sci-fi viewers, but dig somewhat deeper and find that the temporal trajectory is bursting with thematic representation. A time traveller is sent back to 1970s New York to prevent a terrorist, known only as the \u201cFizzle Bomber\u201d, from murdering thousands.\r\n\r\nTo mention certain plot strands, even touching upon their delicate coating, would be to spoil this ingeniously creative film. Therefore, as a precaution, I will not discuss the second half. Including the paradoxical plot twists of conception and death. This is a mind-bending sci-fi tale that purely excels when focussing on the human elements of its characters. Forget about the jarring tonal shift from exquisitely detailed flashback narration to sudden sci-fi extravaganza. Put aside the occasional heavy hand-holding (although justified for the dense concept) that unimaginatively explains the limitations of temporal shifting. Exclude the multitude of entrancing twists that seemingly allow the narrative to crumble towards its inevitable conclusion.\r\n\r\nPredestination works best when it\u2019s exploring the human condition. The drive that constitutes our soul. And a central focal point, but not the sole purpose, of the story is Jane\u2019s gender reassignment into becoming John. A \u201cwoman\u201d valued as intersex. Internalised male organs as well as female. Despite raising transgender issues and justifiably exploring the emotional conflict of such a scenario, it\u2019s never treated as unfamiliar territory. Much like the film in its entirety, it garners an identity. Enhancing accessibility by turning an irrelevant piece of fiction into a relevant transcendental concept. Snook gave an arousing performance of someone undergoing such a procedure. Harnessing female and male acting qualities and nudging them subtly through her performance.\r\n\r\nReturning to the preliminary question though, the eternally talented Hawke offers this dilemma to the prognosticating Snook, who simply replies \u201cThe Rooster\u201d. And yet whilst it was a humorous retort, it maps out the ingenious narrative cohesion that The Spierig Brothers moulded. That intimidating evolutionary deliverance, providing a cathartic allure of inevitability. They masqueraded causality through a simple life story told vividly within the confinements of a cigarette infused bar. Strangely, much like with other labyrinthine features, the second viewing allowed me to sniff out breadcrumbs more clearly. The hidden clues that the Brothers had deliberately positioned to reach the predetermined final destination. Extraordinarily clever.\r\n\r\nThe minuscule runtime should\u2019ve been extended to better build the narrative foundations from the weight of all the mind-blowing twists, but The Spierig Brothers defied genre expectations by pushing a time-orientated story to its limits. The conventional boundaries of storytelling now extended indefinitely, addressing common time travel related issues and exploiting them ingeniously. Intelligence prevails once again.","id":"5e21dad62811a10013a238fe","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e21dad62811a10013a238fe","movie_id":206487}
{"author":"artlawless","content":"This is a film based on the short story by Robert A Heinlein called All You Zombies. It's a fantastic film with a portrayal of paradoxes and the extent to which they can become convoluted if Time Travel was possible. And when I say Time Travel, I mean with the ability to interfere with the past and future, and not just witness. It's a tough movie to get your head around so be prepared to go back and watch it again. The cast is fantastic. _Ethan Hawke_ delivers as always. But we need to talk about _Sarah Snook_ - man she can act! She's the heart of the film and brings together the first half of the film so convincingly. It's rare that a film based on Time Travel is made without ugly holes in the plot. Predestination is one of those rare ones which is complete in its beginning and end.","id":"5c4815869251410e0a52e0f4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c4815869251410e0a52e0f4","movie_id":206487}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A tale of  friendship that blossomed at the final juncture.\r\n\r\nIt was quite some time I have not seen any Hilary Swank's movie. In this her role was very good one. Beside her's, another equally extended character played by Emma Rossum. As these two play the roles that defines the movie, which is more like the American and women's version of the French movie 'Intouchable'. I never heard of this film before, but got interested once I learnt about the storyline and of course the cast.\r\n\r\nI usually become a prey for tearjerker movies, but not for the intense emotional drama like this one and so it is won't expect you fall for it either. Based on the book of the same name which was probably a fictional work inspired by the real disease. It talks about a 36 year old ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) patient, Kate and her caregiver, Bec, especially their unlikely relationship and activities together in the final days. They two are exactly opposite, it's not the fate, but day by day growing their deep bond bring them very close when they share everything in life.\r\n\r\nA very good concept, but nothing new in the movie. Everything is already exhibited in other films. The only advantage is if you have not seen those in a large number. In my case, I like this kind of theme, so seen numerous in different languages. You are going to witness here a parallel storytelling in a different context with a fresh cast. But still the movie is captivating, because of excellent execution from both the cast and crew.\r\n\r\n> \"Why is it that we want the ones that don't see us.\r\n> Instead of the ones that do.\"\r\n\r\nThe let down was the rest of the characters. I don't know where they were, but totally discarded. It is understood that the husband and wife relationship was shattered because of the sacrifice. Friends and Parents, they have got ditched from the screenplay that won't happen in reality. The writers should have used them to create more sensational moments, but they had a different idea in mind to narrate the story. In a couple of places I felt Rossum had over-performed. In other hand, Swank was kind of attractive. I consider it a plus point to fix our face towards the screen, unfortunately she played a tragic role.\r\n\r\nDespite all the good and bad, it was one step ahead for both the lead women to get back to their positions as an actress, compared to their recent years form in the industry. It is not a popular movie, but it should have been. A movie about how to build a friendship and to fight a disease. A friendship that blossomed at the final juncture, nevertheless it fought hard till the last minute. That is the major difference in this film to others. Like I complained earlier, there's no parents or husband, all about told from the perspective of a friendship. If you want to try this, don't anticipate to a greater height and clear your mind before entering. Expectations are the major cause for all the disappointments.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"55cce592925141319000035e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55cce592925141319000035e","movie_id":290542}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"The one question that we want to ask after walking out of Pulivaal is \u2014 why can't Tamil film directors make a thriller film without including pointless songs and annoying comedy tracks? This film, an official remake of the Malayalam film Chaappa Kurishu (which was inspired from the Korean thriller Handphone), is a cat-and-mouse thriller between two men who are neither good nor bad, just victims of circumstances. Initially, we think of the rich Karthik (Prasanna) as a playboy (he even is planning to dump his co-worker Monika and marrying Pavithra, the girl his parents have in mind for him) and our sympathies are all with Kasi (Vemal), who works in a departmental store. But, halfway through, we start empathizing with Karthik while Kasi becomes a person who is toying with him. These slightly grey characters, who are the film's protagonists, make Pulivaal mildly refreshing.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with a nicely-edited montage (TE Kishore is the editor) of their daily lives \u2014 Karthik selects from a bunch of newspapers, while Kasi takes a peek at the day's news at the tea shop; Karthik takes a shower in his luxurious bathroom while Kasi has to wait in queue at the public toilet and fetch water to take a bath; and so on. And, Karthik, not surprisingly, owns an iPhone while Kasi uses a phone that is bound together by a rubber band.\r\n\r\nThe mobile phone is what sets the plot in motion as Karthik's iPhone ends up in the possession of Kasi. And, it is important for Karthik to retrieve the phone because it holds a video of him having sex with his employee Monika. Kasi, who has taken the phone on an impulse, is guilty and decides to return it, but, before he can do so he realizes that he can use Karthik to get back at people who are mean to him \u2014 like the hostile Valliappan (an irritating Thambi Ramaiah), his store manager. He also doesn't know how to use the phone but, can Karthik track him down before someone learns of the phone's content?\r\n\r\nThis is definitely a juicy plot and in Vemal and Prasanna, Marimuthu has actors who look their parts. And, yet, he slips because he cannot nail the tone required for this subject. He devotes a rather large amount of time on trivial elements that hamper the story's flow \u2014 like Valliappan's romance with a co-worker (with Ilaiyaraaja's songs turning into BGMs), Soori's comedy (which is a compilation of many SMS jokes), and out-of-place songs (that are unimaginatively picturized). Every time something tense happens, the actions cuts to some of these mundane scenes and so, we never really get involved with the story. It is only in the final 30 minutes that the film shows some signs of sticking true to its genre but, by then, it is too late.","id":"53bb184e0e0a26196e000280","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bb184e0e0a26196e000280","movie_id":255420}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"A remake of the Malayalam film Cocktail (which, in turn, was an unacknowledged lift of the Pierce Brosnan-Gerard Butler-starrer Butterfly On A Wheel), Athithi is about a couple, Mathiazhagan ( Nandaa) and Vasuki ( Ananya), whose life is turned upside down in a single day when a stranger ( Nikesh Ram, somewhat wooden) comes into their life. This guy tells them that he has their daughter and orders them to do the strangest of tasks if they want to see their daughter alive. \r\n\r\nThis is a solid line for an edge-of-the-seat thriller (think Aamir, but with a foe who is very much visible and present nearby) but Bharathan, who directed Azhagiya Tamizh Magan earlier, resorts to formulaic filmmaking \u2014 unwarranted songs and a comedy track featuring Thambi Ramaiah that kills tension like bucketfuls of water dousing a minor fire; there is even a 'thaali sentiment' scene (the Malayalam film did not have one). The whiplash editing tries to whip up some tension but it only feels desperate and overdone. \r\n\r\nAnd the needless epilogue only makes the film needlessly sexist. It punishes the woman who has transgressed while letting go of the man lightly. \r\n\r\nAnd, yet, the in-built mystery in the plot (who is the stranger, what does he want and why is he tormenting the couple and of course, how does it all end) somehow keeps us hooked and the film deserves some praise for the manner in which it makes us, the audience, shift our sympathies from the hunted to the hunter. But only just that little bit. Not more not less.","id":"53baa9e90e0a2676c700c046","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baa9e90e0a2676c700c046","movie_id":278259}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Haunted by the past, and so refusing to sail on.\r\n\r\nThe most of the people does not aware of this movie's existence. The only reason I went for it was Brittany Robertson. She's been around, but for the first time I noticed her in a major role was in 'The First Time'. Ever since I kind of liked her, so I had no reason to skip it despite whatever the response it got.\r\n\r\nBased on the book named 'Undiscovered Gyrl'. After finish watching this I felt the original title should have been borrowed instead, because that seems veracious to the narration. The story of a 18 year old girl who decides to blog in a fake name to hide her identity from family, friends and other known people. Because she wanted to write the whole truth about her life, especially to share her dark secrets. But is it safe to let the world know what kind of person she is?\r\n\r\nThe main character was confused between sex and relationship, and so the way it gets us as well. Mainly because of her haunting past. When it enters the final quarter, you probably won't remember the earlier events. The screenplay is not being perceptive, but had a bold plan to bring the curtain in a style. It was an unexpected twist that will make you go awe, but the biggest relief is it was only a fictional inspired by the reality of the internet culture the youngsters live-in everyday.\r\n\r\n> \"It's like we all want to be famous,\r\n> even though we're not good at anything.\"\r\n\r\nFrom her all the major characters so far, this one was the best Britt ever got to express deeply. The plot relies too much on the sexual journey, but there's no strong and disturbing scenes other than a couple of nude scenes. That does not approve teens to watch it, except the matured ones. Because of the movie theme I was hesitating in the initial parts and because of the ending I kind of liked entire film. One small twist changes the viewpoint of the whole narration. Remember, it perfectly imitated the web world as well.\r\n\r\nThe whole film was like a mathematical problem where one character stand in the middle and connects with four others directly. It's not going to solve it, but gives the formula to you do it and ends hinting with many possibilities. It does not make sure viewers understand it, but either way everything you predict is right as well as wrong. The significance of the storytelling was clear, that is to be a practical about the questions that never answered in the real world. You have to take all the clues and put together, because it all connected to main character's childhood. But still debate remains at the conclusion and so that is the way it is.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I did not like the movie from the beginning till the final scene. I thought it was better than the average, certainly not a bad movie. But after the movie, between the watch and this review, during recollecting bit by bit about the movie's purpose, I realised it was being rational in many perspectives, about social media and its safety. This film equals to the those real stories, all the credits must go to the author who is also the screenwriter and director of the film. I feel it is underrated, if you are a regular blog reader of mine, then you may know when I say definitely not to miss.\r\n\r\n7.5\/10","id":"55f718f9c3a3686cfd00ae56","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55f718f9c3a3686cfd00ae56","movie_id":271185}
{"author":"Reno","content":"Like I said in 'Song of the Sea' review, its a 3D animation dominated world. That's mainly in Hollywood, but trend spreading so fast everywhere. Even the Japan shifting gear from anime to 3D anime, I saw it in 'Space Pirate: Captain Harlock'. From a comic book to 2D animation is easy because they are much alike, but it's different when it comes to the 3D. I have seen Micky Mouse and Co transformed into 3D characters that I did not like, because some characters do not suit for that kind of leap. In Micky Mouse, the ears were the biggest drawback. But 'Tintin' was a success and so expecting 'Popeye' would do the same magic which is due next year (2016).\r\n\r\nI have seen all the 'Asterix & Obelix' movies so far from both the format, live-shot and animation, but this is the first 3D animation. I'm so happy that it came overall very well, every detail was retained. Even those mud-smoke\/dirt-smoke (whatever it's called) shown exactly as it to be which forms during their fight after the consumption of magic potion. That concept is for comic book, to make understand the readers the situation because the picture is still. But in a motion picture you can show the whole action, if they make that change the trademark will lose. So I must praise the technical side of the movie for the lossless transformation.\r\n\r\nIt's like a new beginning in the series in the 'Asterix & Obelix' franchise. Especially this story was not freshly written for the screen, but taken straight from one of the comic books in the series called 'The Mansions of the Gods'. In 3D animation, emotions, violence, comedies would be a little realistic. That's why the movie like 'Brave', 'Frozen', 'Up' appealed strongly on the sentimental side. Gaul's favourite food, the wild boar hunting was compromised, because children would be watching the movie and it might disturb on the softer side of them. Just like the filmmakers avoided the Giant's children and women in 'Jack the Giant Slayer'.\r\n\r\nOne of the best things in 'Asterix & Obelix' movies is that the movie might not be awesome, but still it entertains and keeps you engaged. You can't spot the flaws, in animation all are relevant. A man can jump 1000 feet high and leap a mile away. So if there should be something, that must come from the technical side. Since it (Gauls in 3D) is new and so much fun, you can't concentrate finding those faults or you will miss the actual enjoyment.\r\n\r\n> \u2018\u2018It's weird that the house looks like a box.\u2019\u2019\r\n\r\nAs usual the story set in the first BC. The Gaul's enemy the Romans comes with a new strategy to defeat them. They begin to build the large mansions near to their village and later to invade by seducing the community by the Roman culture. So the fight begins between them where the innocent civilians and black slaves get affect more. But Gaul's main intention is to keep the ecosystem unaffected, especially they're against the Romans modern fancy civilization. What happens to the Julius Caeser's 'Veni, Vidi, Vici' is the movie's final battle to disclose.\r\n\r\nProbably a best 'Asterix & Obelix' movie compared to the previous couple of movies. Good to see a non-Hollywood 3D animated movie with a great quality and doing well commercially as well. A whole family together watchable movie, not only for the children. Hoping for the a sequel, I mean very soon. All the above it was short and sweet which runs about 80 minutes. If you are a fan of this comic, you will love it, because lots of the frames look alike. Must be dedicated  to the fans.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"552e7638c3a36804cd000da0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/552e7638c3a36804cd000da0","movie_id":170522}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The second episode: A new case in the hands.\r\n\r\nA follow up to 'The Keeper of Lost Causes' based on the Danish crime-thriller novel of the same name in the original language. That one was a classy, a brilliant initiation in the 'Department Q' series. One of the best Scandinavian detective movie I have ever seen. I expected same energetic, caliber and suspenseful in this as well. But marginally disappointing, yet it stood and delivered to the previous film's standard.\r\n\r\nIn this second episode, it was a murder mystery for Carl and Assad to crack it down. They did not choose it, the case did. It was a long pending affair in the department, since then the world has changed a lot. But the father of twins murdered who investigated privately leaves all the required evidence to the Department Q team. Now, where these two deeply dedicated detectives begin, how they dig it and whether they reach the other end of the investigation to uncover everything is the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nWith a new target in the hands, the Department Q world expands further bigger than the first film. Takes us to the two decades earlier and narrates some of the key events by introducing new characters. So it also creates curiosity about the happenings around and sufficient suspense where it all went wrong. The prediction was not that hard, but without a clear picture of what happened, I simply failed to make a guess as I do always. The story holds everything back, that's a weak point, but very gripping with those thrilling going after scenes.\r\n\r\n> \"I never met anyone as destructive as him.\"\r\n\r\nToo much of flashbacks might be the reason for movie to lose the original appeal. It reduced Carl and Assad's screen-space. It was good for this particular plot to develop the story and characters, but did not help what Department Q theme is known for. That was not at all, certainly it was a good story, I'm not arguing with that, but the presentation was not charming enough and the dearth of fine action sequences was a little setback which was absolutely necessary in the cop themed films.\r\n\r\nThe movie was shot very well with maintaining the same tone from the first, along great performances by everyone. The difference between Carl and Assad remained, we should say it was maintained as it should be. In any two buddy cop movies, they are always antipodal characteristic. It was like a cliche, but brings the better outcome. These two guys together form a best homicide team in Copenhagen police department. Now the third character introduced in this part, a secretary who loosely hangs around, but out of the league from the perspective of story narration.\r\n\r\nVery much a Danish's answer to the Swedish's 'Dragon Tattoo' films. But in a way the two are not a comparable, if you do, then this one lacks in a long way. Because of the type of cop works are different with completely different universe and environment. After the first two films the director has changed for the third film, which is set to hit the screen in 2016. Hoping for 'A Conspiracy of Faith' to do much better than this one, because many more to follow if that succeeds.\r\n\r\n7\u00bd\/10","id":"562bc8739251412845004f63","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/562bc8739251412845004f63","movie_id":254201}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"The original Dead Snow movie was actually not that bad. It was quite okay within its somewhat confined genre. Dead Snow 2 however is a major disappointment. It abandoned all pretence of actually being a real horror movie and wandered into the land of pure comedy\u2026and failed miserably. This movie is like Bad Taste but on a higher budget (and regardless of what the fans want to pretend Bad Taste is a piece of shit movie).\n\nThe movie does have a plot that makes sense, again for this kind of movie, that has to be said but that lone does not make a good movie. There are literally NO really scary moments at all in this movie.\n\nThe movie has plenty of goory stuff. Actually the gore is pretty much thrown at the viewer from the first scene to the last. Unfortunately much of it is so ludicrous that it is embarrassing. To add to the embarrassment a bunch of absolutely nonsensical characters are thrown into the mix. The so called Zombie Squad is just pathetic. The Norwegian police office makes me squirm in my seat. The puking pet zombie makes me want to throw up my supper.\nThis movie is nothing but brain-dead people (and I am not talking only about the zombies here) and tasteless effects stacked onto each other. The only reason it does not get a single star is that there was one or two laughs in there and because some of the ludicrously overdone gory effects was not too bad from a technical point of view.\n\nAs I wrote it was a major disappointment. This movie can only appeal to the die hard fans of the genre or, with its frequent puking scenes, bad jokes and senseless gore to people who \u2026 well I will not go there actually.","id":"5a9eb9b50e0a2671f2013ee2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a9eb9b50e0a2671f2013ee2","movie_id":241842}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**An unusual team of two to fight the evil spirits!**\r\n\r\nThis was based on the real account. A cop from the New York who witnessed those unexplained events are what this film depicted for us. I think it is slightly an underrated film. Not because of true story, but from the entertainment perspective. From the beginning till the end, I enjoyed watching it. Horror means there's no big scary stuff in it, still being true to the genre, it told a decent story. It was well written and directed, a film that I almost missed, but now I can gladly suggest it to the others. But it is just an above average, yet worth a watch.\r\n\r\nThe story follows a cop who witnesses a series of strange events, which also influence his past. In the most of the case, he's trying to find one particular person, a painter seen in and around the city. So he and his partner finally find that strange man and when they do, it is already too late. One of them gets injured and the other one tries his best teaming up with a priest to fight the demon that terrorising the city. The film ends with an interesting event. Looks a sequel won't be a bad idea, since the duo is still fighting the devils as what the end statement reveals.\r\n\r\nThere's a recent television series I'm watching called 'Outcast' and this film is kind of resembles that. Anyway, this one came first, but what makes they both be alike is the unusual team up between two different field people. The series is like a follow-up of this film, or maybe inspired by this original story. Eric Bana is not everybody's favourite, but his films are quite enjoyable and for this, he had given his best. Co-stars are not bad either; particularly Edgar Ramirez was awesome as a priest. I hope you would find it interesting as I did. It would be beyond that for some, so all I say is watch it with a low expectations.\r\n\r\n_6.5\/10_","id":"57f40c4bc3a3680560000301","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57f40c4bc3a3680560000301","movie_id":184346}

{"author":"Reno","content":"Not bad, a decent flick for a debutant director. Like most of the positive reviews say, the movie delivered what was promised, a complete fun cruise (kappal) ride. If you look for a logic, then this movie is not for you, but for fun riot, you are in a right place. The production quality was not up to the standards. In many individual scenes it gives the outdated 90s look, not because it borrows songs from that period or the initial story set in rural. Actors were excellent, acceptable from the technical side of the movie and a one line story with a predictable ending.\r\n\r\nRecently I saw 'Someone Marry Barry', there's nothing common between these two movies as per my knowledge, but if you have seen that movie you would know what and who is Barry. So in this movie, there comes three Barrys against a person who is supposed to be our protagonist Vasu. How he and his lady love Deepika suffer from the three trouble giver on the purpose is the movie that explores throughout with out and out laughs.\r\n\r\nAlong with the couple, the VTV Ganesh's role had a great significant. All the youngsters around, Ganesh as a middle aged who gives advices to them is what lifted the value of having the pleasure. Vaibhav's best film till date, as in a single hero movie. He surprised me, and proved he can be very handy in the lead roles. Karunakaran is in a 'lookout' list of his successful comedy roles in the recent films.

They make movies for the domestic market only, just like the largest mango producer in the world and consumes it all with a 1% export rate. Even small countries that have no big market like India competes with the European standards. But in the recent times the changes have been seen, lots of parallel cinemas are made; is what called alternate to the masala films (mixed genres). The young generation supporting it, both from the audience and the filmmaker.\r\n\r\nThe sad thing is they're choosing a wrong movie to represent the country in the Oscars, so as a result ending up with a disappointment every time. I thought last year they failed to pick 'The Lunchbox' as similar to this one for this year. I don't know whether they would have won the trophy, but these films need to be recognised in a big stage like that. Making into the final five reveals all the India films are not random musical beats. So my point is India missed the bus to the venue Dolby Theatre Hollywood, LA, USA for the second consecutive time.\r\n\r\nThis film feels like a feather fallen out of the British film 'Slumdog Millionaire', but it was totally a different genre except sets in and about the slum kids. A simple story, yet very moving. Two young brothers go regularly to pick the crow's egg in an vacant site near their slum since they can't offer chicken eggs. When the place is bought by a largest pizza chain in the city to bring up their new branch, the kids fix their mind to taste their first pizza and put all the effort to make it happen. But again, they have to face all the odds and that's where the narration takes the turn before heading the end.\r\n\r\n> \"I want pizza too, not dad.\"\r\n\r\nWithout the prior experience the two kids were so awesome in their performances. They two won the best child actor award at the Indian Academy Awards, including the film as the best children's movie of the year. The debutant director really did a great job, especially knowing there's no mass market for newcomers. I think the producers, Dhanush and Vetrimaran to appreciate for this movie to happen. No doubt why it did better at foreign markets than the local. Especially Kollywood does good in the East and Southeast Asia, unlike Bollywood that dominates Europe and North America.\r\n\r\nYou know why this little film is a must see, because Indian films are known for different standards to the rest of the world, but when they make one out of their comfort that puts automatically a must watch. That's not the only reason, there are hundreds of themes yet to explore in Indian cinema and this is one of that. Like the two cute movie characters and their one innocent task, the scenes and music were well supported throughout.\r\n\r\nSome of the domestic issues that India is suffering from long back like the social status brought into the light with this. There's no equal respect in society for all the communities, only it is judged by their lifestyle. Most of the third world's social backward is only for this reason and obviously the lack of basic education. So it is really good when a movie is not only identified for its entertainment, but the message it carried out. It is an adorable, smart, funny, emotional, enjoyable family movie and one of the best of 2015 other than the Hollywood's or English language films. In the world cinema fanatic circuit, Indian films is the least followed, but this one is not to be missed.\r\n\r\n9.5\/10","id":"56d9b0829251412e28005339","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56d9b0829251412e28005339","movie_id":264038}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Like a pizza, Manikandan's Kaaka Muttai is multi-layered; on the surface, it is all warm and inviting \u2014 a feel-good film about two kids and their simple desire and the earnestness in the filmmaking invites comparision with Iranian films like Children of Heaven. Then, there is a hard base to it as well and from time to time, the film turns into a commentary on the class divide in our society and how it is exploited by wily politicians, an allegory of the effects of globalization, and even a satire on media's obsession with sensationalism, a la Peepli Live.\r\n\r\nThe story begins with a plot of land which acts as a playground to the kids in the slum being sold off to make way for a pizza outlet. The pizza place is opened by a film star (Simbu in a cameo) and the enticing visuals of the pizza create a burning desire in these two boys (the terrific debutants Ramesh and Vignesh) who cannot even afford the normal egg and resort to drinking crow's egg (hence their nicknames \u2014 Chinna Kaaka Muttai and Periya Kaaka Muttai) to buy and eat a pizza. The lads' father is in prison, their mother (young Aishwarya Rajesh boldly taking on the role of a mother of two) is running the show at home with great difficulty and their grandmother is almost an invalid.\r\n\r\nBut on hearing their wish, an empathetic railway lineman called Pazharasam ( Joe Malloori), lets them take (read steal) the coal from the yard, and they start hoarding the money they earn by selling it. But after being driven out by the security at the pizza outlet because they are \"kuppathu pasanga\" and dressed in rags, there begins another round of chasing after money \u2014 this time, to buy new clothes. They manage that as well but at the pizza shop, the manager slaps one of them and tells them to buzz off. This incident, however, is captured on a mobile phone and soon, it turns into a media-fuelled, raging controversy. The small-time thief and his cohort (RJ Ramesh and Yogi Babu portraying characters who come across as a modern-day take on some of the characters played by Goundamani and Senthil) in the locality decides to use the video to blackmail the owner ( Babu Antony), the local MLA decides to get some political mileage out of it, the media grows a conscience and starts talking about class divide, and the shop's owner strikes a deal with the cops to hush up the issue, while the boys, who fear their mother might come to know of their embarrassment, go missing. The film does seem a little less sure when the boys are offscreen, but Manikandan manages to tie up all these strands with an ending that is not only satisfactory but also heartwarming.\r\n\r\nManikandan seems to have the knack to make even the most mundane interesting and it is evident right at the very start of the film when the two boys playfully take turns to read out the statutory warning against smoking and drinking. Much of the humour in the film comes from sharp observations. For example, the ration shop can provide two television sets but when it comes to rice, \"adutha vaaram dhaan varum\"; when the boys diss the homemade 'pizza' that their grandma has made for them saying, \"Pizza-la nool noola varum aaya\", she retorts, \"Kettu pona dhaan nool noola varum\"; a woman asks her neighbour to come for a protest because they will get biriyani and money; a friend of the pizza shop owner who keeps making inopportune remarks. The gags are also on their mark \u2014 the politician giving bytes dressed in lungi, the boys nonchalantly walking past a TV reporter without realizing that she is talking about them, a drunken man being taken to his home on a toy car, a TV anchor cutting off a panellist every time he tries to make his point and moving on to a break or worse, showing the video again...\r\n\r\nThe director also doesn't shy away from showing us some of the darker aspects of poverty \u2014 one of the kids in the slums cunningly steals mobile phones from the footboard passengers of passing trains; the thief and his cohort steal the manholes from apartments and sell them to make money; even the cable connection in the boys' home is acquired illegally. And, the two lads themselves reach a point where their ravenous need to somehow taste a pizza (one of them even tells their mom, \"Pizza dhaan venum... Appa venaam\" when she talks about how she doesn't have the money to get him out on bail) forces them to think of taking up crime to get the money required. There is also squalour and abject poverty (though, the camera and the scenes never linger long for us to feel squeamish; this is, after all, meant to be a feel-good film, as evident from the jaunty score) \u2014 the boys' one-room home with a curtain separating the living room and the toilet, the Cooum serving as their pool, the lack of money to arrange the funeral of a departed one... A different film might have used all these elements to give us a heavy-duty social drama that would have only ended up as the 836th time a 'socially-conscious filmmaker' holding a mirror to our society and hectoring us for our callousness.\r\n\r\nRefreshingly, Manikandan refrains from doggedly going for our tear ducts in his portrayal of the lives of these underprivileged (though, there are a couple of deserving moments that brings us to tears); he also doesn't indulge in heavy-handed sermonising or needlessly attacking the haves (we even get a boy from a well-to-do family who is sort-of friends with the boys to the extent of saving a slice of pizza for them \u2014 though the older one refuses to take it deeming it a leftover) and instead presents things mostly in a matter-of-fact manner. Yes, there is difficulty and sorrow in their lives, but there is also an abundant amount of ingenuity, endless optimism, and indefatigable spirit and this is what makes these characters memorable and helps the film soar.","id":"559769b0c3a36855d4000b12","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/559769b0c3a36855d4000b12","movie_id":264038}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> If you give your 100%, the rest of the team will do the same.\r\n\r\nI have seen many historical-biopics from Hong Kong, China, Japan, Korea, but I don't know much of Taiwan history. In fact everything I learnt about the world was mostly through watching movies like this. It was not about war or the freedom fighters, but based on the real story of an under-performed multi-racial baseball team that hit a headline in the 1931 after qualifying to play in a championship.\r\n\r\nBaseball is not a widely popular in the world like football or cricket, except in a few countries. I have seen many baseball movies, but I never understood the game clearly. That never stopped me enjoying the inspiration, the player's passion towards the game and the entertainment it offered. This is not the best baseball movie I have ever seen, but definitely one of the best among them. I never heard this movie before, but once came to know, I was desperate to give it a try.\r\n\r\nSets in when Taiwan was still under the Japanese colonial rule. A high school baseball team called Kano had never won a single game before receives a new strict disciplined coach from Japan. The team's fortune is about to change when the coach Kondo boosts his player's confidence by his method of training. With the initial struggle, they get to taste their first victory. Later the team head to Japan to represent the island in a big tournament. That brings to an end to the narration by revealing their underdog tag to winning the hearts of the fans in an unknown territory with their great consistence performances.\r\n\r\n> \"Don't think about winning. Think about not losing.\r\n> Then you will have all the strength you need.\"\r\n\r\nAn inspiring movie, about the self-confidence and hard work. But I had my disappointments as well with its exaggerated screen presentation. In the many parts, the sentimental cinematic overdose without the realistic appeal made me consider it is nothing less than a commercial film. You know, making the tight fist, teeth biting, sharp look, those things give the audience unnecessary goosebumps. Maybe if you're a native, it might give a patriotic uplift. Other than that I loved the background score, very pleasing camera work and the countryside location, good performances by all, very decent direction and overall a satisfying movie,.\r\n\r\nHistorical subject means, there should always be some amount of graphics to recreate the past eras and this film had a weakness in that field, but those parts were totally ignorable which mostly comes in the backgrounds. I think 180 minutes is a too long for these days films. That's an achievement for you if you succeed watching without losing your focus. We can comfortably sit for that long for a commercial movie, because commercial films means entertainment, but this one was depicting the real story and for a sports movie it does not look good. I am saying that because of the third act and the ending.\r\n\r\nKnowing the history through a movie is good, better than learning in the school, but when it tumbles to meet the viewer's expectation, surely trouble arises. Because all the people are not the same to accept whatever the movie delivers, simultaneously being practical to original events is very essential. If it avoided those cinematic gimmicks, I would have considered it an unexpected masterpiece. I love this movie for being just a movie and historical account, but I expected more honest with the screen presentation. An a movie fanatic, I definitely recommend it, but personally, I let you decide yourself. Because the way it ends, most people easily get upset for spending 3 hours. \r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"56f3f1f392514176c5001a46","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56f3f1f392514176c5001a46","movie_id":256930}
{"author":"tun_nakiwa","content":"The Good, the Bad and the Comedy \r\n\r\nPierre Andre often searches for something different in each of the film he directs; this time around he presents a film just as remarkable as his previous ones. The storyline for \"Kasut Ku Kusut\" is easy for the audience's minds to digest. However, the often used word \"Bapok\" might not sit well with most audience. The characters that shine most in the film is no doubt the ones played by Shaheizy Sam and Along Eyzendy. The comedic characters that they play: Village youngsters, who speak with a heavy Perak accent, will no doubt tickle the audience's funny bones. The character played by Kamarool Haji Yusoff is just as impressive as he is seldom seen taking on a comedic part. The film about a 'messy' shoe affair turns messier with the chase scene - all because of a misunderstanding over a pair of stolen shoes.\r\n\r\nCredit http:\/\/www.cinema.com.my\/movies\/details.aspx?search=2014.10038.kasutkukusut.19509","id":"54c0ca769251416e6000aae9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54c0ca769251416e6000aae9","movie_id":315122}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Kochadaiiyaan opens with a prologue that tells us that the two kingdoms, Kottaipattinam and Kalingapuri, have been at war with one another for generations. We see a boy from Kottaipattinam, who is about to drown, being rescued and the boy, Rana, grows up to become a soldier in Kalingapuri. He earns the friendship of the prince Veera Mahendran, and is made the general of its army. He seeks the king's permission to attack their enemy nation but on the battlefield, Rana reveals himself to be the son of Kochadaiiyaan, the famed general of Kottaipattinam and admits that he enacted a drama to rescue the soldiers of his motherland, who were being held as slave labourers there. Rana is received with joy by his king and even gets him to marry the prince to his sister, but he also has an ulterior motive \u2014 to kill the king, who had unfairly sentenced his father to death.\r\n\r\nKochadaiiyaan succeeds not because of technology but because of the writing. The film is motion capture 3D computer-animated but the animation is primeval; both the motion capture and the texture of the visuals are closer to The Polar Express than Avatar or Tintin. The long shots aren't problematic but whenever the camera cuts to a close-up, we are drawn to the inanimate nature of the expressions. The characters feel like caricatures of the real-life actors we have known. The movements of the actors, too, are robotic (in dance numbers, it feels like the characters are doing yoga), and the detailing is far from perfect, especially for characters in the background.\r\n\r\nThere is also inconsistency in the animation. Some of the scenes seem to have sheen while in some the perspective fluctuates; there are times when a boulder looks as big as the man standing on it and blades of grass look like miniature paddy plants. But the sweeping camera work, the proficient voice over work by the actors, and the energetic background score compensate for these blemishes.\r\n\r\nOnce the plot kicks into gear, the animation takes a backseat and the narration starts to hold our attention. The songs and the stunts are woven into the story and do not stick out. Like any other Rajini movie, Kochadaiiyaan, too, worships its star. His character appears in almost every scene and there are fan-pleasing moments in the form of stylistic gestures and dialogues.\r\n\r\nThe story initially seems like a typical simplistic revenge fantasy (a son avenging his father's death) but as the plot progresses, we realize it is a bit more complex than that. The film actually ends by leaving its lead character in a moral dilemma. His family has served the king and protected him for generations but now, the son has acted otherwise. What fate does his action beget him? What happened to Rana's elder brother who has vanished mysteriously? Where is his friend who abdicated the throne to marry the girl he loved and chose to leave his kingdom? Will the enemy prince that Rana let live return? With such interesting questions, Soundarya has set up the knot for a deserving sequel.","id":"53baad0d0e0a2676bf00bc34","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baad0d0e0a2676bf00bc34","movie_id":256968}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Some friendship comes fast to scar on your life.**\r\n\r\nVery close to being a French version of the 2003 movie 'Thirteen'. About two 17-year-old girls, Charlie, a privacy girl with the asthma and the new arrival, Sarah, a sarky with the mystery background. A fresh friendship bloom unexpectedly between them, they begin to share everything. As fast they become close, the each others secret reveals, with the same speed a series of conflict forces them away with hatreds. Once again a movie based on the novel of the same name. Melanie Laurent's 2nd movie from the director's chair and she outclassed it.\r\n\r\nIntense drama, from the beginning to the end. The story concentrates only these two girls, their first meet, relationship development and the story's conclusion. Very rarely other characters come into the frame with little to deliver speech and exhibit the act. The first half of the film exactly like the first half of the 'Heavenly Creatures'. Closely showcases the two girl's establishments of an unbreakable bond who do lots of mischievous stuffs together. And the second half was like the second half of 'Thirteen'. The fierce battle like environment like the usual catfight, but fairly avoids the overdose which makes a worthy whole.\r\n\r\n> With you, I feel bad. I lie, I am hard.\r\n> You make me play the bad guy. It's unbearable. \r\n\r\nWhat makes a two best friends (girls) hate each other, a boy? That's how the story switched from one way to another, a turning point in the storytelling. But this film was not all about fighting for a boy, there's something else which was the backbone to the narration. Weaknesses becomes a pointed gun to the face to deal with. The circle of to be victimized and be a victim was relatively balanced. The incomprehensible teen emotions take the story with the sequences of blames and absolves.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't get is in the most of the movies is at the end why the film character sees the camera. This doubt is because the whole film explains something, but that final frame gives a different dimensional meaning. Maybe the indication of reform, like that happens in the coming-of-age movies either good way or bad. So, according to this movie... Sorry, you have watch to know it.\r\n\r\nImpressive display by the lead two girls. Music, locations, everything was fine and holds the story till the last minute with same the intensity, then all the sudden releases it with a shocking twist. It was so quick and unexpected at that moment. So there's where I was disappointed a bit. The end should have been a more suitable one than preferable for a strong finish. But no complaints for the rest, a good teen drama which presents the evolution of love and trust to hate and disgust between two characters.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"5575eb19925141403100494a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5575eb19925141403100494a","movie_id":270400}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Think of Pasupathy's cinema-crazy character in Veyyil. Now, take Pasupathy's character from Kuselan, and make this character as the one who has to go and meet his childhood friend, who is now a celebrity. Merge these two characters together and voila, you have Sasikumar's character in Bramman.\r\n\r\nHe plays Siva, a man who has a fascination for cinema since childhood and runs a rundown movie theatre in Coimbatore. Screening the latest releases is an unaffordable proposition for him and so, along with his friend Nandhu, he shows older films of the same stars or with the same titles (Rajini's Billa instead of Ajith's, Friends instead of Nanban). But success eludes him. He falls in love with Gayathri (Lavanya), a college student. With his theatre in financial trouble and facing the prospect of being shut down for good, he goes to Chennai to meet his childhood friend Madankumar ( Naveen Chandra), who is now a successful film director, and seek his help. How this pan out forms the plot of this listless melodrama that tries to be a paean to both films and friendship.\r\n\r\nEver since he dazzled us with his debut, Subramaniapuram, Sasikumar's career has been one of diminishing returns and the blame should squarely lie with the director-actor, who has become more concerned with projecting himself as a mass hero, despite trying to convince us otherwise. This film even features a scene where a character asks 'Nee enna periya hero-va' and Sasikumar retorts 'Naan ennikkume appadi sonnadhilla'. If it was the rustic ruffian archetype in his previous release Kutti Puli, here, he takes on a lover boy avatar in the first half, and gets back to his by-now familiar natpu philosophizing in the second half. That is not necessarily bad, but Socrates's script is so uninspiring and his staging very TV serial-like that even an interesting development (Siva goes to an office to meet Kumar and ends up with the offer of directing a film) feels monotonous. Even the romantic track plays out in an oft-seen manner, with Siva wooing Gayathri in the company of Nandhu, and Santhanam does his usual job of providing the wisecracks to keep us mildly entertained.","id":"53bb19320e0a26197c0002ce","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bb19320e0a26197c0002ce","movie_id":259277}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"\"Wedding planning? Will that work out here?\" Sakthivel asks Shruthi Subramaniam, as she reveals her business plan. \"Why not? Isn't marriage universal?\" she shoots back, and for a moment, it feels like this is the sort of conversation that the makers of Aaha Kalyanam would have had before remaking Band Baaja Baaraat. The genre of the film \u2014 romance \u2014 is universal, and romance is what drives most of our movies to an extent. So, it is not really surprising that this remake works fine. That said, however, like the concept of wedding planning, the film too feels a little alien, and we don't really fall in love with it entirely.\r\n\r\nThe chief reason for this is the casting \u2014 Vaani Kapoor hardly looks like a Tamizh ponnu and her lip sync is often amiss that, despite her making it up with her expressions, we do not get attached to the character of Shruthi. Nani is certainly better, though his whiny accent screams Telugu (which the director cheekily acknowledges through a comment from a character) but he manages to compensate for it with wit and roguish charm. The innumerable songs and the overpowering background score (by Dharan), too are Bollywood-ish while the wedding festivities, for all the colour and flair, feel more North Indian.\r\n\r\nAnd, yet, for all these flaws, Aaha Kalyanam manages to hold your interest and that is mainly because of Habib Faizal's winning script. Debutant Gokul Krishna sensibly sticks faithfully to the original and lets the inherent drama in the script drive the story. The plot involves the classic romance movie set-up \u2014 opposite characters getting attracted to each other \u2014 and the wholesome characterization of the leads gives the film some punch.\r\n\r\nTwenty-year-old Shruthi is, by nature, a planner. She has decided what she wants to take up as a career, has charted how she will go about achieving it and has even decided when she will give it up to marry as per her parents' wishes. Meanwhile, Sakthi is clueless about the future. All he knows is that he doesn't want to take up his family's business \u2014 farming. So, he is captivated by Shruthi's idea of turning a wedding planner and tries his best to partner with her. She seems to like his insouciant charm and takes him aboard Getti Melam, her wedding planning company, but is very particular that their financial arrangement shouldn't become a romantic tangle. But, this being a love story, that inevitably happens, when the two, during a night of drunken revelry, end up in bed. The morning after, she is smiling at the development while he is confused about the transgression. After all, hadn't she wanted not to let their friendship get to the next level? He becomes indifferent while she gets resentful and soon, they part ways, setting up their own businesses (and floundering). But when an opportunity comes up their way to get together again, will they take it up and finally express their actual feelings to one another?\r\n\r\nIt is not a spoiler to say that they do (this is a breezy romance after all) but the film manages to reach this point with enough interesting twists that make it worth a dekko.","id":"53bb190f0e0a26197100026a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bb190f0e0a26197100026a","movie_id":251898}

A police officer who is suspected to have become this brigand's man has gone underground and a team of cops (Richard, Bharani and co) are sent to the forest to capture\/kill him. One of the cops wants to murder Richard for a mind-boggling personal reason. They meet Akhila (Arundhati), a woman who claims to live in the forest, who, they think is a prostitute and so, want to sleep with. If ever there is an award for the most juvenile and incompetent movie cops, this bunch will win it hands down. As for Akhila, she is more than willing to sleep with the whole lot and even has come prepared with a bag of condoms!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in a parallel track, we have a young woman Dhamini (Manochitra), who agrees to be driven to the same forest by Sivaji, a debauched car driver (in favour of another driver who asks the same amount), even though she sees that he has sex prostitutes in the car and tells openly that he will try to bed her as well.

It is unashamedly crass, exploitative and downright sexist. The camera always moves lustily over the contours of the bodies of the two heroines, who are given the skimpiest of outfits; at least, Manochitra is given a knee-length skirt and a top, but all that Arundhati has is a sleeveless vest that somehow manages to stretch to her thighs (it's not much different from Vadivelu's costume in the popular comedy scene in Vetri Kodi Kattu). The performers are all terrible; Vemal sleepwalks through his role while Richard seems indifferent even when he has stepped on a landmine. The only one who manages to actually act and walk away from this debris honourably is Prasanna, but his sincerity seriously looks out of place. Maybe, that is why the director felt obliged to add the 'Special Appearance' tag to his name in the credits.","id":"53baaa920e0a2676b800b9d3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baaa920e0a2676b800b9d3","movie_id":262966}

Bad Neighbours is neither a 1\/10 or a 7 - 8 - 9\/10 movie, it's sits somewhere in the middle at averageville station still awaiting the signal for go.\r\n\r\nTrying to pitch together frat comedy and middle aged comedy worries is a dangerous idea, more so when the entire film comes off as a sketch show. Too many gags fall flat on their face here, the makers straining too hard to make something viable for a cross generational audience to laugh at. It mostly feels like ad nauseum, like we have been here before, seen it before and worn the tight fitting t-shirt.\r\n\r\nRose Byrne and Seth Rogen deserve better than this, yet they are the only ones keeping the picture watchable, where even as they are forced to fumble around with weak willed gross - cum - sex comedy sketches (improvised or otherwise), there's a pull from them that at least gives off a grounded reality vibe. There's also a couple of comedy gold moments, of which do not need to be spoilt here.\r\n\r\nSo it's not a total loss per se, but its comedy longevity is sure to be brief. 5\/10","id":"54fc1a4ec3a36869cf0043ec","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54fc1a4ec3a36869cf0043ec","movie_id":195589}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"His debut film Sillunu Oru Kaadhal was largely a middling effort remembered mostly for AR Rahman's songs but with Nedunchalai, Krishna shows that the unevenness of that film could have been a case of nerves of a first-time director working with a star. For, this film is certainly a surefooted effort that shows that this director can tell an engaging tale. Like his debut film, this one too is a wistful journey of a character \u2014 if it was a man's longing for a lover in the earlier film, this one is about a man's regret over his action. \r\n\r\nThe setting is the mid eighties and the plot revolves around a ruffian who is a better man than whom he seems to be, an always fashionable conceit in Tamil cinema. Here, it is Tarpaulin Murugan (Aari), a highway robber, who steals from lorries that ply on the highway near Periyakulam. He is so skillful that the lorry owners re-route their vehicles to go through a newly constructed highway, which becomes beneficial for Manga ( Shivada), a young and enterprising dhaba owner. Meanwhile, the place gets a new cop, Masanimuthu (Prashant Narayanan), who is as crooked as they come \u2014 the kind of cop who will smoke ganja while on duty, demand servitude from a black marketer, Maatu Sekar (Salim Kumar), in exchange for his protection and even plan a robbery. \r\n\r\nHe lusts after Manga and tries to fuel a tiff between her and Murugan, who loathes him completely, for his benefit. But Murugan double crosses him, and saves Manga from dishonour and this makes her fall for him. This enrages Masanimuthu, who plots his revenge by making Murugan the scapegoat in a robbery involving the goods of a fearful big shot. \r\n\r\nFrom the characterization of the hero (right down to his costumes) to the tragic climax, the shadow of Ameer's Paruthiveeran looms large on Nedunchalai, and this is both its strength and weakness. Hewing to the template of that film (a bold girl falling in love with a ruffian and trying to lead him away from his life of crime), with a dash of Subramanipuram (friend turning foe) thrown in, Krishna creates a film that holds your interest despite the predictability. Credit for this is also due to the creepy performance of Prashant Narayanan (who, in certain angles, seems like a cross between Daniel Balaji and Suriya) and Salim Kumar, who, as the slimy Maatu Sekar, is equally remarkable. \r\n\r\nSadly, their performances also make the lead characters less interesting. Aari, who looks radically different from the lover boy in Maalai Pozhuthin Mayakkathiley, tries his best to make Murugan a badass but the character lacks charisma and we don't really empathise with him as much as we should. Manga is a little better. She isn't an unscrupulous person (she passes off beef as mutton in her dhaba and in one scene, we see her stealing from a vendor) but her character becomes like that of a typical filmi heroine when she falls in love with Murugan. \r\n\r\nOne reason why the film is less effective is that Krishna uses the flashback as the device to narrate his story and considering that the narrator (an old man telling this tale to a couple of lorry drivers during their journey to Delhi) often speaks about what has happened in a remorseful manner, we are not truly startled by the time the climax arrives as we know how the story will unfold. This device also feels redundant because the two lorry drivers, who are essentially the audience stand-ins, have no other use than to utter dialogues that only want to suggest how we need to feel over what we have seen and what we might see next (there is even a reference to Krishna's first film). The climax is a letdown because it feels contrived; the director seems to have decided on how the film has to end and so, the developments don't feel organic. Given that he has shown us Maatu Sekar a man who has no qualms about doing anything as long as it earns him money, we expect him to provide the final twist but Krishna brings in a character who has been in the sidelines for the entire movie to do this task and that makes the end less convincing.","id":"53bab1090e0a2676cf00bce1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bab1090e0a2676cf00bce1","movie_id":260762}

I consider him one of the worst, according to my taste in actors and their performances.

The two unmatched set of the cast that did not pay off as one as what the audience wanted, the fun. So it is kind of mixed feeling to me about the movie like half enjoyed.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Film making could be the windows of the soul...\r\n\r\nDirected by Tim Burton and written by Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski, Big Eyes brings to the screen the story of artist Margaret Keane (Amy Adams), who was producing a number of paintings of waifs with big eyes that captured the art world's imagination. Unfortunately her charlatan husband (Christolph Waltz) manipulated the interest in her work to claim it as his own, leading to Margaret having to front up to the lie and take the case to court.\r\n\r\nQuite often the beauty of filmic cinema is that it can bring notice to the public about certain topics in history. The story of Margaret Keane is a story well worth telling, it may not be all encompassing as a biography since it is just about the key part of her life, but getting the story out there is to be applauded. I myself knew nothing about the Keane case, but I'm glad I do now, this film adaptation forcing me to seek out further reading on the subject.\r\n\r\nIt actually doesn't matter if you have a bent for art on canvas (me, but I do find those paintings beautifully beguiling), this is more about the human spirit, the crushing of such and the birth of. However, sadly to a degree the film often seems at odds with itself via tonal flows. There's whimsy where there shouldn't be, the drama should be front and centre, whilst Waltz's performance is awfully cartoonish, way too animated, and these problems are laid firmly at Burton's door, an odd choice of director for the material, it's like they felt the off kilter look of the paintings marked Burton as a shoe-in to direct.\r\n\r\nConversely he gets a sparkling turn out of Adams, she plays Margaret as being so vulnerable but radiant, yet she's perfectly infuriating as well, tugging our heart strings whilst troubling our anger senses. It's the strength of Adams' turn that steers Big Eyes away from choppy waters, for even as the court case that makes up the finale is given too little time to breath and make the ultimate mark, Adams as Margaret holds her own court and seals the deal for a big uplift - which in turn marks Big Eyes out as a film of great warmth and importance. 7.5\/10","id":"568f6e1ac3a3683251001946","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/568f6e1ac3a3683251001946","movie_id":87093}

{"author":"mattwilde123","content":"This film tells the story of an over-the-hill actor called Riggan Thomson (brilliantly portrayed by Michael Keaton) who was once the star of a superhero blockbuster franchise known as 'Birdman'. We are shown his journey into making a Broadway production starting with the initial rehearsals and read-throughs. What follows is a brilliant exploration of celebrity culture in an intriguing and satirical way.\r\n\r\n'Birdman' could essentially be looked at as one continuous long shot. The camera constantly weaves around the actors and action and so the audience are completely immersed into the perspectives of the various characters (mostly Riggan's). The opening shot plays like a scene in Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Boogie Nights' as it delightfully establishes the narrative in a fluid and polished style whilst introducing the cast and their entertaining interchanges during a rehearsal with hilarious consequences. \r\n\r\nThe editing throughout the picture is almost flawless when moving from scene to scene and has a dizzying effect much like Gasper No\u00e9's 'Irreversible'. 'Birdman' also boasts some marvellous special effects throughout such as when Riggan (Keaton) is alone and being taunted by his egotistical alter-ego. The film shows up typical blockbuster action movies by asking the audience what they want and giving it to them in a manner which embraces the excitement and epic-ness of the genre whilst also poking fun of the conventions.\r\n\r\nThe music that accompanies the film is very scarce in a lot of places adding emphasis to the dialogue and situations arising but, in some cases, an erratic and improvisational drum riff can be heard (occasionally accompanied with the drummer on the set) which completely adds to the eccentricity and spontaneity of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is very intricately written and contains many profound philosophical speeches about art, celebrity and criticism. There are monologues and debates by characters in which they discuss the core beliefs of the film such as Riggan's speech during his performance of his Raymond Carver play \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\".\r\n\r\nThe whole narrative of the film is very intriguing and interesting. There is a perfect blend of comedy and poignancy. There are a lot of twists and ambiguity throughout the film which could be analysed and interpreted for a long time.\r\n\r\nMichael Keaton is fantastic as the protagonist and gives a performance that would have given his career a huge revival (his squeal is my highlight of the film). The parallels with the character's career and that of Keaton's could not have been a mistake and gives the performance that much more edge. Edward Norton plays the method actor from hell (Mike Shiner). He is annoying, snobbish and smug and played brilliantly by Norton who excels in the vileness and pomposity of the character.\r\n\r\nThe film is very much about actors. The self obsessive nature of acting is definitely highlighted by the two central performances but there is also a cast that really help to deliver the film's meaning such as Emma Stone, Zach Galifianakis, Andrea Riseborough and Naomi Watts.\r\n\r\nOverall, 'Birdman' is a fantastic film. It is filled with pathos and profound imagery whilst keeping the viewer thoroughly entertained throughout.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd","id":"58c14e9ec3a3687da8004a11","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c14e9ec3a3687da8004a11","movie_id":194662}

{"author":"Matthew Brady","content":"\"I'm nothing. I'm not even here.\"\r\n\r\nThe story to Birdman is about an wash up actor (Michael Keaton) - famous for portraying an iconic superhero - as he struggles to mount a Broadway play. In the days leading up to opening night, he battles his ego and attempts to recover his family, his career, and himself.\r\n\r\nOkay in my review of Whiplash I bought this movie up mid way through the review just to give a heads up of when I'm going to watch it, because Birdman was my most anticipated film of 2014. But just like every time I really wanted to see a film so baldy I have to wait for a while until I finally get a chance to watch it, story of my life really. But anywhere, I was really looking forward to this movie ever since September, and now finally seeing the film I can safely say that Birdman is one of the best movie of 2014.\r\n\r\nI always know that Micheal Keaton was the kind of movie star that will pick any random movie role just because... well he what's to be important and still show to everyone that he still got it, I guess. Early last year he was in two movies that were pretty blah, and that was The Robocop (remake) and Need for Speed, and those films just made Keaton look like he was just cashing it in just for the sake of it. Until I watched this movie and seeing Micheal Keaton's performance and thinking to myself \"Wait is Keaton giving probably his best performance I've ever seen in my life? I think he is\", because Keaton in this movie pretty much pulls of the best performance I've seen him in his all career. His character in this movie is like a washed up actor who had everything like: the love from the critics and he's fans. Yeah he still dose have that Keaton thing that he always dose in his previous movies, but the scenes where he plays his character (Which is himself if you really look at his character in this movie) but anywhere he still gives a strong and believable performance that at times give me flashbacks of the good old days when he still had roots and felt like he isn't just cashing it in. I hear a lot of Oscar buzz about his performance in this movie, and I wouldn't be surprise if he wins because he totally deserves it. Excellent work Keaton.\r\n\r\nEdward Norton is also in this movie and played a familiar character to himself has the hard to work with actor that at times doesn't follow the lines that he was given or even the direction he was told. We already know that Norton is a fantastic actor in his previous work, but in this movie his performance could be descried has stellar and insanely good.\r\n\r\nEmma Stone is this movie and of course like most of the actors I named off so far who were outstanding in this movie and well you can already guess what I'm going to say next. Emma Stone acting in this movie was just terrific and marvellous to watch. It's good to see a real break out performance from her more than the lay back ones in her other movies. Nice one Emma. The other cast in the movie like Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis both did good as well.\r\n\r\nThe whole movie is shot to look like it's all in one shot and my mind was just blown away by that fact. There were scenes in way I said to myself \"Oh my god is it one shot?\", well I can already imagine the stress, hard work and how many takes they had to do to get it, and boy did it pay off nicely, because I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I dared myself to look away from the beautiful cinematography and the impressive editing used in the film.\r\n\r\nThe movie has a brilliant message about film critics today that doesn't feel like it's in your face message that you normally get in movies. There's a scene in this movie and by the way it's not a spoiler, but I really need to get this out the way first. Micheal Keaton character starts having a rant over this theater critic who is going to give a bad review to he's play when she hasn't even seen it or any of the premieres. He talks about how she only users big words that nobody will say in person and shes to lazy to come up what she really thinks about it so she users big words just to fill in the sentence. This movie probably has the best rant in movie history and Keaton in that scene shows how good of a actor that he is.\r\n\r\nFor problems in the movie: I really don't have any to be honest.\r\n\r\nI loved this movie and yes I'm coming out be saying that. This isn't just the best movie of the year and such, no this is just flawless film making right here. Birdman and Whiplash are the two films I will highly recommend to people, because those two films are my favorite films of 2014.","id":"5e2f2b4bac8e6b0015bcdb0b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2f2b4bac8e6b0015bcdb0b","movie_id":194662}

{"author":"BadChristian","content":"I've seen a lot of bad horror movies and Haunting of Cellblock 11 is trying real hard to be the worst. The acting is abhorrent and the characters are totally undeveloped. Everyone who isn't one of the main 4 people (who aren't great either) probably is not an actor and just someone they found in the town they were shooting in. The worst part is the terrible plot. The movie is an hour an twenty-five minutes including credits and it takes them almost half an hour to actually begin the investigation of the prison. They waste time setting up a backstory that is wholly irrelevant and highlights the studio boss who is the worst actress I have ever seen. Things don't get any better when we get to the prison, as the effects are awful and they can't even follow their own ghost rules. When they first get there, an intern gets hurt and rolls up his sleeve with no holes in it or blood on the outside to reveal a six inch minor cut on his arm. Firstly, it's not a cut bad enough to be concerned about, but they send him away to a hospital after already loosing the other intern who they sent to go get coffee or water or something and never returns or addressed again, so they are down a fourth of their crew. Secondly, they say he probably cut it on a camera box, as if a part of the box could have gotten up his long sleeve sweatshirt 3 inches and then cut him half a foot farther up his arm. There are many things I would consider mistakes that they would have easily noticed if they bothered to watch their own film. A character says they can't possibly write off spiking EMF meters because there is no electricity in the building. They set up like 12 cameras on the walls and numerous on tripods. Let's pretend that all of these and their multitude of computer equipment is powered by a generator or their van, they still are electronic and could interfere with the meter. This is stuff I would complain about in a paranormal\/ghost \"reality\" show, but this is a studio film with a film budget and writers and special effects teams. I won't go any farther into the plot, but it's all terrible and I've seen better paranormal stuff on Ghost Adventures. They essentially have almost an hour to create what every one of those crappy ghost hunting shows would kill to have by making everything up, using CG and practical effects, and creating their own rules for how ghosts and the paranormal work. I love Ghost Hunters and all that crap even though I don't believe in ghosts, so I'm ready suspend all belief and logic to fully buy in, but they just cash out and throw some garbage out there. I recommend this to no one. It is a terrible movie and totally fails as a horror and it's not bad in a fun bad movie way, it's just lazy nonsense.","id":"5bdaac84c3a3680772009972","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bdaac84c3a3680772009972","movie_id":293901}

Others too did well job, especially Abhishek Bachchan as Nandu Bhide (he had double role) was damn funny. SRK-Deepika's chemistry sizzles once again. \r\n\r\nOverall a nice and rocking entertainer! Just go with a free & fresh mind and have some \"ROFL!\" My ratings would be 7\/10.","id":"547c80fe9251412d7f002ebb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/547c80fe9251412d7f002ebb","movie_id":277432}

{"author":"mattwilde123","content":"'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is a comedy film that satirises spy movies such as the James Bond franchise. Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (played by Taron Egerton) is a normal working class 18 year old from London who gets recruited into a super secret spy organisation. Humour comes as he tries to mix with these posh and suave upper-class stereotypes.\r\n\r\nMatthew Vaughn has included his typical ultra stylised violence ('Kick Ass') and it does boast a good sound track. There are a lot of nods to films such as Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' but it just reminds me of examples when things have been done much better. The highlight of the film for me was a scene in which Colin Firth violently massacres a crazy church to the music of Lynyrd Skynyrd ('Free Bird') whilst almost seeming like a continuous long shot.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is very unoriginal and the dialogue with the young actors in particular is cringe-worthy. Tarantino type set-pieces just come across as annoying as the film fails to have any cleverness or creativity.\r\n\r\nApart from Colin Firth every actor is either average or just really bad. Samuel L. Jackson, in particular, is worse than usual as he tries to add some freshness to his regular spiel by trying to affect an annoying and distracting speech impediment.\r\n\r\n'Kingsman' is going to appeal to the intended target age group as it does contain scenes of fantasy violence depicted as \"cool\" whilst characters swear. It would also help your enjoyment of the film if you have not seen the many, many examples where each scene had been conducted much better.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u00bd","id":"58c1503b925141734f009c3b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c1503b925141734f009c3b","movie_id":207703}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> One bad step might cost your leg, maybe life.\r\n\r\nOnce I finished watching, said 'wow'. It can mean in many ways like the movie was stunning, edgy and probably best war flick of the 2014. Yep, there's no doubt in that, at least to me among those I've seen. It was a low budget British war-drama-thriller based on the real event that takes place in the year 2006, Afghanistan. The director was a documentary filmmaker, and I'm happy he chose to make it a movie. But still it looks like a semi-documentary and powerful.\r\n\r\nIn the backdrop of the Kajaki dam valley where one of the British army camp lies in a mountain top, one morning a military unit goes for a routine checkup in the surrounding area. It was not an usual day, a tragedy strikes and followed by a series of mishaps that leaves the entire team in a critical situation and so the other teams who come to assist. They risk their lives to rescue each other. Coming from the England, laying under the burning sun as the injured, they might have felt a very close to hell. The rest of the story is coming out of it, or would they?\r\n\r\nI must agree with many who had seen this said, it is tough to watch. Because everything looked so real, sometimes the pain was felt if your focus was thorough. Especially if you are a kind hearted, your heart rate might go up. It is not all about predictable, we know what might happen because of the following scenes after the first blow, it's one way or another. But how, where, when and who is the question. Anytime, anything might happen, the screenplay was genuine in that matter. Once the tension parts begin, it was unstoppable, it will pull you out of your chair often.\r\n\r\n> \"This whole country is full of sht\r\n> left behind when armies fkd off.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole film was shot in one location and its close by zone. It was in Afghanistan, according to the story, but the film was shot in Jordan. Very well utilised the locations, camera angles, the performances were top notch. I don't know anyone from the cast, but they were the best. Well, you won't forget the film after a watch, at least for a week maybe. You don't have to compare it with American war movies. This was not high-tech military combat, but just a simple story with one breathtaking circumstance.\r\n\r\nWhat really disturbs is to know it was a real story. The unit was small and the head office did not provide them a proper equipments like well working radio sets, metal detectors et cetera which caused the disaster. You know, in the war its not like, take your gun and go kill the enemies like the John Rambo. There is types of war that fought in different style. In this film, these young soldiers were making sure and reporting the movements of the enemy in a nearby checkpoint. What happens was they caught in an unexpected trap and afterwards it turns human emotions.\r\n\r\nI don't remember seeing a better war film from Britain, at least not recently. This film totally shocked me which was unexpected from an unheard title. As usual, taking chances in the unpopular movies gave me an opportunity to discover the hidden gem and I want to spread this word as much as possible far its reach. If you are reading this, especially you are an adult, I definitely highly recommend it. Don't anticipate a complete combat, but it'll give one hundred per cent of the theme under this narration takes place.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"55d3830cc3a3683b7b000478","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55d3830cc3a3683b7b000478","movie_id":306650}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"The kinetic super-spy caper \u2018Kingsman: The Secret Service\u2019 will serve as a boisterous blueprint for those teen fanboys out there that will fancy an elaborate overload of James Bond-esque high-powered hedonism. It certainly does not hurt that the high-wire hysteria as showcased in the twitchy \u2018Kingman\u2019 is based upon the acclaimed comicbook series by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons. Also, add into the mix the movie-making overdrive pedigree of director Matthew Vaughn (\u2018Kick-Ass\u2019, \u2018X-Men: First Class\u2019) and slick, cheeky spy-spry send-ups that recall the over-the-top espionage genre and its exaggerated suspense-driven foundation. Well, \u2018Kingsman: The Secret Service\u2019 is a cockeyed, pulsating parody that works its ultra-violent magic for the Austin Powers crowd that wants to walk on the high-octane wild side of Bond\u2019s universe.\r\n\r\nSure, \u2018Kingsman: The Secret Service\u2019 has its iffy moments where the blatant sexist overtones, magnified violent sequences and a generous bloody bounce of excess will have some stomping their feet in sheer indignation. The apparent knock on \u2018Kingsman\u2019 will be its robust ridiculousness and familiarity in Vaughn\u2019s \u2018Kick-Ass\u2019 cartoonish vibe. However, the same elements that may cause some reservations with the film\u2019s low-brow lunacy is also the same ingredients that trigger \u2018Kingsman: The Secret Service\u2019s carousing charm in majestic mayhem.\r\n\r\nThe grand gimmick behind behind kick-starting \u2018Kingsman\u2019s go-for-broke rollicking is casting the sophisticated presence of the Oscar-winning Colin Firth (\u2018The King\u2019s Speech\u2019) as dapper Harry Hart (aka \u2018Galahad\u2019), a polished and prominent superspy for a British secret intelligence society.  Hart\u2019s top-secret spy network is headed up by Arthur (Oscar-winner Michael Caine). The secretive operation is based out of a notable tailor\u2019s shop known as Kingsman. Also worth noting is that all the secret service agents are named after the famed knights of King Arthur\u2019s Round Table. Go figure. In any event, the suave Harry Hart is the debonair face of the spy organisation and will play a critical part in both recruiting a young up-and-coming agent with decent physical skills and tracking down a worldwide menace bent of destroying the planet. It is all in a day\u2019s work for the skilled, well-dressed licensed-to-kill operative.\r\n\r\nHart, who had been loyally connected to a fallen colleague from a past mission gone disastrous years before, decides to become a mentor for his late co-worker\u2019s troubled son Gary \u2018Eggsy\u2019 Unwin (played by newcomer Taron Egerton) whose law-breaking conduct catches the attention of the police. Feeling a sense of responsibility for his deceased spy buddy\u2019s wayward kid, Hart takes Eggsy under his wings and determines to shape the misguided youngster into resilient Kingman stock. After all, Eggsy has the needed physicality (we are told he is an exceptional gymnast) and roguish spunk to join the ranks of the seemingly understaffed spy outfit. Soon, Eggy and other recruits will be grilled through rigorous training from Kingman member Merlin (Mark Strong) as they look to fill the spot vacated recently from the dead Lancelot.\r\n\r\nThe dearly departed Lancelot, it turns out, was the latest victim of ruthless criminal mastermind Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). The flashy Valentine, a billionaire gone bonkers, hopes to control the world\u2019s climate change. He is known as a mega-wealthy entrepreneur and philanthropist but his sinister heart yearns for some heavy-handed dastardly deeds that puts him on the immediate radar for Hart and his crafty Kingsmen to spring into action. At the demented Valentine\u2019s side is the deliciously disabled exotic henchwoman Gazelle (Sophia Boutella) with the treacherous knack for disarming her adversaries with blazing blades.\r\n\r\nThe bombastic and eye-pleasing \u2018Kingsman: The Secret Service\u2019 sets out to have one goal in mind: to highlight its thunderous homage to spygate spectacles that salute everything from the Agent 007 flicks and related free-wheeling 60\u2019s fare such as the \u2018Matt Helm\u2019 and \u2018Derek Flint\u2019 spy franchises to the recent espionage vehicles that invite the millennium-based harried heroes such as the Jason Bournes and Jack Ryans of the world into the frenetic fold.  It is fast, furious and unapologetic in its rambunctious spirit as a ricocheting romp.\r\n\r\nVaughn, in all his rousing Tarantino-esque tactics, unleashes a visceral assault that is visually wrapped in his escapist package of an adrenaline rush. Wisely, Vaughn incorporates some of his \u2018Kick-Ass\u2019 colourful calisthenics to arm his playful spy yarn. As the veteran spygame squires, both Firth and Caine are game for the frolic they signed up to participate in with puckish aplomb. Jackson brings his usual explosive badass persona to the table as the villainous fashion plate Valentine. The 14 year-old males will draw their adventurous inspiration from Egerton\u2019s junior spy Eggsy Unwin. Some may become nostalgic when uncovering the likes of spotting \u2018Star Wars\u2019 icon Mark Hamill as an imperiled climate changer scientist caught in the crazy clutches of Jackson\u2019s diabolical antagonist. \r\n\r\nAlthough not the most inventive take on ridiculing the spy genre with over-extended finesse and sensationalism, \u2018Kingsman: The Secret Service\u2019 is still a preferred jolting distraction at the beginning of an early stillborn movie season.\r\n\r\nKingman: The Secret Service (2015)\r\n\r\n20th Century Fox\r\n\r\n1 hr. 40 min.\r\n\r\nStarring: Colin Firth, Taron Egerton, Michael Caine, Samuel L.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"If you like old-fashioned James Bond style movies you probably like this one. It is a bit more outrageous and has a few more overly silly moments than the old Bond movies but on the whole this is a very fun and enjoyable secret agent movie.\r\n\r\nGary is, via a few twists and turns at the beginning of the movie, recruited by a secret agent employed by a super secret private organisation with remarkable resources. Their agents looks and behaves like London upper class gentlemen but have remarkable fighting skills. The initial scenes when Gary is recruited are just great.\r\n\r\nGary is then submitted to a rather gruesome training schedule and at the same time the main plot plays out in parallell. Of course the two threads merge towards the classical showdown with the megalomaniacal evil mastermind in the end where, naturally, Gary gets to save the world.\r\n\r\nThe movie has all the \u201cgoodies\u201d of a secret agent movie. British gentlemen agents, action, secret agent \u201cstuff\u201d like shops that are not what they look like, hidden entrances into secret bases, rooms that are actually elevators and of course gadgets, lots of gadget to help our heroes thwart the evil mastermind\u2019s nefarious plans. Of course said mastermind have a personal henchman a la Oddjob to do the more grisly parts of his evil biddings. I quite liked this rather unique henchman, or rather henchwoman, and her odd weapons. More so than the main villain which I found a bit bland at times.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I enjoyed this movie a lot. However, there are some silly parts which drags it down a bit. I especially disliked the colorful exploding heads towards the end of the movie. That just felt like the producer\/director was smoking some funny stuff when making those scenes. There were a few other scenes which I felt was going too much towards silly comedies as well. Without those I would probably have added a star.\r\n\r\nAll things said this was well spent 130 minutes as far as I am concerned.","id":"5ae48c870e0a2669f4008764","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ae48c870e0a2669f4008764","movie_id":207703}

This was one of the teen movie based on the true story of the two friends which is mostly uninspiring, but a well told story.\r\n\r\nThe young actor from one of my favorite teen movie 'Project X' was incredibly good. He's really showing some characters that he may become a valuable property in the Hollywood in the near future. He also reminds me a crossover outcome of Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill.\r\n\r\nWell the story was about two school dropouts who decide to do business on marijuana import-export. Since it is not illegal in the nearby place to their's across the border, they draw a master plan to execute and succeeds and what comes later is you've to see.

{"author":"guywithoutaname","content":"STRONGLY RECOMMENDED - 4.5\/5\r\n\r\nTwo hour and twenty minute horror epics are rare, let alone ones that hold my attention for their entire duration \u2013 the Mo Brothers\u2019 (Timo Tjahjanto & Kimo Stamboel) <em>Killers<\/em> now has a place in that unique group. Brutal, captivating, and often hilarious, <em>Killers<\/em> constantly challenges its audience as it contrasts beautiful, rich cinematography with despicable acts of violence, soaking the result in some of the darkest wit imaginable. The film sits at a crossroads between horror, thriller and satire \u2013 it\u2019s decidedly arthouse and the Mo Brothers regularly aim to disgust and amuse the viewer in the same motion. I\u2019ll try to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible but I can\u2019t make any guarantees \u2013 I really want everybody who thinks they\u2019re up to the challenge to seek this film out because it\u2019s truly something special.\r\n\r\nOpening with one of the most confronting on-screen murders in recent memory, toying with both the male and female gaze, <em>Killers<\/em> is a pan-Asian production that tracks the mutual obsession of two contrasting men. Nomura (Kazuki Kitamura) is a privileged Japanese serial killer who posts meticulously crafted and near-professionally produced videos of his murders to public video streaming websites for gratification. Bayu (Oka Antara) is a Indonesian reporter with little recognition, who has dedicated his life to futile attempts at stamping out corruption. Through accident and circumstance Bayu murders two men and is subsequently tracked down by Nomura, who feels a mutual bond, after Bayu posts a video of his killings online. That's just the first 45 minutes and from there things get a little bit insane.\r\n\r\nA lot of films purport to have something along the lines of \u201cthe most intense final half-hour ever captured\u201d, and most of the time it just isn\u2019t true. I can say unequivocally that  <em>Killers<\/em> has one of the most tense and confronting final thirds (yes, around 45 consecutive minutes) I\u2019ve ever seen. From the moment everything begins to unravel, the Mo Brothers manage to create and maintain a sense of overbearing dread unmatched by others in their immediate circle. It is true masterful direction, with their directorial techniques conjuring a sense of realism that many \u201crealistic\u201d horror films fail to capture.\r\n\r\nWithin this mode, the Mo Brothers experiment with some truly spectacular, left-of-centre filmic ideas. There\u2019s ongoing embedded aural and visual satire of Japanese soap operas, sequences that jump between traditional steady-shots and shaky shots from a first person perspective, and some ultra-dark humour that emerges in some of the films most upsetting moments. Some will put a few of the more wacky elements of the film down to poor direction however those do not have faith in the Mo. With a familiarity of their prior work, it\u2019s fairly apparent that every odd moment here is intentional. Working with such a long runtime, the Mo Brothers would have had the opportunity to cut around any sequence they were unhappy with, so the fact that everything included has made it into a final cut that, despite its runtime, never feels bloated, speaks volumes to the control that the Mo Brothers have exercised over this film.\r\n\r\n<em>Killers<\/em> is the film <em>A Serbian Film<\/em> should have been \u2013 it\u2019s confronting, it\u2019s brutal, and it has something very important to say about the normalization of violence and misogyny in society by focusing on our complicit role as spectators to this violence, but unlike <em>A Serbian Film<\/em> it\u2019s subtle. The film never assaults the audience purely for the sake of assault, and most of the violence occurs just out of frame, leaving the terror to stew in the imagination. This is truly unique cinema on the cutting edge of the horror genre and it deserves much wider recognition than it will probably ever see. The Mo Brothers are fast carving themselves a place previously held by the likes of Takashi Miike, Bong Joon-Ho, and Park Chan-Wook as members of the new generation of horror greats.\r\n\r\n(this is a significantly condensed version of a review I posted at <a href=\"http:\/\/fourthreefilm.com\/2014\/06\/killers\/\">http:\/\/fourthreefilm.com\/2014\/06\/killers\/<\/a>)","id":"53967073c3a3684f4500303f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53967073c3a3684f4500303f","movie_id":171846}

{"author":"tmdb63938527","content":"***CONTAINS SPOILERS***\r\n\r\nRemember when I said that sometimes reviews just come to you and the creative juices flow naturally and other times it's not so easy?  This is once again one of those times, but not because it's difficult to put into words what a film is about, or its style but purely because of how dull, uninteristing and tepid a film is.  This is such a film unfortunately.  Now having said all that, it's not as bad as it could have been and it does have Django in it.  Django makes everything better right?\r\n\r\nSo our two fearless (or one maybe not so fearless) heroines (Kelly & Lucy) are invited to a Montenagro paradise by ones former boyfriend to catch up,drink, see the sea and generally have a merry ole time.  You can probably see where this is going already.  Upon arrival it is obvious that Boban (Micanovic) is still interested in Lucy (Burn) despite recently getting married.  All formulaic stuff so far.  Cue lots of rippled chests, girls showing off flesh and general pointless stuff.  Oh and Kelly (Klebe) is afraid of the sea.\r\n\r\nThey eventually meet up with Boban's friend Alex (Stefanovic) who provides some measure of light relief.  Unfortunately this goes on for far too long, an hour to be precise before anything really of note happens (barring a couple of fish hook gutting murder scenes).  Character development is good.  Dragging it out for over an hour before we even see what the film is about, is not so good.  Goofing around and wearing bikinis no matter how pretty you all may be for a good film does not make.  Anyway they eventually decide to go to the small island of Mamula (the films original title) where things start picking up.\r\n\r\nOverall this is not a great film and while production values are reasonable for this type of stuff, the script and drawn out story let it down badly.  That said, everyones acting is above par with people who have been in much better stuff before.  Kind of makes one wonder how they were all actually convinced to apear in this one.  By all accounts Nero was very difficult to convince, and while his presence lends the film a lot of credibility and professionalism, maybe it would have been better to spend those resources elsewhere.  But it's Django, and he's always cool so I can see why they wanted him.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is stilted at times but this can be forgiven.  The scenery is fantastic and it really is a beautiful part of the world.  For a low budget Serbian production it exceeds probabal expectations with just one notable exception.  The killer mermaid herself.  She has far too little screen time, but when she is on screen the effects are very well done, some slightly dodgy cgi aside.  Zorana Kostic Obradovic is beautiful and beguiling at the same time and it is a real shame more was made of character development and leading up to the finale, than of her herself (given the film is about a mermaid after all).\r\n\r\nNotable mention must also be given to Mina Sablic as the actual creature herself.  The effects and make up applied to her are actually quite good in all fairness.  Franco Nero is also his usual awesome self, with a couple of great (if not cheesy) monologues for him to gruff and grizzle out.  Not the worse film I ever seen, far from it but watch this with very low expectations and it should entertain enough for its runtime.  Recommended only for Nero and Obradovic.","id":"58fa3cc8925141587d00db8e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58fa3cc8925141587d00db8e","movie_id":260030}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> When no ones are innocent, the trouble would be twice to deal.\r\n\r\nIt was a hot and humid atmosphere, I thought they shot in Italy. Then came to know it was an Aussie flick when a dead kangaroo was shown. So Simon Pegg in an Australian film, that directed by one of my favourite dog movies 'Red Dog' famed filmmaker. On this, it was a mixed feeling to me. A comedy-thriller, a good time pass movie. The film editing and the screen presentation were what made it look a better flick. If it was told from the starting point to the end as a single line, then it would have been very ordinary.\r\n\r\nBarely there are eight actors, that mean it is a limited cast movie that takes place in the isolated location. All about love, cheating, crime, money, completely about the dark side desires. There are a couple of twists, that is only because of the bend in the storytelling. At the Beginning, the three different stories were told one after another that set in the same timeline. The first one was to introduce a hitman, followed by a woman who cheats her husband and the finally a dentist couple who was threatened by a loan shark.\r\n\r\nThere are no good guys in the story. All of them has some issues and they want to get rid of it from their lives. So the plot begins to explode once they committed to their plans that does not go as it should be. When a series of mistakes and characters and their situation overlaps with each other, that lead to the finale.\r\n\r\nThere are some minor plot holes, if you don't compare it with the Hollywood blockbusters like critics then possibly you would enjoy it. I won't suggest it if you are looking for a Tarantino style masterpiece. It is a little dark-comedy from the down-under that has its own value despite there are some similarities with other flicks.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"56477c50c3a36826200041dc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56477c50c3a36826200041dc","movie_id":237756}

It has all that a child could desire in a film (trust me, the kids in the theatre LOVED it - it was super cute) and it also had some absolutely hilarious moments for the adults. The plot is pretty good; even if it is predictable, it's predictable in a way that works. The animation is gorgeous. The voicework is awesome. The way all of the characters have grown over the 5 year gap between the two movies in the series was really well done and evident, not just in appearance, but also in their personalities and interactions with each other.\r\n\r\nIn any case it was a lot of fun!

{"author":"Reno","content":"Like I said a couple of year ago during 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2' review, it's a terrible title for a sequel. The host, Neil Patrick also said the same thing during the 2015 Oscars. But in the digital world, slight change in the title makes random in order. I mean on the computer and web world, it won't show in order. Even sometime it might get lost in a vast number of other titles if they dare to chance the first word in the title for a sequel. Other than that they are not stupid as many people think. That's why they highlighted 'Dragon' boldly than the rest of the words.\r\n\r\nThis part two was not much different to its first. The story continues five years after Hiccup recovers from his injury. He and his pet, Toothless discovers a new land during the survey for the map. So their's adventure begins, but end in a trouble and forces all his people from the town to involve and fight against the rising evil force that tries to conquer them all.\r\n\r\nLike I always say, those days are gone, now animated movies are for all ages. This was a very nicely and carefully written screenplay, did not fail to deliver. Very close to the impact the first movie made, but due to simplicity it stayed a couple of steps behind. Developed well with a bit of suspense, thrill and entertainment. Nothing more we could have asked, a perfect follow-up and hoping to explore beyond lot more in the upcoming movies in this series. Four years gap between the movies is a nice idea and fine breathing space for this franchise fan. A movie must be seen by animation fans, especially if you have already seen the first then don't miss it. \r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"55464003925141499f003038","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55464003925141499f003038","movie_id":82702}
{"author":"Andres Gomez","content":"The first one was good and the second is not any worse.\r\n\r\nThis series is standing out of the pack for its complex plot involving several topics, not just the typical ones in an animated movie. Arguably, they have been also treated in former movies; two main characters which are crippled (Finding Nemo ...), greater involvement of strong female roles (although, still, not as main characters and utterly in need of help from the male roles), ecology, etc.\r\n\r\nThe points I dislike the most is the speech of homeland being the good \"peacekeeper\" nation forced to use violence to keep it (peace). Quite hypocritical but, clearly, addressed to the US audience.\r\n\r\nThe repetitive line of story about the (nerd) hero who is the only one to save the world is quite tiresome too.\r\n\r\nFinally, how lightly some other traumatic causing topics are treated: finding that a parent abandoned their child, death, etc ...\r\n\r\nIn any case, this is a good movie, funny and with an interesting story. Worth watching for a franchise that, I think, doesn't have all the attention it should have.","id":"56f3f9c2c3a3682fcf002e66","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56f3f9c2c3a3682fcf002e66","movie_id":82702}
{"author":"Reno","content":"A low budget horror movie from a newcomer director. In that perspective, it was a decent movie, because within the limits everything was done nicely. In fact, it was a minimal cast movie set in an isolated cabin in the woods. A simple story that is like the title, it is about a newly married couple's honeymoon. All sets off nicely to them until strange events begin to follow one after another. How the couple manages to come off of it, or do they is the rest.\r\n\r\nI don't know others, but like I said it was not a bad movie to me. Whatever happened, it just kept me engaged throughout, because of the uptight plot. Though, it raises some questions about the events that takes place in the movie and makes to have your own imagination. In fact, my opinion in the begging was 'big foot', later very quickly I understood what it's about. The writer's notion was also the same, leaving blank space to fill by the viewers with their creative prediction.\r\n\r\nThe most of the answers answered or going to be answered are merely the same (I think). For those who won't get it, will suffer nothing except think they wasted time. The rest will probably want a sequel for a proper and further explanation. Especially a couple of dialogues made me think that way. But, I don't think so there will be one, it will stay a mystery as of now forever, if I'm not wrong. Not a scary movie nor actual violence, but the suspense was the movie's strong hold. If you're looking for that type, you can give it a try other than blood gore and killings.\r\n\r\n5.5\/10","id":"5540f7edc3a3681dab001bf1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5540f7edc3a3681dab001bf1","movie_id":254191}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Under house arrest in a haunted house!**\r\n\r\nAbsolutely a kick-ass horror-comedy from the Kiwi. In a horror, usually we expect too much, particularly we calculate them according to how much it scares us. That's a tough job for the filmmaker, but when the comedy tag was attached to it which makes even tougher. In this kind of theme, very rarely people say they're satisfied enough and this is one of those. Yep, a surprise film written and directed by a newcomer. Since it is a New Zealand film, I don't anybody from it, but they all were excellent. Particularly the lead woman was unbelievably good, totally loved her, kind of reminds Nia Vardalos of 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' fame and her expressions too matches for in this film.\r\n\r\nThe story was familiar, even some part of it can be compared to the recent film 'The Boy'. Likewise, other pieces from different films, but I did not care, because it still looked fresh of its own. The way it was developed contributed to the film's success and those suspense lived up to the hype that were made in the early stage of narration. The woman who won't get scared easily, finally meets her ultimate fear after returning to her mother's house where she grew up. But only to discover the house is haunted, followed by mysterious events and the final confrontation between her and whoever on the opposite.\r\n\r\nGreat setting with the awesome performances, and always keeps us on the edge. But the laughs were delivered in the form of black comedy. The twists and turns make the film to flip to the opposite side after reaching at one point of the narration leaving the viewers to judge how strongly it linked to its genre. But I don't think most of them care about that since they're already entertained and only going to witness the final thrilling conclusion. I hope there won't be any follow up, because this one-off film was one of the best from the down under, so I don't want it to be ruined, like they do in the Hollywood. Recommended, you will enjoy it even your rating does not meet what I've given.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"57ed869fc3a3686d0100035f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ed869fc3a3686d0100035f","movie_id":253306}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Arima Nambi opens with a conversation in a high-end restaurant where we see Arjun Krishna (Vikram Prabhu in a role that is not so different from the one in Ivan Vera Mathiri) and his friends rating girls. 'Oh no, not again,' you cringe and fear what the rest of the film will be like. But then, we get a very nice meet-cute. Arjun sees Anamika ( Priya Anand, just adequate), a confident young girl, in the crowd and approaches her. He woos her with a song, gets her contact and a day later, the two are off on a date \u2014 drinking and talking to their hearts' content. Anamika invites Arjun to her home for a drink and everything seems cozy (it is refreshing to see a film that doesn't make a fuss over its leads drinking). And then, Anamika is kidnapped, and her kidnappers mean business. When Arjun tries to go after them, they don't think twice about shooting at him.\r\n\r\nAll these events happen in the first 20 minutes of the film and that is when you realize that you are in the hands of a confident filmmaker. First-time director Anand Shankar packs in enough background about the two characters so that we care about them. We get why Arjun, who has known Anamika only for two days, will risk his life to save her.\r\n\r\nThe first half of the film is first rate. There is a genuine thrill in these portions that keeps us on the edge of our seats. This is also when the film feels most plausible. When Arumugham, a cop who takes up the case, saves Arjun when he is about to be shot, it doesn't seem unlikely. He is a thinking cop and MS Bhaskar plays this role in a wonderful manner; we can see the wheels in his mind turning as he goes through the details of the case. Like, when Arjun tells him the details of the car in which Anamika has been kidnapped, he pauses for a beat to process the information and only then calls the control room. Similarly, when Arjun takes on his pursuers for the first time, we are not surprised as we have seen him working out at the gym in a lighter scene. What seemed like a hero-glorification shot earlier (a close-up shot of Arjun's abs) now has context.\r\n\r\nThere is a fair bit of exposition that feels unneeded. In one scene, Arjun and Arumugan are eavesdropping on the conversation between the villains and Anamika's dad and we get why the kidnap has taken place. Yet, the director makes Arjun explain this to Arumugham, who, we know, is an intelligent cop. Such spoon-feeding should not have been there in a film that is smart enough to know what it wants to be.\r\n\r\nThe plot, in fact, is all-too familiar and resembles K Bhagyaraj's 1991 comedy thriller Rudhra the most. As in that film, here, too, there is a video of a murder that the villain, a powerful politician, wants to destroy. Both the heroines are damsels in distresses requiring the help of a hero with a presence of mind. There is even a scene of the hero committing a bank robbery (though, they are tonally very different). There are cops who are in collusion with the villain. The all-important video gets destroyed in both films. Finally, even the manner in which the hero indicts the villain is similar. However, the treatment is very Hollywoodish here.\r\n\r\nThere are scenes which show that Anand Shankar is merely taking a leaf out of Hollywood thrillers. At least two sequences in the second half \u2014 a rooftop chase sequence (adapted very well) and events at a police control room (adapted a little clumsily) \u2014 are influenced by The Bourne Ultimatum. 'Why am I not getting this?' asks a character, repeating a line from the earlier film. Even a musical cue that crops up at crucial moments resembles what is known as the 'Hans Zimmer horn' sound.\r\n\r\nThe film also loses some of its verve in the second half, which feels a little stretched and all over the place. And, yet, there is enough cleverness in the writing and assuredness in the execution, especially for a debut film, to make Arima Nambi stand apart from your usual action thrillers.","id":"53baaa270e0a2676b800b9b6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baaa270e0a2676b800b9b6","movie_id":263505}

Black, \"Mythica: A Quest for Heroes\" is a fantasy\/adventure about a limping servant with blossoming magical powers named Merek (Melanie Stone), who rounds up a noble warrior, Thane (Adam Johnson), and a miscreant lothario, Dagen (Jake Stormoen), to help the priestess, Teela (Nicola Posener), find her sister (Natalie Devine Riskas), who was taken captive by a brutal ogre. Kevin Sorbo has a glorified cameo.  \r\n\r\nThe story takes place in a Medieval-like world where magic, ogres, elves, trolls and other fantasy creatures are real.

The Utah locations are diverse and magnificent and the varied score is phenomenal with kinetic percussion-oriented pieces.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Yes, another castaway film, but not a bad one either.\r\n\r\nA castaway film based on the true event of the US navy airmen who crash landed their plane and lost in the sea during the WWII. The story is set when the US response to the Pearl Harbor attack was underway. But three men are unfortunate to end at a vast pacific ocean. The film tells their survival story without food, water and medical attention until they plan to sail to the nearest island.\r\n\r\nThere are many awesome films were in the recent times with this theme, so it looks like people are already tired of it. But I enjoyed it, I never get bored of listening to the true adventure stories like this. You know it is a low budget film with a minimal cast, but production quality was excellent. The amazing effort by all the three, especially towards the final act with their diet to match with the real event.\r\n\r\nDraco Malfoy, the bad boy from the 'Harry Potter' film series was very interesting. I never noticed him as close as in this one, because he never did a big role until now. So I hope he makes some fine roles in his future projects.\r\n\r\nIn the B movies, this is really a top notch product. There are only minor flaws, and the scenes repeated from other similar films, because these things are very common in the castaway situation. So you can't blame the film for being so cliche, but you can try to appreciate the attempt.\r\n\r\nBy the way, it's got a small twist at the end. It was the editing magic, otherwise if the story was told in a straight line from the beginning to the end, there would have been nothing but a usual tale. Now, do you think I would recommend it to you, definitely I do.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"576d7a1b9251410b8900006b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/576d7a1b9251410b8900006b","movie_id":302828}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> An innocent girl's desperate adventure.\r\n\r\nThe rumours always adds lots interesting stuffs than the actual news. Sometime we feel that should have been real, because of the sunning depth that even a real story can't match. That's why the false information spreads like a virus on the social media. This movie character was inspired by a real young woman from Japan, but not the real event. An urban legend surround her visit to Minnesota, United States, back in the 2001.\r\n\r\nI have seen many films of different versions of the same events or the persons, but I never heard of this one before. So after the watch I did a little research on the original and I thought this film looked much better than that, especially for the movie it supplied a fine story material. Still a very much predictable, but for an entertainment purpose, it did decently.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful adventure-drama. The main character is just like the one from 'Citizen Dog' or 'Amelie'. Kumiko is an innocent and a solitude woman in the twilight of her 20s. Her life is not so good, with having no friends or a boyfriend, pressure from her mother and at work, she decides to chase an unexpected dream after learning about the treasure from the tape she finds in a seaside. That leads her to travel halfway across the world to an unfamiliar territory and what follows is her desperate drive to achieve the undertaking.\r\n\r\n> \"I discover treasure. Right here. It's mine.\"\r\n\r\nThe end was heartbreaking, only if you understood it clearly. Though I'm not going to reveal anything about that part as it might spoil if you have not it yet. But there's no declaration in the opening or before the end credits about whether it was a real or what actually happened in the end. Lots of scenes make no sense, and gives the impression of the girl is so dumb. Also leaves many unanswered questions behind which is the negative side of the narration. That's what you get in an urban myth, a collective tale and each slice of it is someone's creation\/prediction based on the original evidence that is not understood properly.\r\n\r\nThe story might be Americas, but due to the Japanese lead character, the entire film was in Japanese with English subtitle and very often some English line with the American characters. Besides, it looks more a Japanese film than the Hollywood's. The 'Pacific Rim' star Rinko Kikuchi was outstanding in the title role. The direction was good, the director also appeared in a small role as a cop. In fact, that was a big one for this movie where a small role can impact on the high level.\r\n\r\nEven a ten year old can differentiate what is real and what's not from a movie he watches in this world. Whatever the girl from the movie believed in is simply a fictional account and an entertainment for us, so don't expect it to be an uplifting movie. As I said it was based on a speculation of some real incident, but a well made movie except not detailing everything they have shown. It got a mixed response with mostly positive feedbacks, but my take on it is definitely good. And finally, this movie is not for everyone, if you decide to watch, try not to analyse it deeply.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"56d9aef492514175a30070d4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56d9aef492514175a30070d4","movie_id":244563}
{"author":"mattwilde123","content":"Richard Linklater's 'Boyhood' is a brilliant film about life and the struggle to find meaning. It follows a family through a twelve year period as they endure situations and tackle obstacles together. The main technical aspect of the film is a very controversial and memorable one as Linklater hired his main actors and continued to follow them for twelve years thus adding to the realism of the feature adding much poignancy to the themes. The overall direction can be considered very naturalistic and simple but there are wonderful shots of natural environments such as the beautiful river that Mason and his father visit representing the beauty of life whilst underlining the insignificance of man's role in the world.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is a touching study of the meaning of life. There is a great balance of humour and heart-rending dialogue throughout the film. At 165 minutes, the movie is a long one but the pacing was perfect and captivating that I hardly noted the film's duration. The characters each have profound dialogue in which they discuss the journey of which they (and we) are going through and question the reasoning of difficult events.\r\n\r\nThe performances in 'Boyhood' are exceptional. Mason (Ellar Coltrane) starts off as relatively inexperienced and under-developed but matures as the film progresses adding substance to his character's arch. This performance is supported by the excellent Patricia Arquette who plays the mother. Arquette manages to portray the mother perfectly as she undergoes traumatic events that shape her family's life.\r\n\r\nOverall, I feel that 'Boyhood' is a technically brilliant achievement in film-making. Not only is the process fascinating in terms of the methods used to create the film but it is also a fascinating investigation into time.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd","id":"58c14f08c3a3682650009451","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c14f08c3a3682650009451","movie_id":85350}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A mighty actor in a light role, accomplish it like usual.\r\n\r\nIan McKellen would have been a convenient actor to lead in this as it was a very close to his real life. You might have heard this is a Robin Williams last movie. One final amazing character display where the whole movie was about his part, but nothing else. A decent storyline, but a simple, low cost drama about homosexual.\r\n\r\nThe exposition of the tale was very brief, but took its time to evolve in the entire 90 minutes. Still clarifications like regarding his wife, their marriage and the end scene can not be proved its meaning. Though we can assume them in many angles. I think those were the major setback for this film, otherwise it could have been a better one.\r\n\r\nI would have loved it if the emotions were stronger. Because the film characters and their relationship constructions were absorbing. So the only missing piece was the sentimental appeal. But Robin Williams' sudden dismissal and the time of this movie is coming out is what heartbreaks, especially the sort of role he appeared in it.

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"Boyhood organically condenses twelve years of upbringing into an undramatic three hour behemoth. The journey of adolescence is one personality-altering experience that each of us inevitably undertakes. An existential life step that physically and personably transforms our very bodies, from innocent child to independent adult. Parents forced to release their protective talons and enable their children to venture out into the harsh world, justifiably falling down the pitfalls of life and picking themselves back up again. But what\u2019s the point of it all? We grow up. We attend school. We work. We live, love and lie. Only to see ourselves never progress on a personal level. Life is valuable. It is a finite amount of time that rapidly ticks by at the rate to which we grow older. It can often be disillusioning, but most importantly, it can be special. It\u2019s up to us to make the most out of the limited time bestowed upon us.\r\n\r\nLinklater\u2019s sprawling coming-of-age epic is a technical masterclass in ingenuity. Depicting the adolescence of a young boy growing up in Texas with his divorced parents. Logistically, literarily and lovingly, Linklater opted for the innovative concept of filming in real-time. The actors physically growing with their characters, with the ability to add personal experiences to the narrative. This ambitious depiction of maturing is subconsciously organic, and proved to be an effective method in illustrating adolescence. It kept the casting limited, without having to obtain multiples actors for the same character at different stages of childhood, and exhumed a sense of natural intuition.\r\n\r\nThat being said, this meticulous construct of film-making unfortunately facilitated a mellow story that lacked any drama or emotional depth. Coming-of-age dramas work effectively when depicting one specific year that dares to dramatically endeavour into relatability. The issue with Boyhood is that, due to its extensive duration of narrational time, several aspects were emotionally subdued. For example, Mason experimenting with alcohol and recreational substances. Linklater failed to dig into the emotional conflict that lead Mason down that path, merely likening the character to an empty shell. Another example, Bill drunkenly assaulting Olivia. Again, this case of domestic abuse is only touched upon before Linklater moves on with Mason\u2019s life.\r\n\r\nBoyhood is essentially a montage of fictitious memories. Good and bad. It\u2019s all part of growing up. But does that necessarily result in an entertaining or emotionally captivating film? For me, it\u2019s a hesitant \u201cno\u201d. Sure, there will be scenes that are relatable to your own upbringing and therefore engage you momentarily. Personally I warmed to the scenes involving Hawke\u2019s fatherly figure and his attempt to rekindle with his children. Growing up with divorced parents, Linklater\u2019s dialogue was incredibly realistic and related to my own life. But as I said, he then quickly moves on with the narrative and the emotionality is diminished yet again. Hawke and Arquette offer their intense acting styles to spice up the narrative, however Coltrane and Linklater\u2019s own daughter rarely displayed variety. The plot\u2019s structure itself commenced with nostalgic-fuelled simplicity (GameBoy Advance SP, DragonBall Z, Coldplay\u2019s \u201cYellow\u201d etc.) and then ending on philosophical existentialism, which I suppose merged adequately with Mason\u2019s advancing frame of mind.\r\n\r\nYet I cannot shake the feeling of disappointment. Linklater took no risks with the story. Limited emotional depth. Boyhood, for all its technical ingenuity, remained hollow. \u201cOne of the greatest films of the decade\u201d? I\u2019m not convinced, yet I appreciate the innovation behind the lacklustre story.","id":"5e206b18b3316b001303346e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e206b18b3316b001303346e","movie_id":85350}
{"author":"tmdb39513728","content":"**Phenomenal**\r\n\r\nWhen you think back to _Slackers_ you remember how easy that movie flowed. How comfortably it drifted. Just go with it. Let it happen, live in the moment. Then there's the _Before trilogy_ which again seemed effortless and free-flowing yet constructed with so much care that you knew this filmmaker was not only unusual, but acutely human. That he cherished experience and learning and submitted to the eternal present, surrendering to and tinkering with fate, while tending to the perpetually immediate situation with enormous sensitivity and regard. \r\n\r\nBut nothing could prepare you for _Boyhood_. You can't overstate the fact that it's a grand free-flowing time-lapse experiment and that most of the actors--no not actors, not performers--most of the people were cast when the central figure was a very young boy, looking up at the sky, having no idea how his future would unfold. The world might be a stage but Richard Linkater is not omnipotent. As a definitive work-in-progress, a daring collaboration with fate and destiny, who could really know how the boy's script was going to turn out, and how the wide array of voices in his life would shape him as he stumbles toward adulthood? Only a true sure-footed and fluid filmmaker, an authentic disarming innovator could raise this baby with as much beauty and wisdom. Dazed and Confused? Make room for Clear and Composed.\r\n\r\nHear the lamb howl. _Boyhood_ is a daring experimental wolf wrapped in conventional wool. Needing to be shot chronologically, the linear time-line and 12-year shooting schedule called for a fresh and original approach to crafting a movie. If something went wrong during the many long gaps in production, say, if an actor suddenly became unavailable, or some drastic circumstance threatened to break the continuity of the boy and his family's life, there's no going back to re-shoot. No relying on special effects make-up or casting young and old versions of a character. The faith invested in this concept and the delicate handling of it's execution is a marvel to witness, blooming before our eyes. \r\n\r\nPatricia Arquette was growing up too. Aging faster than Ellar Coltrane, it appeared. This movie defies breaking up into a series of disjointed, episodic fragments. And Arquette stitches together an admirable and dedicated performance as the ubiquitous maternal defender who struggles to keep herself and her family from falling apart. Because of the blur between fiction and reality, between drama and documentary, and because of the way Linklater is able to nurture the process and allow his films to take on a life of their own, Arquette may not be acting on set any more than she has to in real life. A slight adjustment in perspective and this movie could have been called _Motherhood_.","id":"54d1f7b0c3a36830800026a9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54d1f7b0c3a36830800026a9","movie_id":85350}

Only on the later I came to know that and my stance has changed a bit. Because it's not always about the quality of the product, but something revealing truth is most important to me in films. It was honest and not following the blueprint of a similar kind was the advantage. Obviously it was a small budget B movie with unfamiliar cast.\r\n\r\nSo while watching it, I thought why they (film characters) not doing like this, that. Because entertainment films should do that for its viewers to please, but its notion was not that. It was depicting the actual event. Well, most of the crucial scene with the beast was just acceptable due to the category of film it belongs. Can't afford graphics nor trained animal, but I appreciate the effort.\r\n\r\nStory wise, it takes time to come to the point. And then everything happens so fast before the end approach. Initially, the narration teases with a different kind of thriller, but after some developments, it accomplishes its mission. Like I said don't expect something like 'The Revenant'.

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Lost-in-the-woods-and-menaced-by-nature Indie*** \r\n\r\nA young couple from the big city (Jeff Roop & Missy Peregrym) goes hiking & camping at a Provincial Park in the wilderness and find themselves lost and harassed by primal perils, human and animal. Eric Balfour is on hand as a dubious Irish outdoors guide. \r\n\r\nWritten\/directed by Adam MacDonald, \u201cBackcountry\u201d (2014) was inspired by the true story of Mark Jordan & Jacqueline Perry and their encounter with a man-eating bear in the wilds of Missinaibi Lake Provincial Park, North of Chapleau, Ontario, in 2005.\r\n\r\nPeregrym is reminiscent of Hilary Swank while Roop brings to mind a younger, less goofy Ray Romano. The movie\u2019s basically a low-rent meshing of survival-in-the-woods flicks like \u201cDeliverance\u201d (1972) and \u201cThe Edge\u201d (1997). If you\u2019re in the mood for this kind of flick, \u201cBackcountry\u201d is pretty well done for an Indie. Sometimes the acting by the protagonists is questionable, but it\u2019s all-around serviceable and occasionally very good. The attack sequence & gore are excellent for such a low budget film.  \r\n\r\nSome viewers have question the inclusion of the suspicious woodsman in the first act, but it corresponds to story structure \"rules\" in any type of suspense yarn, which is: When things slow down, bring in some kind of conflict, particularly in the first act. In other words, to encourage a viewer to keep watching give him\/her something near the beginning: conflict, trouble, fear, violence.\r\n\r\nI was honestly bored with the movie up until Brad (the guide) was introduced, which ultimately leads to confrontation. This relatively gripping sequence perked up my attention and encouraged me to keep watching. It's WHY the writer\/director included it, along with it being a challenge to Alex\u2019 competency, plus a red herring.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot at Restoule Provincial Park and nearby Powassan, Ontario (just south of North Bay), as well as Caddy Lake, Manitoba; I\u2019m assuming the city sequence was shot in Toronto.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B\/B-","id":"5c7919b3c3a36844d418af1a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c7919b3c3a36844d418af1a","movie_id":228973}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Beware of the wolves in the sheepskins.\r\n\r\nI want to begin with what usually comes in the final paragraph in any review that it is a must see film. No matter who you are, whatever your profession is, you must not skip it for many reasons. The film was based on the non-fiction book of the same name by Naomi Oreskes and directed by the Oscar nominated documentary 'Food, Inc.' filmmaker.\r\n\r\nRecently I read somewhere that 'there are more fake flamingos in the world than real ones'. I thought it was a stat that makes clear there are very less flamingos than we presumed. But the point is it gives a different meaning when the same line used as a reference for this film. It is going to be big stride, yes it is. It all began after the WWII and carried out throughout 50 years during the Cold War, but just recent decades everyone realised its seriousness.\r\n\r\nWhen someone interferes with our personal thing, stating that he's an official from the respective field, we ask for the identity proof. But what if it is a conspiracy, how we are going to know it. The common people are always falling prey for such tricks because of the corrupted ministers and the powerful giant corporates. Like, we're the sheep herd and they are the wolves in the sheep's skin. This film is not trying to expose them their entire wrong doings, but on a particular topic, and that is the Global Warming.\r\n\r\nThe media and press plays a crucial part here, but some of them opted a wrong path. Maybe because of the poor knowledge and investigation, or influenced people around them. So the story opens with the cigarettes, how the tobacco companies fooled people in the 60s, 70s till the 90s. The book this movie adapted was written by an American historian, so it's all about the things that happened in the States. But it is still very much the world's concern too, as America is one of the top countries to export modern science and technology to all the corners, especially the third world countries.\r\n\r\n> \"We're leaving our children and grandchildren,\r\n> the legacy of people who failed to lead.\"\r\n\r\nToday's world's hot topic is, the climate change. Because of human there are plenty of species gone extinct than the natural extinct happened in the presence of human alongside. So, the biggest them all is he's posing a same threat to himself. If that happens, the human will be wiped out. The earth will recycle itself over the thousand years of evolution and the life will be restored, the new kind. Human is the only animal on the earth who do stuff for pleasure and those pleasures comes in many ways. One such thing is the money.\r\n\r\nScience is not one hundred per cent perfect, not yet, but that is the closest estimation that we have today to predict anything advancely. The world is not the same compared to 100 years ago, the religion is no more threat to the science. The evolution in science is taking place at a brisk pace, lots of stuffs were studied, understood, discovered in the last two decades than over two thousand years. Those who are doing their work is constantly interrupted by the new kind of troublemakers. Those people are the hired counterparts to the scientists who claims they are experts, but why they are doing it is a disgusting truth.\r\n\r\nIt is a very good message movie. You might probably realise from now on who to believe and why, because that was this documentary's notion that makes people open their eyes to the truth and reality. If you're still in your blindfold, then you're on the wrong side with the wrong people. I want to make you clear on one final thing that this documentary is not trying to prove the Global Warming theory, but it was a debate between the people who tried to stop it and the people who tried to prove it was not a hoax. It is about exposing the dirty works.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"561e7f04c3a368722400007b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/561e7f04c3a368722400007b","movie_id":288789}

There seems to be a rut that has emerged where this new brand of horror film makers can't see that recycling the same ideas is, well, kinda dull.\r\n\r\nInsidious, Dead Silence and The Conjuring have their critics (not me, I like them all very much), but the timing was right for them to hit the mark of many a horror film lover. Tapping into the fear of the doll and the demon hadn't been done for some time, certainly not with any conviction, so all good there for the fans.\r\n\r\nAnnabelle spins off from The Conjuring, and Dead Silence to a degree, but just comes off as a lazy cash-cow. The doll is a spooky monstrosity (most unlike the real Rag-Dolly-Anna version), but it's all a bit of a con, the makers resorting to another demonic being, only Red Darth Maul has now been replaced by Blue Lagoon The Loon.\r\n\r\nCharacter's actions are often preposterous, stretching credulity to breaking point (I know you are being menaced by the unknown, but I got a conference to go to, sleep tight babe!). Elsewhere, while everyone acknowledges that what scares you is subjective, but the scares here are very thin on the ground, not helped by a dull script and bland lead actors.\r\n\r\nIt's tidy enough a production, granted, but familiarity breeds contempt and it's hoped that Wan's return to the director's chair for The Conjuring 2 (where we revisit the realm of poltergeist activity), signals a return to form for his horror stable. 5\/10","id":"550e039bc3a368211c000b1e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/550e039bc3a368211c000b1e","movie_id":250546}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Some arrogant men too have a soft touch inside their heart.**\r\n\r\nIt was a decent romantic-comedy with a good cast. But is an old people romance theme and if you like this director's films, then you would enjoy it as well. A simple tale, and some of the contents looks unreal because of intense story development. An elderly man who is in the real estate business tries to sell his house after his wife's death. Now lives in a small apartment surrounded by the annoying neighbours, but one day his drug addict son brings his daughter to leave with him since he's going to prison. Without an alternate he accepts it and in the meantime, the film narrates their bond as well as his romance with a next door woman.\r\n\r\nThis film was rated so badly, but I quite enjoyed it. I know it is not an awesome film, yet I felt it a bit touching and at a time funny. Michael Douglas was very good and so the Diane Keaton with the supporting actors' fine contributions. It was at its best, there was nothing to improve, because if it does the fun part would vanish. So it is as what it is, only we have to jump in and have some good time knowing the film's limit. Maybe the family audience finds it quite comfortable. Looking at the theme and the narration that's how it should be. So a big yes for them, but it has some sexual references and I'm just reminding that if you want to watch it with your children.\r\n\r\n6.5\/10","id":"57d30a82c3a3681ff700081f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57d30a82c3a3681ff700081f","movie_id":253235}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Face-off: The Antboy, Beetleboys and the Red Fury.\r\n\r\nIt's been a year and half since the first part I saw, so I don't remember much. But I know it was short and sweet little superhero movie for children, like this one. A theme like this might end as a trilogy, but I never thought they would make a sequel after the average first film. Still, there is not much different between the two, especially when it comes to the stunts, very light. The story was a decent one, would have made an impact with the stunning action sequences. But keeping the little children in mind, the film falls soft and family friendly.\r\n\r\nIn this movie, the narration picks-up not too far from where it ended in the previous film. The Antboy is quite famous now, especially among the school kids. So that is where the story develops when he fails to keep the promise he made to one of his fans. The humiliated fan wants to take a revenge. Instead, it complicates further when a couple more supervillains emerge and challenges the town's favourite superhero, the Antboy. Bringing an end to all of this leads to one last battle before the credits roll.\r\n\r\n> \"A real hero is the one that allows all of us\r\n> on the outside to feel that we're not alone.\"\r\n\r\nIn the previous film, most of them were fresh faced and their performances have been only a just acceptable. Especially the Antboy's that I was worried about. I know the story demands geeky kid just like Spiderman and Superman when they were not in the superhero costume to keep the low profile. But now I see well progressed and a very professional lead boy. From the opening title and credits to till the end the visuals were high standards. Sometimes I thought the presentation was imitating the Marvels, mostly the 'Kick-Ass' with those comic pictures.\r\n\r\nThe Red Fury was introduced in a style, the new superpower character. Along the terror tvilling, whose superpower was inherited by the beetles. Totally a bug's world, the clash of the insects should we say. Listen this film (series) is just for fun, I believe any grownups won't take it a very seriously. If you are not interested, simply skip it, but I advise you to show the film to your little ones. The characters might be based on the Danish children's book, but somewhat looks like a mixed spoof of some of the great Hollywood flicks. Only a slightly betters the first film from the technical side, yet a very simple silly follow-up.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd\/10","id":"56116d749251415e53006216","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56116d749251415e53006216","movie_id":314285}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Let's cut to the chase. If you have seen Kahaani, you will find Nee Enge En Anbe underwhelming. That Sekhar Kammula is not interested in a frame-by-frame remake of Sujoy Ghosh's film and wants to stamp his fingerprints over this film is established the moment he introduces his heroine. Unlike Vidya Bagchi in Kahaani, Anamika, here, is not a pregnant woman to instantly earn our empathy and trust; she is an ordinary young woman who claims to have come from the US to India (Hyderabad, in particular) in search of her missing husband, Ajay Swaminathan. It shows that the director isn't worried about putting himself in a tighter spot and is willing to do his share of heavy lifting. In fact, he effectively shows how such a young woman could also be vulnerable \u2014 one cop wants her to share his bed in exchange for information on her husband, while another berates her and blames her after noticing that she has failed to button up her top.\r\n\r\nAnamika is helped by Parthasarathy ( Vaibhav), the only Tamilian in the police station, who develops a crush of sorts over her. Meanwhile, she is told by encounter specialist Amjad Ali Khan that Ajay is actually Milan Damji, a terrorist, who masterminded a horrifying bomb blasts months earlier. Anamika refuses to accept it as she sees this as a cover-up by the police to hide their inefficiency. Meanwhile, a hit man is murdering the people she had gone to asking for help, and everyone is interested in a hard drive that could be the key to solving the whole mystery.\r\n\r\nWhile the audacity to deviate from the original is appreciable, the deviations that Kammula and his co-writer Sai Prasad bring in to the basic plot of the original are what, sadly, let this film down. The Hindi version was essentially an elaborate act of cinematic rug-pulling and yet, it always felt plausible (at least while we were watching it) and also explained the hows and whys in a convincing manner. Here, the final reveal only leaves us with more questions that need answers \u2014 from how did Anamika realize the true nature of the villain to why do the cops, led by Khan, never discuss the possibility of capturing Milan Damji alive and why do the terrorists, knowing that she's on to them, leave Anamika alive (bafflingly, we are even shown a flashback of Damji murdering a woman who had identified him in the past).\r\n\r\nThe film's setting doesn't help as well. It is understandable that the filmmakers decided to set the film in Hyderabad as they were making a Tamil-Telugu bilingual but it alienates the Tamil viewer because we are never truly able to get the local flavour, despite the rousing score in the climatic Durga puja and the numerous zoom outs that Kammula resorts to show us the teeming locality in which Anamika stays. The lengthy Telugu and Hindi dialogues become too much of a strain beyond a point. The mismatched lip sync in scenes when we can make out the actors speaking in Telugu doesn't help either. There is even a laugh-out-loud instance when Sarathy, who is chasing the hit man, tells him, 'Aye nillu, odaathe'!\r\n\r\nThe performances, too, are just functional. Nayanthara, especially, doesn't internalize Anamika and fails to provide the character the minute shades that Vidya Balan gave to her Vidya Bagchi. So, be it when she is pleading with an Imam to provide some information or while running away from a cop who tries to feel her up or when facing a hit man on her doorstep, her acting seems all surface. The one scene where she does score is when she takes on Pasupathy and we are able to feel the character's righteous anger. Even here, she is overshadowed by Pasupathy who is very good in a role that isn't as clearly drawn as Nawazuddin Siddiqui's Khan in the original. The actor is all fire and brimstone initially during the scene, taking out his anger and frustration at not being able to capture Milan Damji on Anamika but once he sees it in her eyes that she is genuine (after her outburst), he mellows down in a manner that is remarkable.","id":"53baad9b0e0a263588002b0f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baad9b0e0a263588002b0f","movie_id":263428}

{"author":"Sriram","content":"It looks like Vijay has realized that he can be in mass masala films that are not only entertaining to his fan base but also to every segment in the audience. He did this earlier with films like Ghilli, Pokkiri and Thuppakki, and does it now with Jilla. This time, he shares the glory with Mohanlal, who plays his godfather in the film. The plot revolves around Sivan (Mohanlal), a don in Madurai, who brings up Sakthi (Vijay), whose father died for him, as his own son. The two are a formidable force in the city but circumstances force Sivan to ask Sakthi to become a cop. But when an accident results in the death of several innocents, Sakthi wants his father to turn over a new leaf. But the older man is not in the mood to heed his advice, and soon, the two are on opposing sides. \r\n\r\nAs far as commercial films are concerned, Jilla is definitely assured filmmaking. Neason understands that the conflict between Sivan and Sakthi is what powers his film and sets up the initial clash between these two characters very well. Sakthi's realizes the error of his ways after a horrible blast, which happens because of Sivan's decision. The scenes following this blast are quite horrific for this kind of film but they are so effective in making us understand why someone as loyal as Sakthi will shift sides and decides to take on the person who is his father figure. The confrontation scene is very well shot and the dialogues too are punchy in this scene. Vijay and Mohanlal are very good here. Vijay utters Sakthi's lines in a nonchalant way (Unakkaga enaku pidikadha khakhi potu police aanen illa, enakkaga nee ippo nallavana maaru) while Mohanlal treats Sivan's lines with seriousness, and so we get to see where each character stands \u2014 the son only wants his father to change but the latter will not give an inch from his position and is even ready to banish him from the house. When the intermission point arrives, we eagerly anticipate what might come next. \r\n\r\nNeason also keeps Sivan's character in the grey area \u2014 he never has any remorse for the blast, he even brokers for a pharma company which is banned everywhere in the world; he is so egoistic that he wants to put Sakthi in place at any cost. Which is why, we feel cheated when the director decides to bring in another antagonist who wants to bring down the father-son duo. Thankfully, our disappointment doesn't last long as this character poses a formidable challenge to Sakthi and that keeps this segment engaging. He even has a minor victory when he manages to kill a character close to Sakthi and Sivan. \r\n\r\nThe lighter portions too are done with confidence. Neason understands the irony of a guy who hates the khakhi falling in love with a woman who is a cop, and treats the romance in a playful manner. He even approaches the scene in which Sivan urges Sakthi to become a cop in a similar vein. A godfather asking his son to do something he hates is heavy duty drama material but the director sidesteps this by going for a good-humoured tone, and just to not make it appear too frivolous, makes Sakthi tell his mom that he will do anything to not see his dad tearing up again. He also manages to get away with the implausible scenario of a don's hireling becoming a cop. \r\n\r\nThe main issue with Jilla is that it is overlong. Neason, probably in an effort to make it a wholesome entertainer, keeps packing in scenes oblivious to the running time. So, we have an unwarranted sub-plot involving Sakthi's sister and forcefully fitted songs which only make the film lengthy. Also, his tendency to cut to a childhood moment every time he wants to make an emotional statement becomes gratuitous after a point \u2014 the film itself begins with Sakthi as a boy; when Sakthi is injured, he recalls a moment when Sivan rushed to him when he injured himself as a boy; when his brother talks about growing up holding Sakthi's hands, he cuts to a montage of two boys holding hands.","id":"53bb165c0e0a26196b000268","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bb165c0e0a26196b000268","movie_id":246087}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"In a poignant scene in Jigarthanda, an elderly man tells Karthik, a young guy who is on the verge of directing his first film, about the attitude of debutant filmmakers. They will demand everything and not compromise, the old man says and goes on to narrate how he, when he was all set to direct a film after a decade of toil in the industry, refused to accept the request of his producer to cast two of his relatives and walked out of the project saying he will get a thousand other producers for his story. \"Aana, kadaisi varikkum aayirathula oruthan kooda varala,\" he says to make Karthik understand that he has to grab the opportunity that is knocking on his doors, despite the conditions it brings along with it. \r\n\r\nGiven that Jigarthanda was the first script that Karthik Subbaraj had written before he 'compromised' and made Pizza (the applause that his name generates during the title credits show how influential this young director has become), he should know how a good filmmaker can exploit a compromise. And, that is essentially what the film is all about \u2014 a filmmaker forced to make the worst possible compromise turning it into the best possible chance. \r\n\r\nThe film begins with an award-winning director ( Nasser, in a cameo) and a producer ( Naren) fighting over the merits of Karthik's ( Siddharth) short film on the sets of a reality show. The director dubs it \"kuppa padam\" and the producer, who clearly has personal issues to settle with him, calls it the best he has seen on the show and announces that he will produce Karthik's first film. But when the young man approaches him, he tells him that he wants not a message movie but a bloody gangster movie. He lists Hollywood films in the genre (The Godfather, Scarface, \"Tarantino\") and tells Karthik, \"Idhu madhiri oru script ready pannu,\" and without pausing adds, \"Illa idhaye script-a pannalum OK\". \r\n\r\nBut like any self-respecting first-time filmmaker, Karthik has too much integrity and so decides that he will make a gangster film based on a true gangster. He gets to know about Assault Sethu (Simhaa), a fearsome gangster who calls the shot in Madurai, and decides to go to the temple town to research about Sethu and come up with an authentic gangster movie. He entices his Madurai-based friend Oorani ( Karuna, who carries forward his Yaamirukka Bayamey form) to help him in the task but the duo is hardly able to make progress. But Sethu enters his life in the least expected way leading to situations that could put both his filmi career and life in danger. \r\n\r\nIf Pizza was a con movie dressed up as a haunted house horror thriller, Jigarthanda is basically a comedy cloaked as a gangster movie. In the first half, the director provides us the gangster thriller that the trailers promised us \u2014 a villain who is both awesome and frightening, his quirky underlings (one of them is a teetotaler and a god-fearing man whose weakness is porn and the scenes where Karthik and Oorani try to woo him by supplying him porn are a blast), brutal murders, and a tense interval block. There is even some virtuoso camerawork by the cinematographer Gavemic Ary, and a lengthy shot in the scene where an attempt is made by a rival to murder Sethu is remarkable. The heroine, too, is an interesting character and isn't there just for the romantic track. She and her mom, an idli seller who cooks for Sethu, are Sourashtrians (this is the second film in recent times to show the heroine as a Sourashtrian, after Naan Than Bala), and they are part of a group that steals saris from cloth stores! \r\n\r\nThe tone gradually shifts in the second half and unlike Pizza, where a single reveal altered our view of the film, here, we never realize that we are seeing a film different from the one we had seen in the first half. The mood lightens considerably over the scenes and we never find this shift in genres jarring when the mood turns somewhat serious again towards the end. The intensity drops in the second half, which does have shades of the Malayalam film Udayananu Tharam (which was influenced by the Steve Martin-Eddie Murphy-starrer Bowfinger) but this is certainly not an 'inspired' film. Also, Sethu's transformation in the end seems a little predictable (and also sentimental), but the actors, especially Simhaa, who owns this role and is terrific in the climax, make us forget this niggle to a large extent. \r\n\r\nKarthik Subbaraj has called the film a musical gangster film and the soundtrack is definitely eclectic and involves a melange of genres. Santhosh Narayanan uses everything from funky Tamil folk to pieces that recall Ennio Morricone's scores for spaghetti westerns in the background. Then, there are also film songs that are used as montages. The film opens to the strains of Paasa Malar's Malarnthu Malaratha (we see it first playing in a theatre where a shootout happens but in what is a frequently employed style in the film, the song spills over into the next scene where it plays as the hero's ringtone), but there is also the mandatory Ilaiyaraaja song (here, it is Kadhalin Deepam Ondru) and even something as recent as Pesuren Peuren from Pannaiyarum Padminiyum. And, if the heroine tells a 'kavidhai' involving rain and Ilaiyaraaja, in a scene that wants to inform that the 80s was not just restricted to the maestro, Sethu tells in another scene that he is a fan of Shankar-Ganesh! This kind of subversive streak is what makes this film singular and reinforces that Karthik Subbaraj as one of the exciting filmmakers of our time.","id":"53e4d8ec0e0a262b80006e75","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53e4d8ec0e0a262b80006e75","movie_id":270766}
{"author":"Grant English","content":"What makes <em>Edge of Tomorrow<\/em>'s 'failure' a bit surprising is how many of us have always wondered - what would happen if you put <em>Groundhog Day<\/em> in the context of an invasion of Earth by aliens keen on destroying the human race?  Okay...so bad example.  \r\n\r\nThis is about action, killing aliens, and getting in as many 'gallows humor' one-liners as possible.  And I realize it tanked in the theaters (relatively speaking) but (I can't believe I'm going to say this)...\r\n\r\nBut it's a fun movie.  It's entertaining, the directing is sharp and quick.  In <em>Groundhog Day<\/em>, about the 4th time you \"I Got You Babe\" you are screaming at the film - \"WE GET IT!!!  MOVE THE STORY ALONG!!\"  That never happens in <em>Edge of Tomorrow<\/em>.  Each cycle through, the story advances and another layer is revealed.  The director seems to get that the audience is smart and they can keep up.\r\n\r\nTom Cruise is well, he's Tom Cruise.  But Emily Blunt is fantastic in the film.  \r\n\r\nThe ending was a bit of a head-scratcher.  Won't spoil it here but the rest of the movie works and thought it was very entertaining.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I have to say that this movie was surprisingly enjoyable. I did have my doubts about it. I always have doubts about movies that manipulate time. I guess one advantage the movie has is that it does not really involve time travel and changing the past to influence the future but \u201conly\u201d resetting a day and living it over and over again.\r\n\r\nThe entire concept is of course still totally ludicrous. Even if we forget about the feasibility about resetting time altogether there are just so many things that are wrong with the concept. For example, is time reset all over the universe or just on Earth? Both of those avenues create their own issues further down the line of course. Even if we try to forget these larger issues there are the issue that as soon as Cage altered his own behavior from one repetition of that day to another he would alter the chain of events and what he knew was the events in the previous repeat would no longer be certain in the one he was living right then. Not to mention that he had a longer and longer chain of people to convince on a single day and still get the job done.\r\n\r\nOkay, enough harping about that. If you manage to lock out all these annoying issues with the story what remains is, as I wrote before, actually a fairly enjoyable movie. It is primarily a science fiction action movie of course and the action as well as special effects are not bad at all. We get treated to plenty of the classical d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu scenes were Cage tries to convince people by predicting their immediate future in minute details. Classical and very not innovative but well done and I have to admit that I am a bit of a sucker for these impress-and-surprise someone scenes. On the whole the movie managed to use the basic concept of reliving the day and make it feel reasonable fresh despite it not being a entirely new idea. The fact that the acting was quite adequate and that both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt made a good performance as far as I am concerned of course helped.\r\n\r\nNaturally the movie builds up towards the climactic battle against the alien central organism and of course everyone (who Cage managed to convince) have to throw in their lives to get Cage in position for the final attack. Personally I liked the ending although I have to say that I was a bit miffed that the writer did not manage to come up with some more imaginative ending scene between Cage and Rita though.\r\n\r\nBottom line, an enjoyable movie well worth watching.","id":"544a4ff30e0a267479003db7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/544a4ff30e0a267479003db7","movie_id":137113}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Resetting the day.\r\n\r\nEdge of Tomorrow is directed by Doug Liman and collectively written by Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth. It stars Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, with music by Christophe Beck and cinematography by Dion Beebe.\r\n\r\nIt has proved to be a great decade for sci-f, it seems that for every misfire there are three great genre films to off set the disappointments. Sitting at the top end of the table is Edge of Tomorrow (AKA: Live Die Repeat). Adapted from Hiroshi Sakurazaka's novel \"All You Need Is Kill\", the story has Cruise as William Cage, an American army Major who upon being thrust into combat against an alien race decimating Earth, finds he awakens to the same day after being killed in action. Seeking out Rita (Blunt), the most decorated soldier of the time, Cage must understand what is happening to him and hopefully save the future of mankind.\r\n\r\nSo far so Groundhog Day\/Source Code then, but Liman's film never lets up from the get go, frenetic with its action, funny into the bargain, and also sexy, it manages to blend audience pleasing conventions with clever thought and process. There's nothing new in the philosophy on show, and there are regular sci-fi tropes for familiarity of genre, but if you are going to recycle formula then do it with verve and swagger, which this most assuredly does. Boosted by Cruise turning in a good one as an unlikable character who develops into a protag to shout for, and Blunt as a super sexy bad-ass poster girl for the war effort, Edge of Tomorrow ultimately rocks. The science will obviously infuriate those who take such things way too seriously, but as the terror of this particular war unfolds on screen (nifty effects), and we have been bought wholesale into our heroes and their quest, its small failings are hardly worth cocking a snook at. 8\/10","id":"59d0abb0c3a368786c016514","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59d0abb0c3a368786c016514","movie_id":137113}
{"author":"EmkEyen","content":"I don't know much about theatre in Japan, but I associate this movie to be similar to the the little Noh I have seen, even though the stage play in center of the narrative is based on the play \"Yotsuya Kaidan\" from the later period of Kabuki theatre. \r\n\r\nKuime takes you on a mesmerizing journey of two, if not three or more, parallel narratives where the on stage facilitates the backstage drama. The pacing is very restrained and timing for accents is crucial. Aesthetically it is very pleasing and has an interesting exposed re-use of the movie sets similar to the actors doing multiple roles and their stories being intertwined. Finally the horror elements are creeping and lead up to several gruesome conclusions. \r\n\r\nThat said, I can see why it did not attract a western audience, as the pacing may be too slow for a western horror audience and the multilayered narrative is more common in the festival circuit. \r\n\r\nPersonally I find that after the one and half hours of elegant theater, the twenty minutes or so finale was a bit crude and could have been worked through better. Still, I found myself very attentive throughout the movie, got affected by the horrific crescendos and maintained an interest for the artistic aspects as well. In conclusion, I'd consider it one of the better movies I have seen by Takashi Miike.","id":"5aa5d8549251415e3f000377","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5aa5d8549251415e3f000377","movie_id":199925}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Sometimes facing the past is the key for the future.**\r\n\r\nWhoa! Why I did not see it before! Seems I totally underestimated it. Lots of good films were released in the 2015 and this is surely one of them. Among the small cost films, this is one of the top 5 films. There's no logic, just a simple storyline with a dark humour. Most of the scene seems deliberate, yet as a one film, very enjoyable.\r\n\r\nA man whose life has never been so colourful, was once saved by a woman who later married him. But now they are separating and he's now getting back to his old position. Instead, he decides to end his life. Before that, he makes a list of 'to do'. Hence returns his hometown to face his past. Begins his quest which will be accompanied by a young woman. The rest of the film focused on the final days of his life.\r\n\r\nI saw it, that's all matters.

{"author":"Reviewpuram Akilan","content":"I don\u2019t think if this can be called a meta-movie. It is something different. And special. This is not your usual \u201canthology\u201d. This is a story of 4 directors, setting out to 4 short films revolving around the theme \u201cdeath\u201d, given to them by the mysterious producer. If you find this baseline to be interesting, wait till you watch the film. It is an enthralling experience from start to finish. Srijit Mukherjee, for my eyes, is a master story-teller. He weaves magic in the form entertaining stories.\r\n\r\nThe film touches multiple genres, with a brilliant narrative structure. The narration is easily the best among Indian films in the past year. The skips, the cuts, time lapses, the transitions between real and reel are a pure treat to watch. \r\n\r\nFor example, there is a scene where a director is narrating his story, and we are cut to a frame where the lead character is featured in the middle of a room. The director is seen to be placing articles in the room, apparently being in the process of production design or \u201cart direction\u201d. He is then interrupted by another director who is listening to the story, and the visual of the director inside his \u201ccharacter\u2019s\u201d room stops what he\u2019s doing, turns around and answers the question. Well, that just took the candidness of the film to another level! There are many more unconventional moments such as this which are bound to make you fall in love with Srijit the audacious story-teller .\r\n\r\nThere is this funeral post-climax, and I honestly feel it was one brilliant piece in this big jigsaw puzzle. There is no \u201crain\u201d at the funeral and no \u201cdark\u201d color-grading. Just simple and straight-forward stuff, no cliches. And it also evokes few laughs, you\u2019ll know when you watch it. \r\n\r\nThings aren\u2019t complicated, neither are they superficial. There are many underlying themes like retribution and death, which are put forth in the most inventive ways possible. And then there\u2019s the social commentary as well. I leave it to you to figure out where it is placed. You\u2019ll be amazed when you realise the placement. The songs are beautiful, with the female version \u201cBasanto Eshe Geche\u201d standing out tall. The background score is adequate, and the overall production value, slick. I felt there were few unwanted characters and few minutes of screentime wasted on them. Maybe they simply can\u2019t be replaced, but could have been done away with completely. They don\u2019t add anything to the story in terms of progression. \r\n\r\nParambrata Chaterjee is a revelation, be it his body language or dialogue delivery. The dialogue where he references Clint Eastwood is a scene where he reaches another level of eccentricity! He is one actor who could, in the near future, be the face of indie flicks in our part of the world\u2026\r\n\r\nAlready among the best Indian films of 2014, Chotushkone is a ride one must not miss. Though not visually arresting, the screen will have your attention, thanks to the actors and situations they go through. And there are the unexpected twists thrown at us, which will leave you watching in glee. With all the detailing and commentary on contemporary cinema, this is one film every cinephile should watch once in his life.","id":"54639675c3a368124a00273b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54639675c3a368124a00273b","movie_id":302632}

But once the character Jim Bob Luke was introduced in a grand style, the narration went off the track.\r\n\r\nThe best parts were over, I got lost interest, and I asked myself why it has to be like this after a wonderful opening? Especially for the character Dane who was a family man and his choice was completely wrong. As mush as Dane, I wanted to know who he shot, but that was not the story's intention to reveal and went in a different direction to disappoint me.\r\n\r\nThe guys (actors) were awesome, but the writing was a let down, it owes lots of explanation rather telling a decent story. It was an indie crime-thriller based on the novel of the same name, sets in the 1980s.

So I was not surprised with the movie, but enjoyed the entertainment it offered.\r\n\r\nRainn Wilson's the man of the movie, but as for the narration Elijah Woods stands on the front. In this, the children were the antagonist, but it is an R rated movie and nothing was so serious to consider. You know bashing kids kind of stuffs were carefully crafted. Comedy means not like you're going to get the loud ones, but simply acceptable for a change in the storytelling.\r\n\r\nIf you exclude the zombie kids, the rest of the movie was nothing new. The same old adventure with the similar group of people who tries to survive the epidemic.

{"author":"Kalla Malla","content":"Collar basiert lose auf einem Traum, den Regisseur Ryan Nicholson vor einiger Zeit hatte. Spontan von der Idee eines Obdachlosen, der Frauen ankettet, foltert und vergewaltigt, fasziniert, rief er eine Indiegogo Kampagne ins Leben, um den Film von seinen Fans pledgen zu lassen. Nachdem Illusions Unltd. noch als Produzent mit ins Boot kam, war der Film praktisch schon im Kasten.\r\n\r\nAllen Ank\u00fcndigungen zum Trotz ist \"Collar\" jetzt kein wirklicher K.O. Schlag f\u00fcr den Zuschauer geworden, aber immerhin ein recht siffiges Grindhouse Filmchen. Die Story um den folternden Penner wurde mit einer sich einmischenden Polizisten, sowie zwei Jungs, die in ihrer Freizeit Bumfights filmen, noch etwas aufpoliert. Doch leider verl\u00e4uft sich \"Collar\" sehr schnell in seiner nicht nachvollziehbaren Handlung. \r\n\r\nDie Hintergrundgeschichte des t\u00f6tenden Obdachlosen, \u00fcbrigens gespielt vom laufenden Fleischberg Nick Principe, als vom Pfarrer missbrauchter Junge, ist ebenso klischeehaft wie letzten Endes unn\u00fctz. Auch die beiden Hobby-Nachwuchsfilmer, die Obdachlosen 5 Dollar geben, damit sie sich gegenseitig die K\u00f6pfe einschlagen, wollen so gar nicht ins Geschehen passen. Klar, man k\u00f6nnte es als Anspielungen an die realen \"Bum Fights\" Filme der Indecline Schmiede ansehen, aber letzten Endes wird es in \"Collar\" auch blo\u00df zum Selbstzweck verwendet.\r\nF\u00fcr mich als gro\u00dfer Fan von Ryan Nicholsons bisherigen Werken, machte sich allerdings dann auch im Bereich der Effekte etwas Ern\u00fcchterung breit. Nat\u00fcrlich wird hier gefoltert und heftig Grenzgebiet des \u00a7131 StGB geschnetzelt, so dass jedes Amtsgericht seine wahre Freude an dem Streifen h\u00e4tte, aber von Nicholson ist man doch andere Gore-Attacken gewohnt. \r\n\r\nSchnell geschnittene T\u00f6tungsszenen kennt man von ihm nicht, denn er ist einer der wenigen, der die Kamera bei seinen Killszenen meistens so lange draufh\u00e4lt, bis der Effekt schon anf\u00e4ngt zu langweilen. Das ist aber nunmal sein Markenzeichen und gerade im Falle von \"Collar\" habe ich fest damit gerechnet, dass dieser wirklich extrem unabh\u00e4ngige, von seinen Fans gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils produzierte Film, noch brutaler zur Sache schreitet.\r\nErw\u00e4hnenswert ist auch die Tatsache, dass der Film, zusammen mit \"Torched\" und mit Abstrichen auch \"Star Vehicle\", einer der wenigen ernsten Nicholson-Filme ist. Er verzichtet auf sperrfeuerartige \"Fuck-Salven\" wie in \"Gutterballs\", bietet keinen Anspielungen auf trashige Eastern (Live Feed) oder andere Horrorfilme wie \"Street Trash\" (Hanger) und liefert keine pubert\u00e4ren Sexwitze (Famine). Das kann man gut finden oder nicht - Fakt ist (und das m\u00f6chte ich nochmal erw\u00e4hnt haben), dass Ryan Nicholson mich mit seinen bisherigen Filmen immer unterhalten konnte und einer meiner bevorzugten Horror Regisseure ist. Unter anderem auch gerade aufgrund seiner Filmzitate.\r\n\r\nNur von \"Collar\" h\u00e4tte ich mir dann doch etwas mehr erwartet, als \"nur\" einen d\u00fcsteren Rape And Revenge Film. Mit Unter 80 Minuten Laufzeit hat man genau das richtige Mittelma\u00df erwischt um nicht zu langweilen, genauso wie der Film sich eher wie ein kleines Geschenk an die Fans anf\u00fchlt, als ein tats\u00e4chlicher \"Spielfilm\". Er ist ein schneller Fingerschwenk des Meisters, wenn man denn so m\u00f6chte, der sich durch die simple, wenn auch v\u00f6llig verworrene Handlung samt nicht nachvollziehbaren Handlungen der Protagonisten, gewaltig das Bein stellt.\r\n\r\nGl\u00fcckwunsch an der Stelle auch an meine Mutter, die im Abspann unter \"Special Thanks\" gef\u00fchrt wird, da ich aufgrund fehlender Aufmerksamkeit \u00fcber ihr PayPal Konto gespendet habe.

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"Cold In July brings synthesised chills, bloody sleet and fatherly responsibilities. The distinction between murder, manslaughter and self-defence is one that continues to grow more appropriate in America with each passing year. How does one determine the truth when only one key witness is available to divulge in their perspective? Especially when the odds are in their favour by accidentally shooting a \u201cwanted felon\u201d in the eye. The police view it as heroism. The general public questioning its intent. The victim\u2019s father overwhelmed with rage and demented turmoil, threatening the safety of the family thrown into the icy-cold chills of crime.\r\n\r\nMickle\u2019s intentionally masculine crime thriller is one that evokes themes of fatherhood. The paternal rights and responsibilities of their children who may, or may not, be following the path of sin. Ever increasing the protectorship of their guardian figure for the sake of the family they have lovingly crafted. It\u2019s a natural instinct. To protect our own flesh and blood, no matter the cost. But what if that expenditure is too severe? What if their existence is causing suffering to others? The morality of these two fathers, the shooter and the victim\u2019s patriarch, is tested through unlawful extremities. Challenges that conjure inner turmoil. And it\u2019s only through Mickle\u2019s astute direction do we as viewers journey down this careening route of masculinity.\r\n\r\nWhat starts off as a simplistic revenge thriller soon complicates itself into an absorbingly comedic drama, whilst still shrouded in pulpy neo-noir aesthetics. Grace\u2019s booming synthesised score and Samul\u2019s ornate use of vivid neon backdrops cement the noir elegance. Yet it\u2019s Mickle\u2019s insistence in shifting genres, adding a quirky aura of surrealism to the mix, that acts as gritty adhesive. Does it work? Not quite. The brutal tension that is meticulously built up in the first hour is palpable. Slow panning through tight corridors. Strikes of lightning illuminating the bleak darkness of 80\u2019s Texas. The atmosphere compact with nullified thrills.\r\n\r\nThen the plot thickens. The local police become involved, a recruited Private Investigator struts his stuff and suddenly the genre changes. Intrinsic comedy is injected through Johnson\u2019s character, contrasting against Shepard and Hall\u2019s intimidatingly serious performances. Unfortunately, this relieves the suffocating tension that preceded it, relying on a clich\u00e9d yet stylistic conclusive shootout with moments of jarring humour. Whilst it does add characterisation, Mickle\u2019s screenplay rarely furthers itself by being weighed down by overly basic dialogue. Conversational scenes, particularly between the two fathers, seemed muted. Lacking in fire and anger. If the script had been tighter with some sharper tongues for the characters, the complacent genre shift would\u2019ve been more forgiving. The two were unable to mesh cohesively.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not a detriment to the overall technicality and theatricality of Cold In July. It remained bitterly deadly throughout and utterly watchable. If only the script had been tighter and the narrative differences more seamless when transitioning, we could\u2019ve had ourselves an incredibly rare hidden gem of noir excellence.","id":"5e206a36b3316b0011038251","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e206a36b3316b0011038251","movie_id":244509}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> An innovative horror-drama with a simplicity.\r\n\r\nIt was not too long ago I saw the director's other film, his first one and liked it instantly. I did not expect him to go all the way from a beautiful teen drama to a creepy horror flick. But I liked this movie as well, thus that prove he's not a fluke. After seeing his both the films, I can detect the style of presentation that marks his trademark. That is very realistic, dull, but a natural societal atmosphere with a mere background score.\r\n\r\nI have said many times that these days horror flicks are heavily leaning on the scary noise\/sounds. But this film brings the tone that's really happening around us. The story was like a straight flowing river, no twists or turns like the Amazon river. Even it did not try to hide the existence of the evil spirit. Not only from us, but among the characters in the story. That means it is a very simple tale with the compelling scenes.\r\n\r\nIt does not look like a cheap horror, this 2 million movie can stand up to any fancy horror flicks. The writer\/director's interpretation was very interesting too. Like he said IT could board a plane to follow who he's after. The theme was also very innovative. Quite similar types have made out, but this one was way better. Yep, many movie goers overwhelmed by the unexpected, even the filmmakers for the response.\r\n\r\nNow I pray for if there is going to be a sequel, it must be made by the same writer\/director. My worry is the B category filmmakers going to spoil the original in the name of follow-up. I highly recommend this movie, especially for adults due to the plot that develops on the sexual intercourse. Though there's no strong nudity. I also suggest you to watch at night, if possible alone. I won't guarantee that it would scare out of you, but that's the best way to watch any horror flick.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"563a4bdd9251414c700021aa","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/563a4bdd9251414c700021aa","movie_id":270303}
{"author":"slayrrr666","content":"Hiking through the Irish countryside, a group of tourists encounter a group of demented locals living in a remote village offering sacrifices to a deadly leprechaun intending them to be next and must find a way to fight off the villagers as well as the deadly creature.\r\n\r\nThis one isn't nearly as bad as it's reputation. One of the strongest aspects of this one is the fact that there's a lot of work done here to enhance the historical connection of their trip with the folklore of the area. The film features some rather enjoyable work about the story of the Celtic origins of the area, from their stories about the past settlers and it's connection to the different monuments around the woods to the different measures of protecting them from the creature as it sets out to hunt them one-by-one all manage to readily make this one quite nice in that regard. As well, there's plenty of incredibly fun action to be had throughout here which carries this one along quite fast and frantic, with the opening stalking of the couple lost in the woods, the later scene of the group getting chased through the woods into the secondary cabin where not only do they come face-to-face with the true intentions behind the arrival there and a pretty enjoyable brawl in the woods where they're captured and prepared for the sacrifice. The ensuing fight with the creature when it appears is rather decent as well, and the final lead-up to the brawl in the cabin where it tracks them down for it's final big fight is a big highlight, yet none of this is possible without the glorious high-impact action with them trapped in the cabin unaware of the creature stalking them outside. Discovering their trapped inside, the first hints that something is inside with them and the different means of barricading themselves away and it breaking through which really enhances the suspense of the situation and gives this one a ton of action along the way. The finale does come close to the impact of this one, with the scenes of them inside the truck and escaping into the woods with the creature right on them and leading into the house ambush which is rather tense and gives this some solid action to finish this off on a high-note. Along with the fine gory kills, these here hold this one up over it's few flaws as it did have a few troubling issues. The film's biggest problem is the fact that the creature never really seems consistent in it's motivations. Initially it seems to be after them for encroaching on it's territory, then it goes after the franchises' storyline of the desire for gold and then it becomes apart of the sacrificial storyline which doesn't make any sense and contradicts most of the other issues here as it never relly seems to be consistent within itself. Neither of these really make it play that well into the franchise as well which gives it a rather odd feeling of being just an ordinary creature on the loose and has nothing in common with the others so it does feel somewhat out-of-place in that regard. The other problematic area is the rather lousy special effects on the creature itself, which is usually so blurry and distorted by the rapid-fire quick-cut editing that you never get any kind of view of it and can tell what it looks like until the end despite it being present most of the movie. These here really drag it out.\r\n\r\nRated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.","id":"58cb3ebb9251415e5d005e89","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58cb3ebb9251415e5d005e89","movie_id":126172}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The religious and cultural influence in the modern America.\r\n\r\nThe second film together for the two lead actors and the director. This film characters were well understood and executed with a full details. It is always women filmmakers who do a fine job like this. While the western world is not able to differentiate between Sikhs and the one who they think these people are for just wearing turban, this film comes in handy to educate them. Especially the youths who are yet to grow up and learn what the real world is. No offense, just saying they are lack of the knowledge.\r\n\r\nA simple drama about two people from two different races. Since they meet very often during the driving lessons, an unexpected bond develops between them and begin to understand each others agony despite their cultural gap. It helps them to re-organise their struggling life, but the relationship is put on a tested when it reached at a certain stage. How they react to it and the plan for the rest of their lives reveals before ending the narration smartly.\r\n\r\nNo twists, but the interesting concept and the choices of the characters makes the film one of the well organised low cost products with a quality of the practical standards. Ben was amazing as usual, and it is his one of the remarkable small roles. Patricia Clarkson too was in a very casual character display as a typical middle-aged American wife going through a crisis.\r\n\r\nThis film reminds me the 'Midnight My Love'. Somewhat similar film yet culturally differentiates. So this film's not about how good the story is, but the society, how it views a person from outside and inside. It is also about the individual characters on how their life transforms with a new friendship and while learning new stuffs to put behind their bad past. This film suit better for the adults because of the theme on them. So I suggest you if you are one to try this wonderful tale.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"576037e1c3a3687c5e00162f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/576037e1c3a3687c5e00162f","movie_id":284286}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"The number of the beast?\r\n\r\nAn apparent victim of a hit and run, a mysterious stranger is held at a remote police station and starts to take over the emotional state of staff and inmates alike.\r\n\r\nIt's not a new premise, something which is being held against Brian O'Malley's film like it's a crime, but the execution, the technical guile, and atmospheric touches brought to the piece, mark this out as a horror film of some merit. Boosted by having the great Liam Cunningham in the lead role, it's a film that shocks and awes with each passing chapter. It revels in the bloody aspects that unfold, positioning the vile nature that some human's are prone to right at the forefront, and with bloody impact. \r\n\r\nPiers McGrail's cinematography is superb, the bold and beautiful shine of the blues and golden browns mingle disconcertingly with the down and dirty feel of the police cells, the latter of which appropriately marry up with the characters on show. Steve Lynch's score is a treat, a real nerve bothering piece of work, gnawing away at the senses in the same way that Cunningham's character tugs away at the emotional conditions of his prey. It's a film of many pleasures for the so inclined, it does get away from itself a little at the end, asking a little too much of the viewer, but it doesn't kill the pic and this is very much a horror necklace worth wearing on a night out. 7\/10","id":"5662960cc3a3682c01002c93","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5662960cc3a3682c01002c93","movie_id":276488}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I have to confess that I bought this movie a bit on a whim and my purchase decision was mostly based on the fact that Nicolas Cage was in it. That was a mistake! I should have done a wee bit more research before wasting my money. I did not really have any hopes that it would be a great movie but I at least hoped that it would be a somewhat decent disaster \/ apocalypse movie. Sadly, it is nothing of the kind.\r\n\r\nThis time I have to side with the people trashing this movie, even the so called \u201ccritics\u201d at Rotten Tomatoes. This is a bad movie. It could have been a half decent movie. The basic idea is perhaps not super original but it could have been made to work. However, it is simply loaded with religious bullshit. Once you filter out said bullshit, which is bloody difficult since you are more or less force fed it during most of the movie, there is really nothing left.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of people are bizarre to say the least. The dialogue is mostly nonsensical. The movies attempt at putting different and original characters, including an obnoxious dwarf, on the plane is feeble. The action and special effects are generally lousy and the attempts to put some thrill and drama into the landing of the plane is laughable. Come on, you see a plane coming, it doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that it has no pilot and is flying in a straight line. You are over the Atlantic, a minor course change would have done the job and there was plenty of time. But nooo, the idiot script writer had Cage fly in a straight line like a chicken race until it was too late. And do not get me started on the stupidity of having someone driving down a stretch of highway in a pickup truck knocking over plastic cones to \u201cclear it for landing\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe only reason this movie gets any stars at all is because I do like Nicolas Cage even in a lousy movie like this.","id":"5ae5c82e0e0a26792e004a49","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ae5c82e0e0a26792e004a49","movie_id":218043}
{"author":"Grant English","content":"The Winter Soldier has all the action, quirky one-liners, and bold adventure that we have come to expect of a Marvel movie.\r\n\r\nPlus we get introduced to a new\/old villain as well as some fun romantic tension between Steve Rogers (Captain America) and Natasha Romanoff (The Black Widow).  (Scarlett Johansson is perfect in this role.)\r\n\r\nBut this film also has some minor irritations all stemming from Marvel's tendency to make _Captain America_ more complicated than it really needs to be.\r\n\r\nMINOR SPOILER ALERT:\r\n1. The love story\/non-story.  Is this necessary? Will the Captain remain faithful to a 80 year-old woman on her deathbed OR engage in a date with his next door neighbor?  Plus the tension between him and Natasha Romanoff is intense.  This comes off as forced, awkward, and pointless.\r\n\r\n2. \u201cThe deception goes deeper than you can imagine. You can\u2019t trust anybody.\u201d  It's this way every time so it should no longer be a surprise.\r\n\r\n3. He\u2019s dead but not really. Not him, the other him. Well\u2026they both were dead \u2013 not really \u2013 but now they are both alive. But one of them can\u2019t remember who he really is. In this film we get to do this with two characters instead of one.  It\u2019s not a huge distraction but why does Marvel keep returning to this plot line? \r\n\r\nEND OF MINOR SPOILER ALERT\r\n\r\nThe Winter Soldier is best when Rogers and Romanoff are on the move trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together. The explosions are nice, the action scenes are intense but the real enjoyment of the film is where skill and wits are relied on more than gadgets and explosions. \r\n\r\nPatriotism is a bit more nuanced this time around and it's better for it.  The cast is great, no awkward acting moments to report.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Right from the beginning events of the scenes are poorly intensified.\r\n\r\nIt was a one sided narration, that is really a very bad for this kind of sensitive theme. But the prime intention was to bring the Guantanamo Bay detention camp's atrocity on the detainees by the US military. Well, it actually avoids those strong cruelties, and focuses the unusual relationship between a detainee and a woman guard.\r\n\r\nLimited cast, shot mostly in a single location with the budget of just one million USD, and an ordinary opening, but ended strong. I assumed a lot of things likely to happen while I was watching. Like Amy Cole (Kristen Stewart) was in undercover, to make detainees talk and collect the information. Because she was the only woman around, but as usual like most of the time I was wrong. It was so plain and filled with human emotions.\r\n\r\nI was strong and confident that they were just torturing the terrorists who deserved it. If you see it from the human perspective that was slightly a over-limit, only if you exclude their crimes. I just felt it was a propaganda to show US in a bad light. That is the reason it will not show terror strikes in the movie that committed by any of the detainee characters, but only the consequences they face.\r\n\r\nA Hollywood movie specially made to make feel good for the terrorists and those who support it. Okay, I agree, some were innocents. While fishing, a few other marine animals also gets trapped in the net as well, for that I feel sorry what happened to them. But 95% of them were heartless monsters. Everyone will have their own opinion on this film based on their religion, nationality or sympathetic for simply being a human, and everything are fair.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"5611692ac3a368680e012581","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5611692ac3a368680e012581","movie_id":244506}
{"author":"Gimly","content":"**A long format review from 2014**\r\n\r\nMisleadingly, the titular Winter Soldier is essentially a minor subplot in what is more of an espionage-technoir-thriller meets spectacle-epic than your typical super hero film. The real meat of the movie, thankfully, has some more substance behind it. Though it wouldn't surprise me if we learn later that Sebastian Stan's villain was forced to take a back seat via last minute script changes \u00e0 la Hawkeye in _The Avengers_.\r\n\r\nThese things are of course a matter of opinion, and I'd like to watch _Winter Soldier_ at least once more (particularly in 2D... God do I ever hate 3D) before committing to any particular ranking. But even without that, I feel confident in saying it's the best MCU Phase 2 film to date. We must await _Guardians of The Galaxy_ and _Age of Ultron_ before cementing that little award, but I'd say that it stands at the very least above _Iron Man 3_ and _The Dark World_.\r\n\r\nI always try to keep my reviews spoiler free, but being that in most parts of the world it isn't out yet, I'll be extra careful to do so with this one. This makes talking about _Winter Soldier_ on its own merits difficult, but there are certainly a few things that can be said.\r\n\r\nChris Evans (Cap'), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) and to a slightly lesser extent. Anthonie Mackie (Falcon) rule the film, and do so without any shortcomings. That's not to say that they couldn't physically have done any better, but their roles were all seamless as far as my blurred vision could tell, which is not an accolade I'd often give.\r\n\r\nWhere _The Dark World_ was simply a holding pattern for Thor with some very pretty pictures, _Iron Man 3_ and _The Winter Soldier_ went out and took some actual risks in their stories. But unlike _Iron Man 3's_, Winter Soldier's risks have (to its eternal credit) been universally well received.\r\n\r\nDirectors Joe and Anthony Russo also managed to cameo a couple of Community alumni, which will never be a bad thing in my eyes, even if they're just one-off, throwaway jokes.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I really feel I need to give _The Winter Soldier_ at the very least one more screening before I feel totally confident in my thoughts about it.\r\n\r\nBut the fact that I'm really fucking excited for that second viewing speaks in its favour if nothing else does.\r\n\r\n86%\r\n\r\n_-Gimly_","id":"5a2ccb3ac3a3680b8f145cdc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a2ccb3ac3a3680b8f145cdc","movie_id":100402}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Aniston at best!\r\n\r\nMight be this is what I was expecting from Aniston from a long ago. Since break-up with Brad Pitt, probably after 'Marley & Me', she has not given any best performance. This is her best shot to till date, maybe in her whole career. She would have not won, but her snub from the Oscar nominee was not justified. Unlike men, who gets better by aging, women are the opposite. In the old days I used to like Aniston, but nowadays, I don't know. In this film she has done without makeup, well, that's an honest attempt.\r\n\r\nNot a spellbinding narration, but it was all about Aniston's performance. There are a couple of cameo appearances, well, all the other character in the movie is like a cameo, including Sam Worthington's, but excluding our heroine. Worth watching this only for her performance, not for the story.\r\n\r\nThe past events should have been explained to let us know the truth along with the portrayal of the present. But it was kind of realism, I won't doubt about that, but sometime cinematic needs a proper detail rather than straightforward. Really a good movie, simultaneously not great as to praise the direction or the presentation that slightly missed the opportunity to be an awesome flick.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"55d381edc3a3683b83000414","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55d381edc3a3683b83000414","movie_id":284276}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is indeed a great piece of superhero entertainment. If superheroes and action, plenty of action, is within your sphere of interest then this movie truly delivers. There is even a story to support the stunts and special effects fireworks that is not too shabby. As a matter of fact, for being a Marvel-based movie, the story is more than acceptable.\r\n\r\nAs the blurb states, our hero is meeting a few adaptation issues after having been awaken into the modern world. Luckily the movie do not fall into the trap of making some silly comedy out of it but keeps these parts at a reasonable level where it stays funny without ruining the movie or disrupting the pace of the real story.\r\n\r\nThe story? Simple and not very original with the usual slew of traitors strewn about, you cannot trust anyone, our hero becomes a fugitive etc etc bla bla bla. It is however a pretty straightforward one which works quite well and is not getting bogged down in silly emotions and general idiotic behavior by our hero like for instance several instalments of Spider Man have done. Actually this is one thing that I really like with this movie. The hero is a true hero from start to finish without any of that modern Hollywood crap where the hero must be tarnished in one way or another to satisfy the directors and producers.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote above if you like superhero action movies then there is little not to like with this one. Acceptable story, plenty of action, good special effects, a cool chick (hey I am but an ordinary male, I like female actors in tight costumes) and a clear hero. None of the actors are really doing a bad job of it and in general the acting is as good as one can expect when portraying characters that, after all, are be totally ludicrous in real life. Its 8 out of 10 rating at IMDb (at the time of writing this) is well deserved. I am astonished that some people seem to have voted it down with a one star rating. It is a Marvel-based movie. You might feel it is more or less good but the style of the movie should not really be a major surprise to anyone and there is no way in hell that it deserves a one star rating unless someone really watched the wrong movie by accident.","id":"53f4879b0e0a267f8d001da8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53f4879b0e0a267f8d001da8","movie_id":100402}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Till the end of the road.\r\n\r\nStonking! Now this is more like it, after the disappointments that have been Iron Man 2 and Thor 2, Captain America gets a sequel of substance and sparks. It manages to blend everything required to make a great superhero film, lashings of derring-do heroics, action bonanza, adventure, some sexy sizzle and of course the key, a story with brains and mystery elements.\r\n\r\nTrue enough to say that the considerable contributions of Black Widow and Falcon (and Nick Fury of course) keeps this as a lively Avengers spin-off movie, which is no bad thing at all, but it's still the Captain who dominates things, marking himself out as a viable main man. In fact the whole film has the old school comic book feel, yes there's the grandiose pyrotechnics - unsurprisingly amped up for the big finale, but there's an adherence to serial thriller conventions that is, well, rather warm and comforting.\r\n\r\nWith the Captain getting some surprising amount of emotional depth and humanity courtesy of the perfectly cast Chris Evans, the viewers have much to care about. Themes of Bondian world domination and global security crisis keep things nice and fanciful, while the unheralded work by the effects guys is modern cinematic art. There's some adherence to genre formula, and a bit of Marvel universe copy-catting going on, but this is one of the best films from the Marvel stable.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**About a rich Brazilian family.**\r\n\r\nIn my reviews quite a few times I have mention deja vu, because of encountering similar films. As for this, it was another Brazilian film that came after this, but I saw that one first. It was 'The Second Mother', the Brazilian entry for the 2016 Oscars. Quite similar in narration, particularly about how the Brazilian rich families function, but lots of sub-topics too were covered. It's like a mixed flavour, a slice of everything.\r\n\r\nStill, the film was fascinating. You know drama films are usually predictable, as well as unpredictable. For instance, a few events resembles to that of our life or that happened our surroundings. And sometimes for taking place in a different country, if you are not familiar with that culture, it becomes a reason to show our interest while we proceed watching it. Seems it was a coming-of-age theme, and it remains that way, but in between the gaps, like I said you will witness the variety.\r\n\r\nIf you had already seen the film that I mentioned earlier, you would feel you had already seen around ten per cent of this film. Like you only need a brief intro to understand the film characters and what follows does not need to get used to the atmosphere in the story. Its about another rich couple with two teenagers and their domestic workers. These characters are the centre of the story and focused each others' bondage, as well as the other side of the their lives like encountering their friends, business, society et cetera. It was a neatly folded film, except I felt the daughter remained a bit mystery.\r\n\r\n> \"No boss ever wins a labour lawsuit in this country.\"\r\n\r\nThe major part of the story was preferred to tell from the boy's perspective. Hailing from a rich family, he was given a very protected life from his father. But he decides to experience the reality of society and that gives him an opportunity to meet a girl. So there's a romance in it, but a small part. As he's a teenager, his sexual curiosity too was explored, but in a most possible decent way. Because if you see the film poster, it gives a different impression, just like the film 'Marina'.\r\n\r\nIn some parts, the film was slow, but considering it is more than a hundred minutes long, the overall pace was good to stay with it till the end. All the actors were excellent and the director did his job decently. But the surprising part was about the topic of racism. I always thought Brasil was one of the tolerant countries when it comes to ethnicity and social classes. Though nothing serious, everything was mostly verbal discussions that ended both ways after those involved expressed their views. Overall, it was a bit different, unlike what we see in American films. Mainly because it arose after an argument with another topic, 'quota', for the socially backward classes.\r\n\r\nI usually enjoy watching this kind of realistic portrayal. It's like witnessing a different culture and lifestyle, in a cinematic way. If you are a film fanatic like me, you will get the point. The structure of characters and plot, all looked fine. The writing must be appreciated, it will work for the majority of the viewers, but still not appealing enough for some sections of the audience. Otherwise the film would have been recognised equal to the other Brasil film I compared with. This is a 'go for it' film. Not just for entertainment, but to understand how life takes turns that's not yours. So I think it is worth a watch.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5887dd05c3a36859e6004631","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5887dd05c3a36859e6004631","movie_id":268100}

The same old, same old plot. Below par acting skills. The film particularly aimed for late 20s and early 30s people. The rest of the guys from different generation would find is unfunny.\r\n\r\nA young woman who recently lost her job, as well as broke up with her boyfriend, heads to her childhood summer camp to become a staff member where her two old friends already been serving. Time to recover from all the recent disaster stricken life, she's unable to cope and things take unusual turns to make events more complicated. The remaining story is to tell how she manages around.\r\n\r\nFor such a B movie, it is an acceptable. But beware of predictable storyline. The lines should have been very motivated, especially towards the end. There's no twist, if you already know it's coming and what it is. Too many adult jokes, otherwise the film would have attracted the youngsters, like teens and kids. Simply one time watchable film. Or you can find similar other great flicks out there.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"5a77102e0e0a26643004d45e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a77102e0e0a26643004d45e","movie_id":251227}
{"author":"Reno","content":"This is a well known story and I have also seen the '56 movie 'The Ten Commandments'. So in this film could not foresee the modification, but it did in a slight manner like the later 'Noah' movie. The best part was the visuals, the graphics were so good, hard to resist the pleasure if you are vfx geek like me. That's the reason I love modern movie, especially remake of a classic like 'King Kong'. The problem in this flick was lie in the story telling.\r\n\r\nAs we know, Ridley Scott is an excellent narrator, but this movie was too short even though it ran 150 minutes. I felt it was just a brief, I mean there were no details or depth in the important scenes. You will know what I'm saying if you had watched '56 movie I mentioned in a above paragraph. That's drawback for the first timers at a same time advantage for not to fall in boredom for those who have already seen other versions. Christian Bale, awesome; Joel Edgerton, good; Ben Kingsley, never required; Aaron Paul, totally waste.\r\n\r\nOverall, not cleverly stablised in the scenes that are very important, especially the final one about ten commandments should have been extended a little bit with a moral message. If it was a Peter Jackson movie, definitely it would have been a trilogy with an aggregated time of over 500 minutes. This movie was an entertainer like I enjoyed it than the message deliverer. Must be watched for the amusement and for the pleasure in updating technical aspect of the narration rather than inspiration.\r\n\r\n7.5\/10","id":"551ecc229251411d8d00109c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/551ecc229251411d8d00109c","movie_id":147441}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This movie was rather disappointing as far as I am concerned. The original story has been rewritten rather drastically. This in itself do not bother me too much. I am not one of those fanatics that get a fart stuck the wrong way if someone messes with the holy bible. However, I really do not think this was a good rewrite. A lot of the magical moments had been removed and that took away a lot from the story.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts off good enough with some nice and fairly impressive battles. Then it slows down a lot and sometimes I got a \u201cget on with it damn it\u201d feeling. When we finally got around to the burning bush part I got rather underwhelmed. God as a vengeful kid? Come on!\r\n\r\nThe disasters and the special effects are not too shabby but the entire bit where Moses confronted Ramses and warned him about the disasters that where to befall Egypt are taken out. They where just thrown on Egypt one after another in ways that could be explained away as natural disasters. From one point of view I can understand the wish to do this but to me it took something away from the movie.\r\n\r\nLater when Ramses decides to go after the Hebrews it continues in the same way with Ridley Scott downplaying the magic in the story. There is no pillar of fire and Moses is not holding out his staff to split the see. The sea just decided to recede and Moses takes advantage of it. Sure the effects when the water returns where quite cool but again, the magic was gone.\r\n\r\nTechnically the movie is quite well done and the acting is quite okay but the biblical grandeur and mythical aspects are no longer there. This grand adventure story is simply reduced to an ordinary, fairly mediocre adventure movie with a high budget. I have to say that I enjoyed Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s The Ten Commandments more even though the special effects in that one is hopelessly outdated and the acting is a bit awkward.","id":"55b47321c3a368210a0060cb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55b47321c3a368210a0060cb","movie_id":147441}

The unsteady cams are annoying but admittedly successful in disorienting the viewer.\r\n\r\nI like Bigfoot-oriented flicks, but some are so goofy or cheap that they made me lose interest. This one has elements featured in previous Bigfoot movies, like \u201cSasquatch\u201d (2002), aka \u201cThe Untold,\u201d and \u201cSasquatch Mountain\u201d (2006).

There are not many hacking film that could satisfy thoroughly. Well, I haven't found as impressive as the recent 'Who Am I'. This film was more like partially a found-footage type. Everything was from webcams and phone cams. Not exactly truthful to the reality. Even people with basic knowledge about computers would know that. But entertainment was there. I enjoyed it, mainly because of the speed and being an edgy.\r\n\r\nWell, a contest winner is waiting in his hotel room for his dinner date with a celebrity in the later night. While he was updating his blog, someone hacks his computer and gives more contents for the blog than he had thought of. But soon it all plays out differently.

How far it all goes and how it all ends are the remaining story to tell us.\r\n\r\nAs I said not the best in this theme, but watchable film. Everything was a one night event. Slowly started and then picked up the pace before ending on a high. The end was not good, the twist. At least that's how I felt. Should have been better, yet acceptable. Elijah was good. I just checked it out after seeing his nice act in his latest Netflix film. The rest of the cast was fine too. A Spanish film in English language. Soon I'm going to check out the 'Colossal' from this same director.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A simplest music-drama, a little inspiring over one's self-confidence.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'Texas Killing Field' comes a simple music-drama with a little romance in it. A plot that was built around when two people meet at a crossroad. One is looking forward breakthrough in the music career and the other one has been there. Besides a single mother fighting for a child custody as a subplot and other few extra characters were added for the movie to brighten up. That did not help to make the plot tighter and faster, instead left behind many unanswered. Anyway, most part of the narration stayed dry.\r\n\r\nLooking at the performances, location and the direction, it was not a bad movie. The story that progressed at a lazy pace is what I felt is the tumble. It should have been better, but still watchable film and not for everyone. It is another movie about the life's hardship. All about the personal life as well as the social life and finding a way to blend them together. Great cast, fine music and a decent ending. Overall, failed to impress, but worth a watch for being different and a slightly gripping due to the realistic approach.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd\/10","id":"56b37fc792514114d9002146","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56b37fc792514114d9002146","movie_id":289891}
{"author":"Asadullah Khan","content":"\"Man kind was born on earth, it was never meant to die here.\"\r\n\r\nIT has been two days since I watched it and I still can't get it out of my head. I can safely say that it has been a long LONG time since a movie had this much effect on me after watching it. And the only thing I can think of now is to somehow Re-Watch it again.\r\n\r\nThis movie was surprisingly different from Christopher Nolan's recent works because they had been great cinematic entertainment pieces catered to a wider audience with a blockbuster approach, this certainly didn't felt like that and hence the polarizing response it got. It is an ambitious project that is not meant to merely entertain, walk into it knowing that. I'll say this though, If it works for you, you'll be in heaven.\r\n\r\nThe premise of the movie is that Earth is no longer capable of supporting humans on it, we must find a new home to avoid extinction. This scenario is told from a very personal perspective and not from a Global scale like some sort of apocalyptic catastrophe disaster film. At the core of the movie is the Father-Daughter relationship. The movie takes its sweet time to develop it too.\r\n\r\nMathew McConaughey, not surprisingly, gives an amazing performance as the main lead. He really carries the film, some scenes were very emotional due to his great performance. The rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially the Daughter played by Meckenzie Foy. The One character that I never expected to be great was the robot TARS. He also acted as the source of the humor in the movie, well executed, timely and grounded.\r\n\r\nInterstellar tackles a lot of themes, Survival, Humankind, Love, Time etc, out of which 'Time' had the biggest impact on me. With relativity being a big part in the film, the whole sequence about it just struck me very deeply and I found new respect for Time. I'm actually at a loss of words to describe it. Also, there is a lot science in it so it can be confusing for many and in Nolan's tradition, it also has twists and mind numbing ending, where the more you think about it, the more numbing it gets.\r\n\r\nThe visuals of this movie are breathtaking. Great cinematography and CGI. The depiction of wormholes and blackholes and other space entities were the best I have ever seen. They just suck you into the movie. Along with that, you get to listen to one of Hans Zimmer's best scores. The score not only felt personal, going perfectly with the movie, but also different from his recent works. There were times where combination of epic photography and soundtrack made the scenes timeless, like I was completely sucked into it and didn't had a clue about my surroundings. I didn't want those scenes to end.\r\n\r\nAlas, the movie was not perfect. My biggest gripe with it is that the pacing and editing was off at times. Some scenes dragged on while others were cut far shorter. The beautiful views of space could have definitely benefited from a few seconds longer onscreen time. Also, I wished there was more space exploration in it.\r\n\r\nWith all the remakes, rehashes, reboots and sequels we are getting in these times, it is great to see original gems like these. This movie is definitely one of this year's best, one of Nolan's best work and one of the best movie I have seen in recent years.\r\n\r\n9.5\/10","id":"5807dc6dc3a3680f2d00319f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5807dc6dc3a3680f2d00319f","movie_id":157336}

Rage, rage against the dying of the light\".\r\n\r\nThe story is about a team of explorers undertakes the most important mission in human history; traveling beyond this galaxy to discover whether mankind has a future among the stars.\r\n\r\nChristopher Nolan once said that 2001: A Space Odyssey was his all time favorite film and how he wanted to do a small tribute to he's next film. And then comes a movie called \"Interstellar\" that will put a smile on Kubrick face if he was alive today, because Interstellar is one of the best movie of 2014 and the best movie experience I've had at the cinema.\r\n\r\nI saw this movie in IMAX and all through out this film I felt like I was in space floating around with Mconaughey and Anne Hathaway. I had that feeling that I was going deep into space just like are main character's, going deep into space just like the viewing auditions and me.\r\n\r\nThe visual effect's in this movie are some of the most stunning, beautiful and Jaw dropping effect's I've seen since 2001: A Space Odyssey.

It's new for Nolan because he always ends on a deep and cold note, but this movie didn't and I didn't mind it.\r\n\r\nMy only nick pick with the movie is some of the character's in this movie wasn't all that interesting. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are the only character's that to me were interesting and I cared for them, but the rest of the character's I didn't really care for.\r\n\r\nOverall Interstellar is a mind-blowing movie with fantastic visual's, interesting story line and the movie will keep you interested till the end.","id":"5e2f2a6898f1f1000ffd19cc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2f2a6898f1f1000ffd19cc","movie_id":157336}

Not because both the movies are about tornadoes, but takes place in a similar fashion where a group of twister\/storm analyzers\/chasers goes after their thing only to come out in a messed-up state. Forget the 'Twister', lets talk about this film. It had better effects, but that did not give the visuals like the natural occurrence, mostly they over-used it. I can call it a display for commercial purpose than reality, that's what Hollywood is famous for, isn't it?\r\n\r\nThe fun part was, the tornado(es) behaved like it had a soul and conscious like any living organism. 'Final Destination 5' was one of the best digital 3D movie at that time, when it comes to the awesome pop-ups and very disappointed with this film which was crafted by the same director.\r\n\r\nThe plus point was, it mildly entertains with a merely good pace of narration. Definitely it is not a category-A movie, if you want, you can say it because of the actors. The real reason is the performances from the cast was not noticeable. If one, one person had a strong hold up on his role the movie might had clinched its success. Due to CGI rule, actors are not getting a better scope for their characters. That's very sad, but true.

{"author":"Reno","content":"Well, one off from two of this year's most expected movies alongside 'The Battle of Five Armies'. Like all the Chris Nolan fans, I was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. But I slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3D film. I agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. All the credit must go to Nolan brothers. A good sign from Jonathan Nolan, who can make big in the entertainment industry in a future like his brother.\r\n\r\nAs we know many had liked 'Inception', to me that was a simple multi-layered action movie, that's all. But the same stuffs that used in this film makes sense. In fact, you have to have a little knowledge over how the universe works, so then it will be easy to catch the scene and situations while watching the movie. Totally like a documentary style concept, but with the additional stuffs like characters and its emotions add flavor that gives a movie look. An educational movie, though it also can work for those who wants just entertainment. Only the slow movie pace would test their patience.\r\n\r\nIt all begins like Shyamalan's 'Signs' movie with a family living surrounded by corn field. Then switches to 'The Astronaut Farmer' and going through 'Gravity', finally meets the 'Inception'. It was just a reference to call the movie setting that brings constant change for every half an hour. Like the opening scene and the end scene had over a 100 years difference.\r\n\r\nAs I earlier said it was the story of a family alongside the future of humankind and decoding universal mysteries through travelling in space and time. This movie would a reasonable for those who thought '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a boring piece, Cleverly written cinematic piece especially for science geeks. I don't know how perfect the movie to the actual present astrophysics, but will justify for the common people's capacity of understanding with an encourageable amount of commercial elements in it to entertain as well.\r\n\r\nThe first three quarters of the movie was well made. It puts me in a unblinkable position like a story was narrated by Brian Cox in a television series. Like I said, lots of astrophysics involved in it, but strangely human emotions were also exhibited equally that I never expected one from Nolan film. It was not an ordinary sentiment, but was strong enough to make a man cry for happy and sad situations in the movie. I liked science and emotion coming together. In fact, it saved the movie, otherwise it would have been a science documentary straight from NASA production through Nolan direction.\r\n\r\nThere are many surprise elements in the movie and of course there is a twist at the end. We can call it a series of twists like the layers. Compared to last quarter of the movie to the rest, it completely detaches which opens broadly to the different directions. And that happens so fast rushing towards the other end. Which give an impression of the movie 'Inception'. In a perfect way to say the first 75% was 'The Tree of Life' and the remains are 'Inception'.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u2018This world's a treasure,\r\nbut it's been telling us to leave for a while now.\u2019\u2019\r\n\r\nAll the actors were so good. Matthew McConaughey steals the show as he dominates the majority of the screen space in the story presentation. There's no ruling out the fine performance executions from Anne Hathaway and the young star from the Twilight movie, Mackenzie Foy. The remaining cast was having less scope which were like the guest appearances that was widened a little broader, but was perfectly fitted for the story. Especially Matt Damon's was the crucial one.\r\n\r\nRemember the movie 'Contact', a lovely movie, which was ruined by its fictional ending. Something like that happened in this film as well. The story was initiated with a realistic approach with actual scientific contents as per the present understanding about the universe. But the end was let me down with the layered contents that kind of impossible to agree with it. As a cinematic theme it worked, yeah, a good solution for this wonderfully written story. We know that the time can't run backwards, so that's the trouble.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this movie defines in a new way, I mean scientifically the existence of ghost. It was not a horror movie, but I liked supernatural force that merged with this science fiction theme. That explains and gives vast ideas to expand our physics beyond something and somewhere yet to reach. Hats off to the director, because he was not thinking of making money here. His idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. And he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions. In my opinion, this will replace '2001: A Space Odyssey' for sometime till another one make this way.\r\n\r\nI could have not asked a better space travel drama than this, especially when I heard Nolan doing a science-fiction I believed he gonna rock it. He was so true to the science and the human feelings in this film. If you had seen enough movies before like this one, you can recall your memories like the Tom Hanks parts from 'Cloud Atlas'. But still independently stands strong and falls in a never seen before category.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u2018Maybe we've spent too long\r\ntrying to figure all this out with theory.\u2019\u2019\r\n\r\nThe end scene leaves a hint of a possible sequel. I would be happy if that happen in a near future, but definitely that would be a completely different cinema as per how this one ended. I know his fans want that to happen and so am I.\r\n\r\nThe visuals were not that great, but simply very good. To see those in digital 3D would have given us a different experience, sadly Nolan was not in favor of that technology. Hoping this movie would get as many as the Oscars nod. Especially not getting into the best motion picture shortlist would be a shame. Like I said I'm no one fan, I just love watching everyone's every movie. I would have went to see it again if it was converted into digital 3D, since I'm modern tech geek when it comes to the films.\r\n\r\nIt will become a talk of the week, perhaps month all over the world, so don't leave behind when your friends talk about it. What I gonna say is it is a must see asap if you are a movie fanatic like me otherwise Nolan movies does not need anyone's recommendation because his movies usually sell itself like the hot samosa.","id":"5463856c0e0a267815002598","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5463856c0e0a267815002598","movie_id":157336}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The wife's trying to track down her missing husband!**\r\n\r\nEver since I saw 'Haywire', I thought Gina Carano would be the next action queen of Hollywood. But very disappointed for her using in small and negative roles. I have been waiting for this film, but could not see it at that time and now I saw it anyway. She was amazing, born to do stunt films and this film I think specially created for her. You can call it a mini 'Taken', though an entertaining film. The plot does not make any sense, but it works as a thriller.\r\n\r\nSo this is the story of a young woman who grew up with her tough father, who also taught how to defend herself against any kind of threat. A few years later she marries a wealthy man and while honeymooning on a Caribbean island, her husband goes missing after an accident. Now all her focus is to find him and with her skills, she faces the bad guys of the island. How far she goes fighting is what covered in the remaining.\r\n\r\nNot the best film from the director of 'Into the Blue', it would work for some people who seek timepass. But I liked it only for Gina Carano and I hope she does more flicks like this. I know some scenes and plots should have been better, like the final chasing scene had too many faults. In the end, I don't think so it was a big deal since in the kind of setting it takes place. I hope you simply enjoy it rather thinking of its flaws during your watch.\r\n\r\n_6.5\/10_","id":"585e9ed8c3a3681a6500e51e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/585e9ed8c3a3681a6500e51e","movie_id":256474}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"That this movie, at the time of writing this, holds an 8.8 rating at IMDb is simply beyond my understanding. Needless to say I did not really like this movie. The story is not very good, the science is ludicrous and the visuals not all that impressive. Maybe the latter would be better in a big theater (I watched this on my home cinema system which has a relatively large screen by European standards) but I am not really sure about that either.\r\n\r\nBe warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of with the usual \u201cI told you so\u201d wet dream of the green fanatics on a dying Earth so it is off to a depressing start right away. That is an overused concept today as far as I am concerned. Then they pour it on with a school official claiming that he Apollo missions and moon landings never happened. What the f\u2026? If they wanted to depress the audience right from the start they succeeded, at least with this audience.\r\n\r\nThe story proceeds with our heroes finding these gravity waves in the sand and by a huge stretch of imagination decrypts them to mean coordinates which leads them to the secret NASA base. Once there Cooper is told that he is their best choice of pilot for a \u201csave the human race\u201d mission through a wormhole. Yeah, right! This guy was former NASA. His whereabouts could hardly been unknown to them. If he was their best choice why would they entrust a mission to save the human race to someone else until he stumbled onto their door? Typical Hollywood nonsense!\r\n\r\nThe movie is full of this kind of rubbish. Romilly wastes 23 years of his life doing pretty much nothing except deciding not to go into the sleep capsule. The supposedly highly trained and vetted professor that they do find turns out to be a psychopath as well as and idiot almost blowing up the ship when trying to proceed with a docking that all the systems tells him have not succeeded. Then they proceed to dock with the main ship and stop its spin as well as bring it out of orbit around a planet with the shuttles engines. That is one hell of a powerful shuttle not to mention the strength of the docking mechanism! This just goes on. When someone is not doing something illogical or stupid (or both) they sit around talking, philosophizing and dragging the movie forward at snails pace. 169 minutes is way too much for this movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie ends up in one big time travel mess (okay they do not travel in time, just sends messages through time but still\u2026) during a bunch of psychedelic scenes while traveling through the back hole. Science? Not so much. And what about this totally ludicrous massively illogical and inefficient robot design?\r\n\r\nThe one good thing I can say about this movie is that the performance of most of the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey, are quite good. For the rest, not my cup of tea.","id":"5a3beb430e0a264cbc23212a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a3beb430e0a264cbc23212a","movie_id":157336}
{"author":"sybddlatfu","content":"This might contain spoilers!\r\n---\r\nInterstellar is my favorite movie. I'm really into space and everything about it, so this movie was my cup of tea. \r\nThe soundtrack is the best of the movie. It points out flow of time, which is the most discussed issue in the movie. Special effects are breathtaking. Even with some small mistakes, it is pretty accurate and expectable. There is some visually pleasing cinematography too, including Saturn, the curvature of spacetime or majestic black hole, which is really satisfying. Some scenes are loud and thrilling, but some moments are so quiet, that you actually think, you are in space!\r\nThe movie is long but gripping. The plot, although it's complicated, is told easily and understandably. But the end of the movie is difficult to understand, since it contains time loop and time travel at the same time, but if you listen carefully, you will get it.

{"author":"Andres Gomez","content":"Another grandiloquent movie from Christoper Nolan.\r\n\r\nThe cast is good, and McConaughey performs a role made for himself. The photography is very nice but the movie commits all the same mistakes than previous Nolan's movies. I think mistakes but it may be that they are the points Nolan fans enjoy the most ...\r\n\r\n* The story makes you believe it is a realy deeply thought plot but, in the end, it has so basic mistakes and stupidities that make it nonsensical.\r\n* There is a general ambience of every moment being epic; deep, solemn and smart dialogues but, at some point our highly trained engineer and pilot behaves really stupidly.\r\n* To keep the mentioned constant feeling of being in an epic moment, Nolan uses a thumping and insistent soundtrack. As it is not a moment, but a 3h movie, it is really tiresome.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the movie is OK but you can only think this is a great movie if you are a real Nolan fan.","id":"5634aee792514129fe009d2c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5634aee792514129fe009d2c","movie_id":157336}
{"author":"decovision","content":"People seem to think that if you enjoy a Christopher Nolan movie, you are a fanboy and the film couldn't really be that good. That is not true. He has never made a bad movie, Insomnia is probably his worst and it is still an excellent movie. \r\nInterstellar is up there in his top 3, with The Dark Knight being number 1 and Inception in number 2. I don't think he will ever make a better movie than The Dark Knight, it is without a doubt a masterpiece of cinema in my opinion. It can be enjoyed on so many levels.\r\nI remember seeing Interstellar in the movie theater and being on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was breathtaking but the end left me confused so i walked out disappointed. \r\nSince then i have watched it many times but it only took a second viewing to realize what a great ending it is and here is why. How many people discuss the end, was the wormhole open or closed for him to make it to Brand, what happens next, is there a sequel. I discuss this with people who hate the movie and the debate will still last a good 30 minutes if not more without getting heated. It is a wonderful story told through the eyes of a genius film maker who deserves more than he receives, an oscar would be nice start.\r\nI read hat his next movie is to be released in July 2017, I can't wait to find out everything about it like i have since he began.\r\nIf you're unsure about Christopher Nolan, watch his career from the beginning starting with Doodlebug.","id":"55f43b7dc3a3686d03003292","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55f43b7dc3a3686d03003292","movie_id":157336}

{"author":"shaunfrombklyn","content":"This was my most anticipated film of 2014, and I was not disappointed. \r\n\r\nThe story was slightly difficult to follow on the first watch, but that was to be expected in a film dealing with complicated fields such as astrophysics and time dilation. Many didn't find its overall message - that love is the most powerful force in the universe which transcends space and time - to be very appealing, but I thought it was an interesting take on special relativity and how two people can be bound by a common feeling, even when they're in different parts of the universe at different times. I also thought the acting was believable, for the most part, and I didn't think anyone was miscast. I enjoyed the surprise appearance from a certain famous actor about halfway through.\r\n\r\nBut what really blew me away were the visuals and the soundtrack. I believe it was Quentin Tarantino who once said movies and music go hand in hand; that a moving image complimented by the right piece of music can create art. Well, the visuals in this film, which took my breath away, and the score, which perfectly captured the 'feel' of the cosmos and all its wonder, proved him right. I think this was Hans Zimmer's best work yet, and although I'm not Christopher Nolan's biggest fan, I will continue to follow his work if he can pull off more movies like this. \r\n\r\nMy only regret was not seeing this film in IMAX.\r\n\r\n10\/10","id":"58a46707c3a3686cc200458c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58a46707c3a3686cc200458c","movie_id":157336}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Often, what might have felt good in a smaller dose might not taste that well when taken as a whole. And that is the case with VTV Ganesh. He was mildly amusing (mostly due to his sandpapery voice) in Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa as Simbu's friend; he was grating in Naveena Saraswathi Sabatham, in which he had an extended role. And, now, in this film, in which he plays the lead, he is nothing short of an excruciating presence.\r\n\r\nHe plays Ganesh, a good man who fails to make the right choices. He is en route to Chennai after getting the news that his wife has met with an accident (she has actually tried committing suicide) and as he journeys by car, he narrates the misfortunes of his life to the driver, who might not be what he seems. And, so, we get to see Ganesh getting dismissed from his job (twice) for being earnest, getting dumped by a married woman with whom he has fallen in love, marrying the woman who actually expressed her love to his friend, and finally, blowing up his wife's money with his get-rich-quick schemes (film producing, betting).\r\n\r\nThis is the stuff of V Sekar's films in the 90s and some of those (like Varavu Ettana Selavu Paththana) were reasonably entertaining despite the didactic filmmaking; even Karunas managed a couple of crudely-made but engaging films with similar material. But, this film doesn't really have a clue on what it wants to be \u2014 a full-on drama, an existential comedy, or even a dramedy (the script is written by Ganesh himself). The performances are so uninvolving (Simbu and Santhanam, who have extended cameos sleepwalk through their roles) all around that none of the characters make us care. Meera Jasmine's character is just one example. We have to feel sorry at her plight; instead, we are only baffled by her character's decisions. She is (probably) a team leader at a corporate but the way she behaves is so archaic. She expresses her love to Ganesh's friend Simbu, who is already in a relationship. When she comes to know of this, she immediately forces Ganesh to marry her by what is clearly an intimidating tactic (she goes to the cops)! Her reasoning is that he once saved her from a misbehaving driver and so is a gem of a person! And, even when she realizes that her husband is using her hard-earned money for his foolhardy schemes, she just goes along with his plans and in the end, tries to commit suicide than breaking away from an awful relationship. In the end, we only end up feeling bad for Meera Jasmine the actress whose once-promising career has come to such a wretched state.","id":"53bb17c30e0a26196b000295","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bb17c30e0a26196b000295","movie_id":251639}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> About a father and his two little girls who has been there was each other.\r\n\r\nBased on the real life events of the director's childhood and it is her first directional film as well. Mark Ruffalo and Zoe Saldana as her onscreen father and mother respectively, while her character as a 12 year old girl was played by her own daughter. I think it was a great team, the mother is the director, the daughter performing under her, the father producing it and it is their story.\r\n\r\nI was worried that this film's going to emotionally hurt me as I'm an easy target to strike with a theme like this as what the synopsis says and the trailer revealed. But I was prepared for that, I wanted to have a tearjerker flick and in the end, I had a great time with it as the fulfillment was way beyond than what I was expected.\r\n\r\nIt was the story of a small family, a father and a mother and their two little girls that set in the 1978 Bostan city. Because of the condition of the father, the struggling family whose children are growing up needs a financial support for their better education and care. So the mother decides to sacrifice a few years of hers to go back to college to graduate and get a job. Now its between the father and the girls, how they spend those years together, which will be their worst nightmare as well as the best years of their lives.\r\n\r\n> \"We'll be braver, Daddy.\r\n> Next time, I promise we'll be braver.\"\r\n\r\nIt really scared me a few times, because of the temperament of the father character, kids playing with a machete and so on. A wonderful family flick, but only for the adult members. Because of the too much cigarette smoking, I mean Mark Ruffalo smoked almost all in his screen presence and obviously the excessive usage of the foul language is the other reason.\r\n\r\nSo it is an R rated flick, but it was so perfect, the 70s atmosphere was spot on. Except the only bothering thing was the children never grew physically, while the cars, clothing style, society, cameras, the timeline has kept changing. But it did not leap extremely forward like a decade or something. That was not a big issue, while the film and its story telling kept the rhythm always on the high. Yep, there's no dull moments, whenever it began to sink under the emotion, repelled back with the same force which is why I hooked all the way. By the way I thought those innocent family sentiments were strongly appealing in a cute manner.\r\n\r\nNow we talk about the roles. Mark Ruffalo definitely deserves an Oscars nomination. But I can't declare the award for him as I have to find out how the other actors performed in their films. This is his best film in a lead I have seen, probably his career best. To me it is this year's version of the last year's JK Simmons performance for the movie 'Whiplash'.\r\n\r\n> \"Our dad is totally polar bear.\"\r\n\r\nThe other side, Zoe Saldana was as usual in a charming and polite character. As I know she never disappoints her fans. Ruffalo and Saldana are one of the best on screen pair, looked so real, like a real couple. The two little girls were also awesome in their debuting film. The entire movie's focus was these four members, very occasionally outside characters come into play with hardly any lines to deliver. I wondered what is the meaning of the title and if your focus is on, you won't miss the explanation, which was so cute.\r\n\r\nAn amazing fusion between the incredible narration and the background score. The tracks (some of them are not OST) as well very good that played till the credits rolled out. I liked 'The Pirate Song' that was written by the director and 'Oogum Boogum' was funny. Many of them I heard for the first time and thinking to grab them for my movie song collection. Overall, it will surely transform your mood by the end of the movie, I mean in a good way.\r\n\r\nInspiring, yes the film inspires to have our own little family with kids. Especially a perspective of a father and his great responsibility was portrayed tremendously. And also the girls who saved their father from being lost. They stayed for each other and stayed that way as how a parent and his children should be as an example, but in a little harsh human nature.\r\n\r\nIt is a rare gem, undoubtedly completely enjoyable. This was one of those that came silently into the productions. The earlier posters were unimpressive and made me stay away, but later, now it turned out one of my favourite flick from the 2015. Obviously movie fanatics loved this heartwarming family drama and I highly recommend it. As usual like I always say, whether you like it or not, but don't miss it.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"567c35039251417dec003c39","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/567c35039251417dec003c39","movie_id":244539}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Inam begins with that oft-heard Tamil saying, 'Yaadhum oore yaavarum kelir' and goes on to narrate the story of Rajini ( Sugandha Ram, conveying vulnerability and fear very well), a Sri Lankan Tamil girl, who, we understand, is seeking refuge in India. If the recent Ravana Desam presented the plight of the people on the sea when they try to crossover to India, Inam gives us a peek into their ordeal before their board the boats.\r\n\r\nThough there is a narrative arc, Rajini's story is presented as compilation of moments from her live. We are introduced to the characters in her life \u2014 Tsunami Akka ( Saritha), who has lost her daughter to the war and has now built a family of sorts around her with orphaned kids and teenagers, Stanley Master ( Karunas), a school teacher who yearns to reach the safe shores of another nation, his wife Stella, Ravi ( Shyam Sundar), an angry youngster on whom Rajini has a crush, and a host of youngsters. Into this motley group enters Nandan ( Star Karan), a special child, who wants to find his fighter brother.\r\n\r\nIn the first half, we get to see how these characters try to lead as normal a life as possible. We see them bonding together, teasing each other, learning together, and even falling in love. However, it is the final stage of war and the battle soon reaches their shores. Even as they try to stay alive, they get scattered or worse die. Rajini, who is wedded to Nandan, flees with one of her friends and her pre-teen husband, but end up in the hands of the Sri Lankan forces.\r\n\r\nComing on the heels of the UN's decision to investigate war crimes in Sri Lanka, Inam is very much topical and mostly presents a neutral perspective on the last phase of the brutal civil war. It wants to show how war can tear apart the moral fibre of humans, and how it affects even those who aren't involved in the fighting. It also tries to show how a pacifist will also become aggressive when pushed to his limits. In one scene, we see Stanley taking on a group of Sri Lankan soldiers who, in the name of searching, feel the women up. He requests, pleads and begs them but when there is no acknowledgement, he stands up to them as he realizes that he has nothing to lose except life and honour. A helpless Rajini is raped but when she gets her chance, she kills the soldier who is forcing himself upon her. Meanwhile, a Lankan soldier bemoans the fact that the war has turned his countrymen into animals, but he will not turn into one.\r\n\r\nBeing a cinematographer, Sivan often resorts to imagery to convey his message. A lengthy shot is seen through a plastic cover holding fishes, half of which are dead, symbolizing the fate of the Tamils in the country. Gods of various religions lie disfigured after a bombing. The most impressionable one is when Rajini pricks her thumb and presses it onto a paper, and we see a thumb impression signifying the bleeding island nation.\r\n\r\nBut the film isn't entirely a sombre affair. There are a few touches of whimsy like a character who has been sitting in one place after accidentally stepping on a landmine, a bedridden one who likes see pictures of women in their swimwear. A chicken that turns into a stew. A kind-of first night between two pairs of teens. A baila song on dosa. But it is Karan who is the source of many of the lighter moments here. An actual Down's syndrome child, he makes Nandan a character to root for with his innocence.\r\n\r\nYet, somehow, Inam stops short of being a hard-hitting film. It is very reluctant to spell things out, which, while understandable, given the protests the film has invited from pro-Tamil groups in the state, makes everything a little hazy, as the context isn't firmly established. Some of the bombing and battle scenes look too similar and there are times when we can see Sivan leaning a little too much on his visuals to create the desired impact.","id":"53bab0ed0e0a2676bb00bc73","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bab0ed0e0a2676bb00bc73","movie_id":260770}
{"author":"mattwilde123","content":"'Inherent Vice' is the next feature film from Paul Thomas Anderson and you can tell. It boasts a great soundtrack, brilliant acting and a very convoluted story as it tells the story of a private detective (Phoenix) as he investigates into the disappearance of a former girlfriend.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is very confusing. It is hard to follow and purposely so as it introduces many characters and multiple stories but I have heard that this aspect of the screenplay is very true to the original source material.

{"author":"Reno","content":"Legends are created to inspire, scare, obey and for entertainment. Sometimes for some people, it's a great opportunity to utilise the concept to do illegal things. Whatever this movie is about you must observe carefully and try to apply these theories. You will get the story, but enjoying watching it is up to what you were expecting and what it delivered. If you had seen numerous similar horror-thriller, then you feel awful.\r\n\r\nBelgian horror-thriller, well, that's what they say, but I doubt it. It sets in the summer scout camp, which is directed by a newcomer. A thirteen member of the scout team heads to the woods to set a camp. But it was about a 12 year old Sam, who is a cub scout. He's a first choice of pick to bully by his fellow scouts, especially by the den leader as well by one particular pack leader. He's always late, weak and his over imagination makes him a weirdo in the herd. During in the camp, he discovers what was said to be a legend is real. Not bothers to convince others since they never going to believe him. His adventure is to go deep and discover the secrets, but all the above finds the right place for his essence.\r\n\r\n> \"Kai does exist.\r\n> He lives in a tree house in the woods.\"\r\n\r\nThe 'Marina' girl was in a prominent role. In this 80 minute movie every role was a prominent one. There was no time to develop character, but simply a straight forward presentation. Began with the spilling werewolf concept and it did not hold longer the suspense. Once you know it's not a horror, but a thriller you would lose the interest. Follows the cliche, the same old killings without the reasons or proper explanation. Well, at that time of the story that how it looked, but sooner or later you will know the truth. It's not only the camp versus the whoever hunting\/haunting them. It's about the basic instinct, the first reaction to the situations. There is no surprise on the pack leaders, their's behavior is not just based on the fiction, merely true in reality.\r\n\r\nTraps were the best parts compared to the killings, but too short to have pleasure. Initially I expected it to be a children's horror movie since they are involved, but there are some contents that do restrict them from watching it. Commercial recognise is very important for filmmakers, so they didn't fear to bring the cliche on. I still feel the end should have been a little creative and a fresh idea could have served it well. Not only the end you are going to predict, well, almost everything before from happening.\r\n\r\nKeeping mystery is the key factor for a movie if the director and writer want to surprise the viewers. Does that 'hold-back' is good enough to satisfy the audience during the twist is the question. First half of the movie nicely keeps the suspense, all about the next half where smartness lacks. Actually, there is no twist at all, the story itself reveals from beginning till the end. All we have to do is figure it out ourselves what this battle is about, other than good versus bad. I'm itching to say it, but it'll spoil if you have not seen the movie yet, so I let you find yourself.\r\n\r\nAs the Belgians perspective the film is okay kind, but not to the rest of the world. Overall an average movie compared to the international standards, but the production quality is impressive. A nice concept, set off very well, but the blow is maybe the influence of Hollywood in today's world cinemas, especially in this genre that did not help to finish it off ably. The days gone by this movie will be forgotten, but I believe in this filmmaker who has a good knack for this type of films will definitely come up with another brilliant product in a near future.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"5540f8c0c3a3681d9c001cab","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5540f8c0c3a3681d9c001cab","movie_id":284270}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"\"There are as many forms of love as there are moments in time,\" wrote Jane Austen about the most colourful of our feelings and in Cuckoo, we see love budding between characters for whom the very concept of colours is alien. For, both Tamizh and Suthanthirakodi (aka Kodi), the romantic interests in the film, are visually challenged. The film is based on a real-life couple whom the director interviewed for a magazine article. The director actually inserts himself into the film as a character, a narrator to the audience and an enabler to the lead pair.\r\n\r\nWhat is refreshing about the film is that it treats the disability of the lead characters in a matter-of-fact way and seldom resorts to manipulation. Tamizh, Kodi and their circle of disabled friends are as human as the rest of us and we never see them wallow in self pity. The romantic track between Tamizh and Kodi actually includes elements that we have seen in our movies earlier \u2014 the initial hate gradually turning into love, peer pressure, familial disapproval and even a whiff of the 'paakamaley kadhal' sub genre (in the final segment) \u2014 but what makes the film feel unique is the setting and the array of interesting supporting characters that the director has created. There is the wisecracking Ilango, Tamizh's friend who is also visually challenged, Murugesan, an admirer of Tamizh's singing (he is a singer in a music and dance troupe with oddball characters), the much-married owner of the troupe Kuberan Chandrababu, the MGR, Vijay and Ajith look-alikes, Kodi's friend Sangeetha, her reader Vinod (who she initially wants to marry), a cop who is humane enough to take pity on Tamizh but is human enough to take a part of his cash, a political underling who isn't above asking for money to get a job placement but will lash out at any disrespect to women and so on.\r\n\r\nA significant portion of the film takes place in something as recognizable as railway platforms (PK Varma's backlit frames makes these places seem so beautiful) but we get to see the lives of people whom we normally, like the character of an elderly office-goer in the film, turn a, umm, blind eye to in real life. We also get a feel of the world of the visually challenged. We see how they learn and read, how close knit they are, and even how they 'see' the world differently; Tamizh is sensitive to sounds while Kodi seems to identify things more with smell \u2014 he identifies her approach with the sound of her footsteps while she gives him a perfume so that she can make him out at once.\r\n\r\nThe film turns somewhat melodramatic with the track involving Kodi's brother, Sekar. He is a security guard with a pregnant wife and tries to exploit his sister's disability. He wants to get a government job for her as a teacher, only because that will mean more money. And, to do so, he is willing to get her married off to Jilaki, his friend and an auto driver, who doesn't seem to be a nice person at all.\r\n\r\nThe film would have benefitted if it had gone through another round or two of editing at the scripting stage. Murugan, a one-time journalist, wants to present the story as true as possible and in his quest, he doesn't exercise his rights to take creative liberties in telling this story as a director as much as he should have done. This turns the film into a somewhat indulgent effort and given that many of the story's arcs are familiar, we, at times, feel restless when the film takes its own sweet time to move on to the next scene. And, in the climatic portions, Dinesh, who is superbly natural as Tamizh, is made to go melodramatic (starting with Tamizh getting picked up by cops), and this change of tone makes the final half an hour of the movie feel cinematic.","id":"53bab2130e0a263588002b82","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bab2130e0a263588002b82","movie_id":260619}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The coldest place in the country feeling heat of murders!**\r\n\r\nIt's not about Wall Street or the financial related related film. The title is where this story sets in, a small town in the United States. This is a thriller about a young man Dwayne, who captured the murder of a mailman while making a video with his girlfriend. Following the event a series of murders takes place. When he comes to know the killer is after him, it's time to reveal us why it's all happening. Meanwhile the sheriff intensifies his investigation considering for the first time such thing happening on his watch in the town.\r\n\r\nReally a good theme, but some silly plots or the reason behind events makes us to feel this is a stupid film. I mean people can do anything for the silly reasons, but the film did not convince on that. Though the locations were good and so the actors. Hemsworth, Malkovich, Dern, Palmer, particularly Stuhlbarg was very good. The narration had no point of view, it was told from every character. It was directed by some television filmmaker, should have been better, but not bad for a view. This is a hit and miss thriller, I hope you watch it for a simple entertainment than anticipating too much out of it.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"5851a53f925141483a00574d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5851a53f925141483a00574d","movie_id":276902}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The game is on, on the salsa floor.**\r\n\r\nI had no idea about this film. Just saw its poster and it reminded me 'This Means War'. Sort of like that, but it's not about the spies, instead it was about salsa. An average guy who gave up salsa during his childhood, once again sparked to take it up seriously after finding crush on his new boss who loves salsa. But he's not alone, his colleague who's a bully is on to her and thwarts all his attempts not to get near to her. Now he has to prove, not just to win the love, but his last passion for salsa.\r\n\r\nTotally a surprising film. It was not utterly a romance theme, but a music, about salsa. The romance was a small part of it. It was somewhat fun, but I find it a bit dramatic about redefining the passion that was given up a log back. And if you love salsa, you might enjoy it. But it was not like those dance flicks from Hollywood. All the important segments of the story come in the second half. Especially the final act was much better, to end on a high. A film to watch once, just for fun.\r\n\r\n_6.5\/10_","id":"587a9ae49251413ecb00740a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/587a9ae49251413ecb00740a","movie_id":201086}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"The disturbing and mind-bending \u2018Creep\u2019 certainly startles with its sense of sophisticated salaciousness, so why should it not meet the expectations of its haunting and hallucinatory hedonism? After all \u2018Creep\u2019 was from the handlers that gave fright fans unnerving and twitchy thrills in fear-monger flicks such as \u2018Paranormal Activity\u2019 and \u2018The Purge\u2019. Granted that the found footage genre has become rather obligatory but there are moments when one can declare a sense of distinction and devilish freshness where frightfests in the realm of \u2018Creep\u2019 can compel with warped and contemptible glee. When a flinching film can muster up an erratic combination of chaos and comedy and still manage to stay on course in its horrific havoc then vehicles such as \u2018Creep\u2019 can claim bragging rights in the slight re-invention of the aforementioned and omnipresent found footage theme.\r\n\r\nPart of \u2018Creep\u2019s unctuous appeal is steeped in the wicked and wayward imaginations of collaborators in director\/co-writer Patrick \u2018The Overnight\u2019 Brice (making his directorial feature debut here), co-writer\/co-star Mark Duplass and producer Jason Blum (\u2018Paranormal Activity\u2019, \u2018Insidious\u2019, \u2018Sinister\u2019). These morbid masterminds effectively instill the aptly-named \u2018Creep\u2019 with bountiful black humour in this glorified goose-bump fable that proudly struts its low-budgeted, atmospheric indie chops armed with outrageous dares and scares.\r\n\r\nUnemployed videographer Aaron (Patrick Brice) unknowingly fishes out the on-coming scrutiny when he answers a Craigslist ad requesting the secretive side of film-making. Thus, Aaron travels to an isolated cabin in the middle of the desolate mountains to meet up with Josef (Mark Duplass, from TV\u2019s \u2018The League\u2019). The sickly Josef, proclaiming his supposedly cancer-stricken condition, wants to be filmed on video as he prepares a diary for his unborn son. Well, the gesture seems heartfelt enough under the surface and something that Aaron should handle with kid gloves, right?\r\n\r\nAaron\u2019s assignment at first appears innocuous as he gathers the insights and intimate moments that Josef provides for the sake of his future offspring. In fact, the two men even become somewhat close and bond together as they wander in the mountains mixing business with a bit of pleasure tossed in for good measure. Soon, Josef steadily starts to show his true colors as his interviews become intense and erratic. The darkness of Josef\u2019s moods shift ominously back and forth. Hence, Aaron understandably becomes quite weary of his videotaped creepy companion\u2019s behavior. It certainly does not help that Aaron unravels some sordid secrets regarding Josef\u2019s unsettling backstory. Just where does Josef\u2019s degree of delusions figure in as far as Aaron\u2019s perspective is concerned?\r\n\r\nThe shocking moments in \u2018Creep\u2019 serves its purpose effectively, especially when the cat-and-mouse titillation and tension is enveloped in a low-budget, knee-jerking production that thankfully is refreshingly taut as it is naughtily off-kilter in its serving of several jittery jump scares and, of course, the edginess of the two men, one armed with suspicion and paranoia and the other one bottled up in a hefty grip of psychosis. The constant antagonism that the creepy Josef demonstrates towards Aaron is a traumatising tease that eerily registers with numbing realization. Fittingly, the found footage fear factor angle does not overtake or drown out the psychological give-and-take anxiety between the defensive Aaron and demented Josef.\r\n\r\nIf anything, \u2018Creep\u2019 manages to not exhaust the found footage foundation as a gory gimmick that many of these kinds of fright flicks fall victim much too often. Instead, the movie is shrewdly aware to take a smirking poke at the impish concept through shaky satirical means. The real trepidation lies in the sometimes quiet yet manic motives of Josef, a live wire that can explode at any minute yet leaves one wondering as to when and where his menacing madness will filter out as it is directed toward his nearby guinea pig in the vulnerable Aaron. Both Brice and Duplass are convincingly engrossing as contributing co-writers and co-stars of an edge-of-your-seat chiller that does not necessarily need to overwhelm the audience\u2019s nervous system with grotesque tactics of torture to bring along the bloody chase of a detached thrill.\r\n\r\nCreep (2015)\r\n\r\nThe Orchard\r\n\r\n1 hr. 20 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Mark Duplass and Patrick Brice\r\n\r\nDirected by: Patrick Brice\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror and Suspense\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s Rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)","id":"561a116892514111c3001b17","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/561a116892514111c3001b17","movie_id":250574}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is very much my kind of movie. Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire plot is driven by John Wick\u2019s very emotional response to his wife\u2019s death and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from her. What I mean with \u201cno emotional nonsense\u201d is that John Wick is never second guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an \u201cordinary\u201d guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn\u2019t go into some silly \u201coh should I really pull the trigger\u201d trance and drops the gun in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys\u2026eventually that is.\r\n\r\nThe plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However, such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than a few glimpses into John Wick\u2019s former life and it is a quite cool background that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond movie.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the action. It is an action movie so you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint. There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness and grace that just makes it \u2026 so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really well woven together.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really like with this movie is that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or \u201cobligatory\u201d scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is \u201cthe bad guys will pay\u201d all the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly pissed off.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday.","id":"558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/558ba0dcc3a3687e68002721","movie_id":245891}
{"author":"Sheldon Nylander","content":"It's cheesy, formulaic, and hammily acted. It's also stylish, high energy, and generally just a fun popcorn movie.\r\n\r\n\"John Wick\" is a retired hitman who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack (no spoilers here, but if you're squeamish about animal cruelty, be warned). Okay, we've heard this story dozens of times.\r\n\r\nWhat's different is the world in which this takes place. There's a secret criminal underground that seems to have their hands in everything, and there's a specific code and honor among thieves. Actually, come to think of it, we never really meet anyone who isn't involved or in the know somehow, so it's implied that this society is very widespread and possibly runs everything. This film actually seems to have more in common with the \"Wanted\" comic book than the \"Wanted\" movie did.\r\n\r\nPart of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick is that he isn't a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo, he's not invincible. He's simply very well trained and determined, which makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know the outcome, there's always this little part in the back of your mind that wonders if he'll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic. Let's be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn't have much practical value in the real world.\r\n\r\nGiven the implications for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane's Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as \"Jonathan\" even though the name is John; different spelling means it isn't a shortened version of his name) to Lance Reddick's hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there's a lot of ground to explore. It's not a smart or challenging film, but it is fun and not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies.","id":"5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d86ad6f172d7f000d47943a","movie_id":245891}

Once the set-up has been staged - Wick grieves at the loss of his loved one - gets some small joy via a pet - only to have that snatched away from him, then the film becomes a joyously unstoppable actioner.\r\n\r\nWick, in good hands with a moody and beefy Reeves (face fuzz strange, though) strong in presence, cuts a swathe through the gangland eastern blockers. And that's pretty much it! Characterisations are thin on the ground, it's a bit nutty and of course preposterous, but boy is it fun. There you go, a box office winning actioner without pretensions.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Something a very unique achievement to video document!\r\n\r\nThis is nothing like anything I have ever seen before. Quite an interesting film, but not for everyone. Yep, I thought it was boring in the opening, but later I get used to it and began to analyse. A film that has only a concept, but there's no beginning or the ending. However, displaying the film subject in the variety of angles was stunning. Sometimes I was keenly looking for where the subject has gone. At sometime it felt like a lazy afternoon under the shades while bright sunlight was on the other side.\r\n\r\nIt was a Taiwan-French co-production and an hour long film that documents a Buddhist monk who has undertaken a slow walk procession in the streets of southern France coast city Marseille which is accompanied by a French actor. It reminded me the recent animation I had seen 'Zootopia', where sloths comes into the scene. Had so much fun, but in not here.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the monk did was called, but definitely it is a fine study material. Like in this modern world where everything is fast and superfast, what it would be like being superslow and how people reacts to it. Actually, many were simply minding their own business, but a few were curiously looking at, like a cultural and\/or the religious difference is something to do with it. A cool film, an art film, but not recommended unless you're not looking for the entertainment only.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"576039e792514166870017d5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/576039e792514166870017d5","movie_id":255554}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Two men with their motorcycles.**\r\n\r\nFine characters and the theme, but could not get the best out of it. The film was slow, though that's the way of it. The story seems very interesting, but that continued from the earlier event which the film did not cover. So it was built on that about a native American who avenged his mother's death and now on the run, chased by an FBI agent. At some point they are going to encounter and what happens then is what puts the end to this narration.\r\n\r\nJason Momoa starred, written, produced and directed the film. I'm really impressed by the attempt, but the film is not going to be enjoyed by everyone. It's a road movie, cross country journey, but filled with more drama than the bike ride or the roadside views. That's fine because it was about the family, and the native Americans who are still suffering from the outrageous acts committed by some of the white men.\r\n\r\nThe narration lacked the appeal, because of the dullness in its scenes. But still there some very good scenes. So it feels more like a TV film and the viewers with no expectation could have a decent time. The end disappointed me, because the rest of the story was developed from the one side, that makes you are forced to believe whatever the film says. You will never have your point of view on what the film deals. If you compromise on that, it will be a better film for you.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"5851ba51c3a3683150019537","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5851ba51c3a3683150019537","movie_id":268060}
{"author":"Olivergbyrne","content":"I remember reading about this film on a film magazine and they said it was going to be a trow back to kids films from the 80's so obviously I imagined D.A.R.Y.L,Goonies, The last star fighter etc.. and I started looking forward to this film. I missed it's theatrical release but finally watched it on blu ray today and I was very underwhelmed. The story start with a future were everybody are locked inside their houses by robots. I'll make the synopsis very brief to avoid any spoilers ...Humans all received some sort of tracking device on the side of their neck that alerts robots of their every move.If a human dare to step away from their house they will have 10 minutes to get home or they will be turned into dust by robots. We follow a bunch of kids that realize accidentally that this tracker can be turned off by receiving an electric shock so they shock themselves and go out then it leads to a rebellion. One of the kid also realize that he has the power to control the robots and that as you imagine comes rather handy. First of all this film feels like a TV film you will get from the CBBC in the 80's.It's very Doctor Who-ish.If you expect (like I did) a trow back to Amblin films , this is not it. This is a very British film and it embrace the type of Sci Fy Britain's has been making for decades. My biggest complain is that on the opposite spectrum of some reviewers on here who felt it was campy , I personally felt the opposite and that it took itself far too seriously. I would have liked the director to add a bit more fun to the script.The dialogs keep things very serious. The film go from Point A to B , it is very straightforward. The characters are not really fleshed out , you get introduced to them very briefly then they are immediately on their Journey.We really don't get enough time with them before hand to really gasp who they are nor really care about them. I would say this : If you are a fan of Doctor Who you might enjoy it as it feels like a feature long episode of something from the same universe as the good old Doctor.If you are after a fun family romp with adventure and comedy , you might be disappointed.It's pure British Sci Fy and it definitely not to try to be something else. It is not a bad film and like all reviews on IMD this is just my opinion and mine is that I believe that only a very specific audience will enjoy this film.","id":"59d4b5ac9251414b5c01593b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59d4b5ac9251414b5c01593b","movie_id":240483}

Well, it was not as bad as I feared but I was not really impressed either. There are some good parts in the movie and, of course, the special effects are more up to todays standards. However it lacks a lot of the appeal, the over the top gory violence and the cartoonish wow-factor that the original has. I guess it is because they wanted that silly PG-13 rating in the hope of raking in more cash. It is not the first time Hollywood greed have ruined a good movie unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the movie is not bad. Taking out Murphy with a simple car bomb was rather disappointing though. Again here the movie lacks the gritty and brutal aspect that the original had. The parts where Murphy is awaken in the secret(?) research and manufacturing facility and him freaking out when discovering what he as become was enjoyable.\r\n\r\nThen it really starts to go downhill in what I usually refer to stupid Hollywood scripting. Ten minutes before Robocop is about to make his public debut then they do a huge info dump into his brain? That is just so poor unintelligent scripting. Of course it went to hell.\r\n\r\nThe special effects are quite okay but again the scripting is just nonsense. Most of the time this highly intelligent combat cyborg is just rushing straight into the fire blasting away like some Terminator\/Rambo wannabe. Sure it makes for some good firefights but it is still poor scripting.\r\n\r\nThen the ending. What was that? I do not refer to the actual ending where Murphy, luckily, prevails but the part after that with the TV-presenter (or whatever he was in the end) rambling on about traitors etc. That was just there to show the audience that they hoped to do a sequel but the nonsensical outburst did not really much sense. Actually I thought that those TV-presenter scenes where generally just a nuisance.\r\n\r\nOn the whole it is not really a bad movie but it is sorely lacking the appeal of the original. Too a large extent this is due to it being reduced to a teenage no-rude-language-please type of movie lacking the dark and gory aspect of the original. The poor script doesn\u2019t help of course. I am not sorry that I spent time watching it but the feeling afterwards where a bit\u2026meh.","id":"53943385c3a368641d002a13","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53943385c3a368641d002a13","movie_id":97020}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Ooh look, it's another revenge thriller.\r\n\r\nNicolas Cage stars as a reformed mobster who is forced to go back to his violent ways when his daughter is kidnapped by baddies.\r\n\r\nIt is what it is really, a Nic Cage starrer that does exactly what the plot synopsis suggests. Does it bring anything new to the revenge formula of genre film making? Absolutely not. But on reflection there are very few that have improved upon originals from as far back as Fritz Lang's Fury in 1936. Sure there is more blood now, more gruesome deaths to put bums on theatre seats, but the majority of them remain soulless, existing only for the point of existing. The market is there for those who either enjoy such genre splatters, or for those who like me just merely wanted a brainless pic to pass the time away with - which of course means leaving said brain at the door.\r\n\r\nIt's all very preposterous, even insulting at times, but this is actually no worse than some of the more praised revenge thrillers of recent times - but that just makes the point that ultimately the bar hasn't been set high for a considerable time now.

Now, in order to get her back, he must get the old gang back together and find the people responsible.\r\n\r\nYes, there is more to the movie than this, but if you are planning on watching the movie, I won't spoil your fun. However, thats not to say that this is a big and interesting plot, far from it.\r\n\r\nNormally, I love movies with a twist, but a twist is nothing if the cast, script and anything really... is bad. In this case, nothing works. Nicolas Cage (whom I know can act) is two dimensional and anything he does seems false and... without passion. While shooting this movie, he must have figured out that it was a mistake and simply... given up. It shows. It just goes to say, a good actor (and I am not saying that Nicolas Cage is a good actor, but he can act, just watch Adaptation) can't keep a movie going on his own, except if your name is Tom Hardy and the movie is Locke, or Robert Redford and the movie is called All Is Lost. Unfortunately, this movie is called Tokarev, the name of a gun, and that... just... says it all. Really.\r\n\r\nI gave this movie two stars, and I'd like to tell you why. Peter Stomare has a small role, and he is always good, and... the ending that goes on beyond the credits... is actually a nice little touch. But everything else. Not worth the bother.\r\n\r\n_Last words... don't watch this movie.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"In the opening minutes of Ramanujan, we see the young Ramanujan posing a trick question to his mathematics teacher in school and embarrassing him. We then see him teach a thing or two about mathematics to a couple of priests in the temple, trigonometry to the college students staying in his house and helping out with the seemingly complicated time table of his school. With these few scenes, Gnana Rajasekaran spells out the genius of Ramanjuan (Abhinay) and the film from thereon, essentially resembles a journey the great man has to take towards the acknowledgement of his genius. This journey is predominantly marked by the three relationships that he forms \u2014 with his pushy mother Komalathammal (Suhasini), his diminutive wife Janaki ( Bhama) and the man who will be instrumental in the world coming to know of his prodigious talent, mathematician GH Hardy (McGowan).\r\n\r\nGnana Rajasekaran is no stranger to biopics, having made Bharathi and Periyar earlier but unlike those two personalities, whose firebrand nature and zeal for their ideals can easily be conveyed on film, his protagonist here is a tricky one. Ramanujan is super-intelligent but how do you showcase intelligence on screen? Then, there is his shy persona. This is a man who is an academic through and through, content to lose himself in mathematics and forget the people around him. He is also a weakling physically, prone to sickness.\r\n\r\nWhat the director does is give us scenes where other characters mostly remark on the brilliance of Ramanujan, while using the character himself to spell out his insecurities and failings. Unfortunately, what looks like a good decision on paper, feels dramatically less interesting on screen. While repeated scenes of characters praising Ramanujan seems redundant, the character starts to feel like a cry baby every time he breaks down and voices his fears \u2014 of not securing a scholarship, of his work not being recognized, of his separation from his wife and of his impending death.\r\n\r\nFor a film that is about a man with astounding talent, the filmmaking is largely unimaginative. The staging is somewhat old-fashioned (read dated), the pacing staid and the film often slips into the kind of melodrama that you nowadays find in TV serials. This is most pronounced towards the climax \u2014 in the scenes that follow Ramanujan's return from the UK. That said, there is a certain doggedness in the manner in which Rajasekaran narrates this story and that keeps you engaged. There is an in-built drama in the life of Ramanujan \u2014 a mathematician whose genius isn't celebrated in his own country but is looked at in awe abroad; a system that forces him to lead an impoverished life despite the goodwill of some individuals around him; the recognition finally coming to him only when he steps out of his county, and finally, fate dealing a cruel hand just when everything seems to be coming together in his life \u2014 and the director does a competent job of conveying this to us, even if it is in a heavy-handed manner most of the times. Strangely, the political turmoil of the time isn't felt at all (the sole exception is a scene in which Ramanujan talks about satyagraha but that has an entirely different context) and the irony in this tale \u2014 the British actually doing something meaningful to an Indian \u2014 doesn't come through; it would have given the film quite some heft.\r\n\r\nThe cast includes a number of very familiar character actors in Tamil cinema but their roles are all strictly functional that they don't have much room to make them truly stand out. The same goes for Abhinay, who is earnest but is let down by the writing. Suhasini as Komalathammal is definitely intelligent casting and the actress brings out the grey shades of the character very well. But the English actors come across as wooden, and the Tamil dubbing of their lines in an anglicized accent, only makes it worse.","id":"53c47338c3a3682476000135","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53c47338c3a3682476000135","movie_id":280871}

But the end should have been really better, other than that the rest of the film was enjoyable. Another small scale movie and another excellent performance by Kristen Wiig. The story of a single woman with the borderline personality disorder. After winning the $80 million through the lottery draw, she decides to own a television show to talk about her personal life. She begins to lose her close ones as the result of her out talk about them, but can she fix it and how is the remaining.\r\n\r\nThis is a unique story, not like that you see it often in the movies. Apart from Wiig, the rest of the supporting cast was not bad, but very sad to see such a good looking wonderful actress like Linda Cardellin in a small role. If you hate slow pace, this movie might be an average to you, but others who won't mind will find it better. What I surprised to know is that most of the film critics thumb upped for it than the film goers. But I still suggest it, mainly for the film fanatics, just give it a try and so you might like it than what you've heard about it.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"571cdb24c3a36864e0005895","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/571cdb24c3a36864e0005895","movie_id":284537}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Too protective mother and her grown up son keen to choose his own path.\r\n\r\nIt is a 2nd directional feature for Helen Hunt. She also starred in a prominent role which is about a mother-son relationship. I don't understand why it was rated very low, but I like this rare movie, which portrayed parent-children bond in an emotional way. Such kind of a beautiful film the last time I saw was the 'The Guilt Trip', I guess. Only the women filmmakers can make films like this.\r\n\r\nMaybe this movie hit my weak point, I'm always sympathetic to the old people's struggle. Anyway, I liked the Helen Hunt's role and she was not struggling, but wanted to connect with her son who's grown up and trying to stretch his wings to fly away from her. This is very usual in the real world, an affectionate father towards his daughter and the same to a mother towards her son. I find this kind of themes are very cute and touches me.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing bad about the direction, but the screenwriting. Helen Hunt is not a great writer, in some parts the film was very dry. Feelingless emotions, but overall keeping the prime target as a mother who's pursuing her son for some reason. There were a few scenes that added the fun flavour to the movie.\r\n\r\nI wanted to give more points it, but I can't. Besides, I can recommend it to the people who're interested to have a movie about the family issues. Not like couples having a quarrel, but between parents and their kids, like maybe similar to the one I mentioned in the first paragraph.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"5697aa5592514154cc00251c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5697aa5592514154cc00251c","movie_id":330115}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"When an actor returns to the screens after a two-year gap, we expect him to choose a vehicle worthy of a comeback. Vadivelu seems to have gone for a safer option and so comes with a film that feels like a less funny and bloated version of his own Imsai Arasan 23am Pulikesi. Like that film, this one too is a historical fiction. They feature garish set design and costumes. The heroines in both these films are dispensable. Even the actor's dual roles in both the films are similar \u2014 a naive king and an intelligent commoner. But while the previous film had wit and playfulness and nicely adapted the Uthama Puthiran formula (which, in turn, had its roots in Alexander Dumas's Man In The Iron Mask), this one tries to adapt the fables of Tenaliraman, pitching it at a very childish level.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with ministers from Vigada Nadu meeting the Chinese emperor. They are egged on by Parasparam (Radha Ravi, alternating between his father's style of dialogue delivery and a normal one), the ruler of a smaller state, to agree to a deal giving the Chinese unrestricted access to trade in the kingdom in exchange for personal wealth. One minister, Nandi Varma Rayar, who refuses to accept this offer is offed. In his place, the child-like king takes in a witty and intelligent fellow, Tenaliraman, who has his own agenda for getting close to the king. Meanwhile, he discovers the plot of the corrupt ministers and they, in turn, try to get him exiled from the country. Who wins this battle of wits?\r\n\r\nTenaliraman is somewhat amusing, especially if you like loud comedy. But the laughs are far and few as director Yuvaraj is in a confusion \u2014 should he stay true to the narrative or play up the comedic prowess of his hero? Sadly, he chooses the latter, and so, the plot digresses to episodes from the Tenaliraman fable that we are familiar with \u2014 an episode involves Tenaliraman demonstrating how he pacified an adamant child by showing it an elephant inside a pot; another has him outwitting the ministers' plan to get him executed by the king and one over-long segment shows us how he makes the king understand that everything happens for a good reason. Thus it falls into the in-built trap in picturising a fable. These stories, which we find witty while reading seem silly when we actually see the act. So, the sight of Tenaliraman bawling like a child in the king's court only makes the scene ridiculous.\r\n\r\nWhile it doesn't end up as lifeless as Vadivelu's other film Indiralogathil Na Azhagappan, many of the scenes lack vitality and the film exhibits a tendency to stop dead every now and then. The score tries to inject some energy but mistakes bombast for grandeur and ends up overpowering the scenes. Vadivelu tries a little too hard to make things funny and his portrayal of the king is clearly over-the-top; the body language and the tonal inflections of the character feel funny initially but soon end up tiresome. The motley bunch of supporting actors who play the ministers hardly gives the impression of being formidable foes to Tenaliraman. So, we hardly feel anything is at stake. In fact, the climax is one of the least exciting endings in recent times.","id":"53baaf7d0e0a2676bf00bc77","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baaf7d0e0a2676bf00bc77","movie_id":262691}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I have to say that this was a rather \u201cmeh\u201d experience. It certainly was not an improvement over the original. Why try to rewrite a story that was actually not bad when you cannot be bothered to spend some effort on it? The new story is sloppy and it is rather clear that whoever wrote it got only two directives: Make sure that Megan Fox gets a lot of focus and if you do not know what to write then cram in some special effects. There are a lot of special effects in this movie!\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that Megan Fox\u2019s ego have had a lot of influence on the movie. To the extent that you might wonder if this movie is about the turtles or about Megan Fox. She might be the wet dream of some less discerning teenagers but her acting skills leaves somewhat to be desired. Okay, okay she was actually not too bad in this movie but then it was not to difficult to shine in this movie either.\r\n\r\nThere are a few moments when it looks like it is going to turn interesting. For instance when the shredder is first introduced and punishes some of his underlings but rather quickly he is reduced to just another \u201cspecial effect\u201d when they slap this robotic shredder suit onto him. Come on, he is supposed to be a skilled martial arts combatant, not some freak in a robotic suit.\r\n\r\nSplinter was just sad. Some lab rat that picked up martial arts from a book he found in the sewers! What the f\u2026? That ruined a lot of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe turtles themselves, being already pushed back somewhat into the background by Megan Fox desire to be in front of the cameras most of the time, are bland to say the least. They are immature, even for a movie like this, and the jokes are simply unintelligent and mostly not very funny.\r\n\r\nI was about to write that, if you like special effects and do not care for much of the rest, then you will probably like this movie but when I think back even the special effects where often only mildly interesting. They were perhaps not really bad but not very impressive either. The truck ride down a snowy slope was just silly and some of the scenes where actually rather underwhelming for instance.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, to me, this was a mildly entertaining movie that could have been much better if someone with basic intelligence had been asked to write the script in the first place. There are actually five (!) people credited with writing this movie and maybe that is the problem. Too many cooks!","id":"5a738bda0e0a26642a013a97","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a738bda0e0a26642a013a97","movie_id":98566}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The lesson the WWI taught us that we shouldn't let it fade away.\r\n\r\nKind of reminded me 'Atonement', but not a similar movie, except like you know the loved one goes to the war, serving a nurse in the army like stuffs. Actually, this one was a biopic of a young Vera Brittain that set in the England, 1914. Her wish becomes real to attend the university of Oxford, but at a same time the World War I breaks out and puts her dream to a pause while her beloved ones are fighting in the war. She fights her own way to save them and bring safely back home. For that she goes through many difficulties and by the time when war nears the end, the movie as well.\r\n\r\nI felt it was a bit lengthy, but covers everything without racing towards the end by trimming all the important portions. It was an anti-war theme. It demonstrated the struggles that everyone who linked directly to the war would go through. Like parents, fiancee, siblings, friends who send their loved ones to the war. Especially how the young generations are affected by the sudden warfare. So like the title, Vera tells the story by recalling her memories. The film won't show the battles, but only a glimpse of a few seconds for a couple of times.\r\n\r\nAlicia Vikander was at her best. She was quite impressive in the recent films of hers. I liked the filmed locations, some of the countryside landscapes were beautiful. The end scene is where it really breaks our heart, makes us to feel what Vera felt. The book which this movie was based on was a bestseller at that time, but was just a someone's story, although the world war two came. It is a good movie about a stupid war. The first major mistake by the man in the modern world, followed by another.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"5661a3bf925141790c007424","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5661a3bf925141790c007424","movie_id":284689}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"And, so it ends, Vijay Sethupathi's enviable run of envelope-pushing movies, with this very familiar tale of blood-soaked romance that clearly wants to be another Subramaniapuram. Right from its period setting (late 1980s) to the countryside duets and the ruthless characters, Rummy recalls the Sasikumar film, almost to a fault.\r\n\r\nThe film begins with Sakthi, an ordinary young man, joining college in Sivaganga where he meets his lover Meenakshi and his friends Joseph and Arunachalam. A tussle with a classmate over Meenakshi leads to Sakthi and Joseph taking a room in Arunachalam's village, where love affairs result in losses \u2014 of your anatomical parts or even life! Even as Sakthi carries on his romance with Meenakshi, Joseph falls in love with Sornam, the daughter of the village's 'periyavar', who is merciless when it comes to saving his honour. Soon enough, both the love affairs come to his knowledge, leading to a tragic ending.\r\n\r\nWhile it is, on the whole, a decent film, especially in the set-in-the-sickle-toting-south genre, Rummy is also wearisome, mainly because it is so predictable. There is a strong been-there-done-that whiff in the proceedings that you are hardly surprised and never really root for the characters. When we see Sakthi and Joseph witnessing a man getting his arm cut for falling love, we instantly know that the two will face life-threatening challenges in the second half. When a character makes an enemy of another in the first half, we know that he will return again later to get his revenge, even if he goes missing for most parts of the film. Then, there is a scene where a character asks another if he will look after her till the very end and he replies he'll care for her till he remains. Immediately, we know what fate (or, the director) has in store for this character.\r\n\r\nThe characters too are broadly written and the actors try their best to elevate this material but there is hardly anything for them to hold on to and showcase something fresh. As for the romances, they happen so quickly without much drama (and, both are love-at-first-sight romances), while the villain doesn't have any shades \u2014 his only function in the film is killing or maiming anyone who has fallen in love with girls from his village. And, unlike some other directors who made up for the lack of novelty with atmosphere, Balakrishnan doesn't bother too much with colouring the film with nativity. If it isn't mentioned that the film takes place in the 80s, we would still have bought this as a contemporary story taking place in the lawless South (even if it isn't the reality). And, yet, despite all these problems, we stick till the end because of our inherent nature of finding some comfort in the familiar.","id":"53bb17840e0a2619840002c9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bb17840e0a2619840002c9","movie_id":252722}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> An impact of the loss of a close one.\r\n\r\nIf you think it is some B movie, which is overrated, I would say your assumption is totally wrong. I did not know anything about this film either, I thought it was a Christian Bale movie, that's who I saw in the poster, but later I came to know it was a different guy. My thought on this changed after watching it, it is really a beautiful drama-music. One of the best films of the 2014 that I would have missed it if I had listened to the lies of the critics. So be careful while choosing such movies, because critics are not always right.\r\n\r\nI believe you all had seen enough films based on the school shootings like 'Elephant'. This is a similar kind, except there's no violence in it, I mean the shootout was not shown, but a drama about its consequences, especially in the perspective of the parents. This tale focused on a father whose son had been killed in a such unfortunate event. How it affects his life was narrated wonderfully with some awesome music tracks. A father's mourning and his uncertain future to the self-discovery.\r\n\r\nThis is Willian H. Macy's directional debut film and he pulled it off quite superbly. Sadly, nobody talks about it in the line of other great films of the year, because it deserves an equal respect and praise. I am not the only one, there are others too who liked it a lot. A simple story and the perfect character exhibitions with the pleasing musics, all these worked in its favour. Supporting roles are enough, Billy Crudup should do more lead roles. After seeing his impressive performance in this I am confident that he can find his own place in the industry. And so Willian H. Macy, I'm looking forward for his future projects.\r\n\r\n> \"There are 14 people in the audience and 10 of them are performers.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not inspired by the real story, except the school shootings, but the film incredibly told what happens after such incidents. The best part was balancing the emotions in the storytelling. After watching it in the first 10 minutes, I expected, in fact anybody expects it to be a tearjerker film, but it was not, even though I loved watching the rest of the film. And the twist was very casual which was not meant for the story or the characters, but for the viewers that related to the school shooting that we never saw. So there is a less possibility for us to expect it coming, but it also that brings a better conclusion to the heartwarming tale.\r\n\r\nIt was like someone's real life, yet not easy to predict the scenes. Cinematically it accomplished its quest to be a good film. Selena Gomez was in a guest role, but for a star like her it was unnecessary to play a small part, especially in a serious theme like this. Because unexpected anticipation grows in us and in the end that might lead to a disappointment, especially for her fans. That is not for her alone, but any other big stars, because it is not a comedy or a superhero film when they appear on the screen, the audience to go crazy. A character with the dialogues means something big, but anyway, she was bad at all.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't as good performance as Anton Yelchin's previous film '5 to 7' that I saw early this year, but yeah definitely a decent supporting character along with Laurence Fishburne's. Don't mistake it, it was not a powerful drama about grieving alone, but in its small specific expanse it reached what it wanted to tell the audience so perfectly. So, there are some fun parts as well in it in a small quantity. But overall, a film that fulfills its promise. By now you might know that I strongly recommend it, especially if anyone who had ever lost their loved ones, they will feel it in their heart more than others do.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"5737620d92514115a1000c3b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5737620d92514115a1000c3b","movie_id":244403}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This movie is probably quite unknown by most people. I certainly had never heard of it when I stumbled on it. It is a quite entertaining little fantasy \/ supernatural \/ crime movie though. I am actually not sure what to classify at as. It starts of as a fantasy movie but is it really?\r\n\r\nThe cinematics of this movie is very good. For me it was the main part contributing to the enjoyment. The small world of these villagers is cinematically beautiful, dirty and gritty at the same time. The characters themselves with their enormous moustaches and weirdly cut hair are great. The special effects will perhaps not win any awards but they were good nonetheless. I especially liked the transformation scene during the meal somewhere in the middle of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe story is a bit of a roller coaster ride and sometimes it felt a bit disjointed. It was not really obvious why one scene or event was followed by another at all times. But then, taking into account the later events in the movie it was perhaps ment to be a bit disjointed and \u201cdreamy\u201d and I have to confess that I was extremely tired when watching this movie.\r\n\r\nThe ending was a bit of a surprise. This is where the movie kind of went from a fantasy movie to more of a crime story. I have to say that I did not really see that coming until it was about to fall in my lap.\r\n\r\nThere are definitely worse ways of spending two hours in the evening, especially if you like movies that are not the typical mainstream Hollywood fare.","id":"55fe59299251410471000205","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55fe59299251410471000205","movie_id":208763}
{"author":"Norsk","content":"Zero Point is an Estonian coming of age tale about a high school student with a schizophrenic mother. The protagonist, Johannes, who bears a passing resemblance to Matt Damon, transfers to a new high school where every woman is beautiful - the only problem is most of the students hate him and want to make his life miserable. Meanwhile he has to deal with a mom that refuses to take her medication and makes the lives of everyone around her a living hell, his friends from outside school who are trying to pull him into a life of crime and alcohol and finally a thieving musician who refuses to give Johannes credit after stealing his lyrics for his latest hit. His situation appears hopeless and suicide seems like a good way out. How will he respond?\r\n\r\nM\u00e4rt Pius does an excellent job portraying Johannes. His performance gave me flashbacks of high school and had me rooting him for like he was my own best friend. The scene where he is up front reading his biography in Swedish while being berated by the Swedish teacher and just after reading a note from his classmates filled with nasty things about him will stick with me for a long time. The supporting cast play their roles well. Linda Kolde is excellent as Liisa, a classmate with a vendetta against him and Saara Kadak is great as\r\nBianka, a beautiful classmate with an infectious smile who feels sorry for Johanees. Highly recommended.","id":"59ff413392514146f5042bf8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59ff413392514146f5042bf8","movie_id":308980}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Perfect sisters' perfect evildoing.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian version of 'Heavenly Creatures'. The director admits he inspired by the Peter Jackson's movie. But you must know that this film was also based on the real sisters who were fed up with their irresponsible and alcoholic mother and her abusive boyfriend. So they plot to set free themselves from the messed up life as they think they deserve better.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed to be a television movie, but later it saw a limited theatrical release and a mixed response from all quarters. I liked the film, for its strong content, but the weakness lies in the first half. The beginning was a very poor quality of presentation, the next half was the reason I favoured it where it erupts while the narration nearing the conclusion.\r\n\r\nSince no one knows the details about the real sisters, the characters were altered in the movie as the cast desired to attack few things to complete it. Both, Abigail Breslin and Georgie Henley were not bad, but it's hard to believe these child actors are all grown up. In a few years, they will be in the lead! Anyway, this film is worth a watch, especially true stories like this fascinates me. We could learn about our world and its society, what other people went through in their lives and the reason behind those stuffs.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"5661a173c3a36875e9007c64","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5661a173c3a36875e9007c64","movie_id":206192}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Vadacurry shares a characteristic with two other films that we have seen this year. As in Pulivaal, the plot is set in motion after the hero steals a mobile phone; and, like the hero of Damaal Dumeel, this act of taking what is not his gets him into trouble with criminals. Sathish (Jai) has just begun his career as a medical representative. But his archaic mobile phone is a constant source of embarrassment. When we first see him, he is waiting in a clinic to meet the doctor and the awkward conversations he has with two of his friends on the phone are heard by everyone around him. On the advice of his loudmouth friend Karikaalan (RJ Balaji), he tries to get an expensive mobile phone but can only afford a cheapskate \"Korean set\" as a replacement. With its blaring ringtone, the phone only lands him in even more trouble. His sister-in-law (Kasturi) uses the phone to scare her child into eating, his friends use it to make him the butt of their jokes and he is even threatened by a petty shop owner for using such a phone near his shop.\r\n\r\nWanting to put an end to this humiliation, Sathish steals an iPhone and starts flaunting it. However, his auto-driver brother's ( Aruldoss) honesty forces him to introspect his action and the young man decides to return the phone to its actual owner. But that only lands him in trouble with another medical rep, Dhayalan (Ajay Raj), who is tracking the phone's mysterious owner to solve his personal problems.\r\n\r\nDirector Saravana Rajan coasts through the first half with the motormouth RJ Balaji, whose kitchen sink brand of comedy results in many laughs and quite a few misses. Then, there is the mandatory romantic track between Sathish and Naveena (Swati's performances has shades of her role from Idharukuthaane Aasaipattai Balakumara, especially when she acts the nagging girlfriend). Interestingly, in a commendable scene which follows the lively song Nenjukulla Nee, the director boldly acknowledges the amount of stalking that good-looking girls (and the heroines in our films) are subjected on a daily basis. But Rajan comes from the Venkat Prabhu school of filmmaking and like his guru, he doesn't seem to like letting things get too serious and so, offsets this sort-of profound moment with humour in the next scene. And when Sathish is desperately trying to get himself out of the mess, we get lighter scenes where RJ Balaji, who has been kidnapped as a hostage, befriends his abductors. Even the graveness of the villain's crime \u2014 repacking expired medicines and selling them to the unsuspecting public \u2014 isn't allowed to weigh down on the plot. There are other Venkat Prabhu touches as well. Like the manner in which the revelations are narrated; Rajan shows us who the villain is and then cuts to shots of the villain's previous actions (not surprisingly, the editor is Praveen KL, who has cut all of Venkat's films). The director also shares Venkat's fondness for casting friends in cameo roles. Here, in addition to Jai, we find Ajay Raj and Venkat himself in a minor role; then, there are the guest appearances by Premgi Amaren and Mahat Raghavendra.\r\n\r\nAnd, yet, despite the flair, the film feels uneven and the strain to maintain a lighthearted tone makes one think that nothing is really at stake here. And after all the mystery around the villain, we are provided with someone who is less convincing given the build-up. The plot could have made into a great black comedy, a satire on our materialistic lifestyle, but there is hardly any sting here.","id":"53baaaf70e0a2676b800b9db","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baaaf70e0a2676b800b9db","movie_id":263487}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"If it was horror in his debut (Eeram), Arivazhagan tackles the sports movie genre in his sophomore effort Vallinam, which wants to highlight the fact that we should stop being a one-sport (read cricket-crazy) nation and encourage every sport and sportsperson in the country. It is an idealistic film, yes, but what makes Vallinam a commendable effort is that it doesn't resort to cricket-bashing to drive home its point.\r\n\r\nThe film begins with an prologue in which we see Krishna ( Nagulan, working hard), a gifted if self-centred basketball player. An on-court fatality involving his friend Shiva ( Kreshna, in a guest appearance) leaves him demoralized and he decides to give up the game and move to Chennai. But, as his coach ( Aadhi, another guest star) tells him, the game that he loves the most will definitely enter his life again. That happens in his new college, thanks to the college's egomaniacal cricket team captain Vamsi, who always belittles other sports and tries to scuttle the chances of the other sportsmen in the place. To put him in his place and defend his friends, Krishna challenges Vamsi that the college's basketball team will win a national tournament. But winning is not going to be easy, especially with an enraged Vamsi doing his best to foil the team's chances.\r\n\r\nVallinam uses most of the sports movie constructs \u2014 underdog protagonists who must first overcome their differences before taking to the court, a no-nonsense coach, an offbeat training montage, fearsome opponents in the final, and a motivational speech by the hero which helps snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. The one interesting variation here is the adversary \u2014 here, it is someone who plays a different game and so, the clash is not exactly on the field but off the field. Arivazhagan divides the narrative into two distinct halves. The first involves Krishna's challenges in putting together a team while in the latter, he keeps throwing obstacles (official indifference, politics, match-fixing, and even romance) in the team's path.\r\n\r\nThe film takes a while to get going after the epilogue as the director devotes quite some time on Krishna forming new relationships (both friendly and romantic) in his new college. But the film goes into top gear after Krishna's confrontation with Vamsi, culminating in a tense pre-interval on-court contest involving Krishna and Sundar, a third-year student, who the former wants to woo to his team. The second half never truly captures the high of this scene but Arivazhagan keeps things moving at a fairly fast clip (save for the romantic track, which takes far too much time than it should ideally do, especially with such a blah heroine) so the film doesn't turn dull.\r\n\r\nThe filmmaking too is a bit heavy-handed here when a little bit of understatement would have been welcome. Take the climatic final match. When Krishna and his teammates are playing, it is intercut with shots of Vamsi playing cricket on his mobile phone and his game's progress contrasts with what's happening on the court (when Krishna's team seems to be losing, he is hitting sixes and fours and as they start winning, he starts getting out). And the expressions of the opponent players (all of whom are foreign actors) are unintentionally funny.\r\n\r\nBut, by then, we are very much invested in the final clash and rooting for the protagonists so much that we feel a genuine rush when the movie ends. The rousing end credits, which feature notable sportspersons of our country (including a certain Tamil actor with a passion for racing!), only adds to the excitement.","id":"53bb19dfc3a3686638000269","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bb19dfc3a3686638000269","movie_id":79356}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Vallavanukku Pullum Aayudham is an example of how most of our filmmakers are clueless when it comes to economy of storytelling. The film largely takes place in a span of three days and we should ideally be made to forget this fact and lose ourselves in the plot. However, the film only keeps reminding us what a better film its source, SS Rajamouli's Telugu film Maryada Ramanna (2010), is. That film was a minor effort for the director, who was clearly going for a lighter fare between his ambitious Magadheera and Naan Ee. And, despite some flab (especially the songs), he succeeded in making audiences accept a comedian as a hero and kept the film moving at a fast clip. Here, though director Srinath opts for a frame-to-frame remake, the momentum is missing in the scenes, turning the film into a drag, even for those who haven't seen the Telugu film. Perhaps, he should have rather gone back to Maryada Ramanna's uncredited source, Buster Keaton's silent film Our Hospitality (1923), which is filled with inventive set pieces and tells the same story in just over an hour.\r\n\r\nSakthi, an orphan in Chennai, learns about his ancestral property and goes to his village to sell it off. En route, he meets Vanathi, a pretty girl and becomes friendly with her, not realizing that her family is baying for his blood owing to a decades-old family feud. He also becomes a guest in her house and when her father Singarayar ( Nagineedu, who did the role in Telugu as well) and two brothers realize his true identity, they are livid. But, there is a catch \u2014 they will murder him only when he steps out of the house to uphold their hospitality. How Sakthi manages to stay alive using his wiles is what the plot is all about.\r\n\r\nThe chief problem with the film is that the director takes an hour for the set-up itself. We have to put up with a hero introduction number, a needless character in the form of a cycle (both of which were written into the story in a much better way in the Telugu film) and most importantly, an overlong and often juvenile comedy track involving Sakthi and Raj, a show-off and his two cronies, which includes the mandatory girls-are- exploiters comment by the hero. If these scenes are made bearable, it is only because of Santhanam, who gets some funny lines to ridicule Raj and his friends.\r\n\r\nIt gets a little better after Sakthi enters the Singarayar household though the film never feels nail-bitingly tense, despite its protagonist's predicament. It feels like everyone was more concerned about staying as close to the original as possible and forgot to inject drama into the scenes. Some of the interpersonal relationships, like Vanathi's equation with her cousin Raja, aren't captured well either. The antagonists are made to recite most of their lines in a drawn-out fashion to add punch but this only slows down the film's pace as do the frequent slow motion shots. As for Santhanam, we see the effort he has put in to pass off as a hero; he looks dapper, attempts difficult steps in the songs and coasts through in full form during the humorous sequences but in the emotional scenes, he is all at sea and at times, this turns the scene unintentionally funny.","id":"53baad390e0a2676c400bd7e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baad390e0a2676c400bd7e","movie_id":263512}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"If his debut film Kadhalil Sodhappuvadhu Yeppadi was an irreverent rom-com, in his second effort Balaji Mohan gives us a high-concept comedy which, in its second half, is entirely a silent film. Well, almost. Many of its tropes must be familiar to those who have seen enough Hollywood comedies and rom-coms. A do-gooder hero with a dream, a heroine with a jerk of a boyfriend, her somewhat dysfunctional family (here, it includes a forever busy dad, stepmom who has stopped writing to take care of the family and whom the heroine isn't ready to accept yet, a stepbrother who flunks in his class but is highly creative), a charity organization that faces eviction, and so on. But the director shows that you only need a bit of invention to turn routine into unique.\r\n\r\nThe film is set in Panimalai, a fictional mountain town, where the hero Arvind ( Dulquer Salmaan, making a sparkling debut in Tamil) is a salesperson. As he tells a character, he cannot stop himself from mending things that are broken. He believes that every issue can be resolved if the parties involved talk sensibly to each other. The heroine, Anjana (Nazriya), is diminutive, doesn't talk much and obliges to her boyfriend's dictates (no specs, only contacts and so on). Meanwhile, interesting (read absurd) things are happening in the town. An association of drunks is protesting against a film star (John Vijay as Nuclear Star Boomesh) for defaming them in his movie, but most importantly, a mysterious illness is spreading in the town which results in people losing their voice. The government declares this as dumb flu, and quarantines the entire town. The health minister ( R Pandiarajan), who is stationed there, embarrasses himself in an interview (which results in a funny YouTube mash-up video) and to save himself, announces that he is infected with the flu. And, following researchers the advice of researchers, the government implements a curfew forcing all individuals of the hill station from speaking. Will this loss of speech make things worse or will it make people to communicate better?\r\n\r\nVaayai Moodi Pesavum is truly an ambitious effort, at least by Indian cinema standards, and what's truly heartening is that Balaji Mohan succeeds in his attempt. Humour is his trump card and he provides that in liberal doses and in every form, from intelligent ones to downright silly. He doesn't spare anyone, from the government machinery to the film industry and even himself. He takes a swipe at not only the fringe groups which have started curtailing freedom of expression in the form of protests but also people in the film industry, who do the same by stifling critical voices. Tellingly, he uses RJ Balaji, who was forced to take his show off air, to launch into the plot.\r\n\r\nHe doesn't stop with creating quirky characters but he manages to integrate them well with the plot. The conflict involving the drunks and film star might look like low comedy to keep the laughs coming (Robo Sankar is a scream as the leader of the protestors) but it also plays a small part in bringing together the hero and the heroine. The TV news bulletin, too, is used not just for comedy (the tickers are little gems in themselves) but also as a crutch to further the plot or narrate the off-screen events, especially in the second half. In a 'meta' touch, the director himself plays the news presenter; he is the narrator both on screen and off screen!\r\n\r\nGiven that the second half has very little dialogues, there was always the threat of it descending into tediousness, but the various sub-plots help to keep things moving. The jaunty score (by debutant Sean Roldan), too, does its part and prevents things turning dreary. If at all there is a flaw, it is that the resolutions for these various conflicts are so predictable. Anjana manages to find courage to call off the engagement with her boyfriend, the dour landlord who is hell bent on selling off the property on which the charity stands decides to let them stay after he patches up with his son, the writer Vidya getting back to writing, the incompetent minister who chose to lie about the illness loses his voice... And, the writing could have been tighter as at times, we can sense the director staying a bit too long with the sub plots.","id":"53baadbe0e0a2676c400bd8e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baadbe0e0a2676c400bd8e","movie_id":263494}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"For a film which wants to treat romance and breakup in a lighthearted manner, Yennamo Yedho (a remake of the Telugu film Ala Modalaindi) is tonally inconsistent. It has a silly framing device \u2014 a gangster wrongly kidnaps the hero to stop a marriage and forces him, at gun point, to narrate his tale. As for that tale, it all starts with a freak accident, which results in Gautham's girlfriend Simran falling in love with the doctor who treats him. Meanwhile, he meets Nithya who was in love with the doctor. The two share their misery and become friends over a night of drunken revelry. Friendship turns to love for Gautham and when he decides to express his feelings for her, he learns Nithya is engaged to another guy, Raja. Distraught he hooks up with veterinarian Kavya, thinking that he loves her. How do Gautham and Nithya get together?\r\n\r\nIt is a convoluted plot that just feels inane on paper but one that could pass off as a comedy of the absurd on screen. But, because of its uneven tone, the film comes across as something that is severely disjointed and unfocussed. The initial sequences which result in the Gautham-Nithya meet-up are done in the right spirit and the extended and indulgent climax has the screwball vibe. But it is what is in between that is problematic.\r\n\r\nThe film has all the elements that we are familiar with \u2014 friends-turned-lovers, the friendly mom, the hero's friends who egg him on, the loser boyfriend\/girlfriend (Raja and Kavya) who exist only to provide conflict, songs shot in foreign locations (of course, with foreign girls as backup dancers) and even a dog which plays a part in getting the lovers together. And each of these plot devices are used as and when necessary to keep the story moving forward and the effect strangely reminds us of a child with numerous playthings moving from one toy to the next as and when he is bored with one. So, we get a serious scene followed by a comedy scene followed by a romantic scene (sometimes with a song) followed by a scene in the present with the gangster and so on.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the romance doesn't feel organic, the sentiments seem superficial and the comedy comes across as juvenile, especially a gay stereotyping track. The performances too are phony. In most scenes, we are able to make out that the actors are performing between an 'action' and a 'cut'. Gautham Karthik does have the charm of his father but his role is poorly sketched that he cannot do much with it. As for Rakul, she manages to get her lip sync right at most times, but in the process, her performance becomes artificial. Only Prabhu, despite the amusing wig, acquits himself, especially in the latter portions when he uses his vocal inflections to bring out the comedy in the scenes.","id":"53baaeae0e0a2676cf00bcae","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baaeae0e0a2676cf00bcae","movie_id":266309}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Not all the birds born navigator.**\r\n\r\nThis 'Yellowbird' came between 'Free Birds' and 'Angy Birds'. I liked all the three. They all about the birds, but different from each others. This is a French film in English language. It tells the story of a yellow bird who was raised by a ladybug. All his life he lived in a small safe enclosure, but the destiny chooses him to lead a flock of birds to migrate during the eve of winter. Without any experience how he manages to accomplish the mission is what covered in the remaining parts.\r\n\r\nThe animation standards were high. The character models and backgrounds, all were impressive. Even the colours and texture were so good. But the story was weak. The adventure did not have any major impressive scene. It has some decent jokes, but not an adventure to define the film. It was a simple story about a lie and doing the right thing after realising that. I am sure not everyone would enjoy it, but kids would.\r\n\r\nFor me, it had lots of ups and downs throughout the narration. At least it ended decently. Animation films won't release every weekend and I have seen almost all the top ones so far, so what's next are these ones.

{"author":"mattwilde123","content":"'Unfriended' is a modern horror film with interesting messages about modern society and our addiction to social networking tools on the Internet. It touches on quite a sensitive subject in cyber bullying from the very disturbing introduction. It tells the story of a teenage girl who was publicly humiliated on the internet and commits suicide due to the heckling and bullying from her peers. A year on and it seems that this group of peers are being stalked online by a vengeful pursuer.\r\n\r\nGabradze's direction is very intriguing. 'Unfriended' (lovingly renamed 'Mad Macs' by me) plays out in very simplistic fashion. The film shows the main character's computer screen throughout it's duration. The audience see every keystroke and mistake made by Blaire Lily (Shelley Hennig). This is a very compelling technique when trying to show the character's panic and fear slowly progressing. Blaire plays around with music software known as 'Spotify' during the film which gives an excuse for there to be non-diegetic music to add to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAs the film is mainly a conference video call on 'Skype', the actors are in separate rooms on individual \"webcams\" to add to the realism of the story. Although the film didn't require the actors each to connect to the internet, occasional screen buffering and flickering help add to the illusion.\r\n\r\n'Unfriended' is a very dialogue-driven film as not a lot of action takes place. Therefore, it is essential to have a good screenplay to keep the story as intriguing as possible. The screenplay is solid and there are genuine moments when the mysterious stalker is very creepy and scary. Due to the nature of the film's themes, there is a lot of slang and computer terms that seasoned users of said social networking tools will appreciate and understand. If you are not very wise to how these programs work it may be hard to keep up with the story.\r\n\r\nThe actors weren't the best but the film did work. It would seem that their jarring and annoying demeanor added to the theme of the piece however.\r\n\r\nOverall, 'Unfriended' is an interesting film. I thought it was a very clever statement on modern life. There were moments that were genuinely scary and creepy but like most modern horror films it relied too much on jump scares. It conjured up good memories of 'The Blair Witch Project' in how it tried to be as realistic as possible whilst also addressing dark themes of today's culture.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605","id":"58c14febc3a3682658008e4d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c14febc3a3682658008e4d","movie_id":277685}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"In Velaiilla Pattadhari, we see Dhanush being criticized by his father for being jobless, doted on by his mother, pitied by the heroine and underrated by the villain. In essence, he is playing a role that he has played many times in his 25-films-old career. The plot, too, is a mixture of the relationship drama in his brother Selvaraghavan's films and our regular masala films, in which the David-like hero takes on the Goliath-like villain and brings him down to his knees. And, yet, the film feels fresh and Velraj (the cinematographer making his directorial debut) superbly manages to strike a balance between the emotional and mass hero moments. \r\n\r\nRaghuvaran (Dhanush) is a jobless youngster, who wants to take up only the job of a civil engineer, as that is what he has studied for. His unemployment is a reason for his father ( Samuthirakani) to berate him, more so because his brother, Karthik ( Hrishikesh), who is three years younger, is comfortably employed. The only support for him comes from his mother Bhuvana (Saranya) and Shalini ( Amala Paul), the girl next door, who gets why he wants only his dream job. A tragedy leads to Raghu finally catching a break and he is entrusted with a major project. However, the envious and arrogant scion of a rival developer ( Amitesh) is plotting to scuttle his plans and take over the project himself. \r\n\r\nThe first half of the film is its beating heart and Velraj nicely sets up the relationships between the characters. Raghuvaran's household is quite realistic and the interactions between the flesh-and-blood characters natural. When Raghu's mother comforts him in an earlier scene, she does so with a mixture of pride (he has designed a telescope-like object all by himself to ogle at the heroine) and hope that mothers usually have for their children. When he has a showdown with his father, we see how a normal argument can spill over into something bigger (Resenting the constant comparisons with his brother, he retorts that his parents named him after a villain while his brother has a hero's name). When his parents talk to each other, they speak in a manner in which people who have been married for years and understand each other talk. We are provided with little, little details about these people that we start believing them. For example, Raghu's father is younger than his mother and they married after falling in love and was a firebrand in his college days. his sophisticated brother went to an English medium school while the crude-on-the-outside Raghu did not. \r\n\r\nAnd despite being jobless, Raghu is not a wastrel. He drinks, smokes and seems crude on the outside compared to Karthik, but we are told the latter was sent to an English medium school while he wasn't. He is also frank enough to admit to Shalini that he is a little jealous of his brother but will not reveal to his father that it was he who helped the goody two shoes Karthik at a crucial stage. \r\n\r\nThe film changes colour in its second half and from a family drama, it becomes a commercial film. It is fantastic to see Dhanush take this boy-next-door to mass hero mode and he has quite a few punchy lines (he has a memorable breathless dialogue that is sure to be talked about). The actor seems to know that this is his show and puts quite an effort into the role, even though he has played such roles frequently. However, the problem is that the film pits him against an antagonist who is more of a wuss than a serious threat. \r\n\r\nThese portions also feel less organic compared to the ones in the first half. But the real trouble is that they also seem needlessly stretched. We get a comedy track of sorts (which while brining a smile also brings down the momentum) and a needless climatic fight (even after the villain has been vanquished) that is solely intended to showcase Dhanush's six-pack. This could still have been a rousing finish but the stunt choreography is quite dull that it fails to pack a punch.","id":"53d6add70e0a262841007d0a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53d6add70e0a262841007d0a","movie_id":262970}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**In this viral going social media era, our actions must be very cautious!**\r\n\r\nA new age cinema. I don't know how it was put under 'found footage' subgenre film, since the webcams involved I think it is very much valid. There are lots of interesting stats for this like it is a $1m film, 80 minutes long, shot within the 16 days, but made to look like a single shot film in real time. This is a story of friends gang whose friend was recently committed suicide. Like usual one day, they are all hanging out on the Skype for a group chat, finds a stranger contact live among them who claims she's their dead friend. So the quest begins to find who really it is and what is the purpose behind such a pose.\r\n\r\nThis story is very familiar. Like a gang was put together in a room and revealing each others secret to bring total chaos. Take for example 'Cube'. What follows is we all know which is actually a famous clich\u00e9 in a thriller like this. So I thought similar way for this and it was, but only in a digital format where the current world trend stands. So this film can be enjoyed by youngsters and those who are familiar which internet forums like facebook, skype, google, email et cetera. In the entire film, all you would see is the computer screen. So you have to quick where mousing is moving and text was composed and concentrating the audio comments. Something like sitting next to a friend's computer and looking what he's doing.\r\n\r\nI think it was a good film, keeps us guessing till the final minute. I'm watching it a bit late, but very happy I did not miss it after all and there is already a second film getting ready which is due this year's end. But I doubt the film won't get anywhere near to this one. The franchise might end up like 'Paranormal Activity' if sequels keeping coming. The actors were good though. I thought one of them was Jennifer Carpenter where one of the film posters resembles 'Quarantine', but during the watch I realised it was a different actress.\r\n\r\nDespite the familiar theme, the setting makes all the difference and pretty entertaining. The end scene was a surprise, because until that point I was not aware of this film genre. Definitely worth a watch for modernising the old storyline with lots of suspense.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"57d30c079251415490000861","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57d30c079251415490000861","movie_id":277685}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"It is always a difficult challenge to remake a movie. That too, one that has already garnered a lot of praise like Salt N' Pepper. Prakash Raj seems to have overcome that challenge admirably as his Un Samayalaraiyil does complete justice to the original.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the manner in which the humour sequences have been shot to the deep, meaningful thoughts that the movie manages to trigger in the minds of the viewers without actually coming across as being preachy, the movie has several pluses.\r\n\r\nA large part of the credit for the film's humour must go to Prakash Raj, Thambi Ramaiah and Elango Kumaravel, who, between them, effortlessly bring a smile to your face. In fact, they make you long for sequences featuring them. It's not just the humour parts that they excel in. They are brilliant even when it comes to showcasing the better qualities of being a human like caring for one another.\r\n\r\nA case in point would be the sequence in which Prakash Raj comes home one afternoon in a foul mood. He is served food by the cook, who, it is evident, is doing so for the praise that he hopes Prakash will shower on him after the meal. Unfortunately for him, Prakash Raj loses his temper, asks him to get out, and leaves the house in a huff. Elango Kumaravel, who, until that point in the movie is constantly at loggerheads with the cook, consoles him by praising his dishes. That scene moves you.\r\n\r\nThe film emphasizes several simple yet powerful thoughts such as the fact that love and trust go hand in hand and that, two people, who are in love, must look to sort out their differences all by themselves rather than looking for external help. More importantly, it also hints at the idea that even out of care, one must not overstep boundaries and make a decision for another.\r\n\r\nOne reason for the commendable manner in which the film has shaped up is its cast. Prakash Raj is brilliant in his portrayal of Kalidasan. Fearless at times, dumbfounded at others, Prakash does a fabulous job, handling both the humourous and serious sequences with the same effortless ease. Sneha as Gowri seems a little unconvincing at the start of the film. However, 20 minutes into the film, she shows why she is considered a class act. The lead pair is offered excellent support by Elango Kumaravel, Thambi Ramaiah, Aishwarya and Urvashi. Both Tejus, who plays Prakash's nephew, and Samyuktha Hornad, who plays Sneha's sister, show promise. This apart, one other factor that works in the film's favour is Ilaiyaraja's background score, which is exceptional at several places.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, this film is like a nutritious meal that not only fills your stomach but also leaves your taste buds tingling.","id":"53baac0f0e0a263588002ae1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baac0f0e0a263588002ae1","movie_id":270781}

When your on line experiences are simply message boards and discussion forums etc, where twitter, skype, facebook and their like are alien to them, then one can only praise when an innovative and fresh idea is brought to the horror realm of film making. And lets face it, horror always needs new splinters to off set the ream of numerical sequels and remakes from hell.\r\n\r\nUnfriended is not scary on conventional terms, where it's not about to jolt you out of your seat or have you hiding behind the sofa. It is, however, scary how technology has advanced, how the millions of world wide web users so willingly commit to baring their innermost to all and sundry. Then there's the dark half, those who use the platforms for venal and nefarious means, bringing very real terrors into our world. \r\n\r\nI can't personally vouch for how genuine the tech aspects are in this film, but Unfriended definitely taps into a frightening realm, and that is to be applauded.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Boy meets girl, girl reveals her true identity and what did the boy do!\r\n\r\nThis is a surprise film. A romance-drama with the backdrop of the smart mix of sci-fi and fantasy. You won't always get a B movie as good as this one. So when you find one, you should appreciate them. It never needed the higher-end graphics, because everything it required of those were in small quantity. Even though they did not compromise and gave best visuals that greatly impacted to the narration.\r\n\r\nThe leading two were very impressive. The Italian locations as well equally beautiful, overall the screenplay was the real winner. The story of an American man who flees to Italy after his mother's death and followed by a small incident. There he meets an unusual young research student and convinces her to date him. While they both getting closer, a series of weird stuffs begins to threaten their relationship. Explaining those to one another and for us the what the remaining film focused.\r\n\r\nThis is like 'Before Sunrise' meets some monster film. I don't think it is very original, but kind of refreshing that carefully carved film. If you see the film poster, you won't get the impression that you want to watch it immediately, but if you give it a try, surely you would be, I mean majority of you won't end in a disappointment. There's no way it should have been better, because it is already at its best in a simple way.

{"author":"Gimly","content":"Following on from my stle of review from previous entry, _V\/H\/S\/2_, I'll just bne giving my quick thoughts segment by segment, rather than the whole thing (star rating is still for _Viral_ overall though).\r\n\r\n**Vicious Circles**: Of the various framing devices found across the _V\/H\/S_ franchise, \"Vicious Circles\" is the best\/makes the most sense, but it wasn't great or anything.\r\n\r\n**Dante the Great**: The most fun of the entries across the whole series. It does stand out in a bad way a little bit, firstly because it's a combination of fake \"found footage\" and fake \"documentary\" which... Like it's weird to have sat through all these shorts and then suddenly have a guy giving an interview to a camera crew, and secondly because I think calling it horror is a stretch. More of a... Fantasy-action-comedy with some heavy gore right at the end.\r\n\r\n**Parallel Monsters**: Has the same problems as the previous film's \"Safe Haven\" entry, but fewer pros to counterbalance it. Could probably be explored in a full length movie to better effect, but even that I'm unsure about.\r\n\r\n**Bonestorm**: The silliest and worst acted of the entire franchise, which truly is saying something. Would probably make more sense as something outside of a _V\/H\/_S film, say... playing silently on a loop on a TV in a skateboard shop, for instance.\r\n\r\n**Gorgeous Vortex**: The \"hidden\" _V\/H\/S: Viral_ entry is an odd one. The only thing it has going for it is also the dumbest thing about it. It's a 15 minute movie that is entirely aesthetic in value, the first and only entry with good video quality. But this is supposed to be a collection of crappily filmed, glitchy footage, copied over to VHS tapes - so in what universe does it make sense?\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._","id":"5c8a2aa8c3a368645d0d32b8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c8a2aa8c3a368645d0d32b8","movie_id":267806}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"The mundane medieval movie \u2018Seventh Son\u2019 is indicative of the cinema wasteland that the beginning of a brand new movie season trudges in after the New Year arrives. In any event, \u2018Seventh Son\u2019 is in good company (or is that bad company?) with flaccid fare such as the sci-fi eyesore \u2018Jupiter Ascending\u2019 and the meatless melodrama \u2018The Boy Next Door\u2019 joining the parade of putrid pictures occupying the big screen at the same time. What is even more shockingly shoddy about \u2018Seventh Son\u2019s embarrassing presentation as a sluggish supernatural movie misstep is the inclusion of Oscar-winner Jeff Bridges (\u2018Crazy Heart\u2019) and current Oscar-nominee Julianne Moore (for 2014\u2019s \u2018Still Alice\u2019) saddled in director Sergei Bodrov\u2019s (\u2018Mongol) period piece sci-fi sludge. Bridges\u2019s gray-haired evil-bashing spook and Moore\u2019s wicked witch may very well deserve to have their SAG cards revoked upon audiences sitting through this faceless fantasy of hocus-pocus.\r\n\r\n\u2018Seventh Son\u2019 wastes no time in setting up its familiar, generic premise involving a mentor-trainee tandem in the wise and haggard spook Gregory (Bridges) and his youthful farmboy protege Thomas Ward (Ben Barnes), an apprentice learning the ropes in taming the evil-doers that dare to exist and persist. Get this\u2026old Gregory is considered a laughingstock (in addition to appearing as a leading personality in this ludicrous narrative) for believing in the evil-minded forces that he warns about consistently. Well, Gregory\u2019s warnings are not so humorous to the naysayers when the sinister witch Mother Malkin (Moore) makes her hostile presence known. Resembling \u2018Maleficent\u2019s gaudy twin sister in wardrobe, Mother Malkin escapes her confines to concentrate on two treacherous tasks at hand: seek revenge on the meddling geezer Gregory and, of course, to control the world under her devilish grasp. The sorcery sass Malkin means business and the desperate Gregory must contain her with the recruitment of the chosen Thomas.\r\n\r\nNaturally, Thomas comes with a unique yet confusing mythology attached to his backstory which explains Gregory\u2019s undivided attention towards the young sword-wielding raw talent. It is revealed that the revered young-blood Thomas is the \u2018seventh son\u2019 from a lineage of seventh sons in his lineage. Thus, Thomas has the specialized aura to carry his own weight into battle as he will serve as an adequate fighting tool for Gregory and the cause to restore order for a doomed society not ready to deal with cutthroat Queen of Mean in Mother Malkin.\r\n\r\nSo we witness Thomas\u2019 so-called training methods and the philosophical mantras that go along with his journey in the name of good versus evil. What would a stud-in-combat-mode be without a lovely lady as an incentive to complete his heroic sacrifices? In this case, Thomas develops a romance with his object of affection in half-witch Alice (Alicia Vikander) who may have some hidden relationship secrets of her own that may prove critical.\r\n\r\nBodrov\u2019s wooden direction and screenwriters Charles Leavitt (\u2018Blood Diamonds\u2019) and Steven Knight (\u2018Easter Promises\u2019) present an amateurish and spotty script that does no favours at all for the rancid \u2018Seventh Son\u2019. Drowsy dialogue, disjointed storylines, hammy acting, tedious fight sequences, derivative-looking 3-D special effect flourishes, cornball sorcery ans swords swagger, spaced-out and unintentional amusing dragons and other convoluted creatures are all are on delusional display in this faulty fable that feels strung together in the aftermath of a drunken stupor originating at the local pub.\r\n\r\nIn this demonic dud, both Bridges (whose \u2018Seventh\u2019 role recalls the forgettable flop \u2018R.I.P.D.\u2019) and Moore are outrageously cast in this clumsy costumed drama and one has to wonder why these veteran performers would sign on the dotted line to appear in this medieval mess? Barnes follows suit as the touted apprentice but his Luke Skywalker-lite antics in \u2018Seventh Son\u2019 are dismissed almost instantly. Even the pronounced presence of Oscar-nominee Djimon Hounsou (\u2018Blood Diamonds\u2019, \u2018Gladiator\u2019, \u2018In America\u2019) cannot give any animated muscle as he appears as Radu, a multiple blade-armed, sword-swinging warlock with stylish jazzy chain accessories. Only the supporting roles of Vikander\u2019s bewitching beauty Alice and Olivia Williams\u2019s Mam Ward (Thomas\u2019 mother) come out of this vacuous venture looking mildly memorable and inviting.\r\n\r\n\u2018Seventh Son\u2019 is based upon the Joseph Delaney books with a decent following in literary circles. The big screen adaptation of Delaney\u2019s pages is meager to say the least. Clearly, there will be no heralded \u2018Twilight\u2019 trend beneath \u2018Seventh Son\u2019s cinematic wings and, if this statement is proven wrong, then perhaps those very same wings need a serious clipping.\r\n\r\nSeventh Son (2015)\r\n\r\nUniversal Pictures\r\n\r\n2 hrs.\r\n\r\nStarring: Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore, Ben Barnes, Djimon Hounsou, Alicia Vikander and Olivia Williams\r\n\r\nDirected by: Sergei Bodrov\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction and Fantasy\/Medieval Melodrama\/Supernatural Fable\/Sorcery and Swords Saga\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: * star (out of 4 stars)","id":"561a21cbc3a3681c2800202d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/561a21cbc3a3681c2800202d","movie_id":68737}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is a good, solid fantasy adventure. It is not a \u201cwow great\u201d kind of movie but definitely enjoyable to watch, at least if you are a fan of fantasy, magic, dragons and such like.\n\nThe movie is based on a book which I have not read although I believe it is considered as a young adult book. The movie seems to reflect this in that it has a fairly simple, straightforward, adventure plot. This is a movie made to entertain with magic, adventure, a bit of humor and visual effects. Nothing more and nothing less.\n\nIn my opinion it does so fairly well. I do like Jeff Bridges in his role as a rather wacky hunter of evil witches who have fallen into a dark and uncaring attitude towards the world around him. Uncaring about everything except slaying of witches that is. Ben Barnes, portraying the apprentice and Seventh Son is unfortunately making a rather bland impression. Then Julianne Moore is definitely better as the evil witch.\n\nNo movie where fantasy, magic and dragons are among the main themes can be without special effects. So, not surprisingly, there are a fair amount of them in this movie. I think they are generally well made and complements the story well without being overdone.\n\nOn the whole I liked the movie. It is a simple but solid adventure story with just the right amount of a few humorous remarks, nice visual effects, a bit of romance and action.","id":"5a92d7900e0a2616c3020376","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a92d7900e0a2616c3020376","movie_id":68737}

It is eligible for some minor exceptions and if you consider that while watching it, then it does not disappoint much. Yes, there are many similar films like this, but what makes it somewhat special is that it is quite freely explored its contents without stressing out on detailing everything. I meant it was a simple road adventure film and you would feel it very familiar yet you will realise that it is not worth criticing it.\r\n\r\nThe actors were decent, but expected much better.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> For whom the golf is not just a sport.\r\n\r\nI don't know the history of golf because I'm not a regular follower of the game other than knowing a few names from this generation. So Severiano Ballesteros is an unheard name to me until I saw this beautiful film. I'm glad I saw it for the many reasons like that.\r\n\r\nAll the films are not for just entertainment, some are the great historical account that makes it reach in a wider distance like this one. Every sports produced its own legends, and so this film is focused on golf. One of the best sport-drama I have ever seen and an important film based on the golf, specially dedicated to Seve fans.\r\n\r\nAn English-Spanish language film produced with the collaboration of Britain-Spain. It sets in a small coastal town of the northern Spain in the year 1967 where the 10 year old Seve introduced to us. Being born in a hardworking farmer family and after losing interest in the studies, how he develops a passion towards the golf is what the film portraits. At the young age he begins to think of the game of all the time and it becomes his life. With the support from his family and trained himself in the harsh conditions make him turn into one of the gifted golfer in the history.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the strangest screen presentations I have seen. It is nothing visual spectacular, or if you expect it to be a film that recreates his whole life, then you might end in a disappointment. Because it was a mix of the feature film as well as the documentary. His childhood days before he becomes a pro was awesomely cinematised and the rest was the archive footages from all the tournament he had competed.\r\n\r\n> \"The one with biggest heart will win.\"\r\n\r\nThat's the part anybody must not miss it because some of the greatest shots he ever played and when he teed off a bad shot, how he came back to the game was so inspiring. His spellbinding techniques and as a humble human being, anyone who does not know would to begin to like him like I did. The blend in narration between the real videos and actors performed were amazing. A perfect screen exhibition for a great sporting personality.\r\n\r\nComing from an economically poor family did not stop him to pursue his dream. Everyone goes through a struggle while chasing such dream, and so Seve did despite very talented. It was a long journey that covered most of his life. With the interview clippings attached to it, lets us know his many unknown qualities of his family, friends, former teammates and opponents recalling their memories. Including some of his old interviews where he reveals how much he loved the game.\r\n\r\nIt was not your usual biographical-sport film, but surely a must see. Very cleverly written screenplay and obviously wonderful editing. Especially if you're a Severiano Ballesteros' fan, you'll definitely love to see him in the film. This is how you showcase a legend on the screen if making money from the product is not an agenda, but letting the world who is Severiano Ballesteros.\r\n\r\nActually, it was directed by a documentary filmmaker, so he excelled it. But the sad part is the film did not reach a wider audience or even the golf fans as it should have been. Mainly because the film did not see the worldwide release, but it is available in the digital format. So I hope my review made you a curious about it and I once gain hope you would recommend it to your friends.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"5752fe98c3a368520700318c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5752fe98c3a368520700318c","movie_id":278990}
{"author":"Grant English","content":"This is a hard movie to watch and rate.\r\n\r\nThe Good:  The images of the flood coming from both above and below the earth were spectacular. The trauma that Noah deals with during the flood and post-flood is beautifully depicted.  I loved the image of Noah realizing that the \u2018sickness\u2019 is in him as well as the others. The story-telling of creation to fall to the flood was beautifully done. I also liked the tension of Noah and the family on the ark as they wrestle with the possibility that the Creator has forgotten them. \r\n\r\nSo with all that good, what ruins the movie?\r\n\r\nI do think a director\/writer has an obligation to the source material.  Subtract the religious aspect of this movie and imagine the outrage if someone changed the story of Harry Potter or Thor.  (Oh wait\u2026they are doing that.)  \r\n\r\nPoint is: if you have source material, use it.  Go ahead and be creative when there are blanks to fill in but why have source material if you're not going to use it?  The director did merge two ancient flood stories \u2013 the Bible and the Babylonian Enuma Elish.  In the end \u2013 neither tradition gets a clear telling of their story.\r\n\r\nOther issues?  The role of Methusala was a complete waste of the talented Anthony Hopkins.  And I still have no idea as to why he was even in the film.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion felt hollow and rushed.  Noah at the beginning of the film leads an isolationist lifestyle focused on raising his children to be good stewards of the earth.  How is this different at the end of the film?  It's not.  Their understanding of life, the Creator, the world isn't any different than the beginning.  There really isn't a pay off to the story...at all.\r\n\r\nIt's just an average film and I expected more with this cast.","id":"54590f9f0e0a26115800215f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54590f9f0e0a26115800215f","movie_id":86834}

It added a bit of extra to the movie and the fight when Tubal-Cain tried to capture the ark was not bad at all.\r\n\r\nHowever, then it went downhill quickly with Noah going more and more nuts and Tubal-Cain, having survived, is subverting Noah\u2019s son Ham. Not that Noah did not really bring that upon himself to some extent though. The parts where Noah want to kill his grandchildren and stops in the last minute is just Hollywood soap-opera bullshit. Also, do not get me started about the ridiculous scene where Anthony Hopkins goes berry hunting like some mental retard.\r\n\r\nUp until about half the movie I did not really understand all the very negative reviews but after having watched through the miserable last half I have to say that I do understand them more. I think the one-star ones are a bit harsh since the movie is often quite beautiful and the acting, despite the crappy script, is quite good, but the lousy script is just destroying the movie.\r\n\r\nDefinitely a disappointment.","id":"543111310e0a265915001518","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/543111310e0a265915001518","movie_id":86834}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Generic Guff.\r\n\r\nNo Good Deed is actually not a bad film as such, it sticks rigidly to a formula and has all the requisite requirements - however ridiculous - for a home invasion thriller, and does it competently. The problem is that it has absolutely nothing new to appeal to anyone who has been watching movies through the 80s and 90s.\r\n\r\nThe 1990s was particularly a thriving hot-bed for such thriller fare, where some unhinged nut-case - male or female - would impose themselves upon some amiable good person's life, and then unleash mentally distorted hell upon them. Sam Miller's film is just a lazy retread of what has gone long before. Only he and his backers think that shifting the focus to black characters somehow makes it more vibrant. It doesn't.\r\n\r\nIdris Alba is a fine actor (in great physical shape as usual), and Taraji P. Henson is a more than effective actress, but the turgid screenplay on offer here does them no favours, where even an intended \"big reveal\" is hamstrung by the familiarity of it all. If one is fortunate to be of a youthful enough age and lucky enough to be viewing this thriller format for the first time? Then this works, it absolutely does. The more mature film lovers, however, will be jaded to the point of sleep status.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Generally speaking I like Liam Neeson so when a movie comes out with him in it I generally get it without too many questions asked. It has been a somewhat varied experience. This one is somewhere in the middle of the range I would say. I did indeed have higher hopes for it.\r\n\r\nThe basic story is quite good but I never really felt very thrilled about the implementation and I more often than not felt frustrated by the various jerks not believing Bill and Bill\u2019s clumsy attempt at convincing people that he was a good guy not to mention controlling the passages. For being an air marshal Bill did not seem to be very good at it. I known he was supposed to be a former drunk but still\u2026\r\n\r\nIt is still a decent enough movie though which rolls on at a reasonably decent pace. I never really felt compelled to pick up my tablet and start to read something while waiting for the boring parts to pass as have happened with a few other movies. Well, at least not very often. It is not really an action movie though and the scene at the poster is pretty much the only high-octane action scene in the entire movie which was also a bit disappointing. Sure, there are some quite good fights between Bill and various other characters but I would still put this movie more in the thriller genre than in the action one.\r\n\r\nThe media jerks and the way people seemed to control things outside, or rather not control things, the plane was also really frustrating. I would really have sued the arses of those media dicks afterwards given how they downright slandered both Bill and air marshals in general without any real proof. What happened with innocent until proven guilty. Oh, yeah right, I forgot, that has no meaning to todays media people.\r\n\r\nSadly enough the thriller part never got that thrilling either. I feel this is due to the rather clumsy way that Bill went about things most of the time. He never really gave a professional appearance. This goes for the cop that happened to be on the plane as well by the way. I felt he was really behaving just like some scared member of a mob rather than a trained professional. When the villain was finally exposed and the reasons for the events where explained. Well, let us just say that I went \u201cmeh\u201d at that point. On the good side Liam Neeson did make a rather good performance given the kind of script he had to work with.\r\n\r\nOn the whole it is an okay movie though which is worthwhile to watch but, as I wrote, I had my hopes set a notch higher.","id":"53b8ed930e0a2676b8008b11","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53b8ed930e0a2676b8008b11","movie_id":225574}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The movie intended to deliver a fine message.\r\n\r\nBased on the true story of Christina Noble, a charity worker from Ireland who went to Vietnam to help the street kids. This movie follows the stories from two different timelines. It opened with Noble's childhood days, from her struggling family to how she lost everything. Wanted to be a singer, but her terrible childhood turned her dream upside down and finally ended up in Vietnam finding her way to give children who needed love and care. Beside her intention was that no one should go through like she did.\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful and inspiring story, but the movie was not great. Because the stars and crews were not well known, but their contribution must be appreciated to spotlight this great lady, Chritina Noble. It also won some prestigious international awards as to recognising its valuable message. This British movie was written and directed by the husband of actress who portrayed in the title role. It is not an entertaining movie, but just like documentary films it was filled with strong contents that makes it must not be missed.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"56e6f9d3c3a3685a9e00aea4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56e6f9d3c3a3685a9e00aea4","movie_id":192767}
{"author":"Gimly","content":"**A long form review originally posted n 2014:**\r\n\r\nNow that I\u2019ve given _Guardians_ a BluRay watch through, I feel more comfortable reviewing it. I saw it on the first day of its Australian cinematic release, but I wasn\u2019t sure what I thought. I watched it again and still wasn\u2019t sure, but now that it\u2019s six months later, I am sure.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a massive fan of director James Gunn. Come to think of it, I\u2019m also also a big fan of Lee Pace, Michael Rooker, Chris Pratt, Benicio Del Toro, Djimon Honsou, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Peter Serafinowicz, Alexis Denisof, Rob Zombie and Nathan Fillion, and they\u2019re all in this. Not to mention I\u2019m an absolute sucker for the MCU. So after hearing that a very decent chunk of the fanbase thinking that not only was this the best Marvel film of the year (going up against _Winter Soldier_ and _Days of Future Past_), but that they would then go on to say it was the best Marvel Cinematic Universe film ever, you could imagine I was very surprised to find that I actually didn\u2019t think it was all that great.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want people thinking I didn\u2019t like it. I did. In fact I will go on record saying that it was miles away from their worst film, and if I\u2019m being honest they handled the last 25 minutes (arguably the most important part) of the film absolutely spectacularly. But I didn\u2019t get the magic that everyone was telling me about. How this was the film for the new generation.  I didn\u2019t even get the sense of satisfaction that I had in Cap\u2019s movie just a few months previous.\r\n\r\nSo many things seemed under utilised, but I don\u2019t know what you could have cut to make room for the extra things I wanted. Which means the only way to get it is to have a longer film. It\u2019s already two hours, and a longer movie means a bigger budget and less screenings. ie. more money going out and less money coming in. And at the end of the day Disney is a business, and they have to make their money the best way they think they can. So I understand why it wasn\u2019t perfect for me, but that doesn\u2019t stop me from feeling _Guardians_ is a mite overrated. Good damn movie. But overrated.\r\n\r\nPersonally I\u2019d stick it somewhere in the middle of the MCU\u2019s releases thus far. Leaps and bounds above _The Incredible Hulk_, _The Dark World_ and _Iron Man 2_, but not so beloved as the likes of _The Avengers_, _Winter Soldier_ or _Iron Man 1_.\r\n\r\n73%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_","id":"5b1676510e0a262de801570b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b1676510e0a262de801570b","movie_id":118340}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This movie is more of a comedy than anything else. It is truly a comic magazine brought to life on the big screen and more focused on delivering a sequence of action scenes and laughs than anything intelligent in the form of plot or characters. I would say it is a movie for the younger audience and comic fans. Having said that I must admit that I found it rather fun to watch.\r\n\r\nThe main characters are two mostly irresponsible rascals, one dumb but likable living tree and two fanatics of which one certainly need not apply to the Mensa club. Of the five I liked Rocket and Gamora the best. Rocket is a rather likable rascal and Gamora is simply cool. Quill is sometimes just silly, Groot is more of a living prop and Drax is just too stupid.\r\n\r\nThe story is more or less just there to tie the scenes together. Unfortunately we do really not get much of a background to the Guardians of The Galaxy universe. It would have been nice to get a bit more understanding of why things are as they are etc. The return of this movie is watching the action, the special effects and the laughs. It is an action-adventure-comedy plain and simple. If you approach it as such it works reasonably well.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of special effects, they are generally well done. The designs are interesting. The shape of the bad guys spaceship is totally ludicrous of course but visually pleasing and goes with the rest of the movie\u2019s tendency to be more of a comedy than a serious movie. The same can be said for that cool but weird net they made by interlinking fighter crafts.\r\n\r\nOn the whole an entertaining movie. I have to say that the dancing scene at the end was a wee bit too silly for me though. I have a problem understanding how a movie like this can get such a relatively high rating at IMDb but okay it was fun to watch and it is not entirely undeserved. Personally I think a 7 out of 10 is more in the right region.\r\n\r\nSHARE THIS:","id":"5a62d0e59251410b1a005f0e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a62d0e59251410b1a005f0e","movie_id":118340}

Indeed, it was about Alex, a middle age working and married woman with a young son. Her husband who takes care of the household, is now deserted them. So in her busy working life, Alex comes to realise the family bonding, particularly with her son. Then there's her dad and sister who are a troublemaker than any useful.

Mary Elizabeth was very good and so the rest of them. This is not an unexpected film, but with its limits it had narrated a fine story. The ratings are not fair.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Set in the late 1930s and mid 1940s in a quaint village in Palakkad, Namma Gramam is an attempt to showcase the social transgressions of the period, especially among the Brahmin communities. Women in this world are mere objects of gratification, and if they are widowed, they are almost pariahs, child marriage is a reality and untouchability is a way of life.\r\n\r\nActor-turned-director Mohan Sharma uses India itself as a metaphor for the plight of his lead character Thulasi, a child bride who becomes a widow the very next day after her marriage. Like the country, which is under British rule, Thulasi's life too is determined by her immoral uncle, Subramani, the patriarch of the household and the bigwig in the village. He is a haughty individual who likes everyone to dance to his whims and fancies, and an abusive father to his righteous son Kannan. He is a hypocrite as well who will advocate the tonsuring of his little niece under the pretense of societal backlash but will unashamedly maintain a concubine.\r\n\r\nThe only character who stands up to Subramani is his widowed mother who tries to protect Thulasi even if it means sacrificing her own life. She is the film's moral centre and the late Sukumari (who won the National Award for Best Supporting Actress for this role) effectively captures the spirit of this character \u2014 she knows she cannot change everything that is wrong about the society but does her best. She detests her son for his ways and knows that the women in her family (including her daughter and her bedridden husband) will always have to depend on him, and yet she stands up to him whenever she can to protect Thulasi.\r\n\r\nThe film moves at a languid pace and the scripts course is predictable to an extent but Mohan Sharma manages to keep things from turning dull. He populates this world with a few interesting characters \u2014 a mentally unstable woman who passes comments (which are sometimes lewd) on the characters and their problems, a nationalistic school master who is impotent, and even a flatulent neighbour, who is used for the lighter scenes. One of these characters in fact kindles Kannan's interest in Thulasi. Mohan, who seems to have a fascination for metaphors, underscores this with a man lighting a street lamp in the foreground. In a nice little touch, Thulasi's liberation too happens exactly on the day of India's freedom. But then, at times, the director does go overboard with his allegories. When Thulasi moves out of the house in the end, he has her free a caged parrot!\r\n\r\nThe chief problem with the film is that the lead character is underwritten. We have to be angered seeing Thulasi's plight but we only empathise with her. Yes it is a male dominated world, but Thulasi is shown as too passive. We accept her crying over her fate as a girl but even after she grows into woman, we never get a scene where she questions society's treatment of her. The arc involving the concubine too is vague. Her husband has apparently disappeared after going to Burma some years ago but we do not get her dilemma when there is an effort to trace her missing husband. She is always shown as a woman who is eager to please Subramani in bed.","id":"53bb1595c3a368662e0001a8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bb1595c3a368662e0001a8","movie_id":267690}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Duraipandi and Arunachalam have a history but Dhanam, Duraipandi's sister, wants her son Nalan to marry Nandhini, Arunachalam's daughter. However, the enmity between the two men worsens. Meanwhile, Nalan and Nandhini, who have grown having feelings for each other get married. The two families refuse to accept them and the newlyweds relocate to Chennai. Can they make it big in the city? Will they bring their two families together?\r\n\r\nWith a debut work, we expect some amount of freshness, be it in the idea or in presentation. But for his first film, Venkatesan takes up plots that Tamil audiences are very much used to. The film is split into two segments, with the interval being the median. In the first half, we are introduced to the characters in Duraipandi and Arunachalam's household and through the title song, the director establishes the characteristics and equations between these characters. But rather than dive straight into the story, Venkatesan gives us almost an hour of needless padding in the form of listless comedy by Soori and Rinson. There is romance as well, but a very much watered down new-age rural romance.\r\n\r\nThankfully, something happens at last when Duraipandi and Arunachalam have a public fallout and the director cranks up the tension by getting Nalan and Nandhini married. And, only then, Venkatesan reveals his true intentions \u2014 the film is not really about the two older men but about Nalanum Nandhiniyum! The second half, set in Chennai, turns into a wish fulfillment fantasy \u2014 the story of a couple who struggle for a bit in the city before striking it rich. The film is content to coast on feel good moments and melodrama bordering on implausibility. Nalan is a carefree young man and the onus of running the family falls on Nandhini, who takes up the job of a teacher. He whiles away the time while she works but once she becomes pregnant, he discovers responsibility just like that! And, what better place can make your problems vanish overnight than the film industry? So, we get a sub-plot about Nalan trying (and of course, succeeding) to become a director. This also provides the director to pay his respects to his guru \u2014 Venkat Prabhu.\r\n\r\nNalanum Nandhiniyum isn't a bad film per se but it is definitely an indifferent one. If the first half suffers from the serial-like treatment, you could dub the second half portions as Vikraman lite (Nalan even narrates a story about four friends, Vikraman's familiar trope, to a director). At times, the film seems to be somewhat autobiographical and given that first-time filmmakers often tend to put incidents from their lives into their films, you cannot discount the notion. What lets the film down, apart from the simplistic writing (Nandhini, for example, isn't really bothered that Nalan is living off her), is that there are hardly any challenges and even when there is sign of a likely struggle (like, when both Nalan and Nandhini are jobless after her pregnancy), it is brushed away with easy resolutions.","id":"53c472e3c3a368246b000153","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53c472e3c3a368246b000153","movie_id":263492}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Forget the narcolepsy; forget the lip-lock controversy (on which reams have been written about). Naan Sigappu Manithan is first and foremost a tale of one man's quest for revenge. If Thiru's previous film, Samar, had the hero searching for the mysterious adversaries who were shaping his life, Naan Sigappu Manithan has the hero hunting for the unknown assailants who have raped and maimed his lover. As in Ghajini, whose formula this film faithfully follows to some extent, the film tries to camouflage the generic nature of its plot by giving its hero a fanciful medical condition; if it was short term memory loss in the former, here, it is narcolepsy. \r\n\r\nThiru actually builds a solid first half building on this sleep disorder, using it to fuel the film's humour, romance and interval twist. Like a guide, he takes us through the life of the narcoleptic Indran ( Vishal) and we see how the medical condition has influenced his life \u2014 at job interviews, he falls asleep on being told he has been selected; we learn he fainted after a classmate proposed to him in school; his incapability to have sex becomes a cause for amusement at a college demonstration; he always needs a 'driver' (Jagan slipping into the role of the hero's witty friend) to be taken to places; and, in a rare occasion when he decides to venture out alone, a blast of a vehicle's horn leaves him sleeping in the middle of the road, which also leads to him getting acquainted with Meera ( Lakshmi Menon, playing the angel to this 'flawed' hero). These scenes, in addition to Saranya Ponvannan's yet another naive mom act, contribute to the lighter moments in the film, and Thiru endears us to the characters that populate Indran's world. \r\n\r\nWhile Ghajini's hero tattooed his body to aid his memory, Indran, here, writes down a list of things \u2014 from staying awake all day to kissing a girl and even watching a Shakeela film first day, first show \u2014 that he cannot (but yearns to) do. And, after Meera enters his life, he manages to strike out many of these items, and when we realize that he only has the last one \u2014 to fight for the right \u2014 remaining, we anticipate how this twist will arrive. And, it unfolds when mysterious men intercept their car atop an unfinished flyover. Indran panics and goes into sleep, while Meera, who is now pregnant with their child is gang raped. Now, she becomes the sleeper as she gets into a coma, and Indran decides to hunt down the assailants and avenge her. But, can he, with his medical condition? \r\n\r\nThere is intelligence in this script, like the hero's name which actually tells us about the one element that can neutralize his condition (which results in a cleverly done romantic scene with Meera and Indran) but Thiru slips quite a bit in the second half as he goes for one twist too many in explaining why Meera is attacked. So, we get a back story about one of Indran's friends involving adultery and blackmail, but the entire segment ends up being unintentionally funny because of the Wild Things-like manner in which characters change colours and the unconvincing performances of the miscast actors involved. Even the climax, despite featuring a couple of gory deaths, fails to fully capture Indran's rage towards the villains for maiming his lover, and what we are left with is a feeling of mild discontent, as a promising premise is compromised for a generic revenge drama.","id":"53baafda0e0a2676c700c0ea","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baafda0e0a2676c700c0ea","movie_id":240865}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"There is juicy melodrama in-built in the story of Naan Than Bala but the writing and direction are plain amateurish. The trouble is that the director, Kannan, never really has a grip on this material. Bala might be the good guy here but the central character should have been Poochi and the drama should have arisen from his two relationships \u2014 one with Kaatooraan, the man who raised him from childhood and treats him as a member of his family, and the other with Bala, who opens his eyes and shows him the error of his ways. This would have made Naan Than Bala a far more interesting film. We never really get a real sense of the Poochi-Kaatooran dynamics because Kannan has made Bala his protagonist. Kaatooran's character, in fact, is terribly underwritten \u2014 one moment he seems to be Poochi's mentor and guardian (he is introduced in a scene in which he forces a relative to step aside for Poochi at a family function) and the next, he is shown as someone who is just using the guy as a tool heeding the words of his greedy wife.\r\n\r\nKannan's treatment of this material is at best TV serial melodrama. When the heroine and her family go to Bala to plead with him to move away from Poochi, they say \"Vedham padicha neengale vedhanaya tharalama\". Such lines would have been acceptable in the 60s but here, they seem exactly like the discarded relic from the past that it is. Similarly, when Bala visits the house of his lawyer, who is a Dalit, we see a photo of Dr Ambedkar that is hung outside the house! And, when Bala the Brahmin drinks their water, the director cuts to a close-up of the photo.\r\n\r\nThe one scene where we really get a sense of what this could have been is the scene where Bala confronts Poochi and makes him see how he has been taking the wrong path all along. This is also where Vivekh shows that he can also handle serious drama. The rest of the time, he is forced to play a caricature, that of a naive and diffident young man, which is clearly not who Bala is, and all we get is a comparable version of the timid character that he played in Alaipayuthey. And, when the character starts spouting Sanskrit mantras at dramatic moments, it only feels unintentionally funny. The only take away for us is the earnest effort that the actor has put in to play this role.","id":"53baab4b0e0a263588002ac7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baab4b0e0a263588002ac7","movie_id":275296}

{"author":"Reno","content":"A Korean comedy-fantasy. One of the most admired senior actors by me from the Korean film industry is that Na Moon-Hee. So far I have watched some of her films and loved all of them. The title says it is her movie, but she did not stay much longer as the script demanded replacement after the opening few minutes.\r\n\r\nIf you know the movie's synopsis you will understand that it is a theme kind of switching back to younger ages. Yes, like the movie 'Big'. In her parts which were the opening portions she put a great performance. After that, the young 'Sunny' girl took over the role and led to another level of entertainment filled with music and fun. Her performance and expressions were so good like her previous movie.\r\n\r\n> _**_''That's why I want to take a photograph now. Before I grow more ugly.''_**_\r\n\r\nAs we know, the concept was too old, but the story wasn't, especially if you are a regular Hollywood movie viewer you would know that. But, surprisingly, this movie was enriched mainly because of the Korean flavor with the usual melodrama and a little clich\u00e9 at some point. It was not a special movie and offers nothing new if you are familiar with Korean films. Because they applied usual Korean movie style of fun to present the story. The story was kind of predictable and that does not stop you from getting entertained.\r\n\r\nWhat fascinated me about this movie was the end. The solution at the final act was well designed to fit for a movie with a concept like this to end in a better way. And further, a clean open for a possible sequel generates eagerness among the viewers if they had liked so far of the movie. It is nothing more than having a good time, which offers a little inspiration about our dream and family value. A good Korean movie, the family type movie, but everyone can enjoy it.\r\n\r\n7.5\/10","id":"54208c0e0e0a26578800018b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54208c0e0e0a26578800018b","movie_id":253065}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Never fear... Miss Meadows is here.**\r\n\r\nThis is not the film everybody was expecting. But not bad to try after coming to know it. It is a black comedy, about a young single woman, a substitute elementary school teacher who moved to a new neighbourhood. She has no limit for her imaginations. Her world was full of wondrous, but there's a little dark secret too. Later, when she comes to face a big hurdle, how she's going to handle her new boyfriend who is a cop and from there where it heads was revealed.\r\n\r\nIt was a Katie Holmes' show. It was a short film, but she was always there, the camera always with her. I'm seeing her film after a long time. She looks a bit old for this role, but worked well. The supporting cast was okay though. That little girl from 'Girl Meets World, Ava, was good. The film looks okay for all ages, but slightly violent with killing and other crime exposing scenes. Especially it is not for young kids, despite the film theme looks a bit magical. So it should be PG13.\r\n\r\nA decent writing and direction. The whole film was shot within two and half weeks. Because the story was simple, that takes place in the limited enclosures. So the experience of watching it was like a television film, but it is not. You might have seen some of the similar films, but still it is worth a watch. Not deliberately going for it, though when you ran out of the options.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"58c1e7c9c3a3683858000183","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c1e7c9c3a3683858000183","movie_id":261037}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> In the dark hours where everything's so alive.\r\n\r\nBased on the manga series of the same name. A movie about a chef, foods and his small restaurant that opens at midnight till the dawn. There are random scenes with fresh characters all along, but it also centres on a set of few particular characters to stabilise the development. Whatsoever the tale sticks around the restaurant and reveals every happenings, no matter what characters they are.\r\n\r\nA very fun, realistic, calm narration, with cool characters. Anyone slurping their food around me really annoys, but that's the way of pleasurably consuming food among the east Asians, especially that makes me my mouth-watering. So I suggest you better have some snacks with, at least you will have something with you while watching this delicious movie.\r\n\r\nInitially I did not know whose story it was, but a chef began to narrate his story by telling about his tiny restaurant located somewhere in the middle of partially both residential and commercial areas. And his unique customers with their stories that definitely gets our attention. In the meantime a young female character was introduced who is going to be a prime focus for the rest of the film that told alternately with other small happenings around.\r\n\r\n> \"Don't let your tears enter the stew pot. Tears is salt after all. It will change the taste.\"\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether it was the great performances or the writing and direction that brought a soul to it, but overall it was so simple and very likeable film that looks like kind of everything worked so finely. Of course the cultural influence was a big impact. The society, its people with their state of mind and lifestyle - totally moving. Other than the whaling, I don't see the reasons to I hate this beautiful country and its people. I think that's why I loved this film like usual and it is one of my favourite film industry.\r\n\r\nImpressive, how the customers respect their chef by calling him master. I have seen the actor who played that important role in the movie 'Quill'. He was excellent in this with his casual effort. There's no way to predict anything from the movie. It would be like you go and sit in a small restaurant near you for a whole day, interacting with every customer who gets in with their story of the day with all kinds of moods, that's how watching this film feels like with surprises.\r\n\r\nThose who read the original manga and those who saw the television series might have reason to compare with this to bring some positive and negative points, but as I'm not familiar with other material, I ended with very happy for this.\r\n\r\nThe runtime really scared me, but once sat for it, I spent those two hours without any trouble. This kind of storytelling really suits for television to split into plenty of episodes, but the movie was equally amazing and can be compared to any top movies related to 'food, chef and restaurant' themes. This was a great drama with fine humours. I want to suggest it and I surely do, especially for those who love drama films with a moderate pace.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"570fc8c19251412c510000c2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/570fc8c19251412c510000c2","movie_id":309028}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The consequence of the WWII on the two Japanese children.\r\n\r\nThe latest Japanese anime, based on the fictional account. Following the Japan's surrender during the World War II, the narration concentrates how the people are affected by the consequences of the war.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"The hero of Damaal Dumeel lives life comfortably \u2014 he has a high-paying job (project lead in a software company); lives in a posh, tastefully decorated rented apartment; has his own house in another town where his mom and sister live; has plans to conduct the wedding of his sister with no expenses spared; and, has a good-looking girlfriend. He also believes in numerology and astrology \u2014 he has named himself Moneykandan (Vaibhav, a little bland for this role) to invite wealth; every morning, he gets astrology alerts on his mobile phone, and even dresses accordingly. He is also a little self-centred \u2014when he comes across a news item on TV where the IT crowd is blamed for the all-round rise in prices, he just tells himself that they are jealous and skips the channel. In other words, an ordinary young man with desires that most of us can identify with.\r\n\r\nEverything is going great for Money but his cocooned world comes crashing down when he is fired out of the blue. He is worried about all his financial commitments (in a niftily shot scene, the director shows this with the faces of everyone from the landlord to the head-scratching watchman asking his for money) and to top it, his girlfriend, Meera (Remya Nambeesan, in a rather short role), tells him that her father would like to meet him.\r\n\r\nIt is in such a scenario that Moneykandan finds a mysterious box at his doorstep. He opens it up only to discover bundles of cash. He plans to it to himself but little does he know that the box belongs to the notorious gangster, Ilavarasu, who has sent it for his friend Meenakshisundaram, a counterfeit drug maker who is on the run from the cops. With the henchmen of both these criminals now after him, Money plans a quick getaway to a foreign country. But that proves easier said than done.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with Damaal Dumeel is that it is a little late to the party. Black comedy as a genre was a trend in 2013 and we have had a handful of such films in recent times (Soodhu Kavvum, Neram, Moodar Koodam, to name a few) that we are only too familiar with the elements \u2014 grey-shaded leading man, cash, rival gangs, cops, confusion, shootout. So, we are able to sort of sense how this story is going to unfold; we know the criminals will be confounded, we know there will be a climatic shootout and Money will walk away from it unscathed. The director even begins the film with the end as we see a hooded figure placing cash in plastic covers and walking away with them. And, when we hear the ringtone in the hero's phone (the sound of gun shots), we instinctively understand that it will play a role at a later moment, which it does.\r\n\r\nStill, as a first film, Damaal Dumeel is a worthy attempt. Right in the opening shot \u2014 a burning match falling down in slow motion and its flames engulfing a document \u2014 we realize that we are in the hands of a competent filmmaker and Shree keeps things moving at a brisk pace till the end. Even the romantic track is used only in small doses and the director doesn't allow a possible melancholic moment to linger. The actors who play the henchmen and the cop in Money's apartment are apt in their roles. Though both Kota Srinivasa Rao and Sayaji Shinde never convey any menace, we get some humour at their expense. Though, the film never becomes the sum of its interesting parts as the screwball nature of the plot isn't fully exploited. There is a nice point made in the end on how money can change a man overnight but it doesn't really come across as effectively as it should as Vaibhav, though he looks the part, is a little bland in the role; an actor with a better range would have conveyed Moneykandan's descent to the darker side in a much better way.","id":"53baafa00e0a2676bb00bc59","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baafa00e0a2676bb00bc59","movie_id":263434}

Despite 90 minute film, there were empty in the middle of the narration. Or you can call it a drag. It started off quite good, revealing about two childhood friends growing together towards the end of the high school. Then suddenly everything changes between them when one of them declares to another that he's a gay. Following that, all the pros and cons of how their future relationship would be were told.\r\n\r\nFamily too has some part, but it was focused from a friend's perspect how unexpectedly the things would change in such situation. There was some fun, though not that great. Actors were nice, and so the direction, even though the script was taken out from the blacklist. I think averagely worked out. With usual teenage film cliches, still enjoyable one. Maybe by the youngsters. For the rest, it is good to watch as a timepass flick, otherwise not worth it.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"5a771683925141059c0447e4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a771683925141059c0447e4","movie_id":99367}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Two worlds within a world, fighting the darkness.**\r\n\r\nFrance is only next to the Hollywood when it comes to the 3D animation. Not sufficient films were made in this format, but still the quality and creativity are laudable. When I saw one of this film's poster, not just for me, but anybody would think of the Na'vi from 'Avatar'. That's a misconception, only until you watch this film. Because it was totally different and awesome. Directed by two not very well known filmmakers, but their firsthand experience prior to this might have helped them for this project.\r\n\r\nLike in any animation films, this tale takes place in a fictional world. The story of legends of the guardians of the sun and moon. Both of those heavenly bodies were created and guarded by ancestors for generations of the two races to keep the planet in peace and harmony. A youngster named Mune, from the night world was accidentally chosen as the keeper of the moon during the ceremony to hand over the guardianship. While it was a successful in power transfer on the day world to another youngster, Sohone.\r\n\r\nThe two youngsters eager to dedicate their lives to keep the order of the ancient practice. On his first day of duty, Mune messes up everything, followed by Necross, from the darkness who hidden underground for the centuries tries to bring chaos. Now, a girl who lives on the border of the day and the night joins those two to a quest to retrieve what is lost. Facing a tough challenge by an evil opponent, these three has to do impossibles. Meanwhile, it is an opportunity for them to prove themselves to their capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe creativity was brilliant. Those characters, settings, story and its developments, so genuinely done. Not just Disney or Pixar, totally Hollywood got a close competition here. Quality films like this, 'The Little Prince' and 'Asterix', can help to grow French animation industry faster and to the standards. Especially this film was short and sweet. Despite a beautiful imaginary world, the storyline was pretty much clich\u00e9d, like the same old formula applied to a bunch of new characters.\r\n\r\n> \"What? You think adventure is to fly a unicorn! And to go with the elves? Bad news! We do not live in a fairy tale.\"\r\n\r\nI mean like any fantasy film, there's always something bad happens in the opening and the remaining is trying to resolve it, which are mostly a lifetime journey for them. We know that as an outline, but not in the pictures, so that's why we watch it. There's also nothing wrong in that, but how smartly the film narrates its story remain pivotal to calculate its success and according to me it fared so well. I hope you would think it that way as well after watching it.\r\n\r\nVery much a kids film, but I don't see a reason why grown ups should avoid it. In fact, this kind of stories are created by the adults with their imagination and that is not easily done work. You can compare it to our real world. Like how different races can live together peacefully. Besides, between two worlds, there's also a thin world exist that separates these two worlds, as well as unifies. As much you enjoy watching it, you will admire what they are doing and for why. Such an inspiration, particularly for the children.\r\n\r\nThe parts of the film were comparable with other popular animations around the world, but not entirely, only the small portions. Maybe because of creative common, but I think the writers had done an incredible job with the screenplay, especially when there's no original source like perhaps a book. I watched it a little late, but the point is I did not miss it. I laid my eyes on it a very long ago, but could not get the right time till now.\r\n\r\nIt's a great relief, moreover, I loved it. Well composed music, the background score was perfectly matched with the visuals which so colourful and attractive. The film also won a couple of international awards. I hope they make a sequel for this. Usual that does not happen in French animation, also the box office result is not in its favour. I think it is slightly an under-appreciated, but definitely an under-recognised film. So it needs your support, if you're an animation fan, you should try it. It was just like another Hollywood film, but was in the French Language. I say go for it!\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"5844651e92514166ba00beee","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5844651e92514166ba00beee","movie_id":323661}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Mundasupatti is one heady cocktail when it comes to the genres that the film dabbles in. It is a sci-fi (a meteorite hits a village), a rural drama (the meteorite becomes the deity of a village), a mystery (the space rock goes missing), a period film (the story happens in 1982, with a prelude set in 1947), and of course, there is a romance as well. But it is primarily a comedy. Director Ram Kumar, who is the latest promising find from the TV show Naalaya Iyakkunar, certainly knows how to end a joke with a punchline. In an early scene, we see Gopi, the film's protagonist, lining up a family which has come to his photo studio to have their photograph taken. As he is about to click, his assistant Azhagumani comes with tickets to a newly-released film (this time, it isn't Rajinikanth and Murattu Kaalai, the usual touchstones for period films set in the 80s, but Kamal Haasan and Sagalakala Vallavan), and the two scoot off without taking the photograph to the theatre. But the joke doesn't end there. We see the Gopi and Azhagu having a gala time at the cinema and it is only when they return to the studio in the night, we get the final part of this joke \u2014 the family is still there holding their pose! If we had merely been smiling at Gopi's travails in getting the family to pose in the earlier segment, now, we instantly burst into a laugh.\r\n\r\nLike Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom, Mundasupatti, too, is built on a one-note premise \u2014 a village and its peculiar superstitions (having photographs taken is bad omen, a deity and the place's lucky charm; if it was a horse that is deified in Azhagarsamiyin Kuthirai, here, a space rock becomes Vaana Muni) \u2014 and the variations on this single theme. We laugh when we see that the villagers allow only their dead to be photographed and frame and hang these photos on their walls in memory of the departed. We laugh when we see them refusing to even be in the room when a photograph is being taken. We laugh when both a husband and wife bribe the hero to take a photograph of their spouse so that he\/she will depart. And, we laugh when they run for their lives when the hero brandishes the camera when he is being chased.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the gags and jokes don't come at the expense of the filmmaking, as it so often happens in our comedies, which seem flatly shot and hastily staged. Here, there is enough craft on display to make us appreciate the aesthetics, like the sequence where Gopi and Azhagu outwit the henchmen of a zamindar (who hopes to steal the invaluable meteorite for an Englishman), which is stylishly staged. The cheerful score and the lovely camerawork only enhance the effect.\r\n\r\nThe actors, too, are up to the task. Vishnu Vishal, who was last seen in Neerparavai (2012), shows that he has a flair for comedy as well and makes Gopi very relatable. As his sidekick, Kaali Venkat is a scene stealer, while, Ramadas, despite being a little over-the-top, keeps the laughs coming as the wannabe film star Munishkanth. His reaction when he realizes that he has been duped by Gopi and Azhagu is hilarious. Nandita doesn't have much to do but veteran Anandaraj makes a fine return to the screen as the impotent zamindar. His character keeps numerous cats in his place and you will definitely chuckle when you know why.\r\n\r\nAgreed the film is a tad overlong (the climax is clearly extended for the sake of packing in a few more jokes) and some of the comedy feels repetitive but Ram Kumar manages to keep things playful and entertaining at all times (even a scene where a thief is meted out punishment is treated in a lighter vein) that we look past some of the indulgences.","id":"53baab300e0a2676c400bd36","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baab300e0a2676c400bd36","movie_id":270772}

None of them can figure out what happened to the people and they don\u2019t have enough gas to leave, so they\u2019re stuck. The cast is headed by Brian Austin Green (Jack), Zack Ward (Alex), Mena Suvari (Tracy) and Joanne Kelly (Claire).\r\n\r\nParts of \"Don\u2019t Blink\" (2014) bring to mind movies like \u201cNight of the Living Dead\" (1968), \"The Mist\" (2007), \"Phantoms\" (1998) and \"Donner Pass\" (2011) with an ending that recalls \u201cWind Chill\u201d (2007). But it\u2019s by far the least of these because, while the mysterious set-up is good for about the first 35-40 minutes, it becomes one-dimensional and predictable, e.g. when the young guy kneels down behind the bar. \r\n\r\nAnother flaw is that some of the dramatics feel forced and awkward, like the girl unconvincingly morphing into a preacher. Those other movies didn't have this problem because they had superior writers\/filmmakers.\r\n\r\nThere are 3-4 worthy women in the cast, including Suvari, Fiona Gubelmann (Ella) and Samantha Jacober (Charlotte), but the director\/writer never really takes advantage of their presence, but he did good enough, I guess.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in Ruidoso, New Mexico, USA.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C\r\n\r\n***SPOILERS*** (Don\u2019t read unless you\u2019ve seen the movie):\r\n\r\nIt might help to see the movie as a microcosm of death in our lives: Everyone and everything around us will eventually die one-by-one, so quick & unexpected it's like the blink of an eye.

{"author":"Reno","content":"The third time this pair had come together for a movie and it does not look good at all. The movie can be enjoyed for its comedy, not for anyone's performance. The location (South Africa) was good, but not exposed well, instead make fun out of it which was expected.\r\n\r\nIn earlier days I used laugh out loud for Sandler's jokes, he's not the same guy anymore, I barely smile now. And for Barrymore, she was one of my actresses (I believe still she's), but her recent movies are disappointing, or barely in entertainment business. Kind of attractive Bella Thorne in a tomboyish getup, hope to see her in many future projects.\r\n\r\nI heard that Dale Steyn does a cameo for a Hollywood and I did not know it was this movie until I saw him. He's a rock-star on the pitch, but when Sandler made fun out of him that irked me and then let it go as it just a silly movie. Like the old days' animation shorts for the TV, this film had collective pieces of comedic scenes. Individually very entertaining, but as a movie fails to assemble. Not for everyone, but manageable.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"55185a5d9251416f0d004ac3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55185a5d9251416f0d004ac3","movie_id":232672}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Emotional dispute for an innocent young soul.\r\n\r\nOne of the beautiful melodrama of the year. It is a partial courtroom drama and it was about a biracial kid, whose grandparents fight to own the custody. Obviously a sensitive matter, but incredibly written screenplay that balanced both the ways. Such kind of theme is always welcomed, but in this case, again, those critics behind ruining the movie. Should have been in the Oscar race in any category, but it didn't. The reason is simple, about famous people and histories always have the edge over the fictional works in the film world.\r\n\r\nChild custody battle is a most familiar theme, but not a very common. In this, the characters are so special, made a huge difference with an interesting opening plot. At some point I felt scenes were very intensified and old fashioned, but the story and dialogues were not. Lots of emotional scenes involved right from the first frame itself. Especially one of the courtroom scene in the third act which was a turning point in the story was so touching. The families are definitely going to love that particular part.\r\n\r\n> \"Well, there are certain things a man can do,\r\n> certain thing a woman can do.\"\r\n\r\nTop notch performances, especially the Kevin Costner, and Octavia Spencer in some crucial parts. Apart from them it has some cheerful humours. A movie that is not pinpointing the mistakes of the past like some of the recent films depicted, but looking forward to the future and unifying by removing fences. As a living creature, the conflict within is not an invalid, even non-living substances do have when they come together in the form of chemical reaction. So as we're civilised, it must be minimised. Happy or sad ending, it does not matter, because it is simply delivering a message about the difference between good and bad.\r\n\r\nThe kid was the centre of the story formation, but the screenplay did not designed her to dominate. Because her presence was the vital than to display stunning performance, as it was a conflict between two different racial people. But, how the kid gets affected if the confrontation gets ugly as the story progresses is the point to develop ahead. So that brings the climax, and you should watch the movie to know how it all ends. I would say it is a very underrated movie and needs immediate recognition. It will going to be one of those movies to be praised in the future.\r\n\r\n8\u00bd\/10","id":"561e81c09251415ab100011d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/561e81c09251415ab100011d","movie_id":253331}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Clear the desk and clear the decks.\r\n\r\nThere's a fabled Nazi U-Boat down in the depths of the ocean, aboard is gold, lots of gold. So it's time for a not so motley crew of submariners to go forth - in an antiquated submarine - and try to set themselves up for life. Naturally nothing goes as planned, there are hidden agendas, rival factions within, claustrophobia reigns supreme, will anyone survive? Will you want any of them to survive?\r\n\r\nBlack Sea is not without problems, though the complaints about credibility and believability not being available? Well these are surely from folk who don't watch enough of, or understand the workings of, genre cinema of this ilk. Kevin Macdonald (director) and Dennis Kelly (writer) have crafted a tight and efficient submarine thriller. Characterisations are clich\u00e9d, with nods to other genre type of films evident, but the group dynamics pulse with danger and the inevitable peril sequences strike the requisite suspenseful chords.\r\n\r\nBlack Sea doesn't define or reinvent the submarine thriller wheel, it just keeps the rotor shafts turning. Strong casting and earthy photography help matters, to make this - ropey accents aside - better than a time waster of a viewing. 6.5\/10","id":"563d81a19251417fa9001c03","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/563d81a19251417fa9001c03","movie_id":246080}
{"author":"sitenoise","content":"The film has a few \"sighted\" actors who do a decent job of acting blind, but they stand out because they're better looking than the blind non-actors. (The film gets meta on that point).\r\n\r\nIt starts off like it's going to be about some kid who loses his sight in a car accident and is told it's only temporary. He eventually learns he was lied to and won't get his sight back. He tries, unsuccessfully, to kill himself. This part is narrated in voice-over by a (non-character) woman who also reads the opening credit roll and returns throughout. Usually films resort to voice-over as a last resort, but it works here. The guy takes a job at a massage establishment run by two blind men and staffed by all blind or partially blind people. The film then morphs into an ensemble piece about several of them: their loves and lusts, not so much their blindness. So it's a film about 'standard' things that go on in the lives of people who happen to be blind. A couple of the blind women steal the show.\r\n\r\nThe amazing (and perhaps frustrating to some) thing about the film is how it does give you an idea of what it's like to be blind. You really get a sense that things are just swirling around rather than being observed. The film's notion of focus is genius. There are lots of truly emotional moments in the film (only slightly off-center from what we're used to because the characters are blind) but they aren't maudlin or melodramatic. They are more darkish, almost creepy. This is no after-school special. There are scenes where the central dialog takes place off camera, or, right when a scene screams for some resolve it's simply dropped. That happens a lot. Very weird. There's scenes where you feel the discomfort for the characters who, during a moment of drama, can't read body language or facial expressions. It punches. Whoever shot this film should win an award. The direction, editing, and cinematography are wildly inventive.\r\n\r\nI didn't get the ending of the film but the last shot is a truly beautiful smile.","id":"55a4789e92514147eb0007d8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55a4789e92514147eb0007d8","movie_id":256106}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Caught in a time loop.**\r\n\r\nYou won't believe this was made by some first timer. Obviously you would find similarity with films like 'Groundhog Day' and 'Edge of Tomorrow' or even with 'The Deaths of Ian Stone', but the point is what makes this one special. Being a B movie makes one of the advantages, but there's no compromise in quality. In fact, it never required any graphics. Everything was managed so well, since it was 95 per cent minimal cast film and takes place in a single isolated location and its surroundings. So what I meant is this is a small gem. If you ever thought of trying B movie, but hesitated for many reasons, so this is the one to pick, especially if you like thrillers.\r\n\r\nThe story narration has the time loop influence. It opened in a drug rehab centre where a youngster named Milton was approached by a beautiful girl Skyler to cook crystal meth for her. So the same night they two breakout with the help of her boyfriend Russell to the woods where they do what they have come for. But the next morning, Milton sees a big change, particularly by Skyler. He never realises that until another next day. For us, the viewers, this is the part to focus as the turning point in the narration.\r\n\r\nSo the day keeps repeating itself as a 24 hour loop from where it all started, but with a different events every day, like giving another chance not knowing why. So they try to figure it out and in a meanwhile, they fall for each other. When one day they think they got a way out, that brings a new trouble as the solution needs a sacrifice or betrayal. Who choose what or is there any other way that told in the remaining film.\r\n\r\n> \"Not a single enemy left. Not a single friend either.\"\r\n\r\nThis theme really needed to be very smart, because most of the viewers to question the flaws. So in a couple of times I said there it goes one, how could they did miss it. But then they proved me wrong in a few minutes later. The writing was so good. He and the director were usually worked on the children's films, but they surprised us with this little gem. Honestly, they deserve to work on the bigger projects with full freedom to execute their creativity. So I am definitely expecting their next feature film would come soon or maybe a follow-up to this.\r\n\r\nMy advice is for you not to underestimate it after seeing its trailer or the poster, or even reading some bad remarks. Like I said, its not a big production's fancy film, but with its limit, it did try its best to give up-to our expectation. So don't mind the actors, actually they were so cool. I thought the lead girl was Daniella Monet, then later realised she's different. She is the girl who fled the village to Rohan after Orcs attached them in the film LOTR. Now she's all grown up and did great in this.\r\n\r\nThis could be easily called an sci-fi-thriller, but according to the story and the direction of its development, surely it belongs to fantasy-thriller. Whatever, don't go for it thinking it is a horror film, if you are a fan of that genre. Because it merely fits with that. Anyway, it is a very entertaining film, the suspense holds for us a very long with the fine pace of the story narration. It is one of the best among the B movies I had seen so far and overall from the time loop themes. I do recommend it, but for the selected people.\r\n\r\n_7.5\/10_","id":"5851a6d7c3a3682f5801907e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5851a6d7c3a3682f5801907e","movie_id":257117}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"Dracula: The dark Superman\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2014 and directed by Gary Shore, \"Dracula Untold\u201d tells the origin of Dracula: In the 15th century Prince Vlad the Impaler (Luke Evans) must protect his small kingdom of Wallachia (in modern-day Romania) from a Turk warlord (Dominic Cooper) who demands a thousand boys from Wallachia & Transylvania, including Vlad\u2019s son. Threatened by the unsurmountable Turk army, Vlad desperately makes a dubious pact with a formidable caged vampire in order to acquire its dark powers and save his family & kingdom. Sarah Gadon plays Vlad\u2019s winsome wife. \r\n\r\nThe producers flirted with the idea of \u201cDracula Untold\u201d being part of Universal\u2019s Dark Universe; and the epilogue of the movie, set in the modern world, suggests this, insinuating a franchise. This idea was dropped, however, and \u201cThe Mummy\u201d (2017) became the first official film in the Dark Universe. In any case, \u201cDracula Untold\u201d was fairly successful at the Box Office, making $56.3 million in North America and $217.1 million worldwide against a cost of $70 million.\r\n\r\nMy title blurb pretty much tells you all you need to know: \u201cDracula Untold\u201d is basically the dark Superman of 15th century Eastern Europe where Dracula wields the power to defeat a thousand-man army. If you like the great prologue to Coppola\u2019s \u201cBram Stoker\u2019s Dracula\u201d (1992), you\u2019ll probably like this movie, which gives several nods to that forerunner. \r\n\r\nThe film LOOKS awesome and has a fine cast. But unlike \u201cBram Stoker\u2019s Dracula,\u201d it\u2019s rapidly paced and doesn\u2019t leave much room to breathe; so the characterizations aren\u2019t quite deep enough. It\u2019s good, but somehow hollow and forgettable. \u201cBram Stoker\u2019s Dracula\u201d was perhaps a little too slow while \u201cDracula Untold\u201d is too hurried. I wish the creators found the happy medium between the two because, with just a little bit more time and attention to detail, it could\u2019ve been great.              \r\n                   \r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot entirely in Northern Ireland.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"That the so called \u201ccritics\u201d at Rotten Tomatoes screws this movie over is not really a surprise. Said \u201ccritics\u201d are usually out of sync with both my opinions and the opinions of most of the viewers which can be seen again from the fact that these people give this movie a 23% rating whereas the actual viewers give it a 60% rating. At lot of \u201cpurists\u201d also seem to take a disliking to this movie. Well, the movie is named Dracula Untold so it should be no surprise that the story would be a new one.\n\nPersonally I found this movie quite enjoyable. Yes it is not the original Dracula story but it is not straying too far from the basic origins and it is really a quite decent story unlike some of the disastrous Hollywood rewrites. The original story claims that Dracula became a vampire during his battles with the Turks and this movie picks up on that and tells the story of how that happened. Unlike most (all?) Dracula movies, Dracula is not really the bad guy but rather the inverse and the movie tells a story about sacrifices and Dracula\u2019s quest to keep some of his humanity, moral and sanity.\n\nIt would not be a Dracula movie without some blood flowing and this movie delivers without overdoing it. Actually the actual bloodsucking stuff is quite played down until the end of the movie. There are a fair amount of fights against the Turks (who are the real bad guys in this movie) though and blood as well as various body parts no longer attached to their proper places does float around quite a bit. The special effects are not forgotten and I quite liked the bat swarms that Dracula commanded during the final fights against the Turks.\n\nI found Luke Evans performance as the prince and unwilling Dracula to be quite good. The rest of the characters were also well played. I am sure that none of them will be nominated for Oscars due to their part in this movie but I have nothing negative to say about their performance.\n\nOn the whole I found this movie quite enjoyable and I definitely disagree with all the people blasting it. I did also quite like the last couple of scenes in modern time at the end which teased of a follow up movie. I would definitely like to see that happen.","id":"5a8c4e8dc3a36862a708acfb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a8c4e8dc3a36862a708acfb","movie_id":49017}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"Fun movie about three moms simply trying to enjoy a harmless night out on the town.\r\n\r\nRELEASED 2011 and directed by The Erwin Brothers, \u201cMoms\u2019 Night Out\u201d is a dramedy about three mothers in Birmingham (Sarah Drew, Patricia Heaton & Andrea Logan White) who go out on the town while their husbands & a friend watch the kids (Sean Astin, Robert Amaya & Kevin Downes). Alex Kendrick plays the pastor and Sammi Hanratty the teen daughter. Trace Adkins appears as a tough biker while David Hunt is on hand as a helpful cabbie. Andrea Logan White plays a friend of the three moms while Harry Shum Jr. appears as her ex-beau. \r\n\r\nThis is a family friendly dramedy with a little edge and slight faith-based elements (limited to one comical church scene and one exchange at the end). The \"inept dad\" theme is tiresome and unrealistic (it seemed to me like the children lacked discipline). But there are some gems to mine, like the female lead being overwhelmed by her own doing. In short, she set an absurd standard for herself and labored under her self-imposed expectations.\r\n\r\nThe church bathroom scene is hilarious. Have you ever had a meltdown over something trivial due to pent-up frustration and were embarrassed to discover that someone saw\/heard you? There\u2019s another laugh-out-loud sequence when someone is innocently doing something, which is inadvertently telegraphed to a bunch of others, but offering the wrong impression.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: This is a fun movie with several genuinely humorous moments and a lil\u2019 bit of mind\/spirit food.   \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hours 38 minutes and was shot in Birmingham, Alabama, and Pelham, which is just South.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Fighting terrorist in the midst of monsters invasion.**\r\n\r\nI am surprised for the production quality. It was comparable to those big productions, so no doubt the visuals played its part accurately. Then what makes this film bad? Well, the story is the biggest issue here. It is a confusion screenplay, not for the viewers, but seems for the writers. Looks they don't know how to develop and end it with their decent opening. It was more focused on the military operation than conflict between the man and the monsters. How come when monsters taking over the earth is not considered a threat, but fighting terrorism becomes the main preference. The same thing applies to the terrorists as well.\r\n\r\nNo way near to the original. In fact, I don't know is it appropriate to tag it as a sequel to a film that earned a decent fame. The title says 'Dark Continent', but it takes place in the middle-east. Maybe it was the northern Africa, anyway, there's no clear picture about the location. This is the director's first feature film, but it was not a bad direction. The actors did decently as well and again, it is the story that bothered me. I feel it is an unnecessary sequel, so I say don't bother to watch it, because it is not worth, unless you can take a chance to find yourself how bad it is. \r\n\r\n_3.5\/10_","id":"57ed86fa9251414c980003a4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ed86fa9251414c980003a4","movie_id":145221}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The mothers' adventure on the night of Mother's Day.**\r\n\r\nI was not interested in this till I saw 'Bad Moms'. A very similar film, but it came first. The Erwin brothers directed it, the ones who made 'October Baby' which I loved it. This film was a slow starter, but once took off, it became non-stop. The entire first act has been just a build up, like how moms are suffering. After that, everything seems so adventurous. It's a one night tale and the plot was developed with a series of confusions. Silly and so random events, but mindlessly enjoyable.\r\n\r\nIt all begins when three moms were introduced like how they're struggling to maintain the family, particularly the children. During the Mother's day, they decide to take off the night and have a relaxed dinner. But nothing goes according to their plan, and so their adventure begins when their car got stolen, followed by roaming around the city at all night. After all, every story has to end and how this one does was revealed in the remaining parts.\r\n\r\nThe cast was the best thing I liked. The story was average, because most of the film was improvised than scripted. So some of the parts were funny, though you won't laugh loudly. The end should have been better, except that part the overall film was better than I thought, only entertainment wise. So I had a decent time with it and I can't say you would do the same, but definitely not bad to try once.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"5851b9abc3a36806a700d542","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5851b9abc3a36806a700d542","movie_id":252680}

I would have liked if it was focused only on Sam about a soldier's struggle since his return from the war like the 2009 film 'The Messenger' perhaps. The Amira's character seems deliberately put in, especially in the present western world scenario to tell what's wrong with them. So sorry, this did not click for me. But I like some parts, like how the character Amira transformed compared to the beginning and ending.\r\n\r\nMartin Starr was at his best and that's why its watchable. Some people might like the film for its simpleness, but the screenplay should have been improved. They covered many topics like wall street, unemployed ex soldier, immigrant et cetera in 90 minutes, but when it comes to the romance part, the reality was missing. So like I said, intentionally the lead two characters put together to bring attention, rather to tell a neat romantic tale.\r\n\r\nIt it like 'Learning to Drive' kind of film. That aimed to reveal the cultural clash between two and how it stands as an obstacle between their feeling to each other. This is not for everybody, even the middle eastern audience might be annoyed about how Amira was portrayed in a few scenes. But those are the parts I liked the most from it.

Louis Bloom might have been born yesterday, just before taking an online course in Small Business Management, the new way to self-educate, without the petty annoyances of human contact and interaction. Every basic lesson he absorbed is put to the test with the obsessive solitary singular purpose of succeeding. Jake Gyllenhaal immerses himself in the role with psychotic stupor. He speaks with the same forward-plotting conviction whether tossing about obvious clich\u00e9s or revealing something brilliant. The perfect entrepreneur. A maniacal detached idiot savant on a ruthless predatory mission. Morality and the legal system are minor roadblocks to dodge, riddles to resolve, sentiments to overcome. His brand of narcissistic psychosis is a genetic mutation that insures the survival of the species. Like an Aryan bulldozer, he cripples and kills the weak, exploiting the flaws in humanity, cannibalizing the limits of civilization, and capitalizing on each opportunity every step of the way, all for his own personal gain. All while intuiting which backs to scratch and\/or stab and when. The perfect entrepreneur. The quintessential post-9\/11 movie hero. Where Travis Bickle sought to take down corruption to rescue the innocent, Louis Bloom does the opposite, preying on the fallen and severing the social codes and mores that bind us for his own solitary success. American Exceptionalism. Nightcrawler is nanoeconomics in its purest, most wicked and vicious form. I'm sure some may see it not so much as a comment on what ails us but as an inspiration to venture out from, and Bloom as a persistent determined role model to imitate. How-to-Succeed-in Business-Without-Feeling.

{"author":"Oldnewbie","content":"I find it truly amazing that Jake Gyllenhaal did not win nor was even nominated for an Oscar for this stunning performance as Louis Bloom. Makes me wonder how much of who gets nominated and who wins rides on insider politics and not on merit. Or how many Oscar noms and wins are \"gifts\" in the respect that either an actor has a catalog of wonderful performances and has never won (Henry Fonda comes to mind for \"On Golden Pond\")or the effort put into as role somehow makes it an Oscar winning performance (Leo DiCaprio in \"The Revenant\").\r\n\r\nGyllenhaal becomes his character; a feral, single minded, means justify the end \"bottom feeder\" catering to the worst in humanity - our seemingly built in need to view others pain. He sees nothing at all wrong with what he does or how he goes about it. Easily he is most believable sociopath I have seen on film. In a performance marked by many stand out moments perhaps the most galvanizing one is not an action sequence but a quiet moment (before a storm) where he tells an employee that \"Maybe my problem isn't that I don't understand people, but that I don't like them.\"\r\n\r\nHow his work was over looked for an Oscar is beyond what good acting warrants and indeed must fall within the machinery of Hollywood backroom politics. Going by IMDb, he was nominated for outstanding acting by just about every other award given in entertainment except the Academy. Maybe perhaps his Lou Bloom was too good and looking at this work, for Hollywood, was like looking into the darkest darkness; understanding the reflection they saw in it was themselves.","id":"590944ce9251411cde00461b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/590944ce9251411cde00461b","movie_id":242582}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> How big deal is hosting a dinner for an old friend?\r\n\r\nExecutive produced by Brad Pitt and distributed by HBO. The film partially inspired by the real event. The British actor David Oyelowo stars in this one man show. Nominated for the Emmy Awards, but he has won the Critics Choice Television Awards for his brilliant performance. That mean Critics loved it, but what movie fanatics say is yet to know. Along, the movie's fate (not commercially) will be decided by the common people who follow either critics or film fanatics or the both.\r\n\r\nSo it begins when an ex soldier, Peter wanted to invite his fellow buddy, Edward from the army for a dinner. Just for one evening, but his mother and Ed's wife are the obstacle. It is a big deal for Peter and he's very obsessed with it, because they haven't met since 18 years. It looks silly, but the story progression is to tell how serious it could get. Drags until the final minute, develops the story in every possible fresh angle, but still revolves around the same theme. Not that hard to predict, but how it all ends remains our intense lookout.\r\n\r\nThe presentation is very deceiving. You would see everything and believe it instantly, but you won't hear everything you see. I am talking about the phone calls that you can't hear the conversation from the other side of the line. That is where the doubts arise, because there's no confirmation of anything. You probably think there might be a hidden message or something and you want to decode it. It might confuse you what I'm babbling, but you will realise while you begin to watch it.\r\n\r\n> \"I see now that my whole life\r\n> has pointed to this moment.\"\r\n\r\nSo, if you have not seen it yet, my small suggestion is there are layers, especially the screenplay. They are not quite in order, but when Peter connects with other people, mostly with phone calls it also reveals his mental health condition. Excluding the beginning, when later part proceeds that discloses he trapped himself inside the house. Only the next half where the movie somewhat gives a glimpse of the surrounding exterior.\r\n\r\nIt seems like Peter is blogging and revealing his present situation for millions of people online. Frankly, I never get those parts. But todays people are hooked to the internet, expects opinions from the strangers about their personal lives. When the film reaches the halfway mark, by then somewhat you come to know about the Peter and what is his motive, but mystery remains as we don't know the people he keeps in touch with.\r\n\r\nThis psychological-drama was shot in a single location with the character Peter almost in every frame. Finely written screenplay by a newcomer and helmed by the 'Blitz' director. The movie was 80 minutes long, uses all the opportunities to fill the loopholes, but still few remains. Better to call it unsettled plot rather to label them as the flaws. Very original and so distinctive, one of this year's rare and special movie, but not a spectacular. And my final words, the less you learn, the more you are going to enjoy the film and you would hardly miss any important stuff.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"56116f2c92514147d8009417","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56116f2c92514147d8009417","movie_id":277662}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"There is a particular moment in Nimirnthu Nil when you stop taking the film seriously and exasperatedly just let it run its course. It happens when CBI officer Michael ( Sarath Kumar, in a guest appearance) comes flying out of nowhere in a car and crashes into a truck which is telecasting, illegally, an interview with the protagonist Aravind Sivaswamy ( Jayam Ravi), who is doing an expose on corrupt government officials. The truck is moving along on the Bangalore-Chennai highway, and only in the previous minute, we have been shown Michael, who is apparently in Chennai, telling a TV channel head that he has challenged his ego and he will not rest until he captures Aravind (notice the topical relevance of the name). And so, when Michael joins the chase in Supermanesque fashion, it is a little surreal and so absurd.\r\n\r\nUntil then, the film does seem to be on the right track (as far as our \"commercial\" films go), playing out like an alternate version of the Rules Ramanujam track from Anniyan (directed by Shankar, who, by the way, owns this genre). As in that film, we get a \"day in the life of\" segment and witness how Aravind, with his penchant for following rules, ends up in a wretched state, questioning everything in the society. He refuses to bribe a cop which results in his two-wheeler being seized, which gets him to travel in a bus, which leads to him losing his wallet to a pickpocket, which lands him in trouble with the police, who are hand in glove with the crooks, and he ends up in jail. Still, Aravind refuses to give up his principles and chooses to be behind the bars and when he is taken before a magistrate, he even manages to point his fingers at the judge accusing him of employing a tout, which only worsens his situation.\r\n\r\nBut, when he comes out of prison, with the help of the well-meaning lawyer Raja Senthoorapandian ( Subbu Panchu) and his friend Ramachandran ( Soori), Aravind shoots off mails to every head of the department in the government narrating his story, which leads to the suspension of the accused officers, who get-together and plot to remove him from their path.\r\n\r\nThese scenes have a swiftness that keeps things from turning dull while camouflaging the flaws. The dialogue too is witty and sharp (Ellarum follow panna thaan rules, but follow pannravan ellam fools), and strikes a chord, igniting righteous anger in us. Sadly, that is short-lived as the film soon does a spectacular nose-dive. The accused officers (147 in number) form a team, elect a group to take decisions on the behalf and take on Aravind's case. As luck would have it, they also manage to find a man, the shifty Narasimha Reddy, who looks exactly like Aravind.\r\n\r\nAnd, the director sacrifices sense for scale and makes serious episodes seem like farce while turning the intended funny ones less amusing. Songs crop at the most inopportune moments, an action sequence happens just to showcase a Ravi vs Ravi fight, the preachifying tone of the film increases exponentially, and a final twist of sorts makes us question many things that we have seen before, from the need for the Reddy character to the inconsistencies in the characterization of Aravind and even the insistence of Samuthirakani in wanting to be the conscience keeper of the society.","id":"53bb1ace0e0a26197c000301","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bb1ace0e0a26197c000301","movie_id":259282}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Ninaithathu Yaaro opens with five youngsters (three boys and two girls) living in the same house, with a board bearing slogans like 'love is more dangerous than a snake' hung on its gate. We are told that all five are love failures and so hate romance. This initial set-up feels straight out of K Balachander's Vaaname Ellai, and we sit back hoping to see how these youngsters' notions on love are changed. To do that, Vikram tells us another story \u2014 of Mohan, an aspiring director who reclaims his life because of his now-married lover, Kavitha, and her understanding husband, Arun, which turns out to be the film's primary plot, which has a whiff of Andha 7 Naatkal. Interestingly, the husband is played by Richard, who, in his debut film, Kadhal Virus, played an aspiring director whose lover marries another man due to circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhatever his shortcomings, Vikraman has always been an earnest filmmaker and this film too has an earnestness that is somewhat admirable. However, he is also a director who seems to be caught in a time warp and so, what should have been an emotional romantic drama that reaffirms our faith in love plays out as a dated film with amateurish performances, unsophisticated filmmaking and needless moralizing. In a scene straight out of his debut Pudhu Vasantham, when Kavitha gets into a car with two males (who are also smoking, by the way) we get reaction shots of Kavitha's neighbours looking derisively. We are told that Kavitha has not slept with Arun despite being married to him for six months, as if that fact alone should make us cheer for Mohan's chances. And, when she tells Mohan that she has decided to get a divorce, Kavitha says that it is better being a vaazhavetti than being in an abusive relationship.

{"author":"Reno","content":"So the final movie in the trilogy. That's what I'm hoping for. Because when the first movie came I thought it was a nice idea and then its sequel was so bad without any further innovative ideas to add up. I was not expecting the third movie, but it made its way and I give it a try only to get disappointed.\r\n\r\nBen Stiller is a fine actor and a great director, this trilogy was just a passing cloud in his career, other I would have blamed him for accepting the offer. As we know its a multi star movie, in that I am very happy to see Robin Williams one final time. What a great actor, lucky we had him in our time. The funny thing is I am confused for Rebel Wilson as Melissa McCarthy, but soon after realised.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the cast, Wilson, Coogan, Kingsley and other were what to say, their existence were in individual narrow thin lane in a weak story. Badly needed a fresh plot in the well known concept from the last two movies, and it did not give us. Hope the reboot would be very creative in the each three. May be it should set in the Hollywood studios like Marvel, Disney et cetera. Because, as I am a movie fanatic, love to see some of my favourite characters like Gandalf the gray, Joker et cetera, as well as beasts like Godzilla, King Kong et cetera come alive at night. It would be so awesome. Anyway, this movie was just okay for a certain reason.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A fine Spanish countryside murder mystery.\r\n\r\nThis is a good suspense-crime-thriller. Reminded me the Korean film 'Memories of Murder', but not the same or similar, except the crime scenario and the location. Awesome to see a detective story that takes place outside the urban area. The Spanish countryside was so beautiful, those marshlands, especially from the aerial views.\r\n\r\nI think the brilliant cinematography is the first thing anyone would notice and the 80s atmosphere. The narration was steady as the crime after the crime with tension arise, while on the other side the investigation advancing till the last minute to reveal the truth.\r\n\r\nThe two cops were so good, along the murder mysteries they're working on. Beside these two men are the characters with riddles. Not only to each others, but for us as well. Not easy to predict anything, also there are some loose ends to have our own perspective regarding the story puzzle. The overall impression is its a fine mystery-crime, but still I felt that I did not enjoy entirely due to the lack of originality. Other than that I'm sure it is worth a watch.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd\/10","id":"56a4c953c3a36838a3005ffc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56a4c953c3a36838a3005ffc","movie_id":236735}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"When I first read about this movie I was not entirely sure whether I liked the idea or not. After having watched it I have to say that I really liked it. It is a nice fairy tale based on the Sleeping Beauty but from the perspective of the evil fairy (who is not really that evil actually) instead. As far as I am concerned the concept worked surprisingly well.\r\n\r\nObviously the story is highly rewritten compared to the original Sleeping Beauty story. Whether that is good or bad is probably a matter of personal opinion. I think it is good since it allowed to story in the movie to have its own merits and not be too dependent on the original. It works for me since the original story is not very present except and thus you do not get any annoyed every so often because the deviate from the \u201coriginal\u201d since the movie clearly demonstrated that it intended to be quite different from the start.\r\n\r\nThe movie is quite beautiful with a typical fairy-tale air to it and at the same time dark and ominous during the scenes that required it. There are plenty of CGI of course and, to me, it was all quite well done. Angeline Jolie did a good job as Maleficent. I was actually less impressed by the three fairies that were supposed to take care of the princess though. They tried to be funny but it never really became very funny.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I found this to be a very enjoyable movie. So did the kids by the way. When I watched it  (with the kids) the kids had already watched it twice.","id":"544e81b9c3a36865a4000268","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/544e81b9c3a36865a4000268","movie_id":102651}
{"author":"akram112","content":"**REVIEW FROM BEHINDWOODS:**\r\n\r\nAfter notching up back to back successes as the endearing and funny \u2018boy next door\u2019, Siva Karthikeyan is back with Maan Karate in a role which is akin to his previous ones but with more scope for action this time around.\r\n \r\nSiva plays Peter, a playful chap with very little worldly exposure and with nothing on his mind except his girlfriend Yazhini. He poses as a boxer to woo her, as she is an ardent fan of sports. But destiny has bigger plans for him and makes him register for a boxing tourney.\r\n\r\nMaan Karate combines elements like fantasy and the regular brand of commercial entertainment in true Siva Karthikeyan style. We also have the sporting angle with Siva being the quintessential underdog taking on a mighty champion. The film does provide quite a lot of fun in the first half with Siva Karthikeyan\u2019s typical antics, his mimicry attempts and his rollicking dance moves in the colorfully shot song sequences. The young man looks handsome in neatly fitting, trendy costumes and accessories, and looks the part as a dashing lead hero. The way he has improved his dance moves is unbelievable and there is an evident and effortless grace in his moves now. All the songs are lifted by Siva\u2019s energetic presence. And like a typical mass hero number, we have Siva and the song\u2019s choreographer dancing together to a signature move, in the \u2018Royapuram Peter\u2019 track.\r\n\r\nHansika is pretty and cherubic as ever and looks gorgeous in the song and dance sequences. Other than that, she gets to be a loyal, unsuspecting and supporting girlfriend who stands by her guy.\r\n\r\nSoori plays a pretty hyper, easily excitable boxing referee and will please his hardcore fans in the limited time he has. The chemistry between Siva and Soori is evident in these scenes and they do bring about a few laughs. Sathish has a few one-liners to make a mark and effortlessly does so.\r\n\r\nThe other actors such as Vamsi as the domineering boxer and Shaji as Siva\u2019s coach play out their roles in the required manner.\r\n\r\nTechnically, Maan Karate is a superior product with the grand boxing arena and the massive scale in the final fight, catching the eye. The songs are a delight to watch thanks to Sukumar\u2019s lighting, the glossy visual treatment and the lead pair\u2019s attractive costumes. \u2018Maanja\u2019 and \u2018Un Vizhigalil\u2019 are the best of the lot but the movie is let down by the placement of these songs as you can preempt exactly when all the songs are going to arrive.\r\n\r\nSukumar\u2019s work is also really brilliant in the movie\u2019s initial few minutes as he transports us right into the proceedings on screen.\r\n\r\nNow coming to the biggest highlight of the movie, Anirudh and his spellbinding work on the BGM score. The final boxing tussle is elevated several notches by Anirudh\u2019s quirky and groovy electronic score. The little training montage is another sequence where Anirudh rules with his orchestration in the background. You have many more scenes which have Anirudh\u2019s lovely tracks in the background. Each of his songs is welcomed with the whistles and hoots of fans. Maan Karate is another step in the right direction for this talented young musician.\r\n \r\nAll things said, we aren\u2019t able to root wholeheartedly for the underdog in the final boxing tussle, and we don\u2019t make an emotional connect with him. The unconvincing way in which the boxing tournament is staged in the movie, may be a reason. Even with a funny title like \u2018Maan Karate\u2019 (meaning pulling off an escape act), when you are making a movie with sports as a key element, a certain amount of seriousness is required in the way the sport is approached and treated on screen. The movie also becomes overtly dramatic towards the end and this reduces the final impact.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the movie is definitely watchable, with some amount of suspension of disbelief, for the many segments of entertainment that it offers.\r\n\r\n**Verdict: Siva Karthikeyan's entertainer to beat the summer heat** \r\n\r\n**Rating: 2.75\/5**","id":"5362491ec3a368395600160c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5362491ec3a368395600160c","movie_id":259837}
{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"Today, June 4, I went to see Maleficent on the birthday of its star, Angelina Jolie. In itself, nothing more than a funny coincidence, although when you think about it, it is customary for someone who is celebrating their birthday, to hand out treats. And boy, this was the best treat ever.\r\n\r\nThree reasons why I was completely stoked to see Maleficent after hearing about it for the first time about a year and a half ago: 1) I love Angelina. 2) I love Sleeping Beauty. 3) Maleficent is my favourite fairy tale villain of all time. On the other hand, I was also a little wary of the way they had apparently altered the story. See, if there is one thing I hate in films, it's when they explain and justify the motives and reasons why a certain character is \"bad\". I for one believe that some people are just plain evil and that's the way it is. And going into this persons' childhood and explaining how bad everything was (or something to that effect) only works to weaken that characters' force. Now, I don't know why a somewhat clich\u00e9d story about the love and betrayal of a young Maleficent (who apparently used to be good and pure-hearted), worked here, but somehow it just did. It completely surprised me, to be honest. I'm usually allergic to this kind of fluff, but it worked! Maleficents' back-story actually intrigued me, moved me even. And it succeeded at what it was supposed to do in the first place: it made Maleficent human.\r\n\r\nIn the end though, they could have written any kind of story about what is undoubtedly Disney's most beloved villainess, it never would have been raised to an above-par level without its most crucial element: Angelina Jolie. I might sound biased because I'm such a fan, but I am perfectly able to look at her performances in a critical way, and I can only say this about her performance as Maleficent: she was in one word, perfect. I honestly can't imagine any other actress who could have approached this role with the same flawless combination of properties (short of maybe Charlize Theron): she is beautiful and very charismatic, yet at the same time undeniably cruel and cold. She was everything I had hoped this real life characterization of Maleficent would be, and then some. \r\n\r\nCompliments also go out to the three other main actors in this film. First to Elle Fanning, for being very convincing as the young princess Aurora. She is sweet, lovely and kind and she has the right personality to play this famous princess just the way she should be. Second, to Sam Riley, who was a pleasant surprise as Maleficents' pet raven Diaval in human form. I was thus far unfamiliar with his work, but he was very well suited to his role and I enjoyed watching him. Last, but certainly not least, Sharlto Copley, who has already thrilled me with his performances in District 9 and Elysium, and who has now definitely made a fan out of me. His range is awesome and he was totally terrifying as Stefan.\r\n\r\nOK, there are some things you have to look past. My first, and most blatant, issue with this film is: if young Maleficent was a good, pure- hearted girl, then why did she, as an innocent 10-year-old, already have evil-looking horns, devilish wings and is she called \"Maleficent\"? Right\u2026 Secondly, I found the three pixies to be very unconvincing and even somewhat annoying CGI-wise. Overall the special effects are well done but the pixies were definitely an eyesore. The dragon in the end also looked a bit unreal. \r\n\r\nThat being said, Maleficents' costumes and make-up were absolutely stunning. I just couldn't get enough of gazing at her intricate headdresses and beautiful gowns. The costume and styling department really deserve top credit and I truly hope there will be some awards for them in the near future. The music was also great, with flawless scoring by James Newton Howard and a terrific rendition of \"Once upon a dream\" by Lana Del Rey over the end credits. Also, awesome battle scenes and action sequences galore!\r\n\r\nGoing into this film, I thought it would be nothing more than a so-so, kind of fun summer flick. A 6.5\/7 maybe. Sometimes, I love it when I'm wrong. Out of the three films that I've seen at the cinema over the last week (the other two being X-Men and Godzilla, both disappointments\u2026) I can tell you, Maleficent was by far the most gratifying. Perhaps because I had relatively low expectations, perhaps because it was simply that good.\r\n\r\nOne serious warning for the rough, rugged men out there: this film features pixies, fairies, sparkly thingies and magical fluff out the wazoo. If you're going to see this, do it for Angelina. If not, treat this film like kryptonite. You will thank me later.\r\n\r\nTo everyone else: go see this film. It will rock your socks off. Maleficent is magnificent.\r\n_(June 2014)_","id":"58ac4b1ac3a36849b00120de","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ac4b1ac3a36849b00120de","movie_id":102651}
{"author":"Andres Gomez","content":"The plot of the actual crime is not the brightest but that's the only weak point of this movie.\r\n\r\nThe directing and photography are really, really good, with an atmosphere that remembers to the latest rising of the Scandinavian crime novels. Stieg Larsson, and series like Bron\/Broen (which have been later deeply inspiring US series like \"True Detective\") are very present in this movie.\r\n\r\nThe cast is superb and gives us great performances. Ar\u00e9valo and Guti\u00e9rrez, which usually perform comedy roles, are fantastic, as also are Barros and Reina. The dialogs are really good and also the several loose ends that the story leaves.\r\n\r\nTo finish, the movie moves around the history of the under-dictatorship and incipient democratic Spain in an indirect way used quite often in Spanish movies. This lets the viewer the door ajar so they can be curious enough to enter and look for more information on their own, while leaving the movie in a safe spot, far from the criticism that could suffer from those in Spain still not acknowledging the darkest period of the recent history of the country.","id":"56ae9ed3c3a3681c3b00ab1c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56ae9ed3c3a3681c3b00ab1c","movie_id":236735}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A unique tale of a student-teacher relationship.\r\n\r\nI did not know this movie till the last week, but I'm very happy that I discovered it. My experience watching it was like I have been waiting for a movie like this for a some time, but did not realise it until I saw it. I liked it a lot within the opening few minutes itself like I already finished watching the whole film. Because somehow I knew it will make my day. It is a heartwarming biographical family drama that tells about a girl who discovers that she can communicate with the world and can learn more about it, despite her birth defects.\r\n\r\nBased on the real story of a 14 year old blind and deaf girl Marie Heurtin that sets in the late 1800s rural France. As being a daughter of a craftsman who does not know how to raise a child like her, decides to send her to the Larnay institution where she can learn things among similar other girls and live a better life. After the initial hiccup, sister Marguerite takes the special interest in Marie and so the wonderful tale begins by revealing all the good, bad and sad events.\r\n\r\nA fascinating film with the wonderful characters, especially the two main characters were the focus of the whole film and no one else, not even a small peek on any other incidents. From a wild child to getting along, knowing the world is much bigger and learning it is the only way to cooperate. But when there is a dedicated teacher, students achieve more than what they dreamed of.\r\n\r\nThe actors who played those roles were exceptional. Especially the Marie's was very challenging one, but was so perfectly done by young new face. And Marguerite was the inspiring young nun that every convent in the world would dream to have under their wings. There are thousands of Marie and Marguerite in the world who never meet, that's why this movie is so special.\r\n\r\n> \"I am so happy. I will see Marie again. She is my joy, the daughter of my soul, the light of my life.\"\r\n\r\nThe French countryside where this film shot was so beautiful. The cinematography was at its best with a pleasing background score. While having so much fun, it also brings some intense tears in our eyes. Not like sentimental stuff, but happy tears. There comes a time for it as well when the movie gets emotional in the final stage of the storytelling. Like when it goes beyond the our reach, that makes us to accept the fate of what every life has to go through.\r\n\r\nI have heard that some are arguing the story was merely true, especially some of the scenes were overly cinematised. If you see it in that angle most of the historical event based films suffers the same issues while portraying the actual event or the character on the screen. Nonetheless, it is true and obviously modified for the adaptation.\r\n\r\nI have also heard it was totally resembling the Helen Keller's autobiography 'The Story of My Life' which was later made into a Hollywood movie that won both leading and supporting actress awards at the Oscars. Now I added that into my watchlist. Likewise the lead two actresses from this deserves similar high profile honour. But it is very sad to know the movie got much less attention despite it got a quality to strike the family audiences.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Lately I've been watching some interesting films. Better way to say it is I'm choosing good one, because I am not addicted to superhero, Hollywood or the big budget films alone like most of the young film fanatics are nowadays. I am here to find the hidden gems and suggest them to film fanatics. Now I highly recommend this one to all\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"571ce0fc9251414a87001a05","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/571ce0fc9251414a87001a05","movie_id":286595}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Maan Karate is nothing but a showcase for Sivakarthikeyan. It is an acknowledgement that the former TV personality is today a bonafide star. And, so, the film comes with all the trappings of a star film \u2014 an A-list heroine, a happening music director, no-expenses-spared production budget, introduction song and not to mention, the hype. And, the actor, to his credit manages to carry this film on his shoulders like a pro. He looks slick (even though his character is from Royapuram), makes us laugh with his one-liners and mannerisms, dances very well and even attempts some heavy-duty histrionics.\r\n\r\nWhich is why it is sad to see his efforts getting wasted in a film that dispenses with any form of logic, and wants us to take it as it is, no questions asked. The story, by director AR Murugadoss, is a mix of fantasy and romance, but Thirukumaran's script is underdeveloped. The film begins with five friends (Sathish and co) meeting a mystic in the forest, who grants their wish \u2014 a newspaper from the future! When things start happening as reported in the paper (the IT company in which they work shuts down, hailstones fall in Chennai), they decide that they could use their knowledge of the future to their advantage, and get rich with hardly any effort.\r\n\r\nSo, they woo Royapuram Peter, a happy-go-lucky (read wastrel) youngster, who is supposed to win a boxing tournament. Their plan is to make Peter take part in the tournament and collect his prize money by making him sign an agreement. Incidentally, Peter falls in love with Yazhini (mainly because she has fair skin, FYI), who loves sports. So, to impress her, he accepts their terms and uses them to pep up his lifestyle. These segments play out in a lighthearted fashion, something that even Ethir Neechal did.\r\n\r\nAnd then the interval twist arrives \u2014 there is another Peter, who is taking part in the tournament, who is a feared boxer and is an odds-on favourite (even their father's names are the same!) This seems like an interesting, but you realize that it is also a flaky one when the second half plays out. While we get the initial confusion of the friends who wonder if they have chosen the wrong Peter, it is hard to believe that a news report would fail to mention the juicy details of the final game, especially given the interest the final generates \u2014one of the opponents has sworn to give the audiences live murder in the ring and the other is an overwhelming fan favourite with a unique style that has become his sobriquet \u2014 'Maan Karate' Peter.\r\n\r\nEven the romantic track doesn't have any odds stacked against it. Yazhini's dad wants to marry her off only to someone who can recite Thirukkural and that problem is solved in a couple of scenes. Yazhini's love for sports is what prompts Peter to accept the offer to take part in the tournament but towards the end, even she tells that she wouldn't mind if Peter loses.\r\n\r\nThe boxing portions too are under whelming, both in terms of staging and drama. There is no real sense of a contest in any of the fights, including the final; we can at least accept that 'Maan Karate' Peter's fights are just farcical, but shouldn't there have been a show of real challenge in the ones involving Peter The Killer? A sports movie should have a rousing climax but here, the end just feels tame.\r\n\r\nGiven that the basic premise of the film itself is weak, and there is generally an 'anything goes' approach to the script, we feel that beneath all the gloss, there is nothing but emptiness.","id":"53bab0620e0a2676d300b9a6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bab0620e0a2676d300b9a6","movie_id":259837}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Not about the night stars, but the Hollywood's.**\r\n\r\nThe title gives an impression of someone lost in somewhere and trying to find a way back home. I did not know what this film was about. I did not know who stars in it and when it released. But I decided to watch it at the last minute without checking out its synopsis and I ended up satisfied. Not fully pleased, but the refreshing story and its characters interested me.\r\n\r\nThis is an unusual drama that takes place in a district where the Hollywood people are dominated. Our tale opens with a young woman arriving there and soon gets an opportunity to become a famous artist's personal assistant. The film also focuses others tales, so it is a multi layered story. But all of them are somewhere connected; particularly at the end. Revealing everyone's agenda behind their act is what brings the conclusion to the tale.\r\n\r\nNot neatly told story, yet different. I would say futuristic theme. I liked the performances. Robert Pattinson was not in a major role, but the other like Mia Wasikowska, Julianne Moore were good. Revolving around the bunch film celebrities means there's no real ones involved with the real names, just mentioned the names who were not in the film. Hard to predict the story, I was not sure until it revealed itself everything at the end. That part was a quite a shock, not I expected, but that's the real twist. Overall film was decent, slightly it missed to be a great. I feel it is worth a watch if you want something new in the story.\r\n\r\n_6.5\/10_","id":"57ed8984c3a3686d0c000519","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ed8984c3a3686d0c000519","movie_id":157851}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Director Ragavan's film tells the heart-warming tale of the love a grandfather has for his grandson and the extent to which he goes to fulfill all his desires.\r\n\r\nThe story might be simple but it has a truthfulness to it that makes it leave a lasting impression on viewers. Rajkiran, who hasn't been seen in too many movies in the recent past, makes a profound impact as the caring rustic villager. His powerful portrayal of the character of Venkatasamy makes one wonder why one doesn't get to see this man more often in Tamil films. Single-handedly, he lifts the film to another level. While it cannot be denied that the film starts off on a slow note, Raj Kiran's arrival in the city peps up proceedings and makes the film more engaging.\r\n\r\nApart from Raj Kiran's performance, the film has another plus in the form of humour in it. Credit for this must go to the director. The humourous sequences don't appear forced and seem to have been carefully formulated from observations of day-to-day proceedings. Vimal takes time to settle into the character of an IT professional. However, as the film progresses, he seems to be more at ease with the part. Lakshmi Menon does a decent job as Vimal's love interest. But neither of their performances even comes a close second to that of Raj Kiran, who steals the limelight. The film has a couple of good numbers, scored by N R Raghunanthan. Manja Pai is a good film with a solid message but if you aren't in the mood for gyan, then this movie might not be to your liking.","id":"53baacd80e0a2676bb00bc08","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baacd80e0a2676bb00bc08","movie_id":275300}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A little kid's fight against the natural phenomenon.**\r\n\r\nAnimated film from Sweden? I don't remember I have seen one. So probably this is my first from that region. It was less than 80 minutes, that means short and sweet. They should have stretched it a bit longer, but the point of the narration was perfectly accomplished, so it does not matter even it was shorter than the usual length. This is a pure children's film, that families might as well enjoy it. I thought everything in it was cute. The characters, and the simple story. But the animation obviously was not that great as we see in Hollywood. Also not bad to ignore it completely.\r\n\r\nThis takes place on the planet of the rabbits and tells the story of a young Johan. He's the happiest kid, living with his loving parents, but until one day when the feather king gets his mother. Missing her presence, the desperate Johan in a boat at the sea alone, uses the situation after receiving a sos radio message. He now enters the forbidden land without an invitation and his adventure begins to fight for his mother's return. It also helps him to learn an important lesson that ends with what seems the right way.\r\n\r\n> \"The feather king took my mom. And I want her back\"\r\n\r\nAfter seeing this I think the director should get a shot at Hollywood, so that he can come back and make the international quality animated features for his nation. I said that because American production houses usually pour a big amount because of their international market that gets them five to ten times what they have spent. If you are an animation film fan, then you should try this. But you should not compare it with any Hollywood animations. I saw it during the week of Christmas and New Year, the best season to watch such magical tale.\r\n\r\nI liked how they avoided the word 'loss' or 'death'. You would understand the situation in the story, but the film is not intended to go details. This is the film about losing someone you love and when unable to cope, especially the little kids who can't understand such concept, this film tried to give something fictional version of logic. For that reason alone, it's worth a watch with your little ones. Like the Americans say after someone had died that he\/she\/it is in a better place, this film set in that place and that's why it was called 'Beyond Beyond' that rhymes with 'Mirror Mirror' kind of fairytale.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"587a821a9251413e9200620b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/587a821a9251413e9200620b","movie_id":257951}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A mom and her three cubs' life journey.\r\n\r\nOne of the latest Disneynature's documentary ventures. There's nothing wrong to call it a grizzly version of 'To the Arctic'. Because both films are about the mother bears and their new born cubs' first year of survival in the wilderness, but the differences are the fur and habitat. Shot in Alaskan coast side, the film crew followed the bear family for one circle of a year's season to capture the beginning of the life journey of newborn cubs with their mother.\r\n\r\nLike the Disney films famous for fairy tales and children friendly, Disneynature films as well not too far behind. Their films are not like we watch on Animal planet and Nationa Geography, the uncut and harsh version of animals' survival in the jungle. But a cute and enjoyable little epic tale. This film was narrated by our own jolly fellow John C. Reilly. Some of his lines were too good for kids and family, I mean comical. Like other Disneynature films is a must see for children. Hope along with kids, the adult would have a nice time.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"55898aa1c3a36809b1000f10","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55898aa1c3a36809b1000f10","movie_id":214314}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The French version of the famous fairy-tale.**\r\n\r\nI should have seen this before the latest Disney version of the tale. It came a couple of years ago, with a wonderful cast and visuals. French cinema is not a great vfx powerhouse. Unlike most of the famous Hollywood mythical and fairy tales originated from Europe, it's rare to see them converted to films in the similar fashion in its homeland. One of the reasons was the international market, to earn back everything they have spent for it, and more. When such projects do happen, sometimes the filmmakers tie up with Hollywood co-production to secure returns. Even if you take this film's worldwide box office, nothing overwhelming. But the challenge they had taken was truly appreciable.\r\n\r\nThat's not it, this is the most redesigned versions of them all I've seen so far. Because I haven't seen any other than Disney's, excluding the modern timeline adaptation like 'Beastly', 'I' et cetera. Yeah, even the Disney's live-action retained original from their animated version, but visually extraordinary. And in here, the story was same, thought told in a different way. The graphics too were very nice, I did not expect that. Despite it is being a fantasy and a children's tale, the contents were more serious. That reveals they were very keen to bring the adults to the screens than the kids. Yet nothing too seriously targeted the grownups like 'Tale of Tales'.\r\n\r\nEveryone knows the basic storyline of this tale. A recently lost their fortune, a family of six siblings with their father relocates to a small farmhouse. No one other than the youngest daughter, Belle, was happy to be in such nature surrounded place. But one day when her father got into a big trouble, she takes his position and becomes a prisoner in an abandoned castle. Since then she begins to learn about the mystery man of the castle, particularly his past, reason to be ended like that. And following, a twist in the narration leading to the finale, everyone's fate will be revealed.\r\n\r\n> \u275dRemember... A life for a rose.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe film was two hours long and well filled with the scenes in it all over. It doesn't feel like we're watching a fantasy film. The colours, costumes, medieval story, misty mountain, all is the major reminder that you are watching a fairy-tale. Though you won't get anything magical from the story right away. Not until the third act. As for the story, from such vastly known tale, you can't expect any major surprise. As I said, some minor changes can be witnessed throughout. But such kind of scale the flick has in all the department, that too coming from Europe makes it a very special.\r\n\r\nDefinitely no to comparison with the Disney's. Both of them were fine products on their own way. But people would compare and pick one when they are based on the same source. That can't be stopped. Disney had created their own brand, aiming for kids. You can find the people who liked both the live-actions. I never knew the original tale, I mean from the original source\/text. Those who are familiar with are saying, this is most closest one. But something I did not understand was the Beast was cute furry Beast, just like Disney's. I anticipated something tough physique, hard character, I mean Beast as a real Beastly.\r\n\r\nExcluding that slight displeasure, I have had no other complaints with the film. I enjoyed it, yet there's another thing which is actually a question rather than a disagreement. The actors did their parts, though I felt the Beast character should have been played by a younger one. Vincent Cassel is a brilliant French actor and he did his best for it. Lea Seydoux as Beauty surely an excellent pick. The direction was good. Cautiously spent for everything in the film. So they have got a fine final product. Most of the people going for it, only keeping in mind Disney. You won't get that Disney's singing, dancing, overall appeal. One must clear off his mind from any great ideas and then only give it a try. Remember, it is not a very good film, but simply a good film.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59b1ebfbc3a3682443037569","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59b1ebfbc3a3682443037569","movie_id":197796}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"It seems as if big screen dueling cinematic fairy tales are the trend within the last few years at the box office. Back in 2012 movie audiences were bombarded by the _Snow White_ avalanche when filmmaker Rupert Sanders\u2019s _Snow White and the Huntsman_ had the share the releasing spotlight with director Tarsem Singh\u2019s _Mirror Mirror_ (although Singh\u2019s whimsical narrative had the head start in hitting the movie theaters first by a mere two months). Now in skipping ahead four years later we seem to have a repeat performance with another classic tale involving youthful fairy tale femininity as the focus shifts to the \u201cBeauty\u201d from Jeanne-Marie Laprince\u2019s **Beauty and the Beast** (or for the French-speaking movie-goers \u201cLe Belle et Le Bete\u201d). In 2016, co-writer\/director Christophe Gans\u2019s (\u201cBrotherhood of the Wolf\u201d, \u201cSilent Hill\u201d) **Beauty and the Beast** makes its lavish entrance into the movie mindset of viewers waiting to see what amounts to be another stagy screen adaptation of Laprince\u2019s vintage and unconventional fairy tale romancer. Bill Condon\u2019s musical film version of **Beauty and the Beast** will makes its entry a few months later in March 2017.\r\n\r\nNo doubt that Gans\u2019s French live-action version of **Beauty** has a breathtaking visual vibrancy to its opulent production. Plus, it certainly does not hurt the polished product when the film features a couple of France\u2019s big-time smooth cinema stars in leads Vincent Cassel and Lea Seydoux. In any event, **Le Belle et La Bete\/Beauty and the Beast** was originally produced in 2014 so now it is making the rounds to the U.S. shores and elsewhere. As imaginative and sleek that Gans\u2019s colorful showcase is in its elegant presentation the film fails to offer anything dramatically darker or delirious that dares to separate any distinction from past interpretations of this famously familiar story for the ages.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment has always been realized that if you are going to regurgitate epic fairy tales that have been done countless times over with richer reception then your current installment better bring something more stimulating and introspective to the creative table for feasting. For the longest time Disney, in particular, had the notable monopoly on the animated musical _Beauty and the Beast_ from the early nineties. Also, Jean Cocteau\u2019s nostalgically hypnotic 1946 fantasy offering still manages to resonate as well. Somehow Gans\u2019s elaborate and eye-popping take on the photogenic cutie and the misunderstood creature does not quite translate or connect beyond its obvious sumptuousness. **Beauty and the Beast**, at least in modern-day and future outings, should strive to the accountability of being more than a serviceable non-traditional love story saddled in sparkling trivialities.\r\n\r\nA French widowed merchant (Andre Dussollier) is practically destitute after his ships are lost on the high sea. So the bankrupt family man of six children packs up and moves to a quaint  countryside home to try and reclaim his chaotic life. His absent ships are not the only thing that is considered lost as his brood of problematic offspring are a handful. However, the one bright spot out of the unruly bunch is youngest daughter Belle (Sedoux, \u201cBlue is the Warmest Color\u201d). Whereas Belle\u2019s dissatisfied siblings are not thrilled with the relocation and overall less-than-stellar circumstances she in fact is taking a positive approach to the land and her father\u2019s unsettling situation at hand.\r\n\r\nFeeling underappreciated and disillusioned by his vain children (with the exception of his beloved and sensible Belle of course) the Merchant roams into the forest where he eventually ends up lost until he stumbles upon a castle owned by the ominous Beast (Cassel). The Merchant decides to take a gorgeous red rose from the property as a kind gesture to give to his only grateful child Belle. However, the Merchant absconding with the red rose did not quite sit right with the retaliatory Beast. This treasured red rose is the symbolic reminder of the Beast\u2019s cherished late wife. As a result the Merchant must pay the ultimate price in the eyes of the demanding Beast by holding him for rightful compensation. Specifically, the Merchant must be in life-long servitude to the fearsome Beast as selected punishment. Should the Merchant not comply with his indefinite servant role then the Beast promises to eradicate his entire family. Yikes!\r\n\r\nThankfully, the Merchant is given one day off from the Beast\u2019s clutches to inform his selfish-minded children of his dilemma at large. When the Merchant says his last goodbyes to his family a concerned Belle gets word of her father\u2019s inescapable fate. Feeling guilty and somewhat responsible as the recipient of the so-called forbidden red rose Belle rushes over to the castle and offers herself as a suitable replacement for her father\u2019s harsh sentence as the Beast\u2019s human piece of property. Fortunately, the Beast accepts the swap as Belle is allowed to assume her father\u2019s servicing duties. Thus, Belle benefits from the Beast greatly as he occasionally spoils her with pretty outfits and lets her enjoy the castle\u2019s majestic surroundings\u2013a far cry from where she hails from domestically. The stipulation is that Belle must have a mandatory dinner with the Beast each and every evening. Otherwise, the co-existence between the duo is solid and non-confrontational.\r\n\r\nSoon, the lonely Beast would start to develop romantic feelings for his acquired comely helper. At first Belle is repulsed by the fact that her hideous-looking overseer would dare to suggest that his heart yearns for her especially when this seemingly corrosive creature had her father (and currently now her) in a reluctant arrangement to serve his anti-social, personalized needs. Belle eventually realizes that the Beast is rather intriguing to her and not as sinister as she first imagined. Their bond tightens as the days go by and Belle cannot help but dream about how the Beast came to be from ages ago. Surely he must have been captivating in his regal heyday and stylized existence despite whatever heavy-handed pathos that had destroyed this once passionate soul. Clearly, the Beast is in search of true love and companionship so the golden question remains: can Belle be the beauty that finally eases his inner pain and comes to the rescue of his empty heart?\r\n\r\nWhen Belle requests a reprieve from the Beast for a day to check in on her father he grants her his permission but nevertheless insists that her betrayal in not returning to him may invite more devastating grieve and sadness. Surely Belle does not want the Beast to be overcome with wrought based on her potential deception. It does not get any easier when Belle learns of her riff raffish older brother and his crew that are planning on raiding the castle and killing the Beast in the process of stealing all his wealthy possessions. Naturally, Belle\u2019s love and attraction for the Beast is set in stone as she cringes at the potential harm her misguided family has on the mind to lift his riches and end his life. Will Belle\u2019s deep-seeded affections for the Beast be enough to prevent her wayward clan from harming a hair on her beleaguered suitor\u2019s hunted head?\r\n\r\nGans skillfully deploys the showy special effects techniques that give glorious sheen and wonderment to this French fantasy trying to invigorate a sense of surreal romanticism. Indeed, **Beauty and the Beast** boasts a robust landscape riddled with its telling brand of atmospheric charm and escapist curiosity. Besides, a French-made re-imagining of this glossy folktale should scream volumes of a dream-like aura that paints an alluring picture. Although Gans strikes a boisterous balance in conveying his exposition with the gumption of a rousing spectacle worthy of its welcomed glitter **Beauty** still feels rather distant and incomplete without adequately generating any substantive chemistry between its lovelorn leads.\r\n\r\nIndividually, both Seydoux and Cassel bring a refreshing vitality to their suffering characterizations. Cassel\u2019s Beast is effective as the languishing, wounded wonder imprisoned by his past emotional demons while Seydoux\u2019s Beauty\/Belle demonstrates a feisty heroine not afraid to embrace the loveliness of her persona. But Gans fails to provide any consistent rapport between Seydoux and Cassel collectively as they share awkward dinners and matter-of-fact conversations that do not seem to register with much gusto. Seydoux\u2019s Belle aimlessly parades around in designer dresses as Cassel\u2019s beastly kidnapper methodically pines for his curvaceous captive. In fact, Cassel\u2019s Beast has more romantic reverence in flashbacks towards his departed wife than he does in contemporary times with his desired Belle. When the third act involves Belle\u2019s villainous brother and the plot to ruin the Beast\u2019s livelihood the film turns into a recycled revenge period piece that places more emphasis on the Beast\u2019s periled predicament than the intended juicy love story between a mismatched pair of lovers building a tenet of belonging.\r\n\r\nGans (and co-writer Sandra Vo-Anh) deliver a _Beauty_ of a package that befittingly wallows in the shadows of previous_ Beast_ editions. This fairy tale falls short of its entertaining goal despite its pleasing, tangy wrapping.\r\n\r\n**Beauty and the Beast (La Belle et La Bete)** 2016\r\n\r\nShout!

{"author":"Reno","content":"> When logic and prediction isn't an issue, you'll get a decent thriller.\r\n\r\nWhen the big production houses along with the great filmmakers and young stars turning towards the comic books and dystopian themes, what do you think the yesteryear legends are doing.\r\n\r\nIt is very sad to see the 70s, 80s and the 90s icons are discarded like a trash, but they're trying their best to keep the star status by doing small scale films from the lower rated and debuting filmmakers. That's the best shot they've got which obviously won't do well at the big screens. So that's where this film too comes in.\r\n\r\nAs usual Michael Douglas was good, but the story had many possible ways to travel and that's where the viewers raise their voice by saying it should have been like this, like that or why would he do that.\r\n\r\nOverall, its a decent entertainment that is kind of closest theme to 'No Country for Old Men'. The entire film revolves around just two men and sets in the desert. So a minimal cast film.\r\n\r\nBased on the book 'Deathwatch'. A simple story, but quite interesting film characters. Filled with fairly predictable stuffs yet the performances and very suitable locations are what draws us in.\r\n\r\nIt's a right kind of project for Michael Douglas for his age, but the 'War Horse' actor was also good in his role. An average film, or maybe just above that. If you skip it, you would miss nothing, but if you give it a try, I think that's not a bad idea too.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"5752ed49c3a3680e8600247d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5752ed49c3a3680e8600247d","movie_id":284289}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> One night adventure with a stranger!\r\n\r\nIn his 15 year old acting career it was the Chris Evan's first direction. Many actors had tried that and only a few had succeeded, but some of them just preferred a low cost, simple project to avoid a major disaster. He also produced it and acted alongside the British actress Alice Eve. The film was a one night event based theme which begins when a young woman misses her train, and later forced to spend the night with a stranger after her purse got stolen. During lots of time left for the next train, theirs little adventure begins as they embark around the city.\r\n\r\nThis is really a solid film. Well written screenplay and performed with a beautiful night adventure in the city that never sleeps. The problem with me was, I had seen many similar flicks, so this one looked okay, in a good way, but not that awesome. Still a fine film and definitely highly recommend others who like drama-romance. The plus point was the actors, the chemistry was brilliant. The story was very good, yet like I said it was so simple.\r\n\r\nIt was not just two who meet and develop a friendship or a relationship, but they both reveal their story behind their visit to the city. At first it was a casual disclose, but the true reason comes out when they begin to trust each other and feel comfortable. So each of their tale has a small twist in the same night to overcome that was troubling them for some time. The film makes the impression that they two are made for each other, but only the final scene reveals how their destiny ends when the dawn breaks out. Not so clever, but an enjoyable little gem, maybe a perfect film for the date night.\r\n\r\n6.5\/10","id":"57951bf39251412ba30012dd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57951bf39251412ba30012dd","movie_id":283350}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Birdman of Won Wron Correctional Centre.\r\n\r\nRight from the very first scene I knew this was going to be a special type of prison film. Mother nature in all her glory, a bird of prey elegantly gliding through the air in pursuit of its target, then bam! Trapped in a fence, cut to a prison van, a prisoner menacingly staring down a frightened young man, himself trapped, but a wise old bird of years and years of incarceration experience sidles up alongside the youngster, about to take him under his protective wing. The healing of the title begins, for man, boy and creatures, a metaphor heavy narrative that thankfully is beautifully written and portrayed.\r\n\r\nDirected by Craig Monahan, who also co-writes the screenplay with Alison Nisselle, this Australian film stars Hugo Weaving, Don Hany, Xavier Samuel and Mark Leonard Winter. Music is by David Hirschfelder and cinematography by Andrew Lesnie. Story follows a small group of prisoners working in a penal system approved rehabilitation of injured birds of prey programme. But outside of this harmonious circle lay differing problems, bully boy cons trying to muscle in with their poison, and then there is serrated family ties outside the prison gates that seem impossible to be healed...\r\n\r\nThroughout the pic there are broken beings, inmates, creatures and wardens, all in need of redemption or a restart in life. There's a lot going in the story as such, but it all makes for a gratifying whole because the makers have taken their time to build the characters. Tech credits are excellent, with the performances of the lead actors leading from the front. Weaving giving high end professionalism as the emotionally troubled main guard is something of a given, while Samuel (The Loved Ones) looks like he is about to build himself a worthwhile career.\r\n\r\nThe film, however, in human form belongs to Hany, who gets the plum role of Iranian Viktor Khadem, the old lag who is the centre of the story. His accent sometimes sounds more South African than Iranian, but his ability to say so much with pained visual ticks and a becalmed delivery of crucial dialogue really cements the heart of the story's worth.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, Lesnie's wide angled photography does justice to the surroundings when the story goes outside of the prison walls into the outback, and of course the grace of the birds is given appropriate splendour. Which leads to bird trainer Andrew Payne, who along with editor Suresh Ayya, deserves a mighty pat on the back for ensuring that Healing is beating a true heart from all standpoints. \r\n\r\nThis is a lovely film waiting to be discovered by grown ups who are able to get involved with the thematic beats of the story and accept its deliberate pacing in the process. 8\/10","id":"5517da6ac3a36862f900369f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5517da6ac3a36862f900369f","movie_id":254143}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"A fairly entertaining movie but Hercules as most people know the story it is not. The movie blurb above from Paramount is at least fairly honest in calling it a \u201crevisionist take\u201d. Most other commercial texts talk about the legendary twelve labors and in general makes you think that Hercules is \u2026 well Hercules. Do not be fooled. Most of this movie goes to some length to portray Hercules as a normal man, unusually strong for sure but certainly no demigod, that have created the myth surrounding him himself with the help of his friends. If you are into Greek mythology and do not like it messed with this movie is not for you. It is a classical Hollywood rewrite focusing on action with little respect for anything else.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, it is not the total disaster as is normally the result when Hollywood makes \u201ctheir take\u201d on something classical. Hercules and his team are a fairly charming bunch of hard hitting rascals. The revised story is not really all that bad. Simple and predictable of course, it  is a Hollywood action movie after all, but it works fairly well.\r\n\r\nThe movie is an action movie so naturally the main reward of this movie are the action scenes which are fairly good. Over the top, unbelievable and devoid of any form of actual military strategy of course but still quite entertaining. Whoever wrote the scenes having Hercules and his friends running around in the middle of huge battles without much in terms of protection while the rest of the army huddled down in this famous shield wall formation is no genius, military or otherwise, that has to be said. Well, at least it got Hercules some head bashing moments.\r\n\r\nIf you are a fan of action movies and are prepared to put your brain in park and just enjoy the show this is a rather entertaining movie. At least this is my take on it. Some of the scenery is quite beautiful, even slightly breathtaking. It never really feels slow and the acting is on a level suitable for the movie. A slightly above average Hollywood \u201crewrite\u201d I would say.","id":"5a58f7890e0a2634fc00e57a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a58f7890e0a2634fc00e57a","movie_id":184315}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Chase your life (dream), don't let it chase you away.\r\n\r\nA multinationally produced film product. The story as well won't take place in one place, but travels around the different continents. It is when 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' meets 'The Ultimate Gift'. A very inspiring theme, made by 'Serendipity' director which is his first film since last five years. Looks like it is his career best, at least in my perspective it is. The film talks about the different human moods, especially about the search for happiness as the title suggest.\r\n\r\nBeing I am a movie fanatic, I won't watch great flicks every day. It is not easy to come by, sometimes I have to go through 5 movies, sometimes 10 and sometimes a month long wait. In my recent watch I liked so many flicks, but never considered them as my favourites until this one. Like I said its been months and I am super excited with this film.\r\n\r\nAs usual, my nemesis, the critics led it to the box office flop. I am saying the same thing that it's definitely not suit for critics, but families (excluding kids) and mainly middle-aged people. It will be too early for children to understand the movie and there is a nudity, but no sex scenes. The old people can enjoy watching it, but won't inspire them like 'The Bucket List' did.\r\n\r\n> \"Do you have any children, doctor?\r\n> My husband and I, it was our only regret. We couldn't.\r\n> But, you know what? It was bloody good fun trying.\"\r\n\r\nUsually for the western countries, self-discover means visiting India. We have seen movies like 'The Darjeeling Limited', 'Eat Pray Love' and many more that focuses on the similar subjects. This film gets rid of that so called cliche and goes ahead with different locations. The title character Hector goes for a such mission looking for happiness through self-discovery, meets different people and their cultures. Even he undergoes several life threatening situations and also meets his past (people) only to clear his head.\r\n\r\nHector was a very fond of Tintin comic books, he kind of imagines that he's Tintin and his dog as Snowy, but there's no confirmation in this regard in the movie. The adventure he takes exactly depicts what Tintin stories do. Looks his mood was kind of affect since his childhood. In the opening scene, he loses his dog which represented his 'Happiness'. Also, where the 'Unhappiness' (probably his girlfriend in his real world) rose above and tailed him since. These are simply my theory considering unexplained things or trying to crack down the hidden messages.\r\n\r\nI won't deny that some of the ideas were borrowed from the other flicks. It might not be as fancy as 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty', but it had some of its own great momentum like, laughs, craziness, emotions, romance and adventures. I have not seen Simon Pegg's all the movies, but in this he was never seen before avatar. I'll definitely remember it for him as long as I'll be in this film watching business. I was expecting his usual comedy, but I was absolutely blown away for witnessing an uplifting movie. If you focus deeply on the narration, you could virtually experience passing through all those provinces shown in the film. Definitely one of the top 10 films from the year 2014. I highly recommend it, certainly a must watch.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"566ee96692514125d300a9db","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/566ee96692514125d300a9db","movie_id":254375}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Homeless and drug addiction, with the backdrop of a little romance.**\r\n\r\nThis film reminds me the Al Pacino's 'The Panic in Needle Park'. The independent filmmakers Safdie brothers directed it that inspired by the real life story of Arielle Holmes, who also starred in the lead role. This is definitely a depressing film, seeing those faces, eyes, makes sick. But a very realistic film, kind of aimless plot, till the final quarter and then with a small twist, the tale comes to an end.\r\n\r\nI have seen it and if you ask me about the story, I say its hard to describe, but it can be only watched like a documentary film. Over ninety minutes, the film revealed the life of homeless people. Like from their day beginning to the nightfall, how they make it and their preferences. So it is not an inspiring film, though at least there's something you can learn about them.\r\n\r\nAfter knowing the theme, I thought there would be lots of violence like rapes, stealing, cops and maybe killing. Surprisingly, it was none of those, not exactly, except drug addiction and sometimes stealing to buy drugs. Looks like from this film, the actress got a breakthrough, particularly in her life. I hope its turnover from hereon. I appreciate the directors for that who made a difference in someone's life. Don't think it is a film for entertainment, watch it if you are interested in the documentary film. So it's not for everybody, but some will find it good or maybe decent.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"581cfa9892514135d40016ac","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/581cfa9892514135d40016ac","movie_id":285024}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> About how a terrible event changed the judicial system.\r\n\r\nThe name Angelina Jolie on the poster draw my interest on this one. She was executive producer of this excellent Amharic movie. I appreciate her side of contribution to lift the world cinema. Some of the stories go unheard, because they are happening in the remote places of the earth, far from the modern cities and countries. Newspapers, media might fail to report them in a long-range, because it is less interested in the other side of the world, but movies like this ensures the outreach.\r\n\r\nI think this is my first Ethiopian movie. All the cast and story take place in this landlocked East-African country. The narration often switches between a small village and the capital city. Based on the real and historical even about one of the oldest blind belief over marrying a girl when she and her family denied the permission. It's set in the year 1996, the story of a 14-year-old girl Hirut who'd successfully escaped from her abductor, but not without a blow en-route. Now she's facing a charge which she had done in self-defence and the rest is her fight in the court of law.\r\n\r\nAs usual, everything is fine in our society, so things won't change and it does not have to, until something terrible happens. As to what this film talks, the law was not written in a single day and some of them are overlaps with traditional culture which definitely need a serious reconsideration. It keeps changing until finding a correct solution. Take our society as an example, now the homosexual and marijuana laws were getting friendlier than ever. This story is another example of patching the loopholes in the law. It might come after a horrible incident, but makes sure that it won't repeat.\r\n\r\n> \"I can't even protect my little sister.\r\n> They will get her one day.\"\r\n\r\nThe entire film was not a courtroom drama, but people's bonding and cultural exposure. Actings were wonderful, especially the main two characters, Meaza and Hirut. The pace and focus was largely on the topic, but a few glimpses of landscapes of the countryside made me wonder how beautiful the Ethiopia is. I think the cinematography was at its best. This film has been officially submitted for the last concluded Oscars (2015), and in my view it should have been nominated for the main event instead of 'Timbuktu'.\r\n\r\nI thought it was a tale about some westerners who comes to help the little girl, or maybe adopt her, kind of stuffs. But it was purely a uni-national, uni-racial, its society and flawed judicial system which might give you a shock. After opening 30 minutes, I was pleased to have picked it to watch and ended highly satisfied when it ended. The conclusion was very emotional, especially the lines Hirut said was reflected what she went through and might going repeat for other girls.\r\n\r\nThis is highly recommended by me. This film needs viewers, to learn what's really happening out there. Especially in a male dominated society, how the children and women are coping to stand on their own feet. Because of the brave attempt by the brave women, the changes have come and building a better future for the next generation. So hats off to the director-cum-writer, producers and all the above those two ladies who are still carrying out their works to help the struggling women as the final report from film says. I think you won't regret watching it, so why don't give it a try.\r\n\r\n8\u00bd\/10","id":"567c339c92514131df0012fa","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/567c339c92514131df0012fa","movie_id":245855}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A story of Sue, surrounded by the legal conflict.\r\n\r\nEveryone has something to remember their childhood and cinema is one of the sectors to talk about. In my time it was 'Jurassic Park'. The first film to give a perfect picture of either visual graphics or the characteristic behaviours and much more. So I proudly say I grew up being a fan of that movie and got a special interest in the Tyrannosaurus Rex. There are many varieties, but T-Rex is the many people's favourite, as well as mine. This documentary movie is about the same species and I was delighted to learn more about it.\r\n\r\nI was ready for the adventurous ride, the film opened with the dialogue which states that we are surrounded by the past. Moves on with a team of paleontologist discovering the 13th T-Rex in the human history nicknamed Sue. The recovery percentage is higher than the previous 12 specimens. Listening to their interviews of what they are saying with their enthusiasm and eagerness on the find, gives us the goose bumps. It was going well, suddenly after the 30 minutes it switched from scientific study and research to the legal battle to save the Sue. I did not expect it and I don't want the trial and courtroom drama. I did not have a choice, but had to finish my watch.\r\n\r\n> \"So you look up and you're looking at the past,\r\n> and then you look down and you're looking at the past.\"\r\n\r\nWhat comes next was the interesting stuff. The intervening of the federal government was actually the film, the truth that many people did not know. The fight for Sue begins. We would know with our commonsense what's legal and illegal by the end of the half movie, but taking side is the tough part. Because at the one end sympathy for emotional attachment and the other end legislation that everyone has to bow. Soon you would forget the Sue, since the scenario completely changed and you would be no clue where it will progress from there. As from the perspective of the paleontologists who found Sue, it is heartbreaking. And as a public eye, the allegations are just the misuse of power.\r\n\r\nIt had a dark humour as well, like two dogs fight for a piece of bone. But in reality, someone has to go down and the price was big. America's U-turns and wrong decisions either internal or the external affairs is not the first time to showcase in a movie or the documentaries. As a movie fanatic, Charles Chaplin's exile was the hardest thing I ever disliked about America. These peoples, including Peter Larson from this documentary are the exceptions for their achievements. There they have failed, at least I expect them to give a right credits.\r\n\r\nThere was actually no case, just a mishandled situation that stretched to a decade long. In a couple of parts it confirms like when a prison guard says 'Man, you must have really pissed somebody off'. In another case, it was the real Ph.D paleontologist, Robert Bakker, who praised the technics and expertise of Peter Larson team and called they are not pirates. But did not support openly as he knew legal limits was crossed by them. Watch this just to know the truth about Sue and men behind unearth her. A good documentary film, but you won't learn scientific terms other than it was Sue's struggle from the day she was seized by the FBI to the journey to a museum. If she was alive, no one wanted to claim her, rather run for a life.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"55c656df92514105d8000533","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55c656df92514105d8000533","movie_id":249170}
{"author":"tmdb39513728","content":"Remedial Dystopia\r\n\r\nI'm not a big fan of YA lit. Nothing like it when I was young. I grew up with Kesey, Huxley, Salinger, Dickens and The Who. I probably would have liked a steady diet of teen vampires and young dystopians. I would have loved my comic book heroes on the big screen in 3D. And video games and smart phones and search engines. Oh to be a millenial! \r\n\r\nI was introduced to a truckload of Young Adult Lit during English Ed studies and found myself wanting to read _Catcher in the Rye_ all over again. There was just something really amateurish and disposable about these novellas. Like the authors weren't fully-developed writers. Nor am I all that interested in movies adapted from these novels, unless they are packed with talent (_The Hunger Games_), or star someone I just can't get enough of. That someone at the moment is Shailene Woodley. A young woman who is just oozing talent. She has that authentic, subdued strain of self-consciousness, it makes you forget she's in a movie. In fact, her focus seems to come so unassumingly natural I wonder if she even knows she's in a movie.\r\n\r\nI watched _The Fault in Our Stars_, The Spectacular Now and _Divergent_ in succession. _Divergent_ is getting short-changed by the same critics who praise _The Hunger Games_. Yes, it's simplistic, essentially a shallow allegory. Factions representing classes, institutions and vocations. The coercion of the Dauntless by the Erudite as a military coup. And rebellious adolescents as heroic Divergents. But if this gets kids even remotely interested in politics and the social sciences, I'm all for it. I'd prefer this to bare-chested werewolves and forest warfare. Then again, there's no defending _Divergent_ if it weren't for Woodley's splendid presence. Her inner strength mixing in with her vulnerability. She provides the suspense, as we are always awaiting her next reaction. Makes me wonder how she'll develop in the years to come? As well as Kate Winslow has I'm sure.","id":"54d9077fc3a3687ab500004e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54d9077fc3a3687ab500004e","movie_id":157350}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I should probably mention right away that I have not read the book-trilogy that this movie is based on. Given the content matter I might actually have liked the books. The movie? Well to me the movie was a rather mediocre one. As the blurb states the story is set in a dystopian future but we do not really get to know how they got there except the standard explanation that \u201cthere was a war\u201d. The world is a bizarre mixture of primitive post-apocalypse living and modern, futuristic tech. The division of people into factions\u2026well to me it felt pretty dumb to begin with and the idea that some people could not possibly fit into more than one faction was absolutely ludicrous to me. How the hell was it supposed to keep peace by deliberately factioning people against each other?\r\n\r\nOkay, trying to get over these gripes, what about the rest of the movie. Well it was okayish I guess. It did give me the same feeling as when reading a young-adult book and I would say that this movie is most suitable for a younger audience. The story is rather predictable. There is the initial training part where Tris of course gets a few friends and in particular befriends one of her tutors. Not surprisingly there is also the obligatory jerk. The one thing that makes the movie a bit out of the ordinary are the induced dream sequences which are not too bad.\r\n\r\nLater in the movie Tris starts to discover the plot of the bad guys and of course goes off to save the day. Again these part are simple and predictable. The ease by which Tris and a few of her friends manages to infiltrate the lab\/headquarters of the baddies is rather unbelievable. It of course helps that it seems like it is only the good guys who can shoot straight or fight worth a damned with a few occasional exceptions when the script calls for it.\r\n\r\nThe movie is, as far as I understand it, based only on the first book in the trilogy so it is perhaps not very surprising that it ends with a lot of loose ends but, for Christ sake, they fight their way to stop the plot, taking down a lot of people on their way, and then they leave the chief mastermind of this despicable plot lying unconscious but alive on the floor just taking off. That just felt dumb!\r\n\r\nIt is not a bad bad movie but I do not understand the high ratings some people seem to give it.","id":"53f0530e0e0a2675a9002e4c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53f0530e0e0a2675a9002e4c","movie_id":157350}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Why must Hollywood scriptwriters of some genres of movies, especially monster, superhero and horror movies, so often think that the audience are total idiots? Or maybe they themselves are severely lacking in brainpower and do not understand the level of trash in what they spew out. In Godzilla scriptwriter Dave (David) Callaham should have a special dishonourable mention for ruining a promising movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie started of with the obligatory nuclear power plant scenes. When it started I first thought, oh no not the blame nuclear power scare again. However, as it turned out, this was not so. Unfortunately, this was pretty much the only good part in the entire script. The rest of the script is just a collection of illogical, unintelligent garbage.\r\n\r\nIt starts quite quickly when Ford\u2019s father suddenly pulls of his mask, takes a sniff, and declares that there is no radioactivity in the air. Only a scientifically ignorant idiot writes something like that. Then we have the scene were the soldiers rush into The Nevada nuclear waste facility and checks the inspection hatch on every door until they find one where there is a light only to discover that the monster have broken free and left a gargantuan hole. A huge monster have broken through the walls of a nuclear waste facility leaving a whole big enough to drive a battleship through and no one would have noticed until some marines goes around and inspects the doors on the inside? Again, you have to be pretty unintelligent to write a scene like that.\r\n\r\nThe entire plot is basically the same unintelligent mess. They follow the creatures around until they reach civilization. First then do they actually try and do something. That is just so nonsensical. In the case that a huge city-destroying creature would approach any large population center it would be blasted way before it reached it. Also, when they do attack they fire some light weaponry and maybe a tank gun or two against it. If millions of people were at risk I think it is not a very far fetched belief that the military would throw everything they had at the threat. And do not get me started on the hair-brained scheme of luring out the monsters to the sea with a nuke. What a load of bullocks!\r\n\r\nOkay, so with all this ranting, why did I give the movie as much as 6 out of 10 stars? Well, I am a fan of huge monster movies and the parts where the monsters rampage around destroying things or slugging it out against each others are great. Unfortunately this is pretty much the good that can be said about this movie.","id":"541e7d39c3a36801ea000e7a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/541e7d39c3a36801ea000e7a","movie_id":124905}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The combination of good people and bad money!**\r\n\r\nMuch better film than I expected. Looks kind of a French thriller, but based on the novel of the same name. It revolves around a young American couple who moved to London, where they're on the verge to lose the inherited house after the severe debt. Luckily they find bundles of money from their dead renter. Since it was a bad money they wait for the right time to spend it, but what follows is their nightmare who ends up running away from the most dangerous men.\r\n\r\nThis is really a good story and a well made film, but I don't understand how it was so underrated. Obviously the critics did their job like usual, but the film fanatics turning it down as well which is a very sad. I know it feels so familiar, but very entertaining with lots of edgy moments. Especially the final battle between all the group at one place was very good, yet they kept it so simple. Both the lead actors were fantastic, including a small contribution by Tom Wilkinson.\r\n\r\nIt is a small story, that mostly takes place in a week. But the pace was excellent and it comes to the point without making any delay in the form of development. Yet there remains some mystery like how the guy died in the couple's rented apartment. Excluding those which only brings clich\u00e9 if it goes deeper, the film definitely worth watching and I feel happy for watching a good thriller after a long time. So I recommended it.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"57d30b45c3a3681ff20008d3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57d30b45c3a3681ff20008d3","movie_id":262338}

Rotten Tomatoes: 74% on the meter (average 6.6\/10); 67% liked it from 171,052 audience ratings.\r\n4. I saw this film off DVR from Cinemax.\r\n5. Directed by: Gareth Edwards.\r\n6. **Starring**: Bryan Cranston as Joe Brody, Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, Juliette Binoche as Sandra Brody, Sally Hawkins as Dr. Vivienne Graham, Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ford Brody, Carson Bolde as Sam Brody, David Strathairn as Admiral William Stenz, Elizabeth Olsen as Elle Brody.\r\n7. Demographic targets: Godzilla fans, action fans, international market.\r\n8. (from Box Office Mojo) Estimated production budget, 160 million USD.  Estimated gross revenue as of 01jan2015: States, 200.7 million USD (38%); overseas, 328.0 million USD (62%).\r\n\r\n**Setup and Plot**\r\n\r\n1. In the opening sequence, Joe Brody, his wife Sandra and son Ford are in Japan. Joe and Sandra work at a project that aims to contain some unexplained phenomena involving huge amounts of energy and a partially buried large object.  The object turns out to be living, breaks much of the containment apparatus, and causes widespread tragedy.  A heavier blanket of secrecy is applied.\r\n2. Jump forward to the present.  Ford is grown up, is in the US armed services, and has a wife Elle and son Sam in San Francisco.  Ford gets a call from Joe, then goes to Japan to get him out of jail.  While Ford helps out Joe, the object (a 'muto') revives, breaks free this time, and flies away, leaving even more destruction and death than in years before.\r\n3. A second, larger muto awakens in Nevada.  The two mutos are tracked by the US Navy, which is now actively involved.  The mutos' activity awakens Godzilla from his long slumber in the Pacific.\r\n4. Ford and Dr. Serizawa are drawn into the military's quest to contain the mutos.  Elle and Sam are at risk as the three giants converge on San Francisco.\r\n\r\n**Observations**\r\n\r\n1. True to tradition in Godzilla movies, human activity is depicted as futile.  Most human efforts against giant monsters have no noticeable effect.  The rest of our efforts catalyse the monsters to rain down more destruction on human cities and military personnel.\r\n2. In a few of the many Godzilla films I have seen, a child is rescued, or a trapped helpless person is released.  But for each such action, thousands of human lives are lost, and tens of billions of dollars of real estate value are zeroed out.  The contrast accentuates the helplessness of the human race against forces it cannot control and never will control.\r\n3. In a slight departure from what I'm used to in the Godzilla universe, a human being does something that will make the survival of the human race more likely. Watch the film; you can't miss it.\r\n4. Godzilla causes a huge amount of property damage and loss of life, though not nearly as much as the mutos cause. The case could be made that Godzilla in this film, as in many others, is indifferent to the fate of the human race. He does in the mutos in order to get back to his snooze beneath the Pacific.\r\n5. **One line summary:** Godzilla saves humanity from the mutos in an 8 minute appearance.\r\n6. Three stars of five.\r\n\r\n**Scores**\r\n\r\n1. **Cinematography**: 8\/10 Some of the SFX were cheesy, but most were fabulous.\r\n2. **Sound**: 7\/10 Few complaints.  I could hear the dialog.  The music was not too irritating.\r\n3. **Acting**: 6\/10 Bryan Cranston, Ken Watanabe, Juliette Binoche, David Strathairn, and Sally Hawkins were fine in their limited roles.  Aaron Taylor-Johnson's performance was both boring (beginning) and believably heroic (toward the end), so I ended up liking him.\r\n4. **Screenplay**: 6\/10 The director stayed true to the franchise, but with updated SFX and a few other adjustments.  The holes in the plot, though, seemed endless.","id":"550f1e9ac3a3683e7f003270","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/550f1e9ac3a3683e7f003270","movie_id":124905}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"The big atomic lizard gets another make over.\r\n\r\nBack in 1954 Ishir\u00f4 Honda introduced to the film world Gojira, a creature that is still today seen as viable cinematic interest. Gojira, in spite of being a man in a rubber suit monster movie, is a smart and feisty film. Tapping into an oppressive nuclear age via moody atmospherics, whilst simultaneously imbuing plenty of creature feature carnage, it got the balance right. The makers of Godzilla 2014 have tried to do the same, they look back fondly to the original wave, pay it respect, but sadly they don't quite pull it off.\r\n\r\nPlot essentially finds the world under attack by some Kaiju (MUTO) monsters after humans keep dabbling in all things nuclear. The end is nigh, that is unless mankind can find an ally in Godzilla, an almighty prehistoric type lizard who itself is a product of some prior nuclear shenanigans.\r\n\r\nThe human plot strands feature the usual secretive government suits mixing with science guys, all looking worried or running around in a fretful state. There's a father and son axis - with the son a bad ass army guy who has a loving wife and child back home. Characters are many, and they take up a good portion of the film, unfortunately very few of them are interestingly written, which is a shame given the pic is packed with acting talent.\r\n\r\nIt's a two hour plus movie, with the build up being very prolonged, with Zilla not showing up till the hour mark. This renders the main monster as a bit player in its own movie, a mistake often made by others in many a sequel to Honda's original. There's also the irritating fact that what all good Zilla movies need is a shed load of monster mayhem, plenty of smack-downs, but sadly they are in short supply here and are often rendered as background staples. Until the finale that is.\r\n\r\nIt takes a long time to get there, and thankfully saving the pic from below average hell, it's not a let down. It thrills and opens up the eyes and ears considerably, and fans of all things Zilla will get goosebumps upon the arrival of the electrical charge and breathing of nuclear fire sequence. But with that comes the annoyance that the good technical craft within the piece has previously been used sparingly, the decision to put bland characters at the forefront instead of cinema's most famous monster proving to be a huge error.\r\n\r\nThe makers have to considerably up their game for the planned sequels that will feature other legendary creatures. 6.5\/10","id":"565b6312c3a36850740037bc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/565b6312c3a36850740037bc","movie_id":124905}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A modern warfare and its effect on the family of a person who involved in it.**\r\n\r\nI like this director's films, because he writes the screenplay for all his films and each were so different with cleverness in narration. Sadly, this is the first one I didn't like. It was very similar to the 'Eye in the Sky', but came before than that and with a stretched storyline. It centres on Thomas, a pilot for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) stationed at an air base in Las Vegas, but fighting combat in the middle-east. Every day he's bombing at the terrorist makes him quite uneasy when the innocents get killed. And on the other hand, failing to handle his family with his professional distress brings more complication and how it ends are the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nIn my view I think the overly sentimentalised great film concept destroyed it. The emotions work fine in the war themes, but here it gives a wrong idea over battle against the terror outfits. Because of a combat officer with the sympathetic mind, that considered as the weakness of a soldier. So it all begins with the writing, if one wants to make a war film, a modern warfare, relying on this kind of storyline brings only anti sentiments from the soldier's perspective and we the people who love our nation.\r\n\r\nI understand when the main film characters are not physically present at the actual battleground, not easy to draw a good story out of it. And due to the complete absent of a soldier getting injured in a crossfire, they wend for different kind of emotional dealing. The only thing that made me sense was the sexual abuse parts and how it was taken care later. Good actors, good direction, but a weak story and shortfall of some good thrill moments makes it an average.\r\n\r\n5\/10","id":"57d30774925141548d0006dd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57d30774925141548d0006dd","movie_id":253626}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Goli Soda is about four friends (orphans at that) who try to create an identity for themselves, their romance and their fight against a big shot who wants to squish them beneath his feet because their action inadvertently has resulted in a loss of face for him. If this reads like the plot of a typical masala movie, you are not wrong. Goli Soda IS a masala movie. But what sets it apart and even makes it one-of-a-kind is that its protagonists aren't grown-up 20-somethings but adolescents, early teens to be specific. There have been Hollywood films that have transposed the sensibilities of a regular genre movie to ones that have kids as the principal characters, like Brick, Bugsy Malone and Young Sherlock Holmes, but this is probably a first in Tamil cinema.\r\n\r\nHowever, unlike those films, Goli Soda stops with fitting only its young protagonists with adult, mass hero attitudes; the other characters, including the antagonists, are all grown-ups. This does pose a challenge because young boys taking on rowdies can take away the seriousness but Vijay Milton manages to evade this hazard to a large extent by keeping the plot fleet-footed so that we don't dwell on the less believable scenes. That these teenagers are played by the cast of Pasanga is an added advantage. The four boys have grown into adolescents but their acting is as assured as in that film.\r\n\r\nPulli ( Kishore), Settu ( Sreeram), Sithappa (Pandi) and Murugesh (Murugesh) are orphans and thick friends, who make a living doing odd jobs at the Koyambedu market. The two adults who empathize with them are Manthiravadhi ( Imman Annachi, who has a riotously funny scene at the police station) and Aachi ( Sujatha), who is a wholesale dealer at the place. Pulli and Sithappa have romantic interests (Chandhini and Seetha who actually acquit themselves better than typical masala movie heroine), and Aachi spurs the friends to strive and create an identity for themselves. She manages to get them help from NKB ( Madhusudhan, for whom this performance could be a breakthrough), who controls the market, and soon, the youngsters have a fledgling eatery. But trouble comes in the form of Naidu's brother-in-law and right hand man Mayilu (Vijaimurugan), who starts using the place for his illicit activities. Unable to contain their anger at the defiling of their workplace, the four friends take him on, which earns them the wrath of NKB as well, and he badly wants to put them in their place to save his image.\r\n\r\nDespite the familiar storyline, Vijay Milton's script is interesting and at times, unpredictable. The film does take some time to get going and the initial scenes, when the boys try to woo girls like your typical Tamil cinema heroes, are somewhat tedious. But the director shifts gears when the boys start getting responsible. That they do not face any challenge in establishing their hotel and do it in a song is pure filmy stuff but the film knows it all too well and acknowledges this with the remark: paatu mudinjum naama innum periyaalagalye. The dialogues (by director Pandiraj) are a plus, sharp and cheeky. And the manner in which the problems escalate for the protagonists is well realized \u2014 it is gradual in the beginning when Mayilu starts using the place for his activities and worsens exponentially when the lads take him on and NKB comes into the picture. The film also shows that our masala films could be much better without frills like romantic songs. It is only when the director makes his heroes take on over a dozen men that the film turns less believable and we wonder if he could have found a way to make his protagonists use their brains more instead of their brawn to bring down the villain. And, the dues ex machina that the director resorts to when the heroines are being chased by the villain's men towards the end of the film \u2014 they run into a school and one of the goons' daughter who is studying there comes to him causing a change of heart \u2014 is unintentionally hilarious.","id":"53bb16da0e0a2619840002b0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bb16da0e0a2619840002b0","movie_id":252720}

It is convoluted, and you do start to think is this just going over the top, but the end just shows Pike's character to be a damaged high-functioning psychopath.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The last ten minutes is to define the title!**\r\n\r\nTry to expect from the film what the title signifies. Then this will be a decent film to have. As we know there's no big names in the cast, as well as from behind the camera. But the whole film discloses is what people do when their marriage fails, in order to move on. That's not it, there's a message, that it ends with, especially about the children of the splitting couple. Seems it is a nice one from that angle, though overall film is not a clever enough to attract all kinds of viewers.\r\n\r\nWhen his wife suddenly breaks the news that she wants a divorce, the husband in a surprise tries his best to convince her not to, but nothing works. All the separation affair can be solved easily as they have a good understanding. So they try to move on, particularly the father who meets many women, including his old school and college mates. But what they are not seeing is their young daughter who is affected by all this. So where the story heads from there is told in the remaining.\r\n\r\nFor the first time direction, this is not a bad film. A low budget, short film with a simple storyline. Well intended film on what it wanted to say. But nothing was told straight, everything was about not being single, that means dating and sex was the priority. Only in the last ten minutes it tries to turn around. That's where the story and the title overlaps. Really the nice performances, particularly Paul Schneider, who has been seen mostly in the supporting roles. So I think it is worth a watch if you are not forcing yourself.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"585ed29a92514115cd0124b8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/585ed29a92514115cd0124b8","movie_id":261820}
{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"OK, let me start off by saying that the new Godzilla is definitely an entertaining movie and well worth the price of an admission ticket. That is \u2013 so long as you go into it with popcorn-level expectations. Now, it has to be said that the bar, since the most recent attempt by Roland Emmerich in 1998 (which was hilarious at best) wasn't set particularly high, to say it nicely. So in all honesty, with today's budget and special effects, it never had big chance of being that bad. But I have to admit, judging from the trailer \u2013 I thought it would be better.\r\n\r\nIt starts off pretty good. There is proper story build-up and character lay-out. Where we are \u2013 what's happening... It's all there. In fact, the story revolving around the main characters is pretty dramatic from the get-go. Death in the family, trauma leading to obsession over finding the truth surrounding the circumstances. Bryan Cranston is impressive as the family father and science guy. He just knows something is up concerning some big beastie and he won't let up until he figures it out. That is \u2013 if he gets the chance. Something happens around one third into the movie that is a pivotal turning point in the story. I knew this immediately when it happened and in the end I realised that I had been correct.\r\n\r\nFrom this point on, it's out with the story and in with the action. An almost mind-numbing, pummelling assault of non-stop action. I'm not saying it's bad, I'm just saying it's a lot less interesting than it could have been.\r\n\r\nHere's the deal: instead of just one Big Monster, they bring in three. One Godzilla, and two huge insect-like creatures that are only designated as MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Object). Seriously, they couldn't come up with a proper name? And instead of Godzilla being the big threat to mankind, the MUTO are. In fact, Godzilla turns out to be the good guy because he's the only one that can defeat these insect creeps. This story line is factor one in the reason that this movie isn't what it could have been. Factor two is the plot point that these creatures all feed on nuclear energy instead of \"manburgers\". Consequently, the only real threat they pose is the massive destruction they cause in big cities (and obviously, the human lives that become casualties by default). It's because of this that there is never any real sense of threat or danger. They don't hunt us, they don't care about us. All they want is nuclear energy and a place to breed. What's worse is, these MUTO take screen time and attention away from the monster who's supposed to be the main antagonist and namesake of the movie! It might as well have been called \"Big Creepy Insects\" instead of \"Godzilla\"... \r\n\r\nIn the end, what we're left with is billions of dollars worth of collateral damage and a big-ass monster who's really kind of a nice guy. Weird.\r\n\r\nStill, it's certainly not bad. Aaron Taylor-Johnson does his best at looking very serious and all grown up since his Kick-Ass days, although I am certain that this is definitely one of his less compelling roles. The problem is that from the 1\/3 turning point that I mentioned, his character becomes very formulaic and clich\u00e9. Our hero even shares an intimate moment of eye contact with Godzilla in the end... Aww.\r\n_(May 2014)_","id":"58ac459292514158c8013b5c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ac459292514158c8013b5c","movie_id":124905}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> If a mother isn't being one, her own child would doubt her.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian thriller-drama, is going to contend with another nearly 100 movies from the different countries for the upcoming (2016) American Academy Awards. I hope it will make into the final shortlist and my wishes to the cast and the crew. A minimal cast movie, set in an isolated lake house where the 9 years old twin boys and their mother lives. After their mother returning from the major facial surgery, the brothers doubts is she's the same person. They have no choice, but have to go for an unusual route to find out the truth.\r\n\r\nInitially it was very slow, but keeps accelerating since the beginning of the second half and it ends strongly. You have to be an open minded, that is very important especially for this movie. Try to understand what it delivers than what you want see. I mean prediction is okay, but don't assume in a wider aspect. The narration was so simple and you may think the end is so cliche, but the movie does not bother to provide a surprise. Before going to talk about the twist, you have clear a couple of things.\r\n\r\nThe first question you have to answer yourself is what is 'horror' mean to you. The demons? The ghosts? Other creepy creatures? The zombies? Possession and exorcism? Haunted places and objects? Imposter? You know 'terror' is also called 'horror', which is a very close to the 'thriller' than being an actual 'horror'. Different movies explain in a different way, but this movie is not that distinctive from those, except being unconventional in revealing the details related to the story and characters.\r\n\r\n> \"I want you to repeat ten times\r\n> that I'm your mother.\"\r\n\r\nThis film had a few diversions in the name of the genre. That is the reason why it failed to satisfy the horror fans, but so much better without mentioning that around. You have to be careful from the beginning itself, observing closely every scene. Because the storytelling commences with a hint within the first 10 minutes which is equivalent to the twist. You must get it right, or the rest of the narration won't be interesting enough.\r\n\r\nSo it is a one time shot, for the second time watch it won't be that effective. Some people deny the casual twist that comes in the first act which is too early for them and so they expects one in the final section only to get disappointed. Nothing wrong with the audience getting annoyed, but the film being atypical, just changing the order of all the three acts, that's it. The writer wanted the viewers to keep guessing throughout the their watch. That's the twist in the filmmaking, not in the actual film. Other than that it was not a smartest movie with the turnovers to amaze or confuse you.\r\n\r\nI mean it has a proper conclusion, and you would know what it is, but should have to wait for how it's going to take place. I have seen many guys criticising that part particularly, but I felt it was good and made the movie a better product. Definitely one of the best films of the year, especially in my perception. From the posters to the trailer and teaser to the movie, it was being truthful. Never intend to cheat you, except like I said if you assume the things to happen in your way. Specially a big NO to the fancy stuffs like graphics and high pitch sudden sound\/noise that's very common in horror to scare you. If you are a Hollywood fanatic, you definitely miss those doses and blame the movie.\r\n\r\nA great directional debut as well as the twins with the real names on-screen. It got some intense scares, but limits the grossness. Had less dialogues and more in acts. Pretty rare movie and I am surprised that the critics liked this film more than the movie fanatics. But I'm happy that I'm not one of those to dislike it being a movie buff. My only disappointment is the outro scene (the exit scene) (in Hollywood it for kissing) which comes after the conclusion and before the end credit (sometimes, along the credit). I strongly recommend it, and I hope you consider some of the points I wrote in this review, otherwise I barely recommend it.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"56043da092514122be0054f3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56043da092514122be0054f3","movie_id":284303}

And that's why he was outstanding in this movie.\r\n\r\nRosamund Pike acting in this film was pure brilliant and spectacular. She was so good in this role she might get a Oscar nomination for this. Tyler Perry in this movie was actually pretty damn good, and am so surprise saying that because Mr. Perry was in such awful films like: MADEA trilogy, Alex cross and the list goes on. But in this movie he did good.\r\n\r\nWhat this movie does so brilliantly well is how we view media today, because most of the stories you hear on the news might not be true and how the media can spread lies about people and ruining their lives. Everybody always believes what the media says even if it's true or not, because we don't know what that person on the news is going through, and this movie got that message out they so perfectly.\r\n\r\nMy only problem with this movie is Neil Patrick Harris character.
