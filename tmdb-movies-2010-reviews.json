{"author":"Andres Gomez","content":"Lope is a movie with a great cast and ambience placed in the golden age of the Spanish literature.\r\n\r\nHowever, it commits two important mistakes that share with another great production like \"Alatriste\".\r\n\r\nFirst, the story modifies substantiatly the real biography of the main character, trying to make the plot easier while mixing several episodes of his life. It doesn't work.\r\n\r\nSecond, the main character is performed by an Argentinian actor that doesn't speak a standard Spanish from Spain, in contrast with the rest of the cast. That makes the most important part of the film not credible.\r\n\r\nMaybe this second mistake is not so important for the international audience but, for the Spanish one, which I assume is the main target, makes the film a disaster.","id":"50c19d32760ee31a530003f9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/50c19d32760ee31a530003f9","movie_id":48573}
{"author":"Matt Golden","content":"Twin sisters Julia and Sara (each played by Bel\u00e9n Rueda) both suffer from a degenerative eye disease that robs them of their sight; Sara lost her vision completely, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before Julia\u2019s sight follows. The film begins with the death of the blind Sara, apparently being menaced by someone in her home, then hanging herself. Details surrounding Sara\u2019s death don\u2019t add up for Julia, however; why would Sara kill herself? She was scheduled to have an operation to restore her sight, and she just met someone. Julia and her husband Isaac (Llu\u00eds Homar) begin to investigate, but time is running out: Sara may have been murdered, her danger is now turning toward Julia, and the added stress is stealing Julia\u2019s remaining vision ever faster...\r\n\r\nThere are so many great concepts here. The most primary is blindness, and the terror it invokes. Our heroine knows the remaining time she has with her sight is short, and the agony she (and her husband) feels over its loss is palpable. Not content with the mundane horror of blindness, the film ups the ante by putting this woman with ever-dimming sight into a life-or-death struggle to discover what happened to her sister and prevent it from befalling her as well. Few horror films are able put their protagonist in such a nail-bitingly vulnerable position.\r\n\r\nEven fewer horror films, however, have the terrific Bel\u00e9n Rueda anchoring them. Rueda\u2019s performance is incredible, by turns vulnerable, heartbroken, terrified and full of steely resolve. She and Homar have a warm, believable chemistry that informs their performances as a married couple with a devastating disease hanging over their heads. Will he love her when she\u2019s blind? Will he abandon her? He\u2019s sick with worry over the stress and her imminent plunge into blindness. She\u2019s driven by guilt to discover what happened to her sister, even knowing what it may cost her.\r\n\r\nThe film itself is a masterwork of tension and style, including some gorgeous and clever cinematography by \u00d3scar Faura. This is indeed one of the most stylish thrillers I\u2019ve ever seen, particularly a conceit that director Guillem Morales effects around the midway point and is clever, frustrating, and hideously effective. The film eschews (as all the best do) copious blood and gore, and milks the quiet horror of Julia\u2019s predicament for everything it\u2019s worth.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of story beats high-concept enough they may raise your eyebrow after the fact, but when your film is this immaculately-crafted, this terrifying, this effective\u2026who the hell cares? If you\u2019re not on the edge of your seat by the time of the film\u2019s hellishly tense finale, I fear you may require medical attention. Mystery, thriller, horror, character study\u2026the film is all these things and more, blended into an arresting film experience that elicits a full catalog of fears ranging from the mundane to the Grand Guignol.\r\n\r\nJulia\u2019s Eyes is ever more proof of what I\u2019ve been saying: these days, the best horror films speak Spanish.","id":"51ec281419c29551df10a23c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51ec281419c29551df10a23c","movie_id":52274}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"I will hurt someone before they hurt me.\r\n\r\nLondon Boulevard is written and directed by William Monahan. It stars Colin Farrell, David Thewlis, Ray Winstone, Ben Chaplin, Keira Knightley and Anna Friel. Music is by Sergio Pizzorno and cinematography by Chris Menges.\r\n\r\nAfter serving his stretch for GBH, Harry Mitchel (Farrell) returns to his manor and finds gangland boss Rob Gant (Winstone) wants him as one of his charges.\r\n\r\nWritten and directed by the man who co-wrote The Departed, it's not hard to guess what sort of tone London Boulevard is set at. Which for anyone who follows neo-noir will find plenty to like here, not least the stylish and tonally compliant photography of Menges.\r\n\r\nHowever, falling under the neo-noir banner becomes a curse in a way because there are far greater films of this ilk to liken it too. Pic at least does have the courage to not cop out in resolutions, but again there is no surprise factor for the genre faithfuls.\r\n\r\nThe narrative often meanders, shoehorning in Knightley's (underused) harassed actress as a love interest in the process, and London accents are choppy. It also is criminal to have Stephen Graham and Eddie Marsan in your movie and barely give them screen time!\r\n\r\nOn the plus side of things, the violence and dialogue is often taut and tart respectively, backed by a scorching rocky hipster soundtrack. Farrell is good value as a tough guy, Winstone does what he does best, menacing of course, while Thewlis steals the film as a wired cool cat with menace surprisingly lurking in is heart.\r\n\r\nAs a whole it fails to hit all the right spots, but enough in here for neo-noir fans to feed on as an appetiser to a more fulfilling noir meal. 6\/10","id":"5ab8b79cc3a3680a3e02d742","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ab8b79cc3a3680a3e02d742","movie_id":48838}

{"author":"CRCulver","content":"Abbas Kiarostami's last few films were made outside his native Iran, and his 2010 effort CERTIFIED COPY is set in the colourful towns and countryside of Tuscany. Its two main characters have arrived in Italy from elsewhere: a Frenchwoman (never named, and played by Juliette Binoche) has lived in Arezzo for several years now, running an antique shop, while James (William Shimell) is an Englishman invited to lecture on an art history book that he has written.\r\n\r\nAs the film opens, James is in fact giving that lecture, speaking of how a high-quality copy of a work of art may said to be better than the original. He soon meets the French antiques dealer, and the two spend an afternoon touring the nooks and crannies of Tuscany. With the Frenchwoman\u2019s awkwardness and Jame's suave, confident air, Kiarostami is clearly riffing on the romantic comedies of the last two decades. But then the film takes a magical-realist turn: the two begin speaking as if they have been married for many years already. The apparent relationship between the two continues to evolve and morph over the course of the film's 106 minutes (and what seems to be for them just a Sunday afternoon spent together) as Kiarostami broods on the nature of marriage as the years go by: people change over time, a husband and wife will eventually be rather copies of their youthful selves, but will they be copies better than the originals, or a sad mockery of their youthful idealism?\r\n\r\nFor anyone who has been married (people who haven't may not get much of the film), CERTIFIED COPY is a moving evocation of the rigours of staying together with another person, and the shadowy undercurrents of even apparently happy unions. However, I was ultimately left with mixed feelings. Starting this film with a highly didactic lecture was, in my opinion, a bad choice: no audience wants to feel lectured to right off the bat. Then, the script is a bit too conversation-driven, becoming in parts a logorrhea that will overwhelm even viewers who can understand its trilingual French-Italian-English dialogue (it's probably horrible for those who rely on subtitles). Kiarostami could have trimmed the dialogue without sacrificing any part of his message.\r\n\r\nBefore making this film, Shimell had been known only as an opera singer on the stages of Europe. He manages to make the leap to film actor quite well, with all the subtlety that his role requires -- indeed, I know someone quite like James in both background and personality, and Shimell's depiction bore a resemblance so close it was chilling. Juliette Binochedeftly manages to change her mood and bearing instantly to signal another shift in the film's intrigue. In spite of the European setting, much of Kiarostami's personal technique remains (as well as general aspects of the Iranian New Wave like only the voices of minor roles heard, with the characters themselves not shown onscreen).","id":"5b0ae8a20e0a260d890093dd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b0ae8a20e0a260d890093dd","movie_id":48303}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Urban Beasts.\r\n\r\nOutcast is directed by Colm McCarthy and he co-writes the screenplay with his brother Tom. It stars Kate Dickie, Niall Bruton, Hanna Stanbridge, James Nesbitt, Ciar\u00e1n McMenamin, Josh Whitelaw, Therese Bradley and James Cosmo. Music is by Giles Packham and cinematography by Darran Tiernan.\r\n\r\nMary (Dickie) and her teenage son, Fergal (Bruton), are being tracked by Cathal (Nesbitt), a man using dark arts to achieve his quest. But why is he after them? Can Mary's own witchcraft skills keep them protected? And how come the Scottish housing estate that is their latest home has suddenly started suffering brutal murders?\r\n\r\nHow nice to find an independant British horror bringing something refreshing to the genre, that of the occult in a modern day housing estate - and a depressingly bleak one at that. McCarthy and his team fill out their picture to a backdrop of urban decay, with narrative splinters involving doomed love, a battle of the black arts and a beastie secret to will out.\r\n\r\nThere's no rushing going on here, pic is purposely paced slowly, the writing giving us important information in increments. We are only given partial anatomy glimpses of what is comitting the bloody carnage. The key characters have interesting stories of themselves, with two fractured family dynamics at work, while the delve into cryptic rituals and arcane magic as a weapon makes for fascinating viewing.\r\n\r\nThe big reveal of the perpretrator is something of a let down, for although we are introduced to a new looking creature, the effects work is not great - leaving us hankering for a less is more approach. But it's a minor itch, with a cast on form (does Nesbitt and Dickie even know how to be rubbish in anything anyway), and the colour filters set at social realism, Outcast is a surprise winner of a horror movie. 7\/10","id":"5da657e2e6d3cc0013abdbcb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5da657e2e6d3cc0013abdbcb","movie_id":42917}

{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"When I first saw the trailer of Easy A, I wasn't particularly intrigued. It looked like just another high school teenage comedy. But then I decided to watch it anyway (mostly because I wanted to know what all the fuss was about), and it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise! Coincidentally, I had just seen Emma Stone for the first time two days ago, when I watched Zombieland, and I thought to myself, \"Hey this girl seems kind of cool\". But that still wasn't an answer as to why right now I can't read a single magazine without seeing her face somewhere. After seeing Easy A, I finally know. This girl is FUN. She has a great talent for comedy of the driest, most sarcastic kind and a perfect sense of timing. And you've got to love that husky voice.\r\n\r\nEasy A is about a girl, Olive, who's a straight A-student with a flawless reputation, until she tells a little white lie to her best friend about how she supposedly lost her virginity to a guy that doesn't even exist. However, things go awry when this little anecdote spreads like wildfire and all of a sudden she has a reputation of being a hussy. (This plot line demands some suspension of disbelief, because it's obviously very hard to believe that any group of high school students would be shocked at the thought of one of their peers _*having sex*_, but whatever.) Of course, like with any rumour, it changes constantly depending on who you talk to. So before Olive knows what hit her, everybody in school thinks she slept with every guy around. Now here's the twist: once it becomes clear that she can use this newfound reputation to her advantage, she does so to the fullest. Simply put: unpopular guys pay her to PRETEND she had sex with them. Obviously, at some point things get out of hand and she has to find a way to fix it all again.\r\n\r\nThis concept could have been really stupid, if it wasn't for the great screenplay. It is a tribute to classic 80's teenage films including, of course, John Hughes, and it also features some great references to The Scarlet Letter and Sylvia Plath. The dialogue is quick and witty, and the characters are all really typical people without being clich\u00e9 stereotypes. Stanley Tucci is a delight as Olive's dad, bringing the same kind of dry-as-a-bone humour to the table as his on-screen daughter. Patricia Clarkson is a wonderful actress, and as it turns out, a really funny one as well. All the actors are perfectly cast.\r\n\r\nOne of the funniest elements in Easy A is a group of Christian students, the 'Jesus freaks'. The leader of this little group is a girl called Marianne, played by Amanda Bynes. She just can't stop preaching to Olive about her 'indecent behaviour' and the dialogue between the two provides some of the funniest moments throughout the film. Here's a small foretaste; Marianne: \"There's a higher power that will judge you for your indecency.\" Olive: \"Tom Cruise?\" \r\n\r\nOverall, this is mostly a 'chuckle' comedy rather than a 'rolling over the floor laughing' comedy, though it has some really good LOL moments. And the 'chuckles' are widespread.\r\n\r\nI would definitely recommend watching Easy A if you're in the mood for a witty, intelligent comedy about a smart, sassy girl who takes control of her own life and everybody who thinks they have a right to think badly about her.\r\n_(September 2011)_","id":"58ac431592514158df0135bc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ac431592514158df0135bc","movie_id":37735}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Bloody and Bloody Hilarious.\r\n\r\nTucker & Dale vs Evil is directed by Eli Craig who also co-writes the screenplay with Morgan Jurgenson. It stars Alan Tudyk, Tyler Labine, Katrina Bowden and Jesse Moss. Music is by Michael Shields and Andrew Kaiser and cinematography by David Geddes. Plot has Tudyk and Labine as two harmless mountain\/country men who head to their newly acquired vacation home in the woods to fix it up and get some R & R. But after a misunderstanding at a roadside store with some college kids, who think Tucker & Dale are hillbilly psychopaths, the wheels are set in motion for a bloody battle for survival, but who for?!\r\n\r\nIn 1996 Scream came slashing forward to inject witty life into a fading horror genre, with freshness and inventive splinters from the slasher formula, Wes Craven's movie rocked the horror faithful's world. Tucker & Dale vs Evil will not have the same impact, its limited release and low budget worth ensured it never had a chance of being a big thing, but still it's the freshest horror\/comedy to have come out since Scream made its bloody bow at the box office.\r\n\r\nIt's such a simple idea at the core, you have to wonder why it wasn't thought of before? Craig and Jurgenson have flipped the age old Hillbilly Killers vs Preppy College Kids idea on its head, and in the process smothered it gleefully with dark humour, laugh out loud moments and inventive deaths. There's also some social comedy nestled nicely in the narrative, big points about first impressions and ideas of stereotypes, and hell yes! There's even an opposites attract arc - though that admittedly helps to bog the picture down as the central joke premise runs out of steam towards the end. In fact were it not for a relatively sloppy finale, this would surely be falling into sub-genre classic status. Thankfully all that comes before it is so full of vim and vigour, blood and bluff and fun and frolics, it's not hard to forgive the debut director his one misstep.\r\n\r\nThe neat trick is having the film unfold from the Hillbillies viewpoint, where the carnage that unspools gets increasingly difficult for them to explain, this in spite of their innocence. Each death is logical to the college kids who go on the attack when one of their number, they think, is kidnapped. And it's logical to us the audience as well, were it not for us being privy to these wonderfully funny sequence of events, we too would have them hung, drawn and quartered after a guilty verdict was reached in 10 seconds. This is the ultimate horror\/comedy flip-flop movie. So many funny sequences light up the picture, with a chainsaw scene one of the finest moments to have ever graced a horror comedy movie, but the dialogue, too, is not found wanting in the fun and charming department. Cast are on top form, with Tudyk & Labine a most agreeable double act, where their comedy timing is impeccable, and Bowden & Moss are more than just pretty faces.\r\n\r\nCraig (Sally Field's son) has started with a bang, if he can top this then he is a name to really get excited about. If he can't top it? Well he will at least always have one of the best horror comedy movies on his CV.

Tucker & Dale Vs Evil follows two redneck hillbillies- Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) who head into the woods in the Appellation Mountains so that they can drink some beers, do some fishing and fix up a worn down cabin to turn it into the holiday home of their dreams.\r\n\r\nAt the same time a group of preppy college kids are on a camping trip into the same woods also to have a good time. After a couple of run ins with the hillbillies, they assume that they must be your stereotypical inbred manic chainsaw wielding killers right out of Deliverance or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. So when one of the kids Allison (Katrina Bowden) is rescued from drowning by the hillbillies, prejudice and paranoia reign supreme with the others mistaking it as her being hauled away in a kidnapping attempt. So they embark on a mission to rescue her from her saviours with hilarious consequences.\r\n\r\nDespite the premise of the movie being based on one long running joke of a massive misunderstanding, the story remains fresh and the scenes extremely funny for the majority. I'm not aware of any other movie that has done this type of role reversal with hillbillies in this type of scenario and managed to blend in the right amount of comedy with horror and gore. In fact across all the genres, it is not often that you get to see the perspective of the 'bad guys' (far from it in this film).\r\n\r\nThe best moments come from the writing as we follow the bickering between Tucker and Dale as a bromance emerges on screen. Both Tudyk (aka Steve the Pirate from Dodgeball) and Labine impress making the characters extremely likeable and charming so that by the end you really do care what happens to them. Bowden plays her part solidly as well and definitely brings some eye candy to the film!\r\n\r\nMost of these types of films tend to lose their drama element but this keeps the anticipation and as I said, you end up really caring about what is going to happen to the characters. However, the only major fault that I can pick out is that despite all this, it does begin to fade as a spectacle in the last 15 minutes as they focus a bit too much on the back story and tying up loose ends when what they were doing up to that point was more than enough in my books.\r\n\r\nIt's usually hard to combine the right amount of comedy and horror without creating a somewhat tacky result so credit must go to the new guy on the block- director and co-writer Eli Craig. If you are looking for a unique comedy horror that has a chance of hitting cult status\/settling in nicely behind Shaun of the Dead then you need look no further than this.\r\n\r\nFor more reviews, visit www.ireviewfilms.com","id":"51a43c93760ee33bdc0c0ec3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51a43c93760ee33bdc0c0ec3","movie_id":46838}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Some people have said that this film followed the book better than the original one with John Wayne. I have not read the book but I must say that I did not feel that there was that much difference between the John Wayne version and this one. Sure, there was a difference in the details but the main elements was pretty much the same. There was an epilogue on the end which was a tad more sad, but certainly not misplaced, than in the original film.\n\nI have to say that the film it was very good. Jeff Bridges was doing an excellent interpretation of Rooster Gogburn.

It was good...the ending was somewhat anticlimactic, but the bulk of the film was solid, aided by a terrific performance from Otto Jespersen as a grizzled old troll hunter who works for the government and has been growing increasingly frustrated with their secrecy. The special effects also were incredible (here in 2012, when special effects have progressed so far, for me to mention the special effects in a truly film marks them as something special).

{"author":"Matt Golden","content":"Where do you start with Tron: Legacy? It\u2019s a sequel to a minor cult hit that arrived in theaters 28 years ago, a film more renown for its (at the time) state-of-the-art design than its coherent story or classic characters, rekindled now not as a reboot or remake, but as a direct sequel to that long-ago work.\r\n\r\nTron's esteem may have grown in the intervening years (much the same fate as another maligned-at-the-time science fiction film, Blade Runner), but time has been mostly unkind to it; Disney attempted to stage a run of pre-LEGACY screenings of the original film, but modern audiences greeted its dated appeal as unintentionally hilarious. Frightened by the impact this might have had on their $170 million spectacle, they pulled plans for a theatrical release, and whisked the recent 25th anniversary DVD off of store shelves. And so, bereft of a childhood that contained Tron, I went into the sequel with naught but a Wikipedia plot breakdown (which was, to be honest, frustratingly informative) to fill in what turned out to be largely irrelevant narrative gaps. I say that to say that I am reviewing Legacy solely for Legacy's sake, untainted by nostalgia or high expectations.\r\n\r\nMore than two decades after the events of the first film (which, for the uninitiated, involve a computer programmer [Jeff Bridges, reprising his role] being zapped from the physical world into the computer world he created and fighting an oppressive digital tyrant within), we\u2019re introduced to that computer programmer\u2019s twenty-something kid, heir to his father\u2019s tech empire and not terribly happy about it. It seems he\u2019s still hung up on his father\u2019s mysterious disappearance long ago, and a mysterious message leads to him discovering Dear Old Dad\u2019s secret underground lab, where he\u2019s accidentally zapped into the digital world as well. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not spoiling anything to go ahead and say that within he finds his trapped father, and they must fight their way back out. To give more plot details would be unfair and pointless. Suffice to say that once within the digital realm, it becomes action beat after action beat wherein our young hero rescues dad and his requisite romantic interest until the film ends.\r\n\r\nOh sure, there are good guys, and there are bad guys, and there\u2019s a token stab at depth, but what does it matter? That digital world looks really cool, right? And that\u2019s why we go. The sad truth of the matter, however, is that what looks awesome in a two-minute trailer begins to wear on the eyes when presented long-form. \u201cThe Grid\u201d exists in three colors: neon blue, neon orange, and black. Well, two colors and an absence of color, I suppose. As nifty as this may seem, two-plus hours of this (particularly at the reduced light offered by 3D projection) robs it of interest, and the whole thing becomes a dull slog. 3D works by enhancing depth, but little to no depth is present when the film is lit and shot in such a stylized manner. To boot, only the bad guys are orange. And as our audience proxy characters are good, we\u2019re robbed even of the contrasting orange to break up the monotony.\r\n\r\nThere are some neat sequences, of course: the initial lightcycle battle, a digital dogfight later on, etc. Garret Hedlund and Oliva Wilde are perfectly fine in their frankly bland roles, and Jeff Bridges squeezes what depth he can into his dual characters (actual Kevin Flynn and his twenty-years-younger digital duplicate, thanks to some unnerving but nifty visual trickery). The film is far from the unwatchable dreck of, say, The Chronicles of Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader. It\u2019s just...not very interesting. Techno group Daft Punk\u2019s score was easily the best part of the film, and something I\u2019d actually recommend picking up with no hesitations. At its best, the Daft Punk score and stylized imagery (early in the film, before it wears you down) do provide a unique and imaginative experience. It\u2019s just one fit for the length of a music video, not a feature film.\r\n\r\nBut let\u2019s not kid ourselves: Tron: Legacy is a flashy, ridiculous spectacle that exists solely to put pretty pictures onscreen for two hours and drive a $4+ 3D surcharge. And I say that with no judgment. Some films simply are what they are, and you\u2019ve no more right to expect a dog to meow than to glean from them deep meditations on the human condition. The history of cinema is full of this kind of shallow but aloofly entertaining distraction. But is it wrong to want more of these kinds of films? Take Star Wars, for instance: its strength lies mainly in its revolutionary aesthetic and special effects, but it\u2019s the characters that we remember from the film, not just how cool some set-piece looked. And Lucas isn\u2019t even a terribly good writer; the strength of his characters came from that universal pull all great archetypes have, that ability for audience identification and empathy. Will the name Sam Flynn have the same kind of longevity? What about...uh, Oliva Wilde\u2019s character? Apparently not, at least for me. (Note: IMDb says it\u2019s \u201cQuorra.\u201d) If nostalgia for the first film is strong for you, or you\u2019ve no qualms about paying $14+ for a mildly-distracting if uninvolving experience, go for it. Everyone else may as well save themselves the money. Maybe catch it on Blu-ray.\r\n\r\nI should note, though, that I can honestly say 3D added nothing to the experience, so if you want to be able to actually see in The Grid, save yourself the money and hop into a 2D seat.","id":"51ec287319c295369c3a2e05","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51ec287319c295369c3a2e05","movie_id":20526}

{"author":"Matt Golden","content":"Over their storied career, the Coen Brothers have made some of the most original, most iconoclastic, and most critically-acclaimed films of all time. They've tackled adaptations (No Country for Old Men, O Brother, Where Art Thou?) and remakes (The Ladykillers) before, of course, but even these films have borne the brothers' unmistakable mark of originality, their skewed vision of the world, and their cynical, sarcastic sense of humor.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, to make of True Grit?\r\n\r\nIt's termed a re-adaptation of the original Charles Portis novel, a \"re-imagining,\" in the parlance of our time. One is hardly able to discuss the film without the spectre of John Wayne, however: the best-known adaptation of the book was one of the film legend's definitive roles, one of those cultural touchstones that rarely if ever are engineered. Discussion of that film invariably centers on Wayne and his performance: a washed-up, forgotten cowpoke that seemed tailor-made for Wayne to draw on his position at the time. A direct predecessor of Mickey Rourke and The Wrestler.\r\n\r\nI'll admit that it was the Coens' pedigree that moved me to see this film. I've by nature little interest in Westerns, but despite producing a few lesser films (I'm looking at you, Burn After Reading), the Coens' sheer talent, along with the casting of Jeff Bridges in the John Wayne role, had me intrigued.\r\n\r\nThe story is simple and straightforward: The father of young Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) is murdered by a two-bit criminal (Josh Brolin), and she takes it upon herself to see him brought to justice. To that end, she hires a reputedly ferocious US Marshal named Rueben \"Rooster\" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), while a prideful Texas Ranger (Matt Damon) tags along, hoping to bring the perpetrator to justice for a big reward.\r\n\r\nAnd that's it, really. Completely absent is the trademark Coen plotting, convoluted subplots that twist and turn over onto themselves as though the script were one enormous M\u00f6bius strip (M\u00f6bius script?). Gone are the defiance of genre definitions, the satirical take on stories, the feeling of the brothers Coen peering through the camera lens at their subjects as though they're studying specimens in a jar. This is straightforward filmmaking, telling a simple tale with all the incredible talent and creative power the Coens command.\r\n\r\nSo what's not missing, then, are the richness of character, impeccable performances, beautiful cinematography and arresting score that are the other hallmarks of a Coen film. Attention is naturally centered on Jeff Bridges, having the audacity to take on one of the defining performances of one of the most famous actors ever. Bridges doesn't attempt to mimic Wayne. He crawls into this character and wears him like a suit. A hairy, shaggy, smelly suit. But Bridges inverts the typical presentation of such a character: instead of offering the audience with a cold, unfeeling badass whose heart is gradually thawed by the presence of a precocious youngster, this Cogburn is introduced as a shiftless layabout with a reputation who seems to have all but given up on such activities in favor of sleeping and boozing, the events of the film conspiring to scrape away that useless crust to reveal the force of nature beneath. Matt Damon, an actor who's never been in a Coens film before but seems as though he should have, also offers a great performance as the proud and buffoonish Texas Ranger LeBeouf, as do Barry Pepper and Josh Brolin in their short but effective appearances as heavies.\r\n\r\nBut the yeoman's work lies not on Bridges' grimy, slouched shoulders. Instead, our focus is on fourteen-year-old Mattie Ross, and the performance given by fourteen-year-old Hailee Steinfeld is, in short, one-of-if-not-the finest performance I've seen in quite a long time. Not content with giving such an incredible performance as a young teenager, this is, to boot, Steinfeld's first film performance. Steinfeld's Mattie Ross is smart, wily, mature, childish, scared, brave, and a force of nature in her own right. She has been wronged, she will see that wrong redressed, and nothing will stand in her way. An early scene in which she negotiates with a trader for horses and money is not only hilarious but revealing, one of the best character introductions in film history.\r\n\r\nSuch an unexpectedly straightforward film from the Coens deserves an equally straightforward judgment: I truly loved this film. There is so much greatness contained within it, from the powerhouse performances of Bridges and Steinfeld to the dark, touching, hilarious script, to Roger Deakins' breathtaking cinematography, to Carter Burwell's haunting score comprised of reorchestrations of classic hymns. It's one of the most perfect films I've ever seen. This is the second fantastic remake I've seen this year, the second to eclipse the original (the first being the superlative Let Me In). If you're wondering whether or not to see this film, wait no longer: go immediately to your nearest theater and buy a ticket. Speaking for myself: I can't wait to see it again.","id":"51ec28a319c295369c3a2ed7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51ec28a319c295369c3a2ed7","movie_id":44264}

It's got tonnes o' blood and night skies, so points. An Aboriginal with a half a face actually kills someone with a boomerang (there you go Luke, apparently it is possible!), so points. There's lots of fire, but no explosions, so points. The executive producer is Greg McLean (the kid behind _Wolf Creek_ and _Rogue_) so points. Plus, it's entertaining!\r\n\r\nAnd I mean come on, Steve Bisley's in the damn thing! (the guy who played Goose in _Mad Max_). Ryan Kwanten (_The Knights of Badassdo, True Blood_) and Tom E. Lewis (_The Proposition_) make their presence known as the protagonist and antagonist respectively.\r\n\r\nIt's a little crazy, some sort of...

Nah, better not ruin it. It's good though!\r\n\r\nThe score's great, one of the better I've heard lately. Though some of the more extreme Western elements bothered me (like quick-draws, horseback cops and white cowboy hats, etc.) I was more than willing to forgive these, after all, we as Australians are not yet in a position in the film industry where we can afford not to pander to the Yanks.\r\n\r\nFirst time Director Patrick Hughes certainly is somebody I'll be looking out for in the future, if this first effort is anything to go by. _Red Hill_ is imaginative, clever, bold, no-nonsense and entirely watchable film that I'm more than happy to have in my collection. I wasn't blown away, it was no fresh new thing I'd never see coming, but Bisley's screen presence and the general non-stop awesomeness makes _Red Hill_ it one of the better productions we Australians have unleashed onto the world.\r\n\r\n76%","id":"5a71901f9251417f1c0049ab","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a71901f9251417f1c0049ab","movie_id":45569}

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"The Company Men calmly reflects a recessive economic climate through a downsizing company. Financial stability is the sole craving in everyone\u2019s life. The upper class. The middle class. Every class. The notion to which one will never encounter the fear of losing their personal possessions and their career position. Corporate employees specifically seek the solidity in their salaries, to be able to provide for their own pride and families. When the economic recession devastated the States last decade, its impact was critical. Innocent workers essentially lost their lives, driving themselves into the descent of debt.\r\n\r\nWells\u2019 well-intentioned drama explores the collapse of a shipbuilding corporation, following various employees that have been made redundant and\/or steering the metaphoric sinking ship. It\u2019s an off-beat peculiarity that forces Wells\u2019 direction to be enticing and inadvertently unappealing simultaneously. The characters themselves, particularly Marketing VP Walker, HR Manager Wilcox and CEO Salinger, are insufferably narcissistic. Walker especially who envelops himself in pride, given the immense financial loss he encounters that prevents him from fully supporting his family and being able to play at luxurious golf club houses. The response to his firing, whilst natural in the sense that he refuses to release the life that he leads, abnormally thinks more about himself than his family. The overwhelming aura of egotism, not just from him, constrains these characters to be unlikeable.\r\n\r\nYet the peculiarity in Wells\u2019 execution is that, despite the vehement behaviour, there\u2019s a sympathetic undertone throughout. Not because you relate to the characters, but the scenario instead. Wells delicately leaves several moments to hang, simmering on a bed of dismissal, that forces you to position yourself in the characters\u2019 shoes. With that in mind, he manages to transform the unappealing characteristics of these employees and turn them into tolerable motives. Slowly but surely, through enduring perseverance, opportunities are tackled. And that\u2019s exactly the purpose of The Company Men.\r\n\r\nIt illustrates the tenacity of the human spirit during uncertain times. The orienteering session being a prime example of depicting this motive. Anyone who has been in a situation such as redundancy will relate to this film for its situational representation, not for its characters. That\u2019s no criticism on the acting though, as each performance is competently given without resorting to melodrama. Cooper in particular gave a nuanced and credible performance, that left his character\u2019s fate somewhat unpredictable.\r\n\r\nMy main issue however is the scope of The Company Men. Instead of focussing on just one employee, Wells\u2019 decided to explore the entirety of GTX\u2019s corporate ladder. Whilst harmless for its narrative structure, it did downplay the severity of the recession. Almost making light of the national economic declination. Solely following one employee through this hard time would\u2019ve produced greater character development whilst also tackling the recession from each angle. Wells\u2019 intentions were clear, just didn\u2019t entirely work for me on an emotional level. Fortunately Deakins\u2019 cinematography consistently entranced with his beautiful autumnal shots, but that\u2019s not surprising let\u2019s be honest.\r\n\r\nMuch like precariously balancing on the corporate tightrope, The Company Men occasionally stumbles with its peculiar narrative and character choices yet seemingly gets the job done with assured performances and a heartfelt motive. Remember, remain positive even in the darkest of moments.","id":"5e21da7d397df0001298770e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e21da7d397df0001298770e","movie_id":44129}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Boo-yah, indeed.\r\n\r\nDirected by Breck Eisner and written by Scott Kosar & Ray Wright, The Crazies (2010) is a remake of the 1973 film directed by George A. Romero. It stars Timothy Olyphant, Rhada Mitchell and Joe Anderson. The plot sees a toxic spillage make its way into a small American town's water system and turns some of the locals into marauding maniacs.\r\n\r\nEisner's movie is that rare old thing these days, that of the horror remake that greatly improves upon the original. That might annoy some Romero purists, but the truth is, is that his original film really isn't that great to begin with. Thus it's ripe for a remake, whilst acknowledging that a certain weariness creeps into our thoughts at the seemingly never ending line of horror remakes getting churned out by a Hollywood running out of ideas. Hell I will even venture that we have seen all this before, nothing in this \"Crazies\" will have the horror faithful rushing out to tell their buddies about some overtly cranial splendour piece they have just watched, but this is a very effective horror piece, taut and tense at times, at others sick and splendidly disgusting. Eisner may not be a \"Craven\", or for sure no \"Romero\", but he executes the material with gusto and shows a knack for knowing how to make the material work.\r\n\r\nThe film is structured over three parts. Character formations in the little town of the delightfully small Americana sounding Ogden Marsh, which leads into the infected going doolally. Then it's the army attempting to get things under control. Lastly it's the the fall out as our brave survivors, erm, try to survive and make sense of what is happening. Eisner and his writers even get away with not fleshing out the principal characters. We know Olyphant's Sheriff is a toughie, and that his pregnant wife, Mitchell, is equally resourceful, while the deputy played by the film's standout performer, Joe Anderson, we know is loyal and sharp with a rifle. Who cares about flesh on these bones, let the crazies after them and see how they cope. Where the writers score plus points is with the portrait of a world losing its humanity. The sick are rounded up and contained, nobody cares enough to try and help them, while those sent to restore order, to protect the people, are as dangerous as those bleeding from the eyes and ears.

{"author":"Kenneth Axel Carlsson","content":"Two brothers. Two fighters. One has had his time and his now a junkie - Dicky (Christian Bale), and the other is in the shape of his life, with his career ahead of him - Micky (Mark Wahlberg). The two love eachother, but one is on his way up, and the other is on his way down. Lets just say, it is not without problems. This is based on a true story, btw, and we see the two brothers by the credits (lovely idea, and also shows us how true the actors are to the real brothers).\r\n\r\nThe story is centered around Micky, but we also get a lot of insight into his crazy family, which consists of a mad and devoted mother (Melissa Leo), a hundred sisters and of course, the father who is just trying to survive in the ocean of women. They all mean well, but damn, I am glad my family is different from them. \r\n\r\nI've never (big word in this case, but still) been a big David O. Russell fan. His movies has been a little too... fancy for my liking, and with a weird sense of humor (seriously, I've never understood what why everyone liked Silver Linings Playbook). However, this one really took me by the heart and flipped me around. It is a very emotional story, and the fact that it's a true story, only makes it so much better. Also, the actors are great, especially the two brothers, Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale. They have enough contrasts between them to make it really interesting.\r\n\r\n_Last words... forget the boxing matches. They are ok, but its the story between the brothers that is the real story here. I mean... that last scene with the two being interviewed... that got me so bad. It is a predictable story, but really, I can forgive that, since the rest is so good._","id":"54a0a83ac3a36851ce002615","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54a0a83ac3a36851ce002615","movie_id":45317}

{"author":"Matt Golden","content":"In the immortal words of Col. Kurtz, \"The horror...the horror.\" Marlon Brando wasn't speaking of this film, of course, but rather the horrors of the Vietnam War. The sentiment remains applicable.\r\n\r\nWhen I write reviews, I do try to give at least a modicum of context, be it a history of the film itself, predecessors to its place in cinema history, or my general feelings on the type of film. In this case, I've just referenced Francis Ford Coppola's classic take on Joseph Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness,\" Apocalypse Now. What does that have to do with Dawn Treader? Nothing, and I couldn't be happier. Why? Because it's distracted my mind with thoughts of a far, far better film. Allow me my few moments of happiness before I have to rifle through the dark filing cabinet of my mind to marshal my thoughts on this atrocity.\\\r\n\r\nWhat went so wrong here, you may ask? We'll start with the history of this franchise. I do not have the highest opinion of this series. We started out with the most famous of C. S. Lewis' Narnia cycle, The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe. I don't know...perhaps if we hadn't been in the middle of such a fantasy film renaissance, I would have found it more palatable. Instead, coming on the heels of Peter Jackson's generation-defining Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the high class and quality of the Harry Potter franchise, that weak take on a book series that didn't thrill me as a child struck me as a cheap, childish appetizer compared to the magnificent feasts audiences had already been served, their stories facile, their acting (aside from a typically great Tilda Swinton) either poor or phoned-in (Paging Mr. Neeson, your paycheck is waiting for you). SHREK co-director Andrew Adamson was the helmer of both Wardrobe and Caspian, and I had hoped those film's failings were due perhaps to his inexperience as a director of live-action. The first film of course wore its Christian allegory on its sleeve (Lewis, for all his writings, never managed to find the definition of \"subtle\"), and it found favor with the churchgoing crowd, whose turnout afforded it a huge box office windfall. The second film was more of a straight actioner (in the vein of Star Wars Episode I, which is to say the supposed action was mired in a swamp of facile and achingly dull political machinations), and didn't find purchase with the same demographic, and box office returns were disappointingly low. Disney, who had financed the films, saw the writing on the wall, and dropped the series. That should have been the end of it.\r\n\r\nUntil 20th Century Fox stepped in. Now, let's remember: Fox doesn't have the best track record with adapting beloved fantasy series into films (a moment of silence for the tragedies that were The Dark is Rising and Eregon, please). Hiring Michael Apted as the director seemed to be bucking the trend of shoveling out crap. Apted isn't really known as an action, fantasy, or epic film director, but he showed promise with the last Pierce Brosnan\/James Bond film, The World is Not Enough (I'll not blame him for Denise Richards'...nuclear physicist...sigh). Still, director in place, 20th Century Fox and Walden Media cobbled together another Narnia adventure, and the results were predictably terrible.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I wish I hadn't expected a poor film going in. Because this film not only met but exceeded my expectations of terrible, and it's not because I was pre-judging it. It's because it was simply that bad. The plot is nonsensical, randomly shunting characters from one loosely-connected vignette to the next, with hokey dialogue and dire predictions of eeeevil standing in for actual menace or intrigue. It's a shaggy dog road trip story, waterlogged on a boat, and I found myself half an hour in wishing desperately that the characters would all get scurvy and die.\r\n\r\nThe plot's so thinly-sketched that I may as well not even try to recount it here, but it has something to do with two of the kids from previous films being once again pulled into Narnia at absolute random, with no thematic or plot reason for any of the nonsense in the first place. Once there, our cast is rounded out with their exceptionally annoying cousin, and despite no one knowing quite what's going on, they stumble upon the titular character of the second film, Prince Caspian, and join him on his completely random quest to recover seven old friends of his long-dead father who disappeared for some reason, and no one knows why. So they fight an island made of evil. Good wins, evil is defeated, the end. Please, let it be the end.\r\n\r\nListen: I love fantasy. I love science fiction, I love horror, I love all of the outr\u00e9 genres, the fantastic, the unreal. It fascinates me, and I love wrapping myself in the trappings of the genre like a favored blanket, letting their comforting warmth wash over me in waves of escapism and nostalgia. But this half-assed bunch of hokum had me rolling my eyes, with the stilted dialogue and the hastily-sketched characters and the nonsensical plot and the ARGH it's too much.\r\n\r\nThe icing on this crap cake was the ham-handed, in-no-uncertain-terms Christian allegory with which the film beat the audience over the head with all the grace, power, and strength of an industrial-size sledgehammer. Yes, the evil was SIN. And Aslan is JESUS. Who exists as a lion in an alternate universe or something, apparently. Who pulls children into this alternate universe at random for...no apparent reason whatsoever (the film explicitly states that it's \"to know Him (Aslan i.e. Jesus, in case you didn't already pick up on that) better,\" but if that's the case, why just these four kids? What's the thematic point of this? Why were the elder kids now judged worthy of not having watery allegory poured down their throats again? What did these kids learn at the end of this film that made them better people?\r\n\r\nARGH again. I cannot even begin to catalogue the problems with this series, from either the internal \"logic\" of the series or the external logic of the human brain. Doing so only hurts my head.\r\n\r\nRemember how I said the second film in the series lacked the ham-fisted Christian allegory of the first? Well, 20th Century Fox apparently recognized the church-going demographic was what made the first film such a success, and had them ramp up the religious content from \"allegory\" to \"explicit yelling at the audience and rubbing its nose in it like it's a puppy who peed on the carpet.\" This sentiment struck me as wholly insincere, a manufactured \"message\" shoehorned in by a film studio who wanted nothing more than to reap the box office rewards of the first film which felt, though unsubtle, genuine in its intentions.\r\n\r\nI've seen films more poorly shot, more poorly acted, more poorly assembled. But this boring, useless, preachy slog with no purpose or point had me at the absolute end of my rope. Rare is it that I sit in a darkened theater constantly looking at my watch, biding my time, aching for the dross on the screen to end so that I simply don't have to endure it anymore. But that's exactly what happened with this film.\r\n\r\nBefore anyone jumps on the obvious point of attack, let me say in no uncertain terms that I am Christian. But (and this is an exceptionally important point) just because a the message of a particular film\/book\/song\/etc. is Christian doesn't make the work inherently good. Nor does criticism of the work in some way equal an anti-Christian sentiment. I often feel that works perceived as \"Christian\" get a free pass on quality because of their message, but quality doesn't work like that. Lowering one's standards results only in mediocre pablum like this continuing to be passed off for media conglomerates to make a quick, insincere buck. Do me a favor. If you've enjoyed these films, fine. I whole-heartedly disagree, but I'm certainly not going to tell you you're wrong for enjoying them. But I beg of you: Don't shut off the critical area of your brain just because something agrees with your worldview. Doing so is a disservice not only to yourself, but everyone else like you who has to suffer through trash like this.","id":"51ec288d19c29551e2117035","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51ec288d19c29551e2117035","movie_id":10140}

It's quite funny and was controversial at the time, as it basically tarnished the reputation of the game and the players. I later found out about this documentary and it's great to see quite a few of the players interviewed, including Bouton, who gives extra insights into the year.

{"author":"CRCulver","content":"Mat\u00edas Bize's 2010 film <i>La vida de los peces<\/i> (The Life of Fish) takes place over a single evening at a Chilean house party. Andr\u00e9s (Santiago Cabrera) is visiting Chile for the first time in 10 years, but he's due to fly back to his adopted Berlin the next day. The action of the film consists solely of Andr\u00e9s wandering from room to room, catching up with people dear to him that he hasn't seen in a long time. Conversations with the friends of his youth hint at the tragedy they shared, which ultimately drove Andr\u00e9s abroad, but it is Beatriz (Blanca Lewin) who ultimately lies at the centre of Andr\u00e9s' youth, and their reunion after a decade leads them to a difficult choice.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, this film is intolerable melodrama. The script is unfocused (there's a bizarre scene where some pre-teens ask Andr\u00e9s a series of graphic questions about what sex acts he's partaken in), and the acting lacks subtlety. The soundtrack is the emotionally gushing pop music one associates more with late '90s teen television dramas like \"Party of Five\" than serious films. Now, the ending of his film is powerful enough that I'm happy I held out and watched the whole thing, but it's bizarre that Chile thought this film worthy of submission for the Best Foreign Film category at the 2011 Academy Awards.","id":"5bb5dd61c3a368151000c917","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bb5dd61c3a368151000c917","movie_id":48999}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"The gift of cinema does credit to the gift of speech.\r\n\r\nThe King's Speech is directed by Tom Hooper and written by David Seidler. It stars Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter, Guy Pearce, Timothy Spall, Derek Jacobi & Michael Gambon. Music is by Alexandre Desplat and photography is by Danny Cohen. The idea for the film came about after Seidler read about how King George VI (Firth) overcame his stammer after a friendship was formed with his voice coach Lionel Logue (Rush). Having himself overcome a stutter problem in his youth, Seidler set about writing his story from informed information. A bonus came before filming started when notebooks belonging to Logue were put forward for use. These enabled Seidler to incorporate works from the books into the screenplay. Plot picks up just prior to George's brother, Edward (Pearce), abdicating the throne, thus thrusting the stammering George on to the hottest seat in England. With World War looming, George will be needed to make the speech of speeches to becalm his nation, but first he must work closely with the affable Logue and hope it brings an end to his vocal woes.\r\n\r\nI first viewed The King's Speech just a couple of days before the Academy Awards that year, so I didn't know how it was going to perform there. It would garner the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Director (Hooper), Best Actor (Firth) and Best Original Screenplay (Seidler), with 12 nominations in total. This was a year when Oscar and BAFTA (where it won 7 of the 14 categories it was nominated for - including Best Film and Best Actor for Colin Firth) got things right. The film at that time I watched it had already made over $230 million in profit, which was a figure guaranteed to rise considerably since the film was still playing to packed theatres in the UK (which was indeed the case as the last figure put forward was $412 million).\r\n\r\nI myself ventured to the theatre on 22nd February 2011, which was over 6 weeks after it was first released in its homeland. As I approached the cinema I saw there was a queue! A queue? I haven't queued to get into a film since the halcyon days of Jaws, Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind! I noticed there was many youngsters in this line, so of course they were going to see the Yogi Bear movie, or that Gnomeo & Juliet film, Surely? Not so actually. In they went to see The King's Speech, an audience that ranged from 12 years of age to the fragile OAP day trippers. For the next two hours the only sounds I heard were that of laughter, hushed words of praise for what was on the screen, and even sobs during some of the more tender moments within. No mobile phones, no chitter chatter about acne or the boy next door, just an across the board appreciation for expert film making.\r\n\r\nThere in is the reason why The King's Speech coined it in at the box office and broke merry records as it went on its way. It has universal appeal, a film without tricks, just a simple involving story acted supremely by a cast of bona fide thespians. It beats a true heart,  whilst doling out a visual history lesson to those so inclined to matters of the British Monarchy and the political upheaval about to surface as Adolf started his surge. Even for a film so chocked full of dialogue and basic human interactions, the pace is brisk and never sags, the quieter reflective moments only bringing anticipation of the next enjoyable scene. When all is said and done, The King's Speech success snowballed because of word of mouth, it started out as an intended independent picture, to be shown in selected theatres only, and now it holds up as one of the best films of 2010\/2011. Believe me, believe the hype, that if you still haven't seen it then you owe it to yourself to see this beautiful movie. 10\/10","id":"5d43eec5a9117f0017ef9906","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d43eec5a9117f0017ef9906","movie_id":45269}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Better to die free than live under the shackles of communism***\r\n\r\n\"The Way Back\" (2010) takes place circa 1940-42 and details a group's mad escape from a Siberian gulag through the cold, desolate Soviet wilderness into Mongolia, across the great Gobi desert, through mountainous Tibet and ultimately freedom in India. The film was inspired by Slavomir Rawicz' popular book \"The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom,\" but not based on it.\r\n\r\nAfter records of Rawicz' release from the gulag by the USSR in 1942 were unearthed the veracity of the book was called into question; others suggest that, although the circumstances of the story may not have happened to author Rawicz, they're apparently based on real events with real individuals, like Polish soldier Witold Glinski. \r\n\r\nMoreover, in light of the millions of prisoners carted away to Siberia during that time period, isn't it likely that a handful of them successfully escaped and had experiences similar to those shown in this movie (and the book) regardless of whether or not they made it all the way to India? In any event, director Peter Weir has plainly stated that the film is largely fictional and only inspired by the book, which may or may not be a true account.\r\n\r\nThe group's natural leader is Janusz (Jim Sturgess), not because he has any leadership charisma but simply because he spent half his life in the woods and KNOWS how to survive in such an environment. As Solomon said, \"A wise man has great power, and a man of knowledge increases strength.\"\r\n\r\nAlso along for the haul is a cynical American called Mister Smith (Ed Harris), a Russian hooligan named Valka (Colin Farrell), a comic accountant, an artistic pastry chef, a priest, a Pole with night blindness and a teen-aged girl named Irena, played by Saoirse Ronan, who incidentally celebrated her 16th birthday on the set.\r\n\r\nThis a story of survival. The group faces freezing nights, lack of food & water, bugs, death, the never-ending Gobi desert and the Himalayas, not to mention the inevitable moral questions that arise from such a life or death situation. Some have complained that the film involves too much walking, but that's the whole point: the film's about a 4000-mile escape on foot to freedom.\r\n\r\nIt drives home some powerful messages that will be pondered well after viewing:\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe government in communistic or extreme socialistic states is a cold, uncaring, demonic machine that will immediately squelch dissidents through any measure possible, including torturous coercion, slander and execution.\r\n\u2022\tSuch godless governments are a vile social infection that spreads and must be escaped at all costs.\r\n\u2022\tIs this socialistic disease now spreading to America? Of course it is and it\u2019s been obvious for quite some time (the Dems).\r\n\u2022\tBetter to die free than live in a gulag (aka labor camp or reeducation camp) or under dictatorial socialistic governments.\r\n\u2022\tNo matter how bad it is, at least you don't have to live in a gulag.\r\n\u2022\tMongolians and Tibetans are people of true honor.\r\n\u2022\tSaoirse Ronan is a precious young lady.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the film features a great score and spectacular locations, shot in Bulgaria, Morocco and India.\r\n\r\nFINAL WORD: \"The Way Back\" is a must if you love survival stories like \"Flight of the Phoenix\" (especially the original version) or \"Sands of the Kalahari,\" as well as films like \"Lawrence of Arabia,\" \"Black Robe\" and \"Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan.\" It's unique but it has the same general tone. Stay away if you have ADHD or solely relish films with conventional Hollywood plotting and roll-your-eyes BS, not that there's anything wrong with that, lol.\r\n\r\nRUNTIME: 2 hours and 13 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-","id":"5db01b62ecaef5001324cd49","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5db01b62ecaef5001324cd49","movie_id":49009}

This film is about warring clans within a larger yakuza community.  Mr. Chairman is the current overall leader; Ikemoto is one of his vassals.  Ikemoto, however, has started an alliance with the Murase family, which deals drugs.  Mr. Chairman is old school, and does not like trading in drugs.  The protagonist, Otomo, is a vassal of Ikemoto, but is a sworn brother of Murase.  Mr. Chairman charges Otomo with breaking this alliance by moving against Murase.  Otomo is reminded rather strongly that his loyalty to Mr. Chairman should outweigh his brotherhood to Murase.\r\n2. In the meantime, Detective Kataoka of the Organized Crime Unit keeps getting paid off by Otomo.  Kataoka gives Otomo intelligence that keeps the police off Otomo's back.\r\n3. Otomo sends an underling to let one of Murase's lieutenants cheat him out of 1 million yen.  When the lieutenant arrives at Otomo offices, he sees that the Otomo group is vassal to the Ikemoto family, and begs to skip receiving the payment.  Otomo's people insist.  Word gets back to Murase, who phones Otomo immediately.  Otomo accepts money and a finger and an apology from Murase's under boss, Kimura.  The Ikemotos demand a finger from the under boss for the insult.\r\n4. As one might imagine, there was a lot of hurt pride.

{"author":"tomz165","content":"As C. S. Lewis wrote Jesus Christ is either a liar, a lunatic or the Lord.  Emilio Barrachina\u2019s  Christ is a lunatic and his Evangelists are liars, all including John.  But the main problem with Barrachina\u2019s  premise is that there is no evidence from the time of Jesus to support his view.  The incidents related in the movie all come from the imagination of the scriptwriter not from any sources truly extant from the lifetime of Christ.  Christ was not a follower of John the Baptist nor was he a Nazarite.  While Christ was executed for sedition the Gospels relate that it was  his claiming to be a king that was the foundation for the accusation of his sedition against Caesar.  Nowhere in any of the documents that we have on Christ from the Roman Empire or the Apostles is he portrayed as a violent revolutionary.  \r\n\r\nThe author claims that his story line repeats the events told in the canonical Gospels but in historical dress to let them acquire their full meaning, i.e., the personal meaning that the author wants them to have.  No evidence is ever offered that this view is a true historical rendition.  Fir instance, the has Pilate ordering the execution of John the Baptist as a revolutionary when we know from the Gospels that Herod himself ordered the execution and we have no other source by which to attribute this act to any other than Herod.  \r\n\r\nThe author also claims in his own synopsis of the movie that the name Iscariot literally means \u201csupplier of arms\u201d but no authority supports such a definition of the name Iscariot and the renditions they do support come nowhere near to identifying Iscariot as a person who sold arms to the revolutionaries or Zealots as they were termed in Christ\u2019s time.\r\n\r\nTo defend his narrative, the author feels that if he can defend minor points in his narrative he has adequately defended the major distortions in his movie.  To this end he concludes his own synopsis by restating the word he puts in Pilate\u2019s mouth that since in Roman Law, each offense had a clearly specified punishment, then there can be no doubt Jesus was executed for a clear crime of sedition.  But nowhere can he show definitively that Christ ever called for revolution or rebellion.  The only source the author uses are the Gospels themselves and these he twists and distorts out of all recognition.  But I believe that here can be found the whole justification for the author\u2019s narrative, since the Romans condemned Christ for sedition then he must have been guilty of just suck an act then all the author has to do is to cut, paste and make-up elements of Christ\u2019s life into a pattern supporting his condemnation.\r\n\r\nThis movie while well made lacks the narrative coherence found in the Gospels themselves and the exceptions it takes with the Gospel narratives without evidence leaves the Christ portrayed as closer to C. S. Lewis\u2019 lunatic than the Christ of the Gospels.  The movie\u2019s progression is sometimes choppy and great chunks of Christ\u2019s ministry are omitted without explanation.\r\n\r\nUltimately, this re-tailoring of Christ\u2019s life is no better and of no more interest than the Jeffersonian Gospel denuded of anything miraculous or supernatural or the Jesus Seminars\u2019 cut and paste job to the same effect.  The only difference is that instead of reducing Christ to a man of pleasing aphorisms, a human teacher of virtue, this movie reduces Christ to a deluded fraud, a violent revolutionary without any coherent message or purpose.","id":"530a5314c3a3684201004728","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/530a5314c3a3684201004728","movie_id":96311}

{"author":"LastCaress1972","content":"Decent enough if unremarkable English-language take on Oliver Hirschbiegels superior Das Experiment, which itself was adapted from a novel (Black Box) which was inspired by a real experiment carried out at Stanford University in 1971. It was funded by the US Navy, and it was abandoned after only six days, when it went tits-up.\r\n\r\nThe story: a bunch of people are interviewed, and 24 are selected to participate in a social experiment: they are to be coached out to a camera-ed up detention centre, where eight will be selected to play the role of prison guards while the remaining sixteen will adopt the role of prisoners. The experiment is scheduled to last for fourteen days, at the end of which the participants will receive their pay: fourteen grand each. There are rules though, and if any of them are broken a red light will come on signalling the end of the experiment, and no one will be paid: The \"prisoners\" may not speak to the \"guards\" unless spoken to first. The \"prisoners\" are to be given three meals per day, but they must finish their plates. The \"Prisoners\" must participate in one hour of physical activity every day. If the \"prisoners\" break any of the rules or play up in any other way, they are to be punished \"commensurably\" within 30 minutes. There is to be no actual violence committed (odd one, this, as the violence erupts long before the red light eventually comes on. Perhaps those conducting the tests considered the acts \"commensurable\" to the acts of the prisoners. I dunno). If anyone wants out and quits, it's over for everyone. Anyway, our hero is \"prisoner\" Adrien Brody (King Kong, Predators) as a pacifist hoping to get some quick cash so's he can follow his latest squeeze out to India where they can \"find themselves\" and whatnot, and our villain is \"guard\" Forest Whittaker (Phonebooth, The Last King of Scotland), an initially shy, gently-demeanored man who still lives with his parents, and who befriends Brody at the interview stage, but who allows himself to be sucked utterly into his role as guard, and who is subsequently absolutely corrupted by his absolute \"power\". Within a matter of days.\r\n\r\nThe two leads - Oscar winners, both - are clearly slumming it, but they by no means ham it up or chew the scenery. The whole thing is done and dusted in a brisk ninety minutes and as a result there's little time whilst watching to consider the shortcomings or flaws until later (who are these people conducting this experiment, anyway? Why the oppressive, dangerous rule-set? Why don't they leap in as soon as the violence rears up? Why are apparently straight men ready to rape each other like 40-year lifers, when they've only been in there 5 days? Even if the would-be rapist is gay, can't he hold off for a bloody week before resorting to sexual assault? Why is an actor of clearly Hispanic\/Mexican descent playing a white supremacist?). It's a decent enough if forgettable way to knock out an hour-and-a-half.","id":"5207b24a760ee3630823a626","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5207b24a760ee3630823a626","movie_id":43549}

{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"Back in the 70's, The Runaways was one of the first all-girl rock bands, initiated by then 16-year-old Joan Jett, who later went on to gain world fame with her band The Blackhearts. Now, I might be somewhat biased on this particular subject, because I am a huge fan of 70's (punk)rock, and especially female rock artists, but I am also a very critical film reviewer. The Runaways therefore, leaves me feeling in limbo.\r\n\r\nI love musical biopics as much as I love the music itself, and since The Runaways falls exactly into my favourite genre of music, I thought this film would be nothing other than a win-win flick for me. However, I felt rather quickly discouraged from the build-up on. When you are telling a true-to-life story, I consider it an important issue to let the audience know who we're dealing with, what's going on and perhaps most importantly, why. These are real people and I want to know why they are who they are, and what motivated them to walk their chosen path in life. The film starts off with alternating scenes of Joan Jett and her soon to be band mate Cherie Currie. Doing stuff that, well... isn't that interesting. It doesn't tell us much about these girls except that they like punk rock and David Bowie. Honestly, having only seen the film last night, it's all I can remember about the first 15 minutes or so. And so the film continues.\r\n\r\nThey form a band, are taken under the wing of weirdo record producer\/manager Kim Fowley, become famous and at some point, break up. The way director Floria Sigismondi tells the story, you'd think it was actually that easy. And this is exactly where the problem lies: bad direction. Possibly even worse editing and screenplay. We are given almost zero back-story of the lives of these young girls, and strangely, literally nothing at all about the personal life of Joan Jett. What makes it even stranger is the fact that the real Joan Jett was actually executive producer of this film, which completely puzzles me considering her part was so badly written. Her character comes across as not much more than a bystander in her own story.\r\n\r\nAt least we're offered snippets of information about Cherie Currie. We know that she comes from an instable family and that her sister (who is in fact her twin \u2013 something I had to learn from Wikipedia since it's never told in the film...) is the only one she is at least somewhat close to. Again though, strangely, what is never told here is that this girl was raped when she was 14 \u2013 an incident which strongly determined the person she would become later on. Very weird to leave out of a biopic.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that the rest of the band didn't give permission for their life story to be used in the film, and it shows. On the one hand, it's a shame because the back-story of the band is already so badly underexposed. On the other, I can't blame them, because this film would have done them no justice whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe story of The Runaways is told as though it all happened overnight: formation, fame, break-up; in what feels like no more than a short year maybe. When in fact they released four albums, three of which with Cherie. Truly awful screenplay.\r\n\r\nThe actors though, are not at all to blame. Kristen Stewart embodies Joan Jett perfectly, she's got the looks, the voice (she sings all her parts herself) and the swagger. Dakota Fanning as Cherie does a very good job also. Although she may not look or sound that much like the real Cherie Currie, her acting more than makes up for it. But then again, anyone who's seen Dakota before, whether as a child actor or teenager, already knows she's a very convincing young actress. The rest of the band, much like their characters, are barely there to be noticed...\r\n\r\nThe part of Kim Fowley is played by Michael Shannon, and he approaches it with a \"love it or hate it\" attitude. Personally, I think he was an absolute scene-stealer (which is not necessarily a good thing, because obviously this film is not about him \u2013 though it is the direction that is to blame, not the actor), acting completely over the top, crude, and horribly inappropriate. Though I can see why some people absolutely hated his character. Simple: there is nothing likable about him. He's an a**hole, and a big one too. As an acting part however, it was obvious that Michael Shannon had a ball playing this guy, and I think that's what makes his role very enjoyable to watch.\r\n\r\nThe actors really do make up for a lot in The Runaways. All parts are equally well-played and very enjoyable. But when the technical aspects of a film are this poor, not even the best actors in the world can make it a success. Zero story, zero character development, shoddy editing and, worst of all, not enough music! Probably the stupidest thing about the whole film \u2013 you'd think that, in a film about The Runaways, there'd be more than two or three original Runaways songs! Yet we have to listen to \"Cherry Bomb\" over and over again, and we get only titbits of their other songs. Sheesh.\r\n\r\nThe Runaways may not have been the most groundbreaking band in history, but they certainly were a cool band of young rock chicks, and they deserved a better film than this one. I would say it's fun to watch once if you're into this kind of music, but that's it. Such a shame.\r\n_(February 2013)_","id":"58ac53e9c3a36849f6012005","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ac53e9c3a36849f6012005","movie_id":27586}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Listen, don't let this place get to you. You stay locked up long enough and you start to believe that you're nuts.\r\n\r\nAfter a gap of nine years, horror legend John Carpenter returned to the movie screen directors chair for this solid if unspectacular horror movie. Though some of the critical reactions to it stink of an over expectation for a return to his former glories, the plain fact is that it's just safe horror film making. \r\n\r\nPlot finds Amber Heard (The Stepfather\/All the Boys Love Mandy Lane) as troubled arsonist Kristen. Shunted into a mental institution post haste, Kristen finds herself menaced by a violent ghost that seems intent on ridding the ward of all its female inhabitants. \r\n\r\nAnd there you have it, a bunch of hopelessly pretty girls (seriously, are all institutionalised girls good looking babes?) are stalked and killed by a female spirit who is dressed up in poor rubbery make up. The odd boo-jump comes and goes, making it not a complete dead loss on the scare front, while the cast are solid in performances and Carpenter shows some trade mark camera techniques to make certain scenes pulse with anxiety. It then hurries along to the big reveal, which sadly disappoints because it just comes off as something done far better in horror\/thriller films previously. It was easy money for Carpenter, and us acolytes don't begrudge him that, while it isn't the embarrassment some have made it out to be, but it is average fare and not a great way for JC to bow out from horror movie making - director wise that is. 6\/10","id":"5518f1519251412c1e00530d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5518f1519251412c1e00530d","movie_id":45657}
{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"The Book of Eli is one of those films that, at first glance, doesn't offer a terribly thrilling premise: a post-apocalyptic world, a lone wolf who fights for whatever is left of the good of mankind, and the young, naive and somewhat annoying girl he reluctantly takes under his wing. And of course, the bad guy. Sure, there are many more films like this you can find at any local video store.\r\n\r\nHowever, when you put two acting grandmasters like Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman head to head, you already know you're in for a treat. And in that respect, \"Eli\" absolutely delivers. Denzel Washington, in the role of Eli, does what he does best: he delivers his most perfect rough-around-the-edges, I'm-a-good-guy-but-I-don't-care routine we all know and love. He is a hard knock alright, and he has absolutely no problem whatsoever severing a few of your body parts if you get in his way. But he is still good to the core, one of the few decent human beings left in a world forsaken of decency. All you need to do to know this is look in his eyes, because the warmth and charisma Washington possesses say it all, even if he is completely covered in scar tissue.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's Gary Oldman. Good old Gary Oldman. I have to say, it's really nice to see him play a stone cold, heartless scumbag once again, especially after his soft good guy role in Batman, where he was almost dorky \u2013 to no fault of his own of course, but still. This man deserves to get every inch of space to act freely, and thank goodness, the Hughes brothers allowed him exactly that. He plays a sort of mob boss, the self-appointed leader of a dingy little town and owner of the bar. He beats his wife, prostitutes his stepdaughter and he does it smiling. He is the most filthy kind of evil, absolutely rotten and loving it. Why? We don't know. He's just a bastard, and that's that.\r\n\r\nWhich is another thing I really like about this film, even though I realize many other people might actually hate it: it offers absolutely no motives, no answers, no explanations to anything, no bite size plot lines, nothing. There's no intro, no voice-over telling you where we are and what's going on. Only half-way through the film there is a scene with Eli and Solara (played by Mila Kunis) where he tells her a little bit about his life, but that's it. Like I said, some people might hate this, so if you are the kind of person who likes a formula-driven action flick with catchy punch lines and nothing to think about, this is not the film for you.\r\n\r\nI would also like to make a little note on Mila Kunis. I must admit, I first had some doubts about her taking on a genre like this (although I was impressed with her performance in Black Swan, but that's a completely different kind of film, and other than that I only know her from That 70's Show), and throughout her first couple of scenes, she didn't do much to remove those doubts. However, as the film progressed, she got her act together and in the end, delivered a credible performance.\r\n\r\nThe visuals are stunning from start to finish. If you are a fan of the new, Frank Miller type of film style with high contrast colours and surreal scenery, you really need to see this. The bleak colours and images of darkness set against a really bright sky make the atmosphere heavy and haunting, making the anxiety of the characters almost tangible. You can just feel dryness, the desert, the hunger and the thirst. The western-like scenery of the town with the \"saloon\" at the heart of it, only adds to that sensation.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I'd like to mention is a quality not many modern-day films possess: the lost art of being silent. It is very rare for a film in this genre to simply be so... still. There is no dialogue except where it's absolutely necessary, and even the music is only used to actually add something to the scenes, but never as filler. The absence of sound here is just as important as its presence. Perfect.\r\n\r\nOn a similar note, the final credits go to Atticus Ross, who created an absolutely magnificent soundtrack, with music that sounds somewhat like the hybrid lovechild of Trent Reznor and Thom Yorke. It's just stellar and truly adds (emotional) value to every scene.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'm not going to tell you what the story is about, I will simply recommend that you go into it with an open mind and no prior knowledge. That's what I did and it worked perfectly. (I will only say that you really need to stick around for the awesome, slap-in-the-face plot twist at the end!)\r\n\r\nOf course it's not the best film ever made, but I still give it a 10, simply because it's beautiful, it's cool and it delivers a few excellent and satisfactory action scenes. And because it's been a really long time since I have downloaded a soundtrack immediately after seeing the film.\r\n\r\nOriginal? No. Eye-candy? Absolutely.\r\n\r\nGo see it.\r\n_(April 2011)_","id":"58ac5027c3a36849e0013123","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ac5027c3a36849e0013123","movie_id":20504}
{"author":"talisencrw","content":"Growing up in the Canada in the 70's and 80's, I fondly recall vastly enjoying an animated version of Lewis' 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' that was presented by Kraft on CTV. Now as a father of a son, I want to see with him the contemporary versions of the books I adored in my youth, though at present I greatly prefer the craftsmanship of cinema pre-1970.\r\n\r\nIt never bothers me in the slightest, to the ire of my more obsessive-compulsive cinephilic friends, seeing films of series with complete disregard to their order (one of my friends nearly had a heart attack, when he discovered I had watched 'Spider-Man 3' without having previously watched films 1 and 2--don't even get me started about the 'Harry Potter' series...), so, especially curious about how one of my favourite contemporary directors, Michael Apted, would do in the realm of big-budget, CGI-intensive fantasy filmmaking (I expected a fish-out-of-water, like Lord Richard Attenborough helming 'A Chorus Line'), I gave this a shot.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed this more than 'Harry Potter' films I have seen, though it does stretch things from the literary works, but unfortunately, that seems to be the way things are, since film became less about artistry and more about business (just see at Toys R Us how many possible toys you can purchase, and similar commercial off-shoots, and I don't even consider this series a major player in this sort of area, because of its Christian undertones, which really doesn't mesh perfectly with selling tons of toys, though of course the realms aren't mutually exclusive, not by any stretch of the imagination). I think that Apted did a decent job, especially considering that yes, he is a fine director, but this isn't really his cup of tea. I distinctly feel that if these films are your comfort food, you won't be disappointed. I look forward to checking out the series' two preceding entries, and, though they left an opportunity for more films, which I believe wouldn't be from Lewis' works at all, it was a nice summation at its conclusion.\r\n\r\nFinally, it was great to see (or at the very least, hear) Tilda Swinton, Liam Neeson and Simon Pegg, they seem to be thrown in everything these days.

I just wanted to watch a holiday movie with my family and this looked okay. Story seemed simple and child-friendly enough that I wouldn't give this one a bad rating. And comparing this to the more recent Nutcracker movie which we watched after this one, the new one was from Disney and was obviously budgeted a lot more with bigger stars so we were sort of expecting a lot more. But we were let down by the newer offering as the plot was severely lacking excitement there. It was boring. And in the end, hard to care for.

The 5th Quarter is a film dedicated to Luke's memory and tells the story of his family in the wake of such tragedy. As the film plays out, it starts to lean away from tragedy and toward triumph, the triumph of the 2006 Wake Forrest Championship Football team. There captain was John Abbate, Luke's brother. The team was supposed to finish dead last, but wound up having a miracle season. It is a story that was so well done, that it couldn't have been anything but a true story. I don't think any writer could have thought of a story like this. Ryan Merriman stars, once again in a sports drama, and of all his performances that I've seen, this had to be the strongest. Not only does he show tremendous athletic ability, but he takes the audience of a roller-coaster ride of emotion. Merriman was so good, that he even had a cold hearted cynic like myself, tearing up. Aidan Quinn and Andie McDowell play the matriarchs of the Abbate family, giving outstanding performances. They made the audience see and feel just what it was like for the Abbate family. Most films are meant to entertain, but the 5th Quarter does more than entertain, it tells a very important story and actually makes you feel something for the tragedies and hardships of other people. I was expecting to see a sports movies, instead I saw something that really made me think. Only the best the big screen has to offer can make you both think and feel for the characters.","id":"5295868b760ee34ac40821dd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5295868b760ee34ac40821dd","movie_id":59728}

So I wasn't really that excited about watching this movie. I guess, I can say, I went with the flow. I wanted to be one of those people who have seen this movie. It was a holiday because of the President's inauguration. So we went to Podium because I know there will be more people in bigger theaters. Many showtimes were sold out already. So we decided to buy tickets for the last full show. We stayed and played with Toby the whole after noon and after dropping off Edward, straight to Podium.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis movie was much better than New Moon. There's more action and the romance between Jacob and Bella are deeper now. More screen time for the Cullen family. The music is better than New Moon having some songs that are more alike than Twilight. I didn't like the makeup. It was not consistent and Bella's hair was the worst. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy rate for this movie is B-.

Of course the plot was not very intriguing but is there anyone who would really expect that from a film like this?

{"author":"John Chard","content":"You know people get up everyday, tell themselves something's gonna change their lives.\r\n\r\nThe Town is Charlestown, Boston, a place where crime is a way of life. Following a bank robbery, professional thief Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) has to keep a watch on bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) because after using her as hostage leverage during escape from the heist, she is the only witness who could possibly identify his gang. But once the two meet they start to fall for each other, forcing MacRay to re-evaluate his life in Charlestown. It's a re-evaluation that will upset a lot of people close to him and the gangster boss who hires him, and all this at a time when FBI agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) is closing in on the gang.\r\n\r\nOne of the most startling things about Ben Affleck's second film as director is that even with the conventional plot, and the formulaic characters, it's still an exhilarating and fresh picture. With Affleck comfortable in his Boston surroundings, it's evident that he and the team went for authenticity, something which in the main they achieve. Sure there's the odd implausible moments, they are - like it or not - cops and robbers staples, but \"The Town\" is not your standard run of the mill actioner. It is, for want of pigeon holing, a modern day noir, resplendent with bleak mood and well oiled characters. Based on Chuck Hogan's novel \"Prince of Thieves\", pic follows the formula of a rotten town with rotten people doing their best or worst to live and get by. Into the pot comes the bad guy who meets a good woman who wants to leave his crappy life and crappy home behind. So far so well trodden path, then, but this is not a giant gangland operation, like, say, \"The Departed\" or \"The Godfather\" et al, this is a small neighbourhood setting, with a small group of everyday dressed young men. It's one of the reasons why Affleck's film feels so very authentic.\r\n\r\nHelping to exude the naturalistic and human feel of the drama is that Affleck doesn't overdo his action sections, yet they are terrific sections for sure. This is not Tony Scott\/Don Simpson\/Jerry Bruckheimer action for popcorn excess. From the electric kick-start of the first heist, to the mid-section car chase - and to the knock out coup de gr\u00e2ce set in motion at Red Sox Stadium - Affleck shows great skill as a crafter of action - aided superbly by Dylan Tichenor's energised editing. Other violence is swift and to the point, the director knowing not to dwell too long on vicious passages in the narrative, thus keeping his characters free of caricatures. Mind, he is thankful to the great cast assembled for his picture, for this is very much an actors piece. Well written without flabby periods of talk for talk sake, The Town provides proper drama for proper actors - and that includes the director himself.\r\n\r\nJeremy Renner is quickly turning into the go to guy for edginess, here as MacRay's best pal, Jem, he deals out a frightening loose cannon turn. Chris Cooper and Pete Postlethwaite have small roles, but both impact hard on proceedings, both memorable and both adding a touch of classy know how. Hamm arguably has the hardest role, for as FBI Agent Frawley he has to carry on his own the other plot thread that is the investigation. Not just that, but the film lends itself to one which dares you to root for the bad guys, it's a tough ask of the \"Mad Men\" actor but he nails it, with one two-fold scene in a bar, as he grills MacRay's ex, Krista (Blake Lively heartfelt and believable), particularly offering a glimpse of what a good actor he can be. Ultimately the main load has to be carried by Affleck and Hall as the central doomed lovers. There is death and misery every where in Charlestown - and for the protagonists of the story, including Doug & Claire. Their relationship offers hope, a beacon of hope in a murky world, but it's a relationship founded on black secrets and built around falsehoods. That Affleck & Hall draw us in with charm and acting gravitas further serves notice as to why The Town is top draw stuff.\r\n\r\nHardships, hard decisions and hard characters come alive in The Town, a great modern day drama that's showing \"Gone Baby Gone\" was no fluke, this lad Affleck really is some director. 9\/10","id":"5cd129ba0e0a262fcd09d78d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cd129ba0e0a262fcd09d78d","movie_id":23168}
{"author":"TheCakerBaker","content":"If Paul Haggis is going to keep on making movies, would somebody do us all a favor and sign him up for a basic screenwriting class? I mean, please, this film could be a lesson all on its own on how not to write a decent screenplay. Its all in here: one-dimensional characters, supremely poor pacing, multiple threads that go absolutely nowhere and completely implausible action sequences.\r\n\r\nAnd, you know, it's just a B-thriller. It's not like I haven't seen these mistakes time and time again. What really bothers me is just how highly it thinks of itself. It not only thinks it's interesting (which it isn't whatsoever), but it thinks it's smart, edgy, and it probably even thinks it's clever. I mean, there are so many characters who function for exactly one plot point and are then left behind in the dust. For example, this one chick who's name I forget (did they ever even say her name?) is introduced fairly early on in the film, and looks even like Russell Crowe's love interest. We see the very, very beginnings of a meaningful relationship forming and then it turns out that she was only a device to fill in a little potential plot hole (trying not to spoil the movie.) The same with Russell Crowe's parents, there are a handful of scattered scenes with them showing little glimpses of a meaningful relationship, and then the same exact friggin' thing is done, they're used as a simple (and illogical) plot mechanism.\r\n\r\nIt's almost like one of Paul Haggis's friends was reading the script and said \"hey, Paul, this is completely ridiculous, how could they possibly manage to _________\" and Haggis wrote in these characters as devices to satisfy the issue, realized they were one-dimensional, and wrote in a pseudo-intelligent relationship (which doesn't in reality make them any better.) And this is how the first 2\/3 of the movie moves so dreadfully slowly. I mean, I'm absolutely confident that with a decent editor, the first hour and fifteen minutes could be whittled down to maybe half an hour.\r\n\r\nThey could have especially left out the symbols that don't actually symbolize anything. Which seems silly to say, but the jar of quarters that keeps recurring in the movie not only has no plot significance, but has zero metaphorical significance. They barely explained what they were doing in their house. They were quite literally only in the film to make it look a little deeper. Not to make it more meaningful, but to make it look more meaningful. To make it \"smart,\" and \"edgy,\" and \"clever.\" I don't usually have a problem with making it through a movie but I had to push to make it through this ludicrous, self-righteous mess.","id":"51d4755019c29567c308c54d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51d4755019c29567c308c54d","movie_id":43539}

He has always something to surprise his audience with.\r\n\r\n\r\nJaden's nemesis is also great. He's scary. But I like the pictures of behind the scenes in the end because it showed that he's not that scary after all.

{"author":"Gimly","content":"I can certainly appreciate the lengths that those involved in _127 Hours_ went to. Being that the movie is 90% bottle-episode, wherein the lead doesn't even have the luxury of something as simple as being allowed to pace about, it's not unfair to say that _127 Hours_ doesn't have a whole lot going on. To try and inject a bit of life into it, director Danny Boyle throws in a number of unique filming styles, and I'll absolutely give props to him for that outside-the-box sort of thinking, but it doesn't actually change the fact that there's still not a whole lot going on. Franco is not a bad actor, but it's a big ask of someone to run something like this solo, and it ends up being a bigger one than he can fully manage. _127 Hours_ is not something I ever found fully engaging. Oft-intense, and kind of gross, but not fully engaging.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._","id":"5e073fab4c1d9a0013e1644c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e073fab4c1d9a0013e1644c","movie_id":44115}
{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"127 Hours depicts the true story of a guy named Aron Ralston, who went canyoneering in Utah in April 2003. Through a pretty serious event of misfortune, he gets trapped in a canyon by a boulder that pulverises his arm against the canyon wall; literally between a rock and a hard place. And, the desperate measures he resorts to in order to free himself. From a Hollywood perspective, this sounds like it could be turned into a wildly spectacular action film with a bold, heroic protagonist, hysterical relatives and \"Where is my son? PLEASE FIND MY SON!!\" (*intense sobbing*) - type of dialogue. Yes? No. Boy, am I glad this was directed by Danny Boyle... The man we all know for his raw, authentic film style. Instead of aforementioned blockbuster drama, he opted for an incredibly realistic, documentary-like film. 127 Hours starts off with no form of introduction whatsoever. We do not get to 'meet' Aron or any of his relatives. However, any such introduction quickly proves to be redundant as, over the fast-paced opening credits, we see Aron enthusiastically preparing for and taking off on a hiking trip (ignoring his mother's phone call in the process...), and there you have it: this is a 'too cool for school', overconfident adrenaline junkie, and that's all we need to know. This overconfidence gradually proves to be the source of pretty much all his problems, as it is later on revealed that Aron neglected to tell anyone where he was going... Oops.\r\n\r\nLike I said, this film looks and feels very much like a documentary, like National Geographic made a big budget reconstruction of the event. The film makers' choice to cast James Franco was a very good one. He is simply amazing. Mind you \u2013 he is alone in this film for about 95% of the time. This requires an actor with the guts and skill to carry an entire film, and I must admit, Franco probably wouldn't have been my first choice. But \u2013 to my pleasant surprise \u2013 he pulls it off, and is actually very worthy indeed of his Oscar nomination. He displays an impressively wide range of emotions, all equally convincing. Panic, disbelief, despair, delusion, hurt and hallucinations. But even confidence, coolness, exhilaration and rationality; it's all there. Aron Ralston, as a character, starts off as a seemingly quite cocky, confident, care-free dude who just wants to enjoy himself and do what he loves most: exploring nature. Without telling his family. But as the film progresses, and Aron realises just what kind of mess he's in, you can slowly see a change occurring in him. And the fact that, after a while you greatly start to sympathize with him and even admire him, despite his obvious stupidity before, is all due to James Franco. He has really proved himself to be a very fine character actor with the capability of moving his audience. There is one scene in particular which I found really captivating. During the 'Tuesday' scene, Aron records himself on his camcorder, acting like he's on a talk show, answering his own questions. This scene is top-notch, acting wise, and this is where you really start to feel for him. \r\n\r\nThroughout Aron's ordeal, we are shown various flashbacks of his childhood, friends, family and loves. This might seem like a clich\u00e9, but honestly, what else are you supposed to think about when you're stuck in a canyon for five days? Some people have suggested they think Aron to be a superficial person for not having some kind of spiritual enlightenment while he was trapped, but honestly, I don't think it's anybody's business to judge what Aron thought and felt throughout his ordeal. We all deal with hardship in our own personal way, and talking to God is not necessarily an option for everyone. Some of us simply draw support from family and love and good memories. I know that's what I'd do. \r\n\r\nNow, back to technical talk. The sense of realism of 127 Hours comes greatly from the grainy, unsteady camera work and graphic depiction of everything. Which is a note that comes with a warning: this film is not for the faint of heart. What surprised me is that the scene where Aron 'releases' himself is visually very graphic. I won't go into detail, but you really shouldn't watch this if you don't have the stomach.\r\n\r\nThere were only a few minor things which bothered me during this film. It has a few moments which, inevitably are a teeny bit boring. But then again, even that seems to fit into the story, so perhaps it makes sense. And I personally think the music wasn't always very well chosen, some of it didn't really fit somehow. But none of this is really any bother.\r\n\r\n127 Hours may not be as profound as Into the Wild, but it's certainly a very well-crafted film which deserves respect on its own merits. Also, the photography of the film is really beautiful and some of the scenery of the canyons is truly breathtaking. I would recommend it for the pretty pictures alone. Anyhow, if you're interested in a really good episode of \"I shouldn't be alive\", this is the film for you.\r\n_(September 2011)_","id":"58a9b3fc92514173ea009b0b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58a9b3fc92514173ea009b0b","movie_id":44115}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Dreamworks play safe and sign the series off with dignity.\r\n\r\nAfter the monstrosity that was Shrek the Turd, the Dreamworks team behind the Shrek franchise woke up and realised what made the series so popular in the first place. Shrek Forever After is not a particularly great film, but it finds some firm footings to appease the adults and children alike.\r\n\r\nThematically it's as safe as houses, it pitches Shrek into a \"It's a Wonderful Life\" scenario, where the big green ogre gets to spend a day away from the life he didn't realise he was happy with in the first place. Making a deal with the nefarious Rumpelstiltskin, Shrek finds a world of darkness for ogres, a world ruled by a psychotic who has an army of flying Margaret Hamilton's to do his bidding. Worse than that, Fiona doesn't know him, she's the leader of the resistance and has no time for some big green ogre love. Donkey is all mangy and Puss in Boots literally has become a fat cat, it's a horrible life, man!\r\n\r\nThe action and graphics whizz past the eyes in what is a perfectly pitched time frame of 90 minutes. It never reaches the heights of the first two movies, but it doesn't strain for laughs or narrative cheek (Pied Piper as a bounty hunter? Genius), or more crucially, it's never dull, something part 3 can't safely claim to not be. It bows out with head held high, not so much in a blaze of glory, but with a dignified recognition of the fact it's time to retire to the swamp and chill out. Take it easy Shrek and the gang. 7\/10","id":"5662813a9251412ad3002731","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5662813a9251412ad3002731","movie_id":10192}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Don't you get it? You're a rat in a maze.\r\n\r\nUS Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) travels to an island asylum facility for the criminally insane with his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). Their reason for being at Ashecliff Hospital is to investigate the mysterious disappearance of murderess Rachel Solando. But Teddy has another issue to deal with at Ashecliff, namely a meeting with Andrew Laeddis (Elias Koteas), the man he believes responsible for the death of his wife (Michelle Williams). Nothing is what it seems at the facility though, and the further Teddy & Chuck investigate, the murkier the truths of Ashecliff become.\r\n\r\nDirected by Martin Scorsese, Shutter Island is adapted from the best selling novel of the same name written by Dennis Lehane (\"Mystic River\/Gone Baby Gone\"). It finds the talented director getting closer to horror than at any point in his career, it also finds him arguably over cooking his grits. Lehane's novel is a page turning lesson in thriller writing, there's no need for deep cranial thinking or fill in the blanks like musings. Scorsese has crafted a movie that, whilst both stylish and moody, is far more intricate than it needed to be. \r\n\r\nFrom the off we saw reams of amateur reviewers dissecting the film and searching for other worldly cinematic meanings. The truth is, is that they don't exist, it is just a great story pinging with psychological twisters. Lehane himself said he felt it was a book he kind of knocked out while in his flow (he undersells himself mind). Scorsese, clearly loving the source to be sure, has crammed too much in for the film to be an across the board winner. Technically accomplished? Without doubt. Depth to the story? You bet. But the reality is that the depth isn't enough to sustain all the genre blending atmospherics that is Marty's want. One is inclined to feel that he so aware that he is treading on well worn genre ground (spot the homages to film noir, old time horror and Hitchcockian grandeur), that he's trying to steer the viewers away from the obviousness on offer. The film is further let down by the second half, where it positively crawls along, something not helped by the fact that the first hour bristles with moody excitement and a promise of clinically executed terror. Anticipation can be a real killer at times...\r\n\r\nYet as is normally the way with a professionally assembled Scorsese picture, there's still so much to enjoy and moments that ensure it will always be a divisive film in the New Yorker's cannon. The cast are mostly great, DiCaprio delivers a stunning performance, one that can only be appreciated once the story has reached the climax. Ruffalo (restrained), Ben Kingsley (shifty) & Max Von Sydow (troubling) all do what is needed and in keeping with the tone of the piece. While the girls - Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson & Williams - have small but crucial parts to play. \r\n\r\nThen there's the supporting characters played by some quality character actors. Koteas is joined by Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levein & John Carroll Lynch. How many of you noticed that we here have a roll call of cinematic serial killers? Edgar Reese, Freddy Krueger, Buffalo Bill and Arthur Lee Allen! (OK, Allen was not proved but \"Zodiac\" the movie lends us to believe it was him). The music used is suitably heart pounding and Robert Richardson's photography is on the money, especially within the dimly lit Ashecliff walls (the foreboding Medfield State Hospital for location filming). The costumes also have a nice 50s look to them, our first encounter of Teddy & Chuck sees them splendidly adorned in film noir hats and coats. While Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is up to the usual tight standard.\r\n\r\nIt's always tricky when great directors are involved, so unsurprisingly we witnessed at the start a difference of opinion with the critics as to how good Shutter Island is? What most agreed on was that the film fluctuates in quality and should have been, given the talent behind and in front of the camera, a much better picture. There's also no getting away from the fact that if you have read the book first the impact of the ending is considerably weakened. Personally I feel Scorsese was the wrong director for this particular source, but that's me, and be that as it may, he still manages to come out of it in credit with his fans - though even if he just passed gas some of them would proclaim it as a masterpiece... 7.5\/10","id":"5e76682eb1f68d0019e470ed","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e76682eb1f68d0019e470ed","movie_id":11324}

Some of the actors managed to deliver solid performances (namely Miguel Corona as trigger-happy town deputy). The story feels a little different and unique for the genre by mixing a western with a serial-killer thriller \/ murder mystery. And even though the direction, SFX, and editing are pretty rough in some areas, the film did manage to keep my interest throughout. (Could've been a little shorter without so many scenes being padded out.)\r\n\r\nAs a fan of westerns, I'm impressed by what was put on-screen with such an obviously low \/ micro-budget. It's apparent the filmmakers were looking to churn out a fun, old-fashioned western, no matter how little money they had.

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"Atmospheric and artistic low-budget slasher\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2010 (with a 2006 Copyright) and directed by Josh Stoddard, \"Sheltered\" is a micro-budget slasher about a group of 20-somethings who seek shelter at a stranger's house during a hurricane, but there's something 'off' about the host and, even more, his brother. Will they survive the night?\r\n\r\nIf you want to see a multi-million dollar horror film, stay clear. If you wanna see a well-made independent flick made on nickels & dimes check out \"Sheltered.\" The acting and script are surprisingly adept. Gerald Downey & Manoel Hudec standout as the courteous host and his little brother, Joey and Billy, while Stacia Crawford is effective as the main protagonist, Jen. Heather Loschiavo is on hand as an oversexed junkie, Christie.\r\n\r\nOne of the other actresses, Tricia Small (Denise), wrote and performed several of the cuts on the soundtrack, along with Dee Rock. One of them is a moving acoustic piece, \u201cSalvation Day,\u201d that plays at the 47:12 mark and it's spectacular, even worth the price of admission. The editing during this sequence is artistic and all-around superb. The end credits song, \u201cI Wanna Go Home,\u201d is also worth noting.\r\n\r\nYou'll notice the TV movie quality of the photography right off the bat but, other than that, the filmmaking is quite professional with imaginative flourishes. Stoddard effectively creates an ambiance of eeriness somehow mixed with beauty and even reverence, which can be observed in the climactic scene of one of the characters standing in the rain with their hands held out to the sky, as if they desperately need cleansed and perhaps re-awoken. It smacks of real life. \r\n\r\nI appreciate well-done spare change budget indie flicks like this because you'll never get what they can offer from mainstream cinema.

There are loads of much better films in the action\/horror\/fantasy genre\u2019s that, at least the so called \u201ccritics\u201d totally hammer. Why the hell this trash got so good scores is beyond me.\n\nThe female acting consists of showing off your boobs then get eaten. The male acting consists of being an asshole, get your dick eaten, then get the rest eaten. The main \u201cevent\u201d is a contrived scene when the main asshole get his dick bitten off and the piranhas eat it and spit it out again under water. I\u2019m sure the 3D effects made it even more ridiculous than in 2d.

Babes, bikinis, boobs, bums, blood, bazulco and bad acting.\r\n\r\nRun from a budget of $24M the film has almost no actors of note in lead roles. Although there is a cameo from Eli Roth (_Inglourious Basterds_), which is always cool.\r\n\r\nWhat we have here, is a virtually flawless example of stupid fun. There's no point in trying to evaluate a film like _Piranha 3D_ on factors like good taste, because it goes out of its way to smash these conventions apart. The film has this crazy energy about it from beginning to end.\r\n\r\nIt also however, is the perfect example of why 3D is so fucking unnecessary. And though I appreciate how forward the film is, that doesn't make it strictly speaking good. It's part creature-feature, part horror-comedy, but it doesn't stand up in a thrill sense to actual monster movies like _Anaconda_ or _King Kong_, and it doesn't stand up in a humour sense to actual horror comedy like _Shaun of the Dead_ or _Dead Snow_, but it sort of takes off on its own in a passable manner. Though it's kiiinda humorous, the film is mostly just \"fun\", as opposed to \"funny\".\r\n\r\nThe script seems cobbled together with a couple of different half assed plot points, but several half ass plots taped together is better than just one half assed plot trying to hold its own and ending up looking like no plot at all. Exploitation has never really been A-grade material, and even though the \"suspension of disbelief\" thing that films are supposed to have as a general rule, is sort of... not here, _Piranha 3D_ still manages to somehow get this piece of crap off the ground.\r\n\r\nI watched it at about 2am with a male friend of mine who has very similar taste and sense of humour to me, and that's pretty much got to be the best possible setting to watch it in. The CG gore is ridiculous, the 3D focus is ridiculous, the film itself is just fucking ridiculous. But brainless is great sometimes, just don't make a habit of thinking that you can get away with bad exploitation, and calling it Black Comedy, once or twice is fine, but soon it just looks like you're aiming for cult, and getting lazy.\r\n\r\n-Gimly","id":"596331da9251410bfa0f30f4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/596331da9251410bfa0f30f4","movie_id":43593}

At the 1.23 mark is IMO the most effective shot in the trailer: Brody's character has one of those iconic triangulated laser sights (from the predators' shoulder-mounted guns) pointed at him. It moves up his body to his head. As it does, many more sights appear, all over him. More than a dozen. He has about fifteen predators all training their guns on him. How's he going to get out of that? He's fooked. Well, no, he's not, because that scene DOESN'T HAPPEN in the film. The first laser sight happens, yes, from the ONE predator of three (?) that are chasing them, but fifteen? No. All those other sights are added in just for the trailer, to make the film look more Predator-filled than it is.\r\n\r\nAs I said, a rather petty quibble, but it's one thing to edit the best bits of a movie together into a trailer to make it look more exiting than it maybe is over the course of two hours, and quite another to lie about what one can expect to see in said movie.","id":"5207b18f760ee3630b24c587","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5207b18f760ee3630b24c587","movie_id":34851}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"They can hear you. Smell you. They see you. \r\n\r\nPredators is directed by Nimr\u00f3d Antal and stars Adrien Brody, Topher Grace, Alice Braga, Laurence Fishburne, Oleg Taktarov & Danny Trejo. It's co-produced out of 20th Century Fox by Robert Rodriguez, John Davis & Elizabeth Avellan, with writing credits going to Michael Finch, Alex Litvak and Jim & John Thomas. It's shot on location in the Hawaiian jungle with Gyula Pados on cinematography, while John Debney reworks Alan Silvestri's score from the 1987 film Predator. \r\n\r\nThe plot sees eight former members of Earth - mercenaries, soldiers, criminals and a doctor, who are literally dropped into a jungle on an alien planet. Why or how they got there is not known, but pretty soon it is apparent they must work together for they are being hunted by an unseen enemy. Hunted, it seems, for sport. \r\n\r\nIn 1987 John McTierrnan gave the movie world Predator, a ballsy Vietnam allegory that pitted Arnold Schwarzenegger and a host of other considerably sized beefcakes against one bad ass mandible wearing alien hunter. Since then the franchise has steadily got worse (though the Danny Glover led sequel is far from a disaster), reaching a crushingly bad nadir with Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem in 2007. Enter Robert Rodriguez who in the mid 90s had done a treatment for a Predator sequel - with Schwarzenegger in mind to return. However, it didn't happen and it's only now, with the franchise at rock bottom, that his script has been reworked and funded to give us Predators, the sequel to McTiernan's 87 ball buster. \r\n\r\nThe set up is a little different but in truth the formula is exactly the same as the original movie. Macho guys and a girl in the jungle are being hunted by something very bad. Alpha male, though, is not going to take it lying down, cue deaths, explosions and much macho posturing. Here in is the main problem with Antal' s movie, it's ticking the same boxes whilst homaging for all it's worth, which is fine since it's hugely entertaining in that Saturday night popcorn way. But there's little to no braveness in the writing. Sure there's some bonuses in the form of alien pets, a predator feud arc and a bonkers midsection with the introduction of another character. Yet as the carnage unfolds, the plot doesn't go anywhere other than where we expect it to go, while there's a huge character misstep in the final third that is more laughable than being the twister it's obviously meant to be. \r\n\r\nHowever, if taken purely as a piece of salted popcorn, the film delivers enough thrills and excitement to warrant the viewing because the action comes thick and fast. From the breathtaking opening as we are literally dropped into the jungle with Adrien Brody, to the inevitable face off for the finale, we have been treated to stabs, chops, thrusts, dismemberment's, beheadings and everyones personal fave - spine ripping! All this and there's barely any blood spilt, lest the green kind counts of course? While the new look predators are awesome, more meaner in tone, with new armour and devoid of the pointless characterisation that others in the franchise have tried to give them, these are unremitting killers, lets leave them like that please! And while it lacks the dark humour of McTiernan's movie, it does have a wry sense of knowing, normally with the portrayal of Royce by Brody. \r\n\r\nBrody is just fine, it's a performance that shows that should he ever want to make the easy money available in action\/adventure type movies? Then he will have no problem getting work. He's buffed up, given himself a gruffer voice and more than shows a capable hand at punching, firing and sticking the tongue firmly in cheek. The others, unsurprisingly, are walking clich\u00e9s, with some obviously only there to be deathly slotted more quickly than the others. The fun here is in waiting to see who gets it first\/next and etc. It has to be said, though, that Topher Grace is not only annoying, he's also very miscast, but in fairness he's not exactly helped by the writing of his character either. \r\n\r\nNot great but hugely enjoyable popcorn fodder.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Sands to the future.\r\n\r\nI guess ultimately it is what it is, a Disney backed video game adaptation of the blockbuster kind.\r\n\r\nIn truth it works just fine and dandy as a family fantasy adventure, with swords and sandals - shields and sarongs, all in abundance. There's the mythical and the magical, the swish and the swash, the HD photography a treat for the eyes. The leads are pretty, likable and energetic, and even though it consistently reminds us that it is based on a video game (jumping and rolling, jumping and rolling), the choreography is niftily arranged and there's a lovely old fashioned feel to the story; which works in that wonderful Sinbadish way.\r\n\r\nNot perfect by any stretch of the imagination, and if one was so inclined? One could deconstruct the faults of the production with the same clinical impact of that achieved by Ben Kingsley's (Sir) wallet when it hit the floor after this paycheck was deposited. It should be viewed in the spirit of how Alfred Molina plays his character, with tongue in cheek and a complete understanding of how to have a good time with popcorn fluff. Prince of Persia is forgettable come the end credits, but at least it was a fun date. And for that we are truly grateful. 7\/10","id":"563da826c3a3681b4b027490","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/563da826c3a3681b4b027490","movie_id":9543}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Dear Mr. Gacy.\r\n\r\nThe Last Victim (AKA: Dear Mr. Gacy) is directed by Svetozar Ristovski and adapted to screenplay by Kellie Madison and Clark Peterson from Jason Moss' memoir novel The Last Victim. It stars Jesse Moss, William Forsythe, Emma Lahanna, Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman and Patrick Gilmore. Music is by Terry Frewer and cinematography by Larry Lynn.\r\n\r\nJohn Wayne Gacy, the mere mention of his name brings shivers, his legacy that of the rape, torture and murder of 33 young men between 1972-1978. Serial Killer films have always been popular, they tap into the psyche where fascination resides. Unfortunately more often than not the films don't contribute much in the way of provoking interesting discussion or adding insight to the killer who is the topic. In fact some skirt the line of tastelessness and exploitation to the point of making the adult viewer a trifle sheepish having just watched them. The Last Victim is thankfully a different beast.\r\n\r\nJason Moss was a criminology student who was fascinated by serial killers. Choosing to use that for the major part of his thesis, he would go on to form a dangerous relationship with the incarcerated Gacy. Posing in profile to that which Gacy was attracted to, Moss began with letters, then phone calls and eventually a meeting with the beast himself. Jason Moss would kill himself in 2006, the significance of which, dates and state of mind etc, are not covered here. This is purely about the naivet\u00e9 of youth, dangerous fascination and the perils of letting a bona fide monster inside of your head.\r\n\r\nIt's not a blood soaked film, it's very character driven, the horrors more of the human mind. Boosted by an intense performance from Forsythe as Gacy, the pic is always compelling, though some poetic licence has been taken to advance the plot dynamics. The flashbacks used are well tied into the narrative thrust, tension is well orchestrated by Ristovski and Frewer's score is unobtrusive but still orchestral and eerie. One of the better serial killer movies available to the intrigued audience, but not because of any stalk and kill tactics and portrayals. 7\/10","id":"546d41abc3a3685ab9000588","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/546d41abc3a3685ab9000588","movie_id":51512}

Fearing for his life, he enlists the aid of his older brother, Benny, who can take care of business, and does. From this moment on, everything starts to get worse. Soon John finds himself part of a gang, nearly killing another boy (boys really), but it gets worse. One day he even beats his father (I think, or maybe his uncle) and then he is forced to live on the streets.\r\n\r\nThere is definitely violence in this movie, but not so much as one would expect, and it's not so pointless as one could fear. John is as much a victim himself, as a bully, and if we feel sad for his victims, we must also feel sad for him. His life could have turned out much different, but a single event changed his life forever. However, that doesn't mean that he can't, if he wish to do the work, change it back.\r\n\r\nLast words... don't worry, there is a great lesson to be learned from this movie, so don't miss out.

{"author":"trineo03","content":"First of all, the animation in this is spectacular. All the scenery in the film looks like something you could find in real life. The action, mainly the climax, and flying shots in this film also show how great the animation is. The main thing about the animation that is amazing is how the dragons look. They all look like real, kinda cartoonish, dragons that come across as vicious but also cute. The cinematography in this film is stunning. The lighting in each and every scene was chosen correctly for it. I really like the score in this film that was done by John Powell. The music in the film just helped bring you into this fantasy world of Vikings and dragons. Now my main problem is mainly the casting of the voice actors. They all did great jobs as their roles but I think some of them would have been better casted if their character was older and not a teenager. That can mainly be seen with Hiccup who is supposed to be a teenager but sounds like an adult who already went through puberty. I also had a few issues with the pacing in this film. Some scenes were way too short and I would have liked to have seen them a tiny bit longer. Now I do get that it\u2019s a film made for children but as long as there\u2019s moving objects on screen kids won\u2019t care what\u2019s happening in the movie.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> When you can choose a best man out of two...\r\n\r\nThe best thing about the film is the title. It got me curious, then I decided to give it a try to learn what's that mean. Love triangle is something what I anticipated, but to know how good it is going to be was my eagerness. I did not know anybody from it, well, except Alyssa Milano. It was a low cost film, but production was good. The opening was decent, so expected a fine development and conclusion. Then did I disappointed with it? Well, a little!\r\n\r\nIt got me. At one point I predicted it entirely wrong. I realised that only during the final few minutes. Yep, the actors were good and so the fairly fitting ending, but for some people that might look like a grand twist. I think the writing, including dialogues and direction was better than I expected. Feels like it is an ordinary version of 'Ruby Sparks'. If you had liked that, probably you would like it as well, though it is not a fantasy.\r\n\r\nWhatever you thought of it, the last 5-10 minutes makes you change your stance, that's how it is designed. So it is not a best romance-comedy, but a watchable one for being slightly original. I would surely give a thumbs up to you to go for it, only if you say you won't try to predict it, but try to watch it like the normal people. In my opinion, that's how it to be watched for the maximum benefit.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"57951b2892514142a40043c4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57951b2892514142a40043c4","movie_id":46198}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"I blame him for saying he did.\r\n\r\nMeek's Cutoff is directed by Kelly Reichardt and written by Jonathan Raymond. It stars Michelle Williams, Bruce Greenwood, Will Paton, Paul Dano, Shirley Henderson, Neal Huff, Zoe Kazan and Tommy Nelson. Music is by Jeff Grace and cinematography by Chris Blauvelt. Story is based on an historical incident on the Oregon Trail in 1845, when frontier guide Stephen Meek (Greenwood) led a small band of settlers across the trail in search of richer pastures. For what was meant to be a two week journey, has now turned into five, and the settlers have this horrible feeling that Meek is lost. With no end to the journey in sight, low on food and water, and becoming ravaged by the terrain, the group starts to come apart at the seams.\r\n\r\nThose familiar with Kelly Reichardt's work, Old Joy\/Wendy & Lucy, will have some idea that Meek's Cutoff was never going to be a traditional Western picture. Often cited as a low-key, minimalist, director, Reichardt has stripped the Western right back to craft a beautifully shot film dealing with the hardships endured both physically and mentally of three families out on the Oregon Trail. Opening without dialogue for the opening seven minutes, where the first voice we hear is that of a child reading Tree of Life, tone is set from the off. We are asked to fill in the blanks ourselves, but it's evident that the group are in trouble, they already look haggard, afraid and near desperation. From here dialogue is as sparse as the terrain they traverse, the wagons crawl at pace, and so to does the film, a slow pace that remains throughout. The interest is all about the characters and their reactions to the situations that arise, no soft soaping or corner cutting, it's stark and uncompromising.\r\n\r\nThis is a different Wild West, the characters are etched into a parched, sun-bleached landscape, there's no romanticism here, just emotional turmoil, it's like the group are in purgatory, desperately trying to reach that Tree of Life on the other side of yet another obstacle. Shot in the 1.33 aspect ratio, this neatly puts the characters front and centre, most tellingly the women, who are the crux of Meek's Cutoff. This viewpoint gives the film a further lift out of the norm, deftly observing the family based woman's place in the West. One of a number of indelible moments in the piece sees the men move away from the women, who have to observe from distance as the men make the crucial decisions, left holding onto the last vestiges of the civilisation left behind, it says so much without actually doing much, something that Meek's Cutoff thrives on.\r\n\r\nThe acting is superb, with Williams, Paton and Greenwood leading the way. This collection of thespians really inhabit their roles, giving the film conviction. Conviction born out by Blauvelt's yellow and brown ochres. Grace's music is also sparse, but telling in a film that mostly deals in quiet conversations, or the natural sounds of wheels turning and tin cups clanking. It's finally detailed and the director wants us to not only examine said details, but also to be part of them. It has already proved to be a most divisive picture, something that is very understandable, even to someone like myself who has been beguiled by it. Where some see a slow crawl where nothing much happens, others see a rich human interest journey where the complete opposite is the case. Regardless of how it eventually works out for the viewer, it remains a film that serious Western fans simply have to see and evaluate. 9\/10","id":"56cfa609c3a3681e4a003e43","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56cfa609c3a3681e4a003e43","movie_id":57120}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"The exotically disturbing character-driven Dutch drama **Meat** (a.k.a. \u201cVlees\u201d) is certainly not your old-fashioned grandmother\u2019s tenderloin steak of a sexual psychological thriller. Filmmakers Victor Nieuwenhuijs and Maartjee Seyferth (who also is credited as a co-screenwriter along with consultant scriber Stan Lapinski) literally and figuratively leads the wide-eyed lamb to the slaughter in this twisted, titillating tale of emotional detachment yet thirsty urgency for forceful flesh and bone in this tawdry crime caper from The Netherlands.\r\n\r\nConvincingly hypnotic, colorfully decadent and unapologetic in its branded rawness, **Meat** is a bizarre and bold commentary on the reckless human carnal compulsion layered underneath mental coldness and despair. Fittingly, Seyferth and Nieuwenhuijs delve into the perverse malaise of sexualized conversion through the damaged mindset of a pot-bellied, middle-aged butcher (Titus Muizelaar) and his curvaceous, willing teenybopper apprentice (Nellie Brenner).\r\n\r\nSkillfully, the aptly titled **Meat** is a potent and functional metaphor for the lost and wayward souls (both human and the victimized animals as edible sacrifices) that are numb and chopped up to the point of no return. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the spotlighted human species in Seyferth\u2019s\/Nieuwenhuijs\u2019s calculating narrative opt for a convenient\u2013if not hormonal mindlessness\u2013manner in which to conduct their sense of unfeeling, brokenness, and disorientation through ritual flesh-peddling excess. Consequently, Meat is lustfully subversive and rooted in misplaced sensuality where inner spirit and integrity are replaced with provocative urges to pound the available flesh with aimless abandonment. Overall, the protagonists in the oddly compelling Meat are seasoned for the toxic taste of the unfulfilled heart while making the walking wounded almost as comparable to the slabs of dripping bloody animal carcasses laying around in the symbolic venue of grinding lifelessness\u2013the butcher shop.\r\n\r\nActually, **Meat** was originally released in 2010 over six years ago. Thankfully, it has resurfaced and will be released through limited outlets. The film\u2019s suggestive content (stark nudity, graphic penetration, coarse language, etc.) is all relative to the nature of the exposition\u2019s unnerving rhythms. This is simply a sordid story about working-class stiffs stuck in a repetitive mode of their stillborn lives. They struggle and settle for the day-to-day operation of the predictable professional\/personal existences that warrant loneliness and quieted hopelessness. The perplexed participants in Meat are wired for the hunger of triggered transgressions involving banging bodies\u2013the only acceptable solution for stimulation to heighten the perceived pleasure yet soften the psychological pain within.\r\n\r\nThe premise involves an unnamed butcher (Muizelaar) whose desperate appetite for off-kilter, dark sexual fantasies is too overwhelming for description. In fact, the butcher is so consumed by his preoccupation for X-rated affection that he arranges to \u201cget serviced\u201d in the frozen meat locker room from an on-call hooker during business hours. Hence, the butcher\u2019s need to \u201cbeat the meat\u201d takes on a whole new meaning at the workplace. Just ask his cute shop assistant Roxy (Brenner, \u201cCrepuscule\u201d). In fact, Roxy had witnessed her womanizing mentor in hormonal action with his female visitor by video recording their steamy sexual session among the frozen hanging meat. It turns out that Roxy has the tendency to capture all that is focused upon her video recording lens.\r\n\r\nWhen the butcher is not busy screwing random shirts on the side he is determined to coax the young blonde-haired Roxy into his world of seedy-minded sexual encounters. The butcher systematically breaks down Roxy with explicit-sounding whispers and intrusive bodily touches of how he could make her experience the ecstasy of a lifetime reserved solely for her benefit. It turns out that the tempted tart Roxy is game for the butcher\u2019s lewd love-making techniques after all. Suddenly, the boisterous butcher and Roxy get down and dirty thus scoring another carnal conquest for the meaty mastermind. However, things turn up ugly when the butcher ends up dead. The question remains: who caused the death of this loin-preparing Lothario?\r\n\r\nSoon, the very frumpy and weary Police Inspector Mann (also played by Muizelaar) is assigned to the case of the slain butcher. Inspector Mann bears a striking resemblance to the late roguish meat man. We witness the cop\u2019s own kind of distant, stand-offish demeanor especially toward his wife Sonia (Elvira Out) who pleads with her husband not to dump her. Inspector Mann, ever so blunt and blistering, tells Sonia that she means nothing to him anymore both at a local restaurant then in the bedroom where he rebuffs her affectionate attention. Of course we see where Mann gets his stinging indifference and insensitivity from when he is seen with his wheelchair-bound mother (Kitty Courbois) reminding her son what a failure he is just like his late father. Clearly, no one will mistake Mann\u2019s critical Mommy Dearest for Mother of the Year anytime soon.\r\n\r\nAs Mann investigates his dead doppelganger\u2019s demise he soon will come across paths with the butcher\u2019s pretty plaything Roxy and soon gains inside into her complicated backstory involving her lusty dalliances with the butcher, her caustic drunken sexual encounters with a couple of opportunistic party-goers, her affiliation with animal activists and her weird hair-raising bedroom practices with unbalanced Turkish boyfriend Mo (Gurkan Kucuksanturk). As did the deceased butcher, Mann starts to become sexually intrigued and mystified by the youngish sexpot Roxy where she fills his mind with visions of lingering naughty, forbidden thoughts.\r\n\r\nStory-wise, **Meat** more than embraces its obligation to parlay its stark character study into a grainy showcase of blue-collar shock value featuring everyday folks targeting whatever ready-made disillusionment worth highlighting in blind salaciousness. Notably, Muizelaar is absolutely winning in his dual roles as the aging and aroused bad boy butcher and the shady law enforcer with questionable motives. Both men are haggard and bogged down by stagnation and frustration. Muizelaar is able to incorporate some hearty ambivalence about the way the audience feels about these seemingly disheveled older men that feel trapped by the passage of time and insecurity. The fact that the matured butcher cannot relate to a real sensible woman beyond the flesh-craving frivolity for beleaguered bimbos is indeed incredibly sad yet absorbingly telling. As for Inspector Mann the fact that he has callously resigned to loving and caring for his needy suicidal wife in search of his escape route to selfish seclusion tells another tortured tale sold so effectively by the committed Muizelaar. Plus, Benner\u2019s Roxy is a vulnerable vixen laced with a tantalizing mix of devilish playfulness and exploitative curiosity. The thought of Benner\u2019s vibrant loose lass creating an infectious obsession for Muizelaar\u2019s two unctuous oldsters looking to fill an empty sexual void all adds up to the surreal cynicism embedded in Seyferth\u2019s\/Nieuwenhuijs\u2019s collaborative psychological sexual suspense caper.\r\n\r\nSure, there are elements of confusion to be found in **Meat** but the risque performances, the frank examination of sexual release as a sociological and psychological necessity for falsified liberation and expression and the butcher shop as the creative placement and interpretation for discarded body parts ripped to assorted pieces sexually and otherwise brilliantly culminates in a flexible and feisty film noir that resonates with acidic truthfulness in chronicled alienation.","id":"57e03c3a9251416c1f00b423","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57e03c3a9251416c1f00b423","movie_id":68279}
{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"Animal Kingdom unleashes an unfaltering roar across Australia. The animal kingdom, a hierarchical group of biological creatures that zoologically determine species that are predacious by nature or hunted down by those stronger than them. It is the laws of nature, Darwinism, that the mighty feed on the weak. Natural selection. We, specifically as human apex predators, do what we must in order to increase our survivability odds. For the Cody family, a familial crime syndicate based in Melbourne, that results in suppressing even the most friendly of noises. Their successful drug-distribution has enabled them to purchase a myriad of luxuries in life, including a quaint abode where seventeen year-old Josh stays after his mother overdoses on heroin. With no alternative shelter, he nestles into the heart of the Cody family tree, commanded by the sweet innocent matriarch who\u2019d do anything and everything to see her boys home and safe.\r\n\r\nMich\u00f4d based this fictitious story on the Pettingill family, where a pair of brothers were acquitted for slaughtering two police officers at point blank range. Offering an apt yet palpable string of tension that questions the utilisation of firearms, a measure to prevent anarchy not commence it, and the lengths a family will partake in for the sake of hereditary aggregation. His screenplay is smart, boasting a range of unexpectedly intelligent character choices that defy typical tropes within other comparative gangster features. If a main character bravely meets their early demise, it\u2019s executed with no padding or fuss. Bang! Suddenly, Mich\u00f4d moves on. An irrefutably powerful and perceptible technique that accompanied the meticulously concise script that he had written.\r\n\r\nThe Cody family members are developed substantially, with their affection for each other explicitly displayed for added finesse. The line between psychopathy and scrupulous behaviour is depicted through the character of \u201cPope\u201d. His outrageous criminal activity tests the loyalty of his brothers whilst embedding a commanding presence within the family. We may view the shenanigans through Josh\u2019s innocent perspective, yet somehow Mich\u00f4d transforms these detestable characters into, well, protagonists. His attentive detail in illustrating the affectionate bonds within the family, instantly adds a light touch of self-justification for their crimes. Impeccably clever, to turn a group of murderous individuals into something more affable.\r\n\r\nNone of this though would\u2019ve been possible without the sensational performances all-round, with three highlights in particular. Mendelsohn showed the world how brutal his antagonistic capabilities can be, with an arresting performance that cemented his talents almost immediately. Pearce, portraying the \u201cgood cop\u201d by convincing Josh not to become a criminal, balances the ethical and moral dilemmas that the main character encounters with a soothingly calm performance. Then Weaver, capitalising on her sweet demeanour, venomously encourages the family through her captivating matriarchal performance. The Brando of Melbourne, perhaps?\r\n\r\nFrecheville lacked emotional conviction, mostly offering a monotonously one-dimensional approach, that forced his uncles to be more enticing as individuals. Occasionally Doolan\u2019s sublime editing consequently resulted in the script feeling somewhat scattershot, particularly in the second act, where the tension dissipated after the shopping centre scene. The introduction of the family\u2019s barrister before the court hearing was also spontaneous, resulting in Phillips\u2019 performance being less than impressive.\r\n\r\nStill, Animal Kingdom is quite simply one of Australia\u2019s greatest exports. Tight, taut and packed full of explosive performances that provide an animalistic bite to this crime story. A rejuvenated modern-take on the classic gangster formula.","id":"5e206ded0102c900163ca2a7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e206ded0102c900163ca2a7","movie_id":44629}

{"author":"Matt Golden","content":"There is little preamble to Cave of Forgotten Dreams. No attempt to graft a larger narrative (indeed, a narrative at all) on the picture, no lengthy introductions of the cast of scientists, archaeologists, and filmmakers with whom you'll spend the next hour and a half. The credits are quick and unadorned, and over them, the unique and unmistakable voice of director Werner Herzog intones, in his inimitable manner, the discovery of Chauvet Cave of southern France.\r\n\r\nThe story is straightforward: a group exploring the area came across the cave, which had been long closed off from a rockslide. They cleared away the rocks and entered, finding the most astonishing collection of cave paintings known to man, more than twice the age of any other and perfectly preserved.\r\n\r\nThe French government protects the cave in earnest, lest it be damaged, and dangerously high levels of radon and carbon dioxide would kill any who visit too long. Were it not for the renown of documentarian and filmmaker Herzog, the French government would likely never have let a film crew into the cave.\r\n\r\nWhat a sorrow that would have been! This film, particularly in its 3D exhibition, is an astounding, moving experience that is wholly unique and an incredible watch for anyone. It's utterly astonishing to view these beautiful, sophisticated paintings, made over 32,000 years ago, to see the contours and the ecstatic play of light and shadow over the curves of the rocks. I've long been ambivalent about the uses of 3D cinematography, but I have seen two films this year alone that have convinced me utterly that though it's not often handled well, it can be an invaluable tool in the hands of a talented filmmaker who uses it purposefully (the other, by the way, is Martin Scorsese's rapturous Hugo).\r\n\r\nThis film is truly an experience, one unlike any other I've seen. The beauty, the history, the humanness of the cave paintings, their incredibly artistry, is unmistakable and undeniable. A scientist in the film talks about how, after being in the cave, he began to dream of the lions, horses, and other beasts depicted on the walls. Seeing these paintings in this incredible environment, realizing that this may very well have been the birth of art...it is unimaginably moving.\r\n\r\nThis is where the magic of cinema comes into play. For how does one apply critical thought to a film such as this? There's little narration, as the experience of viewing the cave (particularly in 3D) conveys far more than mere words could express. Herzog, whose dulcet German tones always seem to contain an infinite depth of grief, wisely keeps the chatter to a minimum, only cropping up for an explanation of what we are seeing, as well as to offer cryptic musings on the meanings of it all. It has no narrative drive, no sense of story to tell. Its cinematography can occasionally veer into the problematic (namely, heavy doses of graininess due to shooting in the dark); the first third of the film is shot with a nonprofessional handheld camera, as it was the first time in which they entered the cave. Is it instead to be judged on the merits of its subject? I suppose so, for rarely will you find a subject as compelling and wonderful as this. And within this cave, Herzog has found things even rarer: a spirituality that is palpable, a common human need for expression, and a voice unfettered by time and space.","id":"51ec285919c29551d90f6db2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51ec285919c29551d90f6db2","movie_id":59490}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Tiptoe Through the Tulips.\r\n\r\nInsidious is directed by James Wan and written by Leigh Whannell. It stars Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Ty Simpkins, Barbara Hershey, Lin Shaye, Andrew Astor and Leigh Whannell. Music is scored by Joseph Bishara and cinematography by John R. Leonetti.\r\n\r\nThe team behind \"Saw\" and \"Dead Silence\" bring us \"Insidious\", one of the finest exponents of the haunted house movie in the modern era. Of course that doesn't count for much with those not particularly struck by the formula, but it does seem to be one of the very few horror sub-genre movies to come out with better than average appraisals.\r\n\r\nOf course it's not perfect, few films, especially in horror world, can stand up and come through unscathed by critics and fans alike, yet for the like minded adults who can set the mood and channel themselves into the boo jump and creepy atmosphere world wrung out by Wan and Whannell, then this is the bomb.\r\n\r\nMuch has been made of the shift in the last third, where the film brings in Astral Projection as its reasoning for the pant soiling previously unleashed. Undeniably the film runs away with itself, goes too far and the last 15 minutes are a chaotic mess of bold ideas and inadequate staging. However, it's interesting to note how often the haunted house movie in recent times gets accused of not bringing something new to the table, something thrown at the wonderful \"Woman in Black\" that followed \"Insidious\"down the pipe. Here the makers offer up something different, true, it hasn't worked in the way they or the hardened genre fans would have liked, but personally I found on second viewing it is forgivable. It's like riding your favourite Big Dipper, you enjoy the spins and upside down scream moments, but just tolerate the flat standard drive stretches of track while your heart tries to steady its beat.\r\n\r\nWhen \"Insidious\" is hitting its heights it's utterly thrilling and unnerving, paced to perfection, it builds from whispered voices on a baby monitor to entities invading the home of the poor Lambert family. The mystery element is strong, just what do they want? Why is son Dalton in a coma but the medical boffins have no idea why? How come the entities have followed the Lambert's even when they move house? The latter of which is refreshing to see in the screenplay, it's a logical move but so often it's not done in other horror movies. The jumps are nicely placed throughout and a number of scenes are so freaky they get under your skin and stay there for some time - seriously, I don't think I'll ever be able to listen to \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" again without my blood being chilled. The use of photographs and mirrors bring the goose flesh to the skin, while Lin Shaye's arrival as the paranormal physic, and the subsequent use of a gas mask, keep things ticking on the freaky deaky scale (though once the gas mask scene hits it's where the pic slightly falls away).\r\n\r\nIt borrows ideas and takes its tonal cues from other horror movies, definitely, and the second half doesn't live up to the promise of the first; hell I'll even concede that a certain entity is badly designed, but it does have something new to offer the formula, it's also well performed by the cast, that itself is a rarity. It hasn't resonated with all, but it was a monster hit at the box office, making nearly $85 million in profit. The market for a good haunted house spooker is always open, so Insidious, in spite of its second half irks, sits in the top draw with the best of them. 8\/10","id":"5dbb75e8dbf144001152f518","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dbb75e8dbf144001152f518","movie_id":49018}

It\u2019s a science fiction film released in 2010 and written by undoubtedly one of the greatest directors in Hollywood, Christopher Nolan, the creator of such stunning films as \u2018Memento\u2019, \u2018The dark knight\u2019, Prestige\u2019 and \u2018Interstellar\u2019. the cast is impressive: the main roles are played by Leo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on the idea of lucid dreams. In the story, the professionals of industrial espionage, using special techniques to steal valuable secrets from the depths of the subconscious during sleep, when the human mind is most vulnerable, learn a new technique - the \u2018inception\u2019 of ideas into the human mind through his dream. The main character - Dom Cobb is a talented thief, his rare abilities made him a truly valuable player in the treacherous world of espionage, but they also turned him into a perennial fugitive and stripped him of everything he had ever loved. One day Cobb has a chance to correct mistakes. His latest case can bring everything back, but for that he needs to do the impossible - inception.\r\n\r\nThere are so many good things about the film. The plot of the film is definitely mind-blowing. You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. The soundtrack is written by Hans Zimmer, who is certainly one of the most sought-after composers. I think all his music is incredibly touching, dramatic and powerful. There are also some iconic songs we all know. The work on the special effects is done flawlessly, evidently, a lot of money was spent on this. The acting is also wonderful, Leo DiCaprio, who was the first actor to accept the offer to play in the film, has done an amazing job.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that viewers can find bad about this film is that it can be extremely difficult to perceive. If you don\u2019t watch the film close enough you can simply get lost in all these jumping from dreams to reality.\r\n\r\nA curious fact is that Christopher Nolan released the film in 2010 but started working on it at the beginning of the 2000s!

{"author":"Cyberknight","content":"*SPOILER ALERT* Stop reading if you don't want to know how this trash ends.\r\n\r\nThis was made as a Found Footage Film (shaky camera, stupid focusing and framing, bad video and audio quality etc.)\r\n\r\nThe first thirty minutes are random chit-chats, like showing staff reading books in a library or interviewing people during work time, with random people getting in and out (what was not cut off just to increase the film's length) and so on (and, a note to the producers, just because it was a clown, didn't make it funny). All that was absolutely irrelevant, as nothing added tension to the film (they could have summarised all that in characters' conversation already at the sanatorium). Only important piece of information, film\/story\/plot wise, was that there was supposed to be a nun ghost haunting the sanatorium, without any explanation as to why (if they had said it was Mother Teresa of Calcutta, or at least a follower of her \"methods\", that would suffice as explanation).\r\n\r\nThe next twenty five minutes are random wanderings inside and around the sanatorium, with some \"supernatural\" events (practical and visual effects) happening here and there. Some are interesting, but most are just more padding to the film's length. A character is badly wounded in an accident with electricity, quite unrelated to the story.\r\n\r\nThe final twelve minutes concentrate all the real action and scares, with the invisible evil spirits dragging people around and, eventually, killing some random characters off screen. Only in the last three minutes a character (the producer, the most annoying of them all) is killed on screen by an invisible spirit (which I can't really call \"evil\", because everyone wanted that guy dead), then the survivors get into the van and try to run away, just to be all killed off screen by the evil nun mentioned in the first 30 min, as she materialises inside the van (implied deaths, that is, because not even off screen sounds are offered to assure us that none of the dummies will come back in a sequel). The end. Follow four minutes of credits.\r\n\r\nTwo of the worst moments in the film occur in those last twelve minutes:\r\n\r\n1) The on screen death of the producer is shown in several different (bad quality) camera angles and takes, what would be obviously impossible with just one camera. It tries to convey a footage \"feeling\" at the same time as showing some \"nice\" fan-service gore. From a cinematic point of view, that's good, because we get a much better visual storytelling, but from the premise of a FFF, it completely destroys the \"footage\" feeling. Just plain stupid.\r\n\r\n2) One character is demented, in an H.P. Lovecraft-ish way, by \"something\" he saw on the CCTv cameras installed in the sanatorium by the staff. The other characters rewind and watch the recording... And whatever it was that was so horrifying that could drive people insane just by watching on a display is never shown, because the cameraman just dumbly record the characters reactions (what the freak is that, YouTube?!), instead of pointing the lens to the monitors! Absolutely irking stupid!\r\n\r\nFifty five boring minutes to get twelve minutes of stupid action. Just forget this.","id":"5dac3c29ae3668001298849f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dac3c29ae3668001298849f","movie_id":203151}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I have to admit that, apart from a couple of episodes, I never really read Jonah Hex when I was a kid. I did not like Western comics very much. Thus, I have no point of reference as to whether the movie is true to the original comic series. Maybe that is an advantage when seeing this movie in that I cannot get upset by the movie not being true to the original. Actually I am reasonably sure that this movie with it supernatural and steampunk influences are not entirely true to the original comic series.\r\n\r\nDespite what seems to be the general opinion I quite liked this movie. The story is mostly comic book material but then this is a comic book character after all. I thought the story was good enough. There is plenty of quite enjoyable action in it. Josh Brolin is doing a good job of portraying the bad-ass Jonah Hex and John Malkowich is perhaps not managing to project the diabolical \u00fcbervillain image that the Turnbull character is supposed to have but he is still not doing a bad job. Megan Fox is, well\u2026Megan Fox. She is fitting the character and the movie fairly well though.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that the supernatural element of the movie is not something that can be found in the original comic series. It did not really disturb me. I am not sure that it added very much but it was okay.\r\n\r\nI understand that people having read and being fans of the original comic series would be upset if the movie did not follow the original but I have to say that I do not understand why everyone else seems to bash it as well. It was an enjoyable hour and a half of fun action. Jonah Hex was the bad-ass that you hoped for. This movie was a much better \u201cinterpretation\u201d of a comic series than the abysmal Green Hornet for instance where the hero was turned into a fumbling idiot.\r\n\r\nFor me personally, this movie was definitely on the upper half of the enjoyment-factor scale.","id":"52d0f7a219c29530e63b5404","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/52d0f7a219c29530e63b5404","movie_id":20533}

There's very little here that is of any actual entertainment value, or at least to balance out how tedious the whole movie is to watch.

{"author":"Gimly","content":"**A long form review originally posted in 2010:**\r\n\r\nI find, the best way to look at this movie, is as two movies. Sounds strange I know, but bear with me.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand you have this Super Hero movie, it's about the main character, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), flying around doing comic book-character type stuff, and it's this pretty okay action film that's worth taking a look at. Then, there's this drama with a hint of comedy, this other film isn't really a genre, it's just about the characters interacting with each other, it's about the main character, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), driving around doing billionaire-playboy type stuff, and this movie, is fucking great. Part script, and part flawless acting, this movie sets _Iron Man 2_ apart from any other Super Hero film out there. It was explored in the first film, and you get a similar thing there, but in this movie the division is more clear, and it bizarrely benefits from it.\r\n\r\nWhen films go franchise-style, it's inevitable that there will be scheduling conflicts, it's an unfortunate part of the industry, particularly when you have a deadline to meet, and for whatever reason, an actor will be unable to return to their original role. Such an event takes place in _Iron Man 2_ when Lt. Col. James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes (originally played by Terrance Howard) is replaced by Don Cheadle. I personally think that Howard was better suited to the role, simply because he looks more like Rhodey does in the comics. But their way of dealing with the changeover is simple, and clever, the character's first lines, whilst making perfect sense in context, are \"Look, it's me, I'm here, deal with it. Let's move on. Drop it.\" Very classy.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mickey Rourke (_Get Carter, Sin City, The Wrestler, Man on Fire, The Expendables_) manages a very convincing evil Russian; Ivan Vanko, who's a perfectly good character, Whiplash as a villain is unfortunately somewhat lacking. Sam Rockwell (_The Green Mile, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Frost\/Nixon, Moon, Conviction_) plays Justin Hammer, corporate rival of Stark's. Scarlett Johansen (_Eight Legged Freaks, The Girl with a Pearl Earring, The Island, The Prestige, The Spirit_) is another good addition to the cast, in the role of Natalie Rushman A.K.A Natasha Romanoff A.K.A Black Widow. Samuel L. Jackson (_Jurassic Park, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, The Starwars Prequel Trilogy, Shaft, S.W.A.T, Kill Bill Volume 2, Snakes on a Plane, 1408, The Spirit, Inglourious Basterds_) portraying S.H.I.E.L.D Director Nick Fury, rounds out the newbies in the cast. And it's all good news.\r\n\r\nThe Hammerdrones are an attempt at revamping the whole boss-battle that was such a let down in the original film, which honestly, once again didn't really work out. Once again it's a case of the character interaction that makes the film what it is. The effects also went a long way in the line of helping out the film, 'cause they were awesome. There are a couple of negatives in the script, just those moments when the suspension of disbelief is not... suspend-y enough. As for example the line; \"Congratulations sir, you have created a new element\", is a little flawed.\r\n\r\nThough if I was forced to choose between them, I would probably say that _Iron Man_ is the better of the two films, but _Iron Man 2_ has a better re-watch value in my opinion, which I prize highly. I wait with baited breath for the next Marvel film to come out, _Thor_.\r\n\r\n63%\r\n\r\n-Gimly","id":"5b1521e60e0a262ddc008184","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b1521e60e0a262ddc008184","movie_id":10138}

It was weird seeing Don Cheadle though play Terrence Howard's character. I like Terrence better. And then there's Scarlett Johansson who is really sexy although I think there weren't that many acting for her in this movie. There weren't many lines. And what was weird also was that in this movie, the chemistry between Tony Stark and Pepper was not that much compared to the first movie although in this movie they actually ended up together.

They shared dreams once, of going abroad, seeing the world, and they did, as soldiers, but only one of them came back. He died on the Route Irish, a road while picking up a journalist from the airport. Route Irish, by the way, is a codename for the road going from the Bagdad Airport to the Green Zone (the most dangerous road in the world).\r\n\r\nThe man feels responsible for his friend's death, and now he is investigating the incident. It should be mentioned here that he stole his friend's phone and found some images and films that might incriminate the people he worked for. As he delves into the circumstances leading to his friend's death, he also relives his own experiences abroad.\r\n\r\nKen Loach is a master of these films; films that doesn't just tell a story, but explain to us how the world works. This might not be \"based on real events\", but it could have been; these are the stories we see on the news every day. I recently watched a movie much like this, called _In the Valley of Elah_, with Tommy Lee Jones. These two movies are kindred spirits in many ways, as they both follow men who are looking for answers, and both involve the military in Iraq. There are major differences, of course, but enough to bind them together. Like one of these and chances are that you'll like the other one as well.\r\n\r\n_Last words... regardless of how you feel about Iraq, watch this movie. It is about people trying to do what they feel is right, about uncovering answers when people would rather that they didn't.

I disagree with the previous reviewer about not finding it very 'funny'. I actually found it very charming and amusing at times, as well as being witty and clever.

No it's not the best romantic comedy film in the world, but it's genuine and there wasn't a dull moment. All the characters bounced off of each other really well and the acting was excellent.

Sure, several of the youths are mostly annoying at first, but it\u2019s so exaggerated it\u2019s obviously camp; plus their arses are all humbled in good time, BIG TIME. Moreover, the three girls are appealing in a girl-next-door type of way despite their initial obnoxiousness, particularly Amber Marie Bollinger as Jessica and Ashley Watkins as Jenny (while blonde Sarah Zurell ain\u2019t nothing to sneeze at). The Irish bloke is easily the most irksome male, but he\u2019s willing to boldly sacrifice everything to save one of the girls.

It stars Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, Rosario Dawson, Ethan Suplee & Kevin Dunn. Cinematographer is Ben Seresin and the music is scored by Harry Gregson-Williams. Plot finds Washington and Pine as Pennsylvania rail yard workers at the opposite ends of their working careers. Whilst working on their first job together, and not exactly hitting it off, the two men are thrust into a frantic pursuit of a runaway train. The runaway (coaster) is pulling tankers containing highly explosive material, and hurtling along at 70mph it has to be stopped before it hits civilisation.\r\n\r\nAlmost as if to atone for the misfire that was The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, Scott and Washington jump on board another type of train movie and literally let it rip. The film is as simple as its plot synopsis suggests, it's a disaster movie on the railway, but with Scott cranking it up as much as he can, it's as much fun as you can hope to have with a modern day popcorner. Carrying all the trade mark licks of its director; roving camera, scattergun editing and ear splitting sound mix, it's also nice to report that unlike Pelham, the pace never sags. Even as the principal characters hang ups and back stories are unfolded in the narrative, Unstoppable literally doesn't pause for breath. Sure the \"Bromance\" development is signposted at the first stop, and yes, are we ever in doubt about where this will end up?

{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"Unthinkable raises a question which has been an issue for many people all over the world for a very long time, and especially since 9\/11. This question is, is it ever justified to torture an individual to save the lives of many? And if the answer is yes, how far can you go?\r\n\r\nThis issue is indeed a very sensitive subject and I think it takes guts for any filmmaker to put it out there in the open like Gregor Jordan did. Add to that the clever fact that he doesn't actually make a choice, but rather lets the audience decide on whatever they want to think and feel, and you have a pretty gutsy and controversial concept.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, this film is about a man of American descent who has become a Muslim and has now, as an act of terrorism, planted 3 nuclear bombs in 3 major American cities which will go off in four days. Screenwriter Peter Woodward made some very tactical decisions considering the characters in the story. They are all somewhat stereotypical, but this is no bother because they're all there for a reason. Carrie-Anne Moss, as an FBI investigator, represents the conscience, the sensitivity and the struggle to make the right decision. Samuel L. Jackson is her polar opposite; the brutal, rational, stone cold \"interrogator\" who does what he does because he's the only one who can and willing to do it. The means he is willing to go to in order to get his subject to talk are almost as unwatchable as they are unthinkable. This is quite possibly the most gruesome film I have ever seen, but that mostly has to do with the fact that the things you see are in fact very real. This stuff does happen, and it's way harder to stomach than any slasher horror movie because it sucks you in emotionally. Intelligence agencies and secret services the world over DO use these techniques, whether we like to believe it or not.\r\n\r\nAll of this sounds like a great opportunity to address a major issue and stimulate people to really think about it, doesn't it? One would like to think so, alas there is one big problem: bad writing. As hard as they try, the filmmakers do not, at any point, manage to evoke sympathy on either side of the fence. Not with the terrorist, for the complete lack of background and motivation, but neither with the people who try to stop him from executing his horrible plans that could claim the lives of millions of people. Especially Carrie-Anne Moss' character, Brody, is quite a pain in the butt because even though her struggle is understandable, quite simply because she's a decent human being, she comes off as kind of naive because she \u2013 from a professional point of view \u2013 is unwilling to sacrifice the life of one to save millions. Her constant interference gradually becomes increasingly annoying, up to the point that you just want her to get out of the way. However, Jackson's character H. turns out to be such a volatile psycho that you almost start to feel sorry for the terrorist! There is one scene in particular which throws you off so badly that you really don't know what to think anymore. I'll only say that it involves the terrorist's wife, and as much as I would like to warn you, I don't want to give any spoilers, but you can take it as a warning anyway... It'll make your skin crawl. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are about as lively and relevant as cardboard-cut-outs, I've already forgotten about most of them, but they don't really matter to the story anyway. However, all of this could have still turned into a decent film, if it wasn't for one major flaw: the horrible ending. It's so incredibly hollow and unsatisfactory that it leaves you wondering why the hell you just spent an hour and a half watching a man being tortured, if there was absolutely no point to it?! It could have been worthwhile if only the filmmakers had any resolve to offer, but there is none. Why did the terrorist do what he did? We don't know. Did the agents accomplish anything? Not really. So what's the point? There is no point. It's just 90 minutes of torture, bad decisions and failure. That's it. \r\n\r\nOverall, it's not all bad. There is some really good dialogue and despite aforementioned flaws and inconsistencies in the script, there are a few really good scenes which do involve one into the minds of the people on screen. The actors do the best they can with what they're given, Samuel L. Jackson is as reliable as ever and Carrie-Anne Moss is convincing in her role, which makes me sad to think that since The Matrix and Memento, she hasn't really had any memorable roles, and that's too bad because she is a good actress. Michael Sheen as the terrorist is good too, though it's hard for him to make his character a 3-dimensional human being because the writers offered him no history or character development whatsoever, but he definitely makes his character's \"in-the-moment emotions\" work from scene to scene.\r\n\r\nSo, final conclusion. I wouldn't really dissuade anyone from watching this film, you now know what to expect and it does offer some interesting food for thought here and there, but you should really understand that this film is pretty challenging, mentally as much as physically. And don't watch this if you're under 18. Seriously.\r\n_(November 2013)_","id":"58ac55b29251415900014fcb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ac55b29251415900014fcb","movie_id":38199}
{"author":"Afra","content":"The Pakistani film industry (lollywood) has been in the doldrums since the 1980's and Slackistan is one of the several Indie ventures hoping to revive cinema albeit a not so successful one.\r\n\r\nSlackistan was shot in Islamabad or Islo as it is affectionately called. A city built by then dictator Ayub Khan so that the affluent could lock out the unwashed masses. It also serves as the nation's capital. Consequently it is home to the richest families in the country.\r\n\r\nThe portrayal of four twenty-something's, rich, Westernized and aimless is fairly accurate. Islamabad is also famously called \"The Dead City\" with no cultural centers, theatres or cinemas. So the inhabitants while away the time by partying, hanging out with friends and driving aimlessly across the city.\r\n\r\nThe plot is composed of the stories of the four youngsters and how one of them overcomes his slacker attitude. It features music from several indie Pakistani bands. It is the director's debut.\r\n\r\nUltimately the movie fails because it is too specific. Most of the jokes would probably be lost on viewers because they are Pakistani jokes. This is in the end a movie made by Islooites for Islooites.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S The movie is banned in Pakistan.

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Aliens attack Earth and seek to SUCK YOUR BRAINS OUT***\r\n\r\nA couple (Eric Balfour & Scottie Thompson) visits some friends in Los Angeles when aliens attack the city and they hold up in a posh apartment complex. The other protagonists are played by Brittany Daniel, Donald Faison, Crystal Reed and David Zayas.\r\n\r\n\"Skyline\" (2010) combines elements of other Alien invasion flicks like \u201cIndependence Day\u201d (1996), \u201cBattle: Los Angeles\u201d (2011), \u201cCloverfield\u201d (2008) and \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d (1953\/2005) with an ending reminiscent of the same in \u201cNight Skies\u201d (2007). The people-snatching aspect recalls \u201cThe Forgotten\u201d (2004).   \r\n\r\nThe director brothers are visual effects designers who were working on the blockbuster \u201cBattle: Los Angeles\u201d while making this indie, which only cost about $10 million. Sony Pictures sued, but the case was later dropped. It must\u2019ve scared the directors because they haven\u2019t returned to directing since (as of this writing) even though \u201cSkyline\u201d made $21 million domestically and $78 million worldwide, which led to the sequel \u201cBeyond Skyline\u201d (2017) by other filmmakers.\r\n\r\nBeing made by effects experts, it\u2019s not surprising that the F\/X in \u201cSkyline\u201d are top-of-the-line. Some of the aliens or crafts look like they were modeled after sea creatures, like octopi and jelly fish. There are also probing tentacles, as seen in \u201cWar of the Worlds.\u201d Meanwhile the main vessels and some of the aliens are similar to those in \u201cIndependence Day.\u201d\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s not enough human interest and the story is too one-dimensional to be overly gripping, for me anyway. Still, this is a grave, tense account of what a malevolent alien invasion might be like. It lacks the lighter side of \u201cIndependence Day\u201d and other eye-rolling aspects (e.g. the pro-American angle), but \u201cID\u201d had more human interest and a plot with a much larger scope. This one amounts to: Aliens attack earth and snatch victims, the end. Yet it\u2019s well done for what it is. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles with shots of New York City, London and Hong Kong at the end.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-","id":"5cce71f29251417be1249933","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cce71f29251417be1249933","movie_id":42684}

But then after a while, you can't help but  think: this is too much for this movie. It's like not sex and the city anymore.

{"author":"Bob","content":"This is a not as bad a movie as many people think. It is not a blockbuster nor an award winner. That said, the filmmaker does an excellent job of putting together a compelling story with a cast of characters, well performed I might add, that will keep you watching. However, it seems to end unexpectedly. My only hope is that a sequel will come along one day to finish the tale. I came across this movie as a Kevin Sorbo fan. He does Sci-Fi and Fantasy well and whenever I stumble across another movie with Sorbo in the cast, I give it a chance. His performance was typical of his style with action and humor rolled into the character. I found it to be a job well done on his part. The leading ladies in the film, and there are quite a few, provided quality performances along side Mr. Sorbo. The director's vision of vampires, however, was a little off in my opinion. There are many takes on the vampire tale and this one uses a variety of sources to create their creatures of the night... or day. Maybe I'm too wrapped up in the Universal Pictures version of the vampire to keep an open mind about those taking a different route with the film. The special effects were not bad for a movie that boasts a mere 1,000,000 dollar budget. The low cost may be a reason why the film seemed to end abruptly. In short, if you are looking for a decent movie, give it a try but don't expect too much. Go in understanding it is a low budget fantasy\/sci-fi\/monster flick that is meant to entertain. I hope that one day the writer and director get an opportunity to at least close out the story.","id":"5aad9b2f0e0a26783301b62e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5aad9b2f0e0a26783301b62e","movie_id":47065}

{"author":"Matt Golden","content":"Oh, this is the stuff. How I\u2019ve missed great horror. American studios have, by and large, ignored producing truly great horror over mindless pablum like Final Destination 6, or Saw 23, or Nostalgic Horror Film Remake 117. Slashers, gore-fests, dead teenager movies and all the other imagination-barren dreck neglect that incredible power a great horror film can wield over its viewer: namely, that it\u2019s the only genre that can truly encompass every emotion, running the audience through the gamut so thoroughly that they\u2019re exhausted and fully satisfied at the end.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t Be Afraid of the Dark is a great horror film. I\u2019d also rank it up there with the great fantasy films; dark fantasy, to be sure, as dark as it gets, but fantasy all the same. It\u2019s a faery tale, with the a-e spelling, replete with faeries, an evil stepmother, a princess and a castle.\r\n\r\nOh, and what a castle it is: the film takes place in the dark, dusty confines of the gloriously decaying Blackwood Manor, a house into which reasonable people would never dream of entering, much less owning. Luckily for us, this faery tale is populated by and large with unreasonable people, for reasonable people have no place in faery tales.\r\n\r\nLittle Sally Hirst is sent to live with her father in Blackwood Manor, as her mother doesn\u2019t want her anymore. Her father Alex (Guy Pearce) and his live-in girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes) are working on restoring the mansion to its former glory, it having been empty for the last hundred years. But Sally\u2019s arrival awakens\u2026things.\r\n\r\nLurking things.\r\n\r\nHungry things.\r\n\r\nLittle do Sally, Alex and Kim know the dark history of what happened to old Emerson Blackwood, and the secrets that the bolted-shut fireplace holds, or what has been unleashed at Blackwood Manor.\r\n\r\nThe tropes of the faery tales are both apparent and subverted here. Sally (Bailee Madison) is a withdrawn, sullen child, wise beyond her years and smart enough to know she\u2019s been abandoned. Alex is a father who loves his daughter, but doesn\u2019t know how to be a parent to her. Kim is a de facto stepmother who didn\u2019t ask for this child but does her best to provide Sally with warmth and love, particularly in lieu of Alex. Terrors are visited upon the girl, but only she knows they\u2019re real; after all, what parents truly believe there are monsters under their child\u2019s bed? Parents know that the monsters aren\u2019t real, even if they are. Children know the monsters are real, and no collection of assurances, no matter how lovingly given, offer enough protection.\r\n\r\nBailee Madison is the focus of the film, and she gives a terrific performace. She\u2019s a real little girl, not a falsely-spun Hollywood version of one. She is reckless, irresponsible, smart, sullen, and terrified. Katie Holmes shines as the stepmother who tries her hardest. Guy Pearce fares well, though he has the most thankless role as the Parent Who Doesn\u2019t Believe.\r\n\r\nOne of the great strengths of the film is how it uses that frustrating disbelief as one of its pillars. The creatures are eventually seen, in ever more apparent lighting, and what that removes from their eeriness it adds to their threat; we know, as does Sally, that these monsters are real, and without help, harm will come. It\u2019s an growing, inexorable conclusion that is terrifying in its mounting inevitability.\r\n\r\nThe entirety of the film is masterfully crafted: the acting is uniformly excellent, the atmosphere is thick and foreboding, the cinematography lush and gorgeous, the art direction is darkly enchanting and the sound design (particularly of the creatures) is terrifying. Even after the creatures have been revealed, their terror doesn\u2019t diminish, and I credit that not only to the sure hand of first-time director Troy Nixey but also the impeccable sound design.\r\n\r\nNixey, a former comic book artist, was hand-picked by producer and cowriter Guillermo del Toro after seeing Nixey\u2019s short film \u201cLatchkey\u2019s Lament.\u201d It was a perfect choice. Del Toro worked for decades on remaking this film, based on an ABC movie of the week from the 1970s starring Kim Darby. He said the film terrified him so much that it was the impetus for him to go into horror filmmaking. And del Toro\u2019s signature touches are all around, from the youthful heroine to the incorporation of faery tales to the trademark art design. None of that should dilute the appreciation for Nixey\u2019s work, however; it\u2019s so rare to find a director who takes time to build atmosphere and ratchet up tension to the breaking point rather than telegraph every scare and pull the trigger too soon.\r\n\r\nThe film is rated R, for there is no other rating to accommodate it. The filmmakers were attempting for a PG-13 film, which they thought they could accomplish without overt gore, language, or sex. When they submitted it for rating, the MPAA gave it an R for intensity, saying it was non-negotiable for \u201cpervasive scariness.\u201d Upon being asked what they could do to get a more commercially-viable PG-13, the MPAA responded \u201cWhy ruin a perfectly scary movie?\u201d\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t Be Afraid of the Dark has what is so lacking in horror films today: imagination. Dark, terrifying, magnificent imagination. The kind that makes you glad you\u2019re able to sit there, in a darkened theater, and let it devour you whole.","id":"51ec27f919c29551dc113fab","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51ec27f919c29551dc113fab","movie_id":46261}

{"author":"MoHA","content":"A young couple, Gaspard (Gr\u00e9goire Leprince-Ringuet) and Marion (Pauline Etienne) are enjoying summer in the idyllic South of France when, by chance, they find a mobile phone. Their curiosity is piqued by the mysterious tone of the messages on the phone \u2013 as well as by photographs of a beautiful woman stored on it \u2013 so they decide to go along to the meeting-place of a church suggested by \u2018Dragon\u2019 (Swann Arlaud) to \u2018Sam\u2019 (Louise Bourgoin). Having got a glimpse of the couple, they decide that following them further would be an interesting afternoon\u2019s diversion.\r\nThis doesn\u2019t prove as easy or as enjoyable as they anticipate: things turn sinister as, when they catch up with the couple, they find them attempting to commit suicide in their car. They manage to get into the vehicle to save the girl but it\u2019s too late for her partner and, disturbingly, Marion swears that she saw someone watching this scene unfold from the nearby woods. As shaken as they both are by these events, Gaspard\u2019s curiosity hasn\u2019t been abated; he cannot resist stealing a camera evidently rigged up to film the suicide attempt, and watches it when he finds himself alone \u2013 though he doesn\u2019t get the references to the \u2018Black Beach\u2019 mentioned by the couple, nor does he know why Dragon and Sam would (with such sentimental aplomb) record their deaths.\r\nLife for Marion and Gaspard proceeds as normal. However, when by chance Gaspard again encounters Sam \u2013 real name Audrey \u2013 whilst out scoring weed with his friends, he cannot resist telling her how he recognises her. They talk briefly, but in that time Gaspard is able to make sense of some of the information he saw in the texts. Some of the places described are to be found in an online game called Black Hole. His interest in the enigmatic Audrey leads him to enter to game to look for her alter-ego: however, in Black Hole the distance between self and avatar is complicated, and for a newbie like Gaspard this almost instantly poses problems\u2026\r\nThe press release accompanying Black Heaven describes the film as \u2018Tron meets Blue Velvet': well, thankfully there\u2019s very little of Tron here, but you can certainly pick up some Lynchian elements in the film\u2019s mysterious femme fatale, its incidental music and most of all the feeling that we, like at least one of the protagonists, don\u2019t have a grasp on what is going on, that there is a mystery to be solved. Internal states take precedence over action for much of the film and not simply because parts of the plot occur in a virtual environment; the focus is very much on what motivates our characters, particularly Gaspard, whose na\u00efvety leads him badly astray. Nothing is immutable though, and the audience isn\u2019t allowed to settle into any one mode of understanding. Gaspard starts out being called a \u2018kid\u2019 by others, yet the plot bestows him with a steep learning curve only to spit him back out as a \u2018kid\u2019 again. Audrey\/Sam is also affected by this, apparently moving from victim to vamp and back (whilst giving the film\u2019s best performance, whether on screen or not, virtual or not.)\r\nAs for Black Hole itself, the world of the game looks impressive: whilst the South of France is warm, sunny and populated by the beautiful people, Black Hole is its opposite, always swathed in darkness and populated mainly by a fascinating array of grotesques. There\u2019s always a danger, though, that what looks cutting-edge now will look ridiculously outdated within a relatively short amount of time, and if the technology carries the plot rather than the other way around this effect nearly always feels worse. Black Heaven may be spared that fate: the idea of MMORPGs is of course a modern phenomenon, but after all the game is still just an arena to explore more timeless ideas such as selfhood, identity and obsession. I\u2019d actually have liked more of the film to take place in this virtual world, as I thought the interplay between avatar and self raised lots of intriguing points, but as it stands I hope Black Heaven will not lose its impact by virtue of its computer graphics. There\u2019s a lot more going on here, to the point that some more explication would not have gone amiss \u2013 just a little, because I appreciate that one of the strong points here is the gently-unsettling atmosphere. Another criticism would be that Leprince-Ringuet doesn\u2019t always communicate all the brooding emotions we know must be present in that head of his, and sometimes seems dwarfed by the strongly-delineated roles being played out around him.\r\nFor all that, I really liked Black Heaven; it\u2019s an innovative, stylish and languid film whilst its successful elements far outweigh the less-successful. Oh, and as a David Lynch fan I can\u2019t help but wonder if director\/writer Gilles Marchand is too, not just because of the overall tone but for one scene in particular which reminded me very strongly of Mulholland Drive","id":"550a419f9251414699000739","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/550a419f9251414699000739","movie_id":49001}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Do you REALLY have faith?***\r\n\r\nThere's been some controversy over 2010's \"Black Death.\" The film has been interpreted in every which way by Christians, pagans, religionists, agnostics and atheists. Either its message is too deep or it's just ambiguous.\r\n\r\nI believe I have it figured out and will share evidence at the end of this review.\r\n\r\nTHE PLOT: The year is 1348 and England is plagued by the Black Death. The Roman Church learns of a remote village that has eluded the plague and suspect sorcery. They send their knight Ulrich (Sean Bean) and a team of hardened soldiers to investigate. On the way they enlist a young monk to lead them to the village, Osmund (Eddie Redmayne), but he has ulterior motives in taking the assignment: He hopes to reunite with Averill, a girl who took sanctuary in the monastery but recently left due to the plague. The monk and the soldiers are all professing believers, but will their faith withstand the ultimate testing?\r\n\r\nThe film has high production values and was shot in NE Germany.\r\n\r\nThe story pulls you in before the first act is over. But it's the final act where the film's greatness really emerges. This part of \"Black Death\" took me by surprise and reveals that it's not really a film about the Black Death, at least not literally. The era of the bubonic plague is just a stage for a grueling exploration into personal belief in God, whether true faith or false.\r\n\r\nTwo important characters are introduced in the second half: Hob (Tim McInnerny) and the beautiful Langiva (Carice van Houten), the authorities of the village. Carice is exceptional.\r\n\r\nA couple sequences show true cinematic excellence: A scene where Langiva leads Osmund out into the night marsh for an amazing revelation, and later when Osmund searches through the misty reeds while Langiva conveys the awful truth.\r\n\r\nThe lengthy water-pit sequence also stands out just for being so excruciating and is on par with the initial Russian roulette sequence in \"The Deer Hunter\" but with more meaning since the outcome in \"Black Death\" hinges on the victims' faith or lack of faith and the everlasting outcome. If Christianity is true, those who denounce their faith have nothing but eternal black death to look forward to.\r\n\r\n\"Black Death\" runs 1 hour, 42 minutes, and is reminiscent of films like \"Witchfinder General,\" \"The Wicker Man,\" \"The Last Valley,\" \u201cSeason of the Witch\u201d and maybe \"Ravenous.\" \"Black Death\" is as good or IMHO better.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A\r\n\r\n***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the film)\r\n\r\nMY EXPLANATION:\r\n\r\nOsmund was never a believer. He may have had some positive qualities but he simply wasn't a believer and the clues are there from the very beginning: For one, he was fornicating with his girlfriend and jumped on the first excuse to leave the monastery so he could see her again (using prayer and a \"sign from God\" as a cover \u2013 even a cover for his own delusion). In fact, Averill told him, \"You've ALREADY betrayed God.\" Secondly, Dalywag points out that his purpose as a torturer was to sniff out lies and tells Osmund to his face that he's a lie. Speaking of Dalywag, despite his gruff exterior and occupation, he later proves his genuine faith as the first person to be crucified for it. Thirdly, Langiva (the red witch) said she looked into the eyes of each visitor when they arrived and saw that Osmund was the only one who wasn't out to harm them, meaning she pegged the others as believers, but not Osmund. Remember, the \"eyes are the windows of the soul.\" Fourthly, although Osmund didn't vocalize his denouncement of God he readily got out of the water pit to view his girlfriend in the cottage. Fourthly, Osmund openly disagreed with Ulrich and the soldiers about Langiva and the villagers. Why? Because he was actually one of them, an unbeliever, whether he knew it or not. And lastly, the end plainly shows what became of Osmund: He became a lifeless and bitter false accuser who cruelly tortured and slew in the name of the church. Remember, Jesus said you can recognize false prophets by their fruits (Matthew 7:15-23).\r\n\r\nSome object to Osmund being a fake believer on the grounds that he was a monk and lived in a monastery, not to mention he prayed. But these things don't make you a believer any more than being in a garage makes you a vehicle. True belief is a matter of the heart, not putting on airs of religiosity, like the Pharisees whom Jesus denounced as fakes.\r\n\r\nThe very first sign that Osmund wasn't a true believer was his seduction by Averill's beauty and his subsequent unrepentant spirit. At the end of the film when Hob is apprehended and caged he's asked why he follows the red witch and he replies, \"Because she's beautiful.\" Hence, both Hob and Osmund were alike in that they renounced faith due to the seduction of beauty.\r\n\r\nAlthough depicted as brutal witch-hunters, Ulrich and his team were RIGHT regarding their suspicions of the marsh village \u2013 the people HAD renounced God and witchcraft WAS being practiced, albeit in a partially charlatan form. Of course it's wrong to persecute people simply because they don't believe in God or adhere to pagan beliefs, but this was a different time and place, when the Roman Church was the state religion.\r\n\r\nAlthough Swire proved to be a fake believer and is actually an obvious type of Judas, Ulrich, Wolfstan, Dalywag and the other surviving soldiers proved their genuine faith and escaped the \"black death\" of eternal death.\r\n\r\nThe idea that Osmund was the protagonist is a red herring. Ulrich and Wolfstan \u2013 gruff and flawed as they are \u2013 are the true protagonists of \"Black Death.\" Besides his courageousness in the face of martyrdom, Ulrich cries out to the villagers in no uncertain terms, \"Repent before it's too late \u2013 Repent!\"\r\n","id":"5d43b8e7ea7b0e0013898e2e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d43b8e7ea7b0e0013898e2e","movie_id":41215}

And then there's Zach Galifianakis. I loved him in Hangover. He's super funny there.

{"author":"Hotsake","content":"Wow, I had heard good things about this movie and went into it with high expectations and I wasn't let down. This is a great horror movie but better than that it a great film period. The main part of the movie takes place during a 2 hour time period and is filled with flash backs through out, which brings depth to the main character. The movie s very gory and becomes more so as it goes on. There is plenty of black humor and drama as well to help balance things out and even most of the minor characters are given a bit of depth and development. The film is based on a true mass murder incident even if the story itself is fiction. I've seen some other movie with Jose in them but she never really made an impression on me until now. Josie Ho was amazing in this and I will be checking out more of her films.","id":"584311919251416ae80002fb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/584311919251416ae80002fb","movie_id":49706}

{"author":"narrator56","content":"I enjoyed this film. There, I said it. I have watched it twice and will again at a future time. I see it more as suspense rather than as an action thriller, the difference Hitchcock explained between a bomb going off and the tension of wondering if it is going to go off. A bulging muscled hero or a bulging cleavaged heroine wouldn't have improved it in my eyes.\r\n\r\nThis is a different sort of alien invasion movie. In fact, it almost feels to me like the invaders dropped in on the planet like drunken tourists and now find they aren't able to fit in or leave but are instead stuck in one bar fight after another. Hmm, okay, that metaphor doesn't quite work, but it feels to me that they aren't here to conquer but rather to try to live their lives.\r\n\r\nI liked how the connection between the two leads gradually grew stronger after what appeared to be dislike, or at least disinterest. And I have to wonder if the title of the film shares its obvious meaning with a shadow allusion to the monsters within us.\r\n\r\nI read somewhere that there is no way monsters built like these could walk upright as they are shown doing. But - they are.  I don't believe in multiple universe, but a lot of renown physicists do, so who can say what is possible? Well, I am being facetious. I enjoy time travel movies even though they are not reality-based.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"I'm proud of my boys, they never forget their momma.\r\n\r\nExcellent remake of Troma's schlocky 80s original.

Unfortunately it's not their home anymore, so they take the couple living there and their party guests hostage and violence becomes the order of the day; especially with the arrival of the boys' psychotic mother...\r\n\r\nIt's bloody and bloody intense as director Darren Lynn Bousman updates the original to modern times. Featuring torture and humiliation, it's not what you would call a comfortable date movie experience, but the makers manage to blend the trashy exploitation of the source with today's terrifying home invasion themes with considerable success. The narrative is not perfect, with leaps of faith required for some twists and credulity is stretched to breaking point, but with Rebecca De Mornay on fire as the mad matriarch, the flaws are easily forgiven. 8\/10","id":"543f7fdbc3a3685e45001349","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/543f7fdbc3a3685e45001349","movie_id":101669}

As with the first, I didn't think it was bad but it had a thin story and not very creative as a whole. Won't say I was ever bored, at least.

{"author":"ohlalipop","content":"Seeing this movie twice must say something about it. I liked this movie. It's funny and clever. The story is unique. Not another typical tagalog movie. The actors\/actresses were really great.\r\n\r\n\r\nAngelica Panganiban amazes us again with her acting skills. We all know she's a good actress starting at an early age playing Becky in Princess Sara. In drama, she's good. And she's proved herself once again acting different roles in the TV comedy show, Banana Split and is famous for her Kris Aquino imitation. And here she is again proving once more to us that she's a really versatile actress. Watching this movie, you can't help but comment on her good looks, sexy body and her acting skills. Eugine Domingo is again a favorite. Although her acting is almost the same as the one in Kimy Dora, she still has this factor that makes us laugh and sometimes scream a little in this movie. Tuesday Vargas is just like Eugine acting roles that are fun to watch. She's funny and smart at the same time. John Lapus plays a different character this time. Instead of his usual gay roles, he also had to play a straight man. Seeing him as a straight man in gross and funny at the same time yet you can't help but give kudos to him in playing t his character. Jaime Fabregas is a veteran actor. We know he's a good actor. But I admire him most in this movie for being able to play the characters so well. Instead of the usual drama, he was able to catch up to all the younger actors\/actresses in this movie. He's a funny man and it's amazing how out of all the actors he's the one who was able to capture his character the most even by just looking at his eyes.","id":"589c4505c3a3684cf90070ee","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/589c4505c3a3684cf90070ee","movie_id":58054}
{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"Clint Eastwood has once again proved himself to be a formidable director. The style and structure of storytelling used in Hereafter will not appeal to a large audience, but something tells me he knew this all too well but honestly, didn't care and rightfully so. Because let's face it, he can afford it and it's certainly a privilege he has earned. And with Hereafter, it seems that all Mr. Eastwood wants to do is share a story. A very beautiful one at that.\r\n\r\nHereafter is divided into three story lines, spread over three different countries. We have Matt Damon as a reluctant psychic in the United States, C\u00e9cile De France who plays a journalist in France and a young pair of twin brothers (Frankie and George McLaren) in England. All of these peoples' lives are in one way or another affected by different aspects of death, whether that be a near-death experience or the passing of someone very dear. Or, in Damons case, the ability to establish a certain connection with those who are no longer with us. Eastwood has decided on a particularly art house-like approach, which, like I mentioned earlier, will certainly back off a large amount of potential viewers. However, I personally very much appreciate his decision. He has obviously chosen not to make this some big, hyped-up monster movie about all things paranormal. Instead, Hereafter deals with its subject with great integrity and subtlety. Although, despite said subtlety, it features a few moments which are, by contrast, incredibly intense and shocking (in a non-scary way). In fact, I would even go so far as to say it is not for the faint of heart, but I mean that mostly in an emotional sense, rather than a spectacular one. On a side note, I would actually not recommend this film to anyone who has, in any way, shape or form been confronted with the 2004 tsunami, or even the London terrorist attacks. It might be really confronting, so be advised.\r\n\r\nI personally think the film's user rating is a bit low, but on the other hand I do somewhat understand why this film has not received the appreciation it deserves. Simply put, not everyone (actually, many people) will not understand it. It is a small story, for a small audience. Also, anyone watching this because they think it's all about Matt Damon will be somewhat deceived. I fully understand why they put his name and picture on the poster, since he is the only big name on the payroll. But this is really not 'his' film, he just plays a part in it. And he does it well, but the rest of the cast actually deserves a great deal of credit, because they are quite simply phenomenal. And I mean *all* of them. C\u00e9cile de France is really impressive, she plays her part with great dignity and empathy. She truly carries every scene she's in, and she will definitely do her country proud. Personally, I was most affected (both story- and acting wise) by the 'London segment' of the film. The story of the two young brothers is absolutely heartbreaking, and the McLaren boys do a superb job at translating this onto the screen. Anyone who doesn't at least feel a shudder of emotion when watching their story unfold, well... honestly doesn't have a lot of heart. I refuse to give away any plot points at all, other than what I already have. This is really the kind of story you just need to surrender to in order to really appreciate it. The pacing demands some patience, but if this is your kind of film it really won't be too much trouble and you will be greatly rewarded.\r\n\r\nThe way the story unfolds (the three-way structure, which doesn't come together until the very end), inevitably evokes comparison to 'Babel', but honestly, that one cost me a far greater deal of effort to sit through than Hereafter. But that is entirely personal of course, and the structure is really the only similarity between the two; the stories are completely different. And I also think Hereafter is actually far more accessible than Babel, despite its subject matter. The stories are told with such tenderness that it didn't actually bother me at all that they were three separate stories which, until the end, had nothing to do with each other. They all intrigued me in their own personal way.\r\n\r\nActually, I could go on and on...\r\n\r\nIt's been a long time since a film has really touched my heart, but this one has. I've been thinking about what rating I should give it, but honestly, I can't think of a single reason why I wouldn't give this film a 10. Hereafter is a film of true beauty, a real gem. Which, unfortunately, won't be understood by many people, but who knows... Perhaps someday, its time will come.\r\n_(August 2011)_","id":"58ac468492514158bc014c63","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ac468492514158bc014c63","movie_id":44603}
