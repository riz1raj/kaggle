He spent the next 33 years in prison for the \"crimes\" of peaceful demonstration and refusal to denounce his apolitical teacher as an Indian spy. He was tortured, starved and sentenced to hard labor. He watched his nation and culture destroyed, his teachers, friends and family displaced, jailed or killed under Chinese occupation.  Fire Under the Snow reaches back to Palden's birth in 1933 and follows him through the Orwellian nightmare that began with the Chinese invasion. We cut back and forth between the past and Palden's present as an activist, living in exile. Our P.O.V. becomes a \"third eye\" hovering over Palden\u2019s current life, haunted by his memories of the past. We explore the escalating cycle of interrogation and physical violation during his years in prison that ended decades later with Palden's escape from Tibet and a cathartic meeting with His Holiness the Dalai Lama.","poster_path":null,"release_date":null,"title":"Fire Under the Snow","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1,"popularity":0.6,"id_imdb":"tt1202564"}

Your children's wellbeing or your own own? Responsibility or self expression? Who Does She Think She Is?, a documentary by Academy Award winning filmmaker Pamela Tanner Boll, features five fierce women who refuse to choose. Through their lives, we explore some of the most problematic intersections of our time: mothering and creativity, partnering and independence, economics and art. Along the way, the film invites us to consider both ancient legacies of women worshipped as cultural muses and more modern times where most people can't even name a handful of female artists. In the end, the diverse women in the film demonstrate that our creativity and our caregiving are not mutually exclusive, but deeply connected. In fact, their co-existence might just be the key to finishing the job.

In these postmodern days it has been said that there is no more pass\u00e9 a vocation than that of the professional art critic. Perceived as the gate keeper for opinions regarding art and culture, the art critic has supposedly been rendered obsolete by an ever expanding pluralism in the art world, where all practices and disciplines are purported to be equal and valid.

But worst of all, Film's character Tom has to speak, and it's an atrociously grating high-pitched, hoarse squeak that can barely be understood. And it's devastatingly funny to watch the superstar singer-actor Film carry on in such a way, playing for laughs.  Tom is best friends with Teung, who has just lost his job as a telemarketer. Teung is pretty much the opposite of Tom, being, in the words of another of the film's characters, \"short, dark, fat and smelly.\" But Teung has a great voice and is a talented composer.","poster_path":"\/yfReCaggUpP5fvhZtGDuCIiR8Ow.jpg","release_date":"2008-12-25","title":"Superstars","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":4,"popularity":1.377,"id_imdb":"tt1888595"}

As full of sudden reversals as any thriller, this documentary follows Sanjay Dutt as he makes Shootout In Lokhandwala, his last film before being sentenced. He plays a real-life Mumbai police officer, AA Khan, who became a local hero after a fatal shootout with criminals in which 1,400 rounds of ammunition were fired. The documentary subtly underlines the ironies of this situation and has as colourful a cast of its own as any Bollywood movie.

For them, the war is never far off. Many of these traumatised refugees have lived here for years, with little food, no work and no prospect of returning home. Zuchuat took his camera to the camp and captured their uncertain existence without providing any comment. He captures the refugees' arduous daily life in long shots, often from a single angle. They all have their own stories of how they ended up here, how they saw their families and fellow-villagers perish and no longer have any work, cattle or land. Another striking story is told by a child that uses a drawing to explain how he was chased away from his native village. Little girls sing a battle song while waiting for what comes next in this prison without bars.","poster_path":null,"release_date":"2008-07-07","title":"Far from the Villages","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"popularity":0.6,"id_imdb":"tt1331091"}

The U.S. government has mandated the construction of a 2,000-mile long wall along the U.S.\/Mexico border and many Americans sport bumper stickers on their vehicles with slogans like, \"Stop the Invasion.\" Una Vida Mejor (A Better Life) follows three families, each participating in the American experience, and each searching for their own version of the American dream. Two of the families have crossed the Mexican border illegally, and entered the United States in the midst of this social and political unrest.

As the drama unfolds, the individual humanity behind the stark statistics and political rhetoric of the immigration issue is revealed and we find that the border between \"right\" and \"wrong\" is hopelessly blurred.","poster_path":"\/wBXP6ekqon02uNKd2GneWgAcdnP.jpg","release_date":"2008-03-02","title":"A Better Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"popularity":0.6,"id_imdb":"tt1180574"}
