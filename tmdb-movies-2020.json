One of the most celebrated painters of our time, Lucian Freud is also one of very few 20th-century artists who portrayed themselves with such consistency.  Spanning nearly seven decades his self-portraits give a fascinating insight into both his psyche and his development as a painter, from his earliest portrait painted in 1939 to the final one executed 64 years later. When seen together, his portraits represent an engrossing study into the dynamic of ageing and the process of self-representation.

Alex\u2019s children Lana and Nico Rockwell return to lead roles following their critical success in Little Feet, starring alongside Will Patton and their mother (Alex\u2019s wife) Karyn Parsons. The family-heavy cast doesn\u2019t soften what is a dark but exceedingly tender look at childhood in a broken home.  The story revolves around the two siblings and their struggle to find solid ground in the homes of Adam, their alcoholic father, and Eve, their negligent mother. The children ultimately run away and find a temporary life for themselves around the town of New Bedford, MA.
