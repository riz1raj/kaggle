{"author":"Reno","content":"> Revealing the truth or sparing the lives with a deal.\r\n\r\nThis is from the director of 'Brooklyn' and that's the obvious reason for I'm here. Looks like many haven't liked it, but for me it was an okay film. Seen plenty of similar themes, so I did not find anything special from this. That means easily predictable story, but I just went through till the end to learn how it all ends. Apparently that's how the narration goes, without a twist. You will know right from the beginning who's behind the bomb blast that takes place at the opening.\r\n\r\nWell written screenplay, but that was not enough for the film buffs or the critics, it might work for people who watch films occasionally. Looks like based on the real, but there's nothing in the opening or in the end of the film about it. Eric Bana and Rebbeca Hall as the ex and lawyers, takes up a high profile case which will be a secret trial. So theirs every move will be watched. Until one day they discover the truth which threatens their lives. The rest of the film reveals whether they successfully accomplish the undertaking or not.\r\n\r\nIn some parts, it was mild thrilling, but the developments were ordinary. Especially it never clears us the motive, just leaves some understandable terms. This is a dramatised thriller than a cinematised crime-mystery with powerful dialogues and stunts. They tried it to be a quite realistic, but was not successful. So there was not any extraordinary performance, both the leads were pretty decent. Had potential to be a great film may be in addition of a few action sequences. Overall, not a bad film, just one time watchable.\r\n\r\n6.5\/10","id":"57b500ac92514172870010aa","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57b500ac92514172870010aa","movie_id":146223}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A thrilling and suspenseful space exploration film.**\r\n\r\nSpace exploration themes are the next big thing in cinema, as well as in the real world. So there some good films, I mean not science fiction, but real science based films were made in the recent times. This is one looked like one of those until the final scene. According to be, it looked so good, but when the end came, it ruined everything.\r\n\r\nIt was more like a docu-adventure-drama, but was a found-footage type film. I wanted to see it ever since I saw 'The Last Days on Mars', because people were comparing between these two. I think both these titles looks same, except different planet exploration. The 99 per cent of the film looked like a real mission, except the conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe writer, director and all the actors did good. The entire story takes place on a spaceship and a few scenes on the Jupiter's moon Europa, obviously a setting. If you like space travel concepts, you will enjoy it. It was just like 'The Martian', but it did not have popular actors, otherwise would have made a little buzz. Most of you have already seen it, if not try it, it is worth if you are a sci-fi fan.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"5851b9ff9251411a4601a604","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5851b9ff9251411a4601a604","movie_id":174772}
{"author":"Matt Golden","content":"Europa Report is one of those low-budget sci-fi films that crop up occasionally and start making the rounds on genre websites (my own first blush with the film was on io9.com) to create a buzz. Since Hollywood has depressingly sworn off any films that aren't megabudget tentpoles with an already-established audience anticipation index (read: sequels, remakes, or pre-existing properties), this kind of high-minded-but-low-budget genre films is a rarity at best.\r\n\r\nIn the film, six astronauts embark on a mission to (as one would expect) Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, after recent discoveries show a possibility of microbial life underneath its icy oceans. What we see is the recorded video from their ship's cameras (yes, it's a found footage film) that tells the story of their ill-fated voyage.\r\n\r\nIt's a simple premise, and director Sebasti\u00e1n Cordero seems to be a bit unsure of himself at the outset. The film refuses to follow a linear narrative; even before the main title appears, we join the crew many months into their trip, and are given the knowledge that there's obviously been an incident onboard already, one that's robbed the journey of one of their intrepid space explorers.\r\n\r\nTwo things worried me at the outset of the film: one: the much-ballyhooed attention to detail (the filmmakers brought on NASA to ensure an unprecedented degree of scientific accuracy) and two: that constantly-shifting timeline of the film. The first point was worrisome because most films that tout so heavily their technical accuracy forget to be dramatically compelling, and the second (similarly) because an overreliance on storytelling gimmicks to keep the audience's interest often betrays a weak story.\r\n\r\nHappily, neither caused the film to fail: the attention to detail enhanced rather than detracted, and while the unnecessary nonlinearity of the storytelling didn't go away until the end, it did finally calm down enough for the audience to orient themselves. Given that I know now how the story unfolds, I can say that it would have actually been more dramatically compelling for the audience if the film had just told itself in a more straightforward manner. Ultimately, though, it works fine, just slightly weaker than it could have been.\r\n\r\nThe bare-bones plot is aided by some smart writing that refuses to dip into easy characterizations and instead defines its astronauts by their mission, rather than cliched, singular personality traits. While refreshing to see, it does leave some of the characters as relative cyphers, but strong performances all around (including District 9's Sharlto Copley and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's Michael Nyqvist) get the film over that slight bump.\r\n\r\nWhat's most gratifying about the film, however, is that it never loses its sense of awe. The film refuses to give in to the cynical pessimism of big-budget sci-fi fare, and its astronauts recognize the immense importance of their mission, particularly when things start to go south. Cordero keeps the tension ratcheted up, never letting the audience forget just how innately tenuous safety during space travel is. The performances are all good, and Copley in particular is a standout.\r\n\r\nBut what I appreciated most about the film was its tactile nature, a by-product of its low budget. The difference between models and fully CGI creations is literally tangible. A week or so ago, I watched Disney's 1979 film The Black Hole for the first time, and while the green-screening of that flawed film is terribly shoddy, its effects stand miles taller than most of the genre fare produced today, if only by virtue of the fact that being real, they informed the cinematography and performances around them.\r\n\r\nEuropa Report fits in comfortably beside Duncan Jones' fantastic low-budget Moon, and while not perfect, compares favorably to that modern classic. This class of film can either be a failure (see: Apollo 18) or a classic (the aforementioned Moon); Europa Report isn't flawless, but it's a great entry in the canon of smart, well-made sci-fi.","id":"51ec26de19c295369c3a0121","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51ec26de19c295369c3a0121","movie_id":174772}
{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"Locke precariously drives down the road of crushing solitude. Concrete. A highly versatile construction material that harnesses strength and durability as aspects of its properties. Impact and fire resistant. A common element for brutalist architecture. And just like the eponymous construction foreman, all it takes is for one mistake. The most minuscule of errors, before an erected building collapses. Unable to withstand the misjudgement of its foundations. Locke, as he drives his tissue-littered BMW X5 from Birmingham to London, must confront unintentional accidents that have caused his mentality to inadvertently spiral out of control.\r\n\r\nA one night stand with Colman as she gives birth to a miscalculated oversight. Consequently causing Locke to abruptly depart for the hospital, resulting in his job dismissal and a construction company spending millions more on a building that has yet to come to fruition. Confronting his own family, showcasing honesty in the most desperate of situations. An hour and a half drive (\u201cas fast as the traffic will allow\u201d). Thirty six phone calls. A life dissolving in the confinement\u2019s of one location. He had everything. Security. Family. Shelter. Only for them to be removed by signalled communications in the luxury of his BMW.\r\n\r\nKnight illustrates the power of simplicity. No flashy visualised distractions. No abrupt editing mechanics. No action. The thrills, tension and drama stem from a screenplay that has its extremities tested by consistently filming in real-time. Allowing the dialogue to be the only aspect at the forefront. We witness an individual deal with the stresses of life. Both professional and personal. Examining the moralities of a man who strives to differ from his irresponsible father. But his wife\u2019s rebuttal is an opaque sentiment that challenges forgiveness. \u201cThe difference between never and once is the difference between good and bad\u201d. An eternally resonant message that self-drives this car journey into the realms of virtuosity.\r\n\r\nKnight\u2019s purposeful choice of enhancing the claustrophobic environment complements the depiction of Locke\u2019s world, as he knows it, swirling in on him. Reducing the boundaries of his breathing space. His stress and anxiety heightening with each phone call he receives. However, none of the above would\u2019ve been as effective if it wasn\u2019t for Hardy\u2019s exceptionally tantalising performance. Far from a car crash, he manages to centralise the focus on him with the camera rarely moving away from his bloodshot eyes or fatigued face. His desperation and intrusive responses illustrates loneliness on a more empathetic wavelength.\r\n\r\nDespite the act of adultery, you never view Locke as an antagonistic entity. He does his best to find \u201cthe next practical step\u201d whilst retaining the thoughts of the recipients in his own head. It\u2019s relatable, personally, on a level that cancels out the background noise. And that, is a powerful dramatic endeavour.\r\n\r\nThere are a few bumps on the motorway though. The various scenes where Locke talks to himself, as if he\u2019s talking to his father, were somewhat cumbersome techniques in order to convey his opposing stance to his father that still haunts him. It\u2019s not particularly subtle, and contrasts heavily with the dramatic phone calls. A desperate attempt to convey abandonment, which would\u2019ve been alleviated by a simple phone chat instead. It\u2019s not shot in one take, and so editor Wright embeds scenes of traffic and the bright luminescence of roads to segregate the narrative flow. These occur too frequently and conceives an occasional irregular pace. And the maternity nurse wasn\u2019t particularly helpful by constantly spluttering \u201cshe\u2019s afraid\u201d whilst Locke clearly stated he was on his way. Give the man a break!\r\n\r\nDespite these bumps, Locke is a smooth drive with dramatic heft and cinematic experimentalism. An irony of a construction worker having his life demolished in minutes. Testing an individual\u2019s moralities through a variety of stress-inducing situations, culminating into an illustration on solidarity. Hardy confidently drives the plot to its desired destination, \u201cspeed limits\u201d included.","id":"5e2072a0f04d010017103526","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2072a0f04d010017103526","movie_id":210479}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"It is an artistically very interesting movie. I would say that the benefit of watching this movie is entirely from the visuals were it excels. Unfortunately after a while the blood-red and, often, bizarre scenes become a bit boring.\r\n\r\nThe story, well you have it in the movie blurb above. There is not much more to it and it is just used to tie the string of artistic expressions of the director\/writer together. This is a quite violent movie. The old cop, Chang, gets more than one opportunity to use various sharp instruments, mostly his sword, on various criminal elements and the effects are frequently shown in all their gory glory.\r\n\r\nWhat about the actors and their performance? Well it is quite good for this type of movie but having said that the acting mostly consists of various people silently staring at each other.\r\n\r\nI had quite a bit of difficulty in deciding what rating I should give this movie. If I would go by the visuals only it should be very high but if I would go by the rest of the content it would be rather low. In the end I decided that although I appreciated the artwork I did not really like the movie as a whole that much.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The war had no mercy on this innocent child.**\r\n\r\nAnyone who lived in the early 1940s Europe would tell you their version of the horrific story. Many people fought for their survival each day, every minute. That's when they all would have thought the paradise (earth) turned into hell. This was adapted from the recent book of the same name, which was originally based on the real about an eight year old Jewish boy. You could say it is the kid version of 'The Pianist' or exactly opposite of 'The Diary of Anne Frank' as if Anne did not take shelter, she would have done something like. Very emotional film from the very first scene to the last. They have produced some of the finest World War II films in the recent time, but I haven't felt like I did for this. Totally heartbroken!\r\n\r\nThe saddest part is this film was underrated and under-noticed despite it was released just a couple of years ago. The reason might be, it was not a big production house film or internationally recognisable actors in it. Though I recognised a couple of German, Polish actors who were on the small roles. It was jointly produced by Poland, Germany and France, but should have been in the English language for the wider audience reach. Anyway, being true, including languages, which were multiple and locations would always give a perfect depiction of the event and I liked it that way. It was also good to see the Russians are not the bad guys or the roughest- toughest one we'd seen in other WWII films.\r\n\r\nThe opening was very strong. We won't know what's going on like who is this kid, where he'd come from and heading to, but surely understandable the boy is fighting for survival against the odds. Soon a small flashback of his recent past shown, but nothing deeper beyond like his home and parents were revealed. In the ending, there's a little information about that which will get you emotionally for sure. He was very young to understand all this, yet developed a survival skill. Like they say, 'all is fair in love and war', he wasn't a warrior, but what he did has to be done and it was impressive for that age. Some people helped him through, though some did not. It's all about running, running, running, like a herbivorous in the wild, not knowing when he'll become a prey to a predator.\r\n\r\n> \u275dKeep moving. To the east, where the sun rises.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe journey of three years of his life was like eternal. He has to sacrifice many things, including his innocent childhood that war had no mercy on it. In one of the scenes where he seriously met with an accident, I was unable to bear it. In a film, it's all compressed for just two hours of what took years in the real life. Only Yoran Fridman knows his real experience. He can be seen in the final scene of the film. This was like a coming-of-age, but no kids should go through it.\r\n\r\nI know it was only a film version, but that smile, that sobbing, that fear and that strategy of survival in that age, you will lose yourself in your watch. But the entire film was only the war portion of his story. There's no earlier event, like with his parents or the post war, except at the end it skipped too far for a brief detail as any film does in that section.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine casting. The kid in the lead was in fact played by the twin brothers. I think they switched and performed well the role they have represented. It was a great screenplay and direction. Wonderful locations, especially creating those war like atmosphere. A fitting background score, it was a perfect film that brought back to us on the screen of the 75 years ago Poland when the Nazis army roamed. But I had zero idea of the film, not even knew it was a war film. It was a last minute decision to check it out and I made the right one. Like this way I'd found many hidden gems, that's what I love to do and spread the word.\r\n\r\nFilms like this usually have more unpleasant events. But involving a kid in such circumstances were even more painful to watch if you are a light hearted. Though a film like this should not be missed. This is a must watch film among WWII themes. I don't think so, I would forget everything I just saw in this film, not for anytime soon and I definitely recommend it to those who are seeking a title, but not sure which one to opt. Mainstream world should know this film and I hope my this review contributes a little for that. So, go guys go, watch it now if you haven't.\r\n\r\n_9\/10_","id":"5935d36992514166240000ae","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5935d36992514166240000ae","movie_id":239103}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is a good movie. It is pretty much what you would expect from a Fast & Furious movie. It could have been a great movie but it is unfortunately dragged down by some of the not too unusual Hollywood stupidity and arrogance towards the viewers.\r\n\r\nVin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson are perfect in their roles as old-fashioned, hard-hitting, fast-driving macho guys. Michel Rodriquez is doing a decent enough job as well but then I do like Michel Rodriquez so\u2026 These guys are making a lot of the movie for me. The rest is not bad but more like filling out some empty space compared to Vin and Dwayne.\r\n\r\nThis is of course a movie about fast driving, action and special effects. In those areas it does not disappoint. There are lots of fast driving and lots of action and special effects. Not all of it is entirely realistic of course. This is rather expected and I can live with it as long as it doesn\u2019t go to far into the realm of ludicrously unrealistic which it, sadly, did towards the end. Although the effects and fights themselves were quite cool the entire flight escape scene was just ludicrous. They were driving at take-off speed, both on the ground and in the air, for how long? 20 minutes? That must have been the worlds longest runway. This is what I call Hollywood arrogance towards the viewers. Do they really think the viewers are so stupid that they will just buy this? Or is it that they themselves are so utterly stupid that they do not realize how utterly wrong the entire thing is? For me this really dragged down an otherwise great movie.\r\n\r\nOtherwise the movie is a nice blend between macho talk, action, lots of fast driving, some humor, some more action, some more fast driving and lots of chars getting smashed. In short all the things that make up a good fun action movie. The story itself? Well, as far as I am concerned, fairly standard issue which held the action together reasonably although the basic idea and technical aspects, especially this \u201cEMP chip\u201d, where not very believable.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it was a good and enjoyable movie which good have been great if it were not dragged down by Hollywood stupidity.","id":"533f9d9cc3a36830f3000a27","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/533f9d9cc3a36830f3000a27","movie_id":82992}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Time for parents to learn some lessons!**\r\n\r\nFirst thing, it was not your a typical film. Though it lacked the proper story structure. The concept seems silly. Like only for cinematically happenable. Since it is not about so serious, they had to cover all scenes, events within its classification, which were not bad actually. But the thing is, it is an R film with the majority of the cast was children. In reality, most of them were in their 20s, but the story wise, they are teens.\r\n\r\nA teenager decides to take hostage of her parents to teach them some lesson for not attending her sporting competition. Her siblings join, and a couple of outsiders too. It was not a well planned event of the weekend, so some unexpected turn takes.

Like awareness about the family unity. Being there for one another in all circumstances. Some viewers might get emotional too. In one of the scenes with a knife in the mouth, I scared that something bad could happen. Olesya Rulin was good. I hope she does more films in the lead. The film was four years old, so Joey was younger than her recent films I've seen. She's one of the next big star.

{"author":"andrew taylor-smith","content":"The popular Outpost franchise gets third outing with a prequel,   OUTPOST : Rise of the Spetsnaz, an origins story rooted in the aftermath of WW2.\r\nAfter the short prologue, we join a Russian unit (The Elite Special Forces known as the Spetsnaz) whilst on a stakeout mission for Nazi blood. They\u2019re a rag tag bunch; disguised in part by the garments of fallen Nazis - sporting their wardrobe and Nazi insignia.\r\nThey makes easy work of the first wave of unsuspecting Germans, but just as their leader discovers some sinister  paraphernalia,  they are out gunned by a backup fleet sporting more hardware that sends them fleeing to the forest. Their leader, one Dolokhov is captured and taken to the experiment chamber of an underground bunker where the origins of this action packet saga come to light. Followers or the previous two films will appreciate the attention to detail that director Kieran Parker and Rae Brunton have cultivated here. It\u2019s subtle enough not to indulge one too much in what we\u2019ve already come to like about the series. Several characters emerge in numerous Zombie guises recognisable in the labyrinth of shudder-some  corridors.\r\nIt\u2019s not long before the unit are pitted against the sinister and barbaric regime  orchestrating their evil deeds and using them as test subjects for something far more inhuman and sinister.\r\nWhat transpires is most action packet of the series so far. It\u2019s littered with a high body count and some well executed fight sequences. There are also great moments of tension and some dry humour thrown in too. There\u2019s even space for the occasional Russian proverb  -  Trouble never comes alone\u2026\r\nIt\u2019s not without its less shining moments. The ending, although brutal came about too quickly and easily. A potentially life-saving amount of weaponry would have helped our assailants to safety was never used. They dispose of the Nazi\u2019s with mere  firepower and some combat when there was an entire army at the Reich\u2019s disposal. This spoiled it for me. That said it is not a dull film, not in the slightest. It just had too much action and not enough danger placed on the surviving Russians.\r\nThis marks Kieran Parker\u2019s directorial debut after story writing and producing the previous two films, Outpost and Outpost : Black sun. It\u2019s a commendable turn, particularly in the action sequences. The central performances are strong too.

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nSix years later, and Frozen has left an undeniable cultural impact. From Let It Go to tons of merchandising, Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee delivered such a memorable film that people not only didn\u2019t forget but regularly asked for its sequel. As of right now, Frozen II has claimed the third-best animated opening weekend ever, proving that the love for this franchise (I think it\u2019s safe to call it that already) is strong. However, how great is the original movie, after all? To be honest, I never fully watched it until this past week in preparation for its sequel. It surprised me in the sense that I didn\u2019t expect to enjoy it as much as I did. Frozen is deserving of the love it possesses.\r\n\r\nWith extremely captivating characters, the story flows naturally, and the entertainment levels are always high. Whether these are due to the amazing singing sequences or to the exciting adventures, this film never stops having fun. That\u2019s what Frozen ultimately is: a lighthearted, fun, and entertaining movie. It follows Disney\u2019s formula for creating a variation of a story we have seen before. Characters go through a traumatic event when they\u2019re young. They have to grow up while struggling with the aftermath of said trauma. Eventually, they overcome that obstacle and live happily ever after (or at least until the next installment).\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s the generic and somewhat cliche Disney model for a new animated film (franchise). Nevertheless, don\u2019t get me wrong: it works perfectly. Sure, it doesn\u2019t bring anything new story-wise, but it\u2019s still a great time. Despite some unnecessary and lazy exposition (the magical trolls are basically exposition devices), Frozen still delivers a truly captivating and visually jaw-dropping narrative. I do need to emphasize this: the animation is phenomenal. Elsa\u2019s magic is seamless and beautiful. Arendelle is a gorgeous location, and the snowy mountains are impressively designed. Let It Go will always be remembered for its lyrics and melody, but the actual animated sequence is astonishing.\r\n\r\nEvery character carries a lot of expressiveness, which allows them to do basically everything. Frozen might not be a groundbreaking movie, but its compelling characters make the generic plot work. From Elsa and Anna\u2019s complicated but heartwarming relationship to Kristoff and Sven\u2019s camaraderie, I care about all of them\u2026 especially Olaf. I know, Olaf is simply the snowman version of a comic-relief character. He doesn\u2019t really have a complex arc in need of extreme development. However, it\u2019s impossible not to love him. He\u2019s such a welcome presence in every single scene. Every single line of his is either a funny remark or a pretty valuable insight into something.\r\n\r\nCounting him out, every other character has a very well explored arc, mainly Elsa and Anna. Their (older) relationship originates from a plot point that might be a tad exaggerated, but it\u2019s convincing enough. Finally, the score is as important as it is fantastic. It\u2019s an animated musical, let us not forget about that. Obviously, Let It Go is the queen of all songs due to its catchy lyrics, memorable chorus, and significance to the character. But other ones such as Do You Wanna Build a Snowman and For the First Time in Forever also carry a sweet melody plus some exquisite character and story development. That\u2019s what I love the most about musicals and why Disney always triumphs regarding this aspect: the way a simple song can tell so much about someone or move the plot forward. In my opinion, it\u2019s the genre\u2019s variation of \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the end, Frozen might not be a groundbreaking animated film story-wise, but it delivers around 100 minutes of pure fun and entertainment. With an exceptional voice cast (Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, and Josh Gad are wonderful), Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee are able to take Disney\u2019s formula and create a worthy variation of the classic blueprint. From the emotionally compelling and well-developed characters to the eyegasmic animation quality, Frozen is a good time from start to finish. Boasting some memorable and catchy songs, it became one of the decade\u2019s culturally most impactful animated movies. I wish exposition wasn\u2019t overused, and that more risks were taken concerning the screenplay, but as a Disney animated flick, it meets the company\u2019s standards.\r\n\r\nRating: B","id":"5ddc0bc53faba0001500a759","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ddc0bc53faba0001500a759","movie_id":109445}

{"author":"Reno","content":"I never saw its teaser, nor read its synopsis, but straight went to see it. And I kind of not satisfied for the first hour of the movie. I just wondered what was the movies' idea to fulfill the viewer's desire. Right away I knew it was not an entertainer, then it must highlight something or give a message. Till the beginning of the end, I thought the same way. Then my perspective changed, actually it changed my previous stance about all the earlier narration.\r\n\r\n**''I know y'all are upset, but got to lift him up.\r\nLet's keep him lifted up.''**\r\n\r\nAfter witnessing the crucial last scene, I was stunned by the incident that was portrayed in the movie. Realized all the initial developments were got meaning in this part of the movie. So I came to know it was based on the real incident. First of all it was not a person's whole biography, though it is told from his critical time of life. The incident can be viewed in two ways. The fight definitely took place on the sub-way, it was not the Oscar Grant's (lead man) fault. But still the consequences are expected, especially on the new year's eve the alert against violence cannot be negligible by the law. But, what cops did was the over reaction to the situation.\r\n\r\nSuch incidents happen in every country and many of them won't come into the lights. I'm glad about this movie, because it kind of creates awareness of such events. Hats off to all the cast and crew who brought it into the silver screen and now the whole world can know the truth. A must see movie among the 2013 releases.","id":"54208a700e0a26577f000139","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54208a700e0a26577f000139","movie_id":157354}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Mission thanksgiving. The turkeys time to fight back!\r\n\r\nIt is definitely an underrated animation. Okay, I agree, Disney is solely dominating the animation industry, especially at present. But this film is no masterpiece like that Disney makes yet not bad to ignore complete. Yes, there are flaws in it, but very acceptable as they're just minors. In the animations, the real world logics won't apply. So you should try to enjoy it than trying to find the errors.\r\n\r\nThis film is targeted for children, but then anybody can watch it because it is a beautiful theme with some real laughs in it, only if you forget that you are an adult for a 90 minute. Technically the film quality matches with Disney, Pixer, Dreamworks and even the Sony animation. It is a fine achievement for an outside\/new production house to come up with like this. I hope Reel FX would make more animations in the future and compete directly with these top companies.\r\n\r\nIt was really a star studded cast. I did not know who were they all, but I identified them by their voices. As far as the story, too easy to predict, but somehow it managed to keep me glued to it with its entertaining contents. It is a time travel theme and a quite entertaining film made by the 'Horton Hears a Who' director.\r\n\r\nSome are saying it is anti-thanking giving film, but I think it is just a fun film. Although, it was kind of like 'Happy Feet', where a bunch of turkeys tries to loose their kind from the humans grip. But narrated differently, something like in the line of 'Penguins of Madagascar'. I don't think anybody can regret watching it, but then there are people with expectations, so it might fail at them. Overall, it was a decent film for sure if not great as other animations that came in the same year. Waiting for its sequel about 'mission turducken'.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"576d789cc3a3687b97001e07","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/576d789cc3a3687b97001e07","movie_id":175574}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I guess one good thing one can say about this movie is that the producer had tried to make it a bit original. Unfortunately it did not work for me. I have never really liked these handy-cam movies where all the scenes are jumping around. This one tried to be a bit original in that it was simulating being made by an old-fashioned world war II film camera instead of a handy-cam. I am afraid that it did not really make it any better as far as I am concerned. It just added a few scrapes and the occasional end of the film reel effect every so often. Usually when something gory was about to happen.\n\nSpeaking of gory. The movie was not really that goory unless you count a lot of body parts being strewn around the scenes. Plenty of the, supposedly, gory parts was just silly, possibly supposed to be comical, but mostly just really silly. The part where the mad \u201cgenious\u201d was grafting to brain parts, one Nazi and one communist, together was just ludicrous and sad.\n\nThe blurb claims this was supposed to be Hitler\u2019s last ghastly attempt to win the war but in the movie it seemed little more than some crazy guys drug induced dream. The main adversary failed completely in projecting any form of \u201cgenius\u201d image and there certainly did not seem to be any support from the Nazi regime.\n\nTo make matters worse there was really not a single likable person in the movie.

{"author":"junijubiroke","content":"\"Frozen,\" the latest Disney musical extravaganza, preaches the importance of embracing your true nature but seems to be at odds with itself.\r\n\r\nThe animated, 3-D adventure wants to enliven and subvert the conventions of typical Disney princess movies while simultaneously remaining true to their aesthetic trappings for maximum merchandising potential. It encourages young women to support and stay loyal to each other\u2014a crucial message when mean girls seem so prevalent\u2014as long as some hunky potential suitors and adorable, wise-cracking creatures also are around to complete them.\r\n\r\nIt all seems so cynical, this attempt to shake things up without shaking them up too much. \"Frozen\" just happens to be reaching theaters as Thanksgiving and the holiday shopping season are arriving. The marketing possibilities are mind-boggling. And in the tradition of the superior \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"The Little Mermaid,\" surely \"Frozen: The Musical\" will be headed to the Broadway stage soon. The songs \u2013 which are lively and amusing if not quite instant hits\u2014are already in place. \r\n\r\nLittle girls will absolutely love it, though. That much is undeniable. And the film from co-directors Chris Buck (\"Surf's Up\") and Jennifer Lee is never less than gorgeous to watch. A majestic mountaintop ice castle is particularly exquisite\u2014glittery and detailed and tactile, especially as rendered in 3-D.\r\n\r\nBut first we must witness the tortured backstory of the film's princesses \u2013 not one, but two of them. The script from \"Wreck-It Ralph\" co-writer Lee, inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen story \"The Snow Queen,\" has lots of cheeky, contemporary touches but is firmly and safely rooted in Scandinavian fairy tale traditions.\r\n\r\nWhen they were young girls, sisters Anna and Elsa were joyous playmates and inseparable friends. But Elsa's special power\u2014her ability to turn anything to ice and snow in a flash from her fingertips\u2014comes back to haunt her when she accidentally zaps her sister. (Not unlike the telekinesis in \"Carrie,\" Elsa inadvertently unleashes her power in moments of heightened emotion.) A magical troll king heals Anna and erases the event from her memory, but as for the sisters' relationship, the damage is done.\r\n\r\nElsa's parents lock her away and close down the castle, which devastates the younger Anna. (Of the many tunes from \"Avenue Q\" and \"The Book of Mormon\" songwriter Robert Lopez and his wife, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the wistful \"Do You Want to Build a Snowman?\" is by far the most poignant.) But once they reach adolescence and it's Elsa's turn to take over the throne at age 18, the two experience an awkward reunion.\r\n\r\nThe perky, quirky Anna (now voiced by a likable Kristen Bell) is a little nervous but overjoyed to see her sister. The reserved and reluctant Elsa (Broadway veteran Idina Menzel) remains distant, and with gloved hands hopes not to freeze anything and reveal her true self on coronation day. But a run-in with an amorous, visiting prince (Santino Fontana) who sets his sights on Anna triggers Elsa's ire, and she inadvertently plunges the sunny, idyllic kingdom into perpetual winter.\r\n\r\nFlustered and fearful, Elsa dashes away in a fit of self-imposed exile \u2013 which significantly weakens \"Frozen,\" since she's the film's most complicated and compelling figure. On her way to the highest mountain she can find, Elsa belts out the power ballad \"Let It Go,\" her version of \"I Am Woman.\" This soaring declaration of independence is the reason you want a performer of Menzel's caliber in this role, and it's the film's musical highlight. (Her flashy physical transformation from prim princess to ice queen does make her resemble a real housewife of some sort, however.)\r\n\r\nAfterward, though, the story settles in on Anna's efforts to retrieve her sister and restore order to the kingdom. Along the way she gets help from an underemployed ice salesman named Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his trusty reindeer sidekick, Sven. They all meet up with a singing snowman named Olaf (a lovably goofy Josh Gad, star of \"The Book of Mormon\" on Broadway) who dreams of basking in the warmth of the summer sun. This \"Wizard of Oz\"-style quartet makes the obstacle-filled trek to the imposing fortress that awaits. (At least \"Frozen\" has the decency to borrow from excellent source material.)\r\n\r\nWhile the journey may seem overly familiar, the destination has some surprises in store. Some come out of nowhere and don't exactly work. But the biggie\u2014the one that's a real game-changer in terms of the sorts of messages Disney animated classics have sent for decades\u2014is the one that's important not just for the little girls in the audience, but for all viewers. http:\/\/newmoviestream.co\/watch\/2294629\/frozen\r\nwish everything about the film met the same clever standard.","id":"535fe7c2c3a36830a9006c93","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/535fe7c2c3a36830a9006c93","movie_id":109445}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Disneyland to Disasterland.**\r\n\r\nThe first thing is it is a different film. Might not be fully a fresh concept, but a rare kind. A bunch of wonderful characters and cast, this is somewhat entertaining. Takes place in the backdrop of Disneyland, Florida. Focused on a small family with two little kids having a nice time in the theme park. The story centres mainly on the father, who unable to resist the attraction towards two young French girls seen everywhere he goes. Which leads him to make mistakes being a father. Moreover, strange and unrecognisable events jeopardises the unity of his family.\r\n\r\nA bit of fantasy and reality, the film has a style. I thought it was just a flow that's taking it to the other end of the film, but the twist caught me by surprise. Nothing like a mind blowing, but for this kind of small flick, it was good enough. I don't think in any way the film offends the Disney park and Disney fans. Though the Disney did a fine job ignoring it rather than creating more publicity for the film by suing. It was just a possibility of life event which can take place anywhere, anytime. So, that's how it came into the life with this children's favourite theme park. Despite where it sets in, the film is for the adults. I think it is worth a try without any expectation.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"598ca66c925141105800091f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/598ca66c925141105800091f","movie_id":158752}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is a movie that had more or less escaped under my radar until I saw it mentioned in one of my news feeds as a Blu-ray giveaway a couple of days ago. Given that it had both Stallone and Schwarzenegger in it, it was really a must buy for me.\r\n\r\nThe escape from prison plot theme is not exactly a new idea but must be considered a rather classical one. A lot of great books and movies have, if not been centered around that theme so at least had it as a major plot element. I would say that it is rather difficult to make a new movie on this theme these days without it feeling a bit stale.\r\n\r\nDuring my movie evening yesterday I was happy to find that this one succeeds quite well in not feeling stale. It also succeeds very well in pairing together Stallone and Schwarzenegger without making it deteriorate into some action hero parody.\r\n\r\nThe basic plot is in one sense the classical hero gets framed, thrown into jail and has to escape. In another sense it is slightly unconventional in that our hero is not only an escape artist, or rather an escape specialist, but a legal one at that.\r\n\r\nBoth Stallone and Schwarzenegger are doing a good job of their roles. We all know that these two actors are not exactly Shakespeare-material and is not really competing for any acting Oscars but they do deliver solid performance as male, though-guy, heroes.\r\n\r\nThe bad guy at the prison is not too bad, in terms of performance, either. The one person I felt was a bit meh was the guy who set Breslin up. I also think they could have made more of a show in nailing that bastard in the end. Not that he did not get what he deserved but I missed a \u201cI\u2019m back\u201d moment with a confrontation between Breslin and him.\r\n\r\nOn the whole a quite enjoyable movie even though the prison break theme is not one of my favorite ones. Oh, and as usual Rotten Tomatoes \u201cofficial\u201d rating is pure nonsense. Due to their idiotic rating mechanism they flag it as rotten which it most certainly is not.","id":"5aec97fcc3a3682ecc000ffe","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5aec97fcc3a3682ecc000ffe","movie_id":107846}
{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"Escape Plan strategises an unbelievable route that never manages to break out of its cliches. Stallone and Schwarzenegger. The duelling juggernauts of 80s action. An impenetrable maximum security facility monolithically stands in their way, preventing them from being reliable gym buddies and exercising those lucrative vein-inducing steroids. Will Arnie \u201cbe back\u201d? Is Stallone still missing \u201cAdriaaaaan!\u201d\r\n\r\nRegardless of the nostalgic fuel that pumps through H\u00e5fstr\u00f6m\u2019s reunion, it\u2019s unfortunately weighed down by an implausibly ridiculous plot that believes itself to be smarter than it actually is, diminishing the non-sensical fun in the process. Best get \u201cback to da choppa!\u201d ey Arnie? (Or governor of California...). An escape artist, hired independently to test maximum security facilities by breaking out of them, is setup by his own financial advisor and incarcerated in the most secure prison of them all.\r\n\r\nSoldiers, probably ex-military, walking around with black \u2018V for Vendetta\u2019 masks scaring up the prisoners who just want to sleep. Schwarzenegger delivering some excruciatingly brilliant one liners as per usual. \u201cYou fight like a vegetarian!\u201d. Stallone, probably extremely interested and involved, looking generally fatigued and uncharismatic. Water hoses shoved down the throats of prisoners, whilst locked in steel boxes (crucial point...) with the brightest and hottest lamps beating down upon them. Palaeontologist Dr. Alan Grant recovering from the trauma of \u2018Jurassic Park III\u2019, by medically assisting America\u2019s most dangerous criminals. And Vinnie \u201cI\u2019m the Juggernaut!\u201d Jones putting the \u201ccock\u201d in \u201ccockney\u201d. Suffice to say, it\u2019s a paradise. A beautiful holiday retreat. If only the plot was just as idyllic.\r\n\r\nEssentially, Escape Plan fundamentally works due to Stallone and Schwarzenegger\u2019s chemistry. Divert away from this, and plot conveniences, holes and illogicality rapidly take precedent. Ray is described to be the ultimate escape artist, which is essentially a cop out description for his character to do literally anything and consider it to be objective fact. Example: using broken glasses, paper and other utensils to blindly craft an apparatus that aligns with the moon to determine the equatorial alignment of one\u2019s current location. Perhaps this is a legitimate tool that can be created under a prison table. I don\u2019t know. Nor do I care. My point is, due to the prison being \u201cthe most secure facility in existence\u201d, the actual escape plan requires the audience to promptly suspend their disbelief.\r\n\r\nThe brawls and action are few and far between, resulting in the remaining hour and half to be weirdly edited conversations where the camera manages to go through Stallone\u2019s eye on multiple occasions. In fact the entire editing, from quick cuts to weird scene transitions that remind me of Microsoft PowerPoint fade out animations, decreased the quality of the general filmmaking. Not to mention the obvious green screen and dreadfully unnecessary moments of CGI.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the gloomy day, you probably wanted to watch this just for Stallone and Schwarzenegger, in which case you\u2019ll be satisfied. You just have to endure the mountainous implausibilities, overextended runtime and underwhelming conclusion. Had it been made thirty years ago, could\u2019ve been good. So perhaps conducting your own escape plan could be better?","id":"5e207392e004a6001899781d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e207392e004a6001899781d","movie_id":107846}

Unfortunately, the lack of an ending feels lazy, as there are many lost opportunities for a more interesting plot (e.g., someone from outside could have noticed that something was wrong with the simulator resetting all the time and do something, like debugging it).","id":"5d8788775a469000109d0e24","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d8788775a469000109d0e24","movie_id":129399}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I think I have never seen a movie with such (over)saturated and vibrant colors. Well, that is apart from the first few minutes which are in black and white as some tribute to the \u201coriginal\u201d Wizard of Oz movie. Surprisingly enough it works quite well. The sceneries and landscapes are beautiful to watch in just the right fairy-tale style that you would expect from the land of Oz.\n\nThe story is pretty much a prequel to the original Wizard of Oz story. Something which does not really intrude too much for most part of the movie but becomes painfully obvious in the last couple of scenes. As for the general story it is pretty much okay. It pleased the kids for sure and I would say that is the main goal of this movie. For adults well, as I said it is okay but not really much more.\n\nThe lead character can be infuriating at times with his \u201cdubious ethics\u201d as the blurb words it. Unfortunately he never really manages to convey that likable rascal attitude that one would have hoped for. He somehow just stays a rather bland character with \u201cdubious ethics\u201d. I think this goes for most of the other main characters as well. Except for the dubious ethics of course which for the other characters are either plain good or totally and without a doubt bad ones.\n\nOn the whole I would say that the movie was okay but never really reached any higher than that. For a kid it was probably somewhat better than okay. I did enjoy the movie although this was mostly for the unusual and vibrant colorization and the lovely scenery.","id":"5ab3dc190e0a265f3000bb51","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ab3dc190e0a265f3000bb51","movie_id":68728}

Too long at just under two hours length, the makers appear to have dropped Melissa McCarthy in the middle of a film, built a load of questionable on going gags around her, and then thrown Jason Bateman in for the charm offensive. Then as the film runs out of steam at the mid-point, it gets caught in a vortex of contrivances and pseudo serious statements. It's a real hodge-podge of a script that does the actors no favours at all. A great premise is not fulfilled, sadly.\r\n\r\nIdentity Thief only escapes bottom of the ladder status because fans of the two leads will find a modicum of enjoyment in their respective efforts. 5\/10","id":"5342689ec3a3683d03000cb4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5342689ec3a3683d03000cb4","movie_id":109431}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is a quite different zombie movie. I think it can best be described as a romantic zombie movie with a humorous touch and some action thrown in for good measure. It is not at all a bad movie. I do prefer the \u201cshot everything that moves and when it doesn\u2019t move anymore shot some more just to be sure\u201d type of zombie movies but I still quite enjoyed this one. The words \u201cromantic\u201d and \u201czombie\u201d is of course two words that you really would never expect to see in the same sentence. Surprisingly enough it does indeed work in this movie.\n\nI think my main enjoyment of this movie was the voice-over with R\u2019s thoughts though. At times it is incredibly funny. The actual story, that the zombies\u2019 magically starts to heal themselves is of course pretty nonsensical but you do not really watch zombie movies for their elaborate plot anyway. I have seen worse and this was not really supposed to be a horror-zombie movie anyway so I can live with that.\n\nThis is the first zombie-movie that I have watched where you actually see the story from the zombies perspective. Another thing that, surprisingly enough, worked quite well. The voice-overs helped a lot to make that happen.\n\nThe special effects are fairly low key for being a zombie movie but I would say that they are just about right for this movie. The \u201cbonies\u201d are the most monster-like ones in the movie and their make-up is quite cool. Unfortunately their movements are quite stiff and look decidedly computer generated. That is a shame and pretty much the only complaint I have concerning the actual implementation of this movie.\n\nUnless you are totally allergic to zombies I would recommend watching this movie. I would especially recommend it if you are not normally into zombie movies. You are likely to be surprised.","id":"5a9b9d2b0e0a2605c602b82e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a9b9d2b0e0a2605c602b82e","movie_id":82654}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"As with most zombie movies the plot is rather contrived and unbelievable (even if you accept the existence of zombies) but if you want to watch zombie movies in the first place that is something that you are supposed to be immune to.\n\nThis is another variant of zombies being created by some virus and rapidly taking over most of the planet. As I said, the entire story is somewhat unbelievable. When I first read about zombies as a kid there was always some supernatural\/magic stuff involved. I think I liked that \u201cexplanation\u201d much better than the virus nonsense which just have too many holes in it. For example there is no way a virus could make human bodies roam around aimlessly inside a sterile laboratory for days without nutrition. Well, as I said, it is a zombie movie so one just have to get over these little issues.\n\nAs an action movie with zombies as the main adversary it is a fairly good movie. The action is solid, the special effects okay and the entire movie continues at a reasonably brisk pace. Pitt is also doing a decent job of his role. There are few of the other actors that are very memorable though. The scenes where the zombies pile onto each other to scale walls and even reach choppers are rather cool. The movie is not very gory for being a zombie movie. Whether that is a good thing or not depends on the viewer I guess. Personally I do not mind some gory stuff in zombie movies.\n\nThere are a few annoying parts which Hollywood always seem to have to throw in. For example, the world is on the brink of the apocalypse and Lane and his wife just doesn\u2019t want to get involved. What the f\u2026? Also why do people always let their kids wander away in situations where they really should keep track of them? Not to mention how clumsy people always get when they have to sneak around and be silent. These things are just annoying.\n\nAnyway, this movie fulfils its purpose as two hours of action-filled but not too intelligent entertainment quite well.","id":"5a3a0e1292514103242092c4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a3a0e1292514103242092c4","movie_id":72190}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I have to say, or in this case write, that this was a fairly disappointing movie. It is pretty much a Die Hard wannabee with a daughter-dislikes-father sub-plot. I do not mind the reusing of the Die Hard concept if the film is good. This one is not really. The script is a stupid, unintelligent political script.\n\nIt starts off badly with some nonsensical crap about a controversial (that is putting it mildly) political deal with the Middle East about pulling out troops from all the bases in the Middle East. To add to this the entire situation have come about because the president just left several people to hang out and dry when he decided to pull the plug on operations in the Middle East. By hanging out and dry we mean get killed or spend some quality time in the regional prisons. That put the president on the bad guy list instead of the good guy as far as I am concerned. I do not know if the writer was trying to make a political statement, which I never like in my movies, or is just plain stupid. Given the rest of the script I would go for stupid or both.\n\nThe good thing with the movie is that there is quite a lot of action and some of it is rather okay to watch. There are a few funny moments as well. I quite liked the tour guide for example.\n\nUnfortunately, even if you try to forget about the political nonsense, the rest of the script is just full of utter stupidity. It starts of not too bad with the diversion at the Capitol and the initial take over of the White House even though a whole bunch of armed, obviously unscreened, guys getting into the White House to work on the president\u2019s home theatre like that is not very believable.\n\nAfter that it gradually degrades though. Cale is nowhere as charismatic, nor as professional, as McClane and there are lots of silly and stupid moments. For example, the car chase starts of not too bad but then Cale get\u2019s into some bloody dream mode and gets shot up. Just dumb. During the same episode the tank scene is just ridiculous. Would they only have one tank? Not very likely. It takes forever for it to move. It is also highly improbable that it could be taken out like that by a hand-held launcher by a front hit. Rear or side maybe but not a front hit. The writer is obviously clueless about military matters. The fumbled chopper attack is embarrassingly bad. The worst is probably when Cale\u2019s daughter stops and air-strike by waving a flag outside the White House. I almost turned off the movie at that point.\n\nIt is too bad because the movie had the budget and some nice actors to be a good action movie but was just ruined by a louse script with a totally unnecessary bunch of political nonsense in it. The next time I see a movie were the script is written by James Vanderbilt I am going to be very cautious.","id":"5ae345770e0a262a55044457","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ae345770e0a262a55044457","movie_id":117251}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"But no piece of art is worth a human life... \r\n\r\nTrance is directed by Danny Boyle and adapted to screenplay by John Hodge from Joe Ahearne's film of the same name from 2001. It stars James McAvoy, Vincent Cassel and Rosario Dawson. Music is scored by Rick Smith and cinematography is by Anthony Dod Mantle. \r\n\r\nArt auctioneer worker Simon (McAvoy) does the double-cross on Franck (Cassel), his partner in an art heist, but after taking a blow to the head suffers amnesia and can't recall where he has hidden a stolen Goya masterpiece. Franck and his thug side-kicks decide to send Simon to hypnotherapist Elizabeth (Dawson) in the hope of unlocking the painting's hiding place. However, once the therapy starts, secrets come tumbling out and nothing is ever as it at first seems. \r\n\r\nAlready this early in the day after the film's release, we know for certain that Danny Boyle's foray into neo-noir is going to split his fan base considerably. Admired for his ability to turn his hand at any genre he fancies, Boyle reaches back to his earlier movies and comes up with a mind bending neo-noir that crackles with the kind of sexual edginess that Paul Verhoeven thrived upon. It sounds snobbish I know, and I have been called a neo-noir snob recently, but if all things noir are not your thing then this really is a film you should stay away from. Think Basic Instinct meets Inception and they take out a 40s Heist movie for drinks and you get an idea where we are at with Trance. \r\n\r\nAll the hallmarks of noir, both neo and conventional classics, are evident here, from characterisations to visual smarts, it's a noir head's dream and very much a must see on the big screen or on Blu-ray formats. Forget any notion of having someone to root for in this, there is scarcely a decent human bone on show. Characters are either fuelled by greed, lust, jealousy or vengeance, or quite simply just not smart enough to operate in the circles they move in. Amnesia is a key component of the story, something which again features a lot in olde noir, as does the central character being a complete dupe...To expand upon more would be stupid of me, the less you know the better it actually is upon first viewing. It really is a difficult film to discuss without delving into why it is such a trippy and deliciously cheeky piece of film. That's not to say that narratively it's smarter than a brain pie, because that's not the case. For as the threads untangle, several times, the mind meld aspect will fall apart if plot dissection is your thing? Also cramming so much \"brain food\" into the last quarter of film kind of feels like too much, overkill if you will. While Franck's side-kick bad boys are irritatingly disposable. Yet it's a film that begs to be seen more than once, twice, thrice even... \r\n\r\nVisually it's superlative, it's clear that Boyle and Mantle know and admire noir's visual splendours, with an awareness of atmospheric importance (noir is an atmosphere, not a genre. There's the snob in me again!) pulsing throughout. Set in London but filmed out of Dungeness in Kent, the backdrop is a city of steel and mirrors, a thriving city of wealth and mistrust. The tricks of the trade are here but never once is it style over substance, the visual ticks matter to the narrative. Night time overhead shots of a bustling city come and go, different colour tones for different character's apartments are clever, oblique camera angles ensure distortion of frame is equal to distortion of antagonists\/protagonists minds (whose trance is this, really?...). Smudgey silhouettes through bronze glass, outrageous POV shots and caressing camera shots of the human form, no shot is wasted in the name of adding detail. Rest assured, Boyle brings his \"A\" game here. All of which is covered over by Smith's slow rumbling score that acts as a foreboding observer ready to unleash itself when the carnage begins. \r\n\r\nThe three principal actors come out firing and clearly are enjoying themselves. McAvoy cements his \"A\" list credentials with a multi layered performance, Cassel is as usual a mighty presence and Dawson, in a bold role, does her best work so far and hints she's ready to move into the big league. While it has to be noted that all three actors have to play their cards very close to their chests throughout; and do so admirably. Boyle's action construction is kinetic, with the pre-credits sequence one of the best opening sequences lately, and Hodge's script has a playfulness about it that ensures those paying attention know the film is self-mocking and not taking itself half as seriously as some film fans seem to think. An audience splitter it is sure to be, but for those with a bent for noirish sexy mind bending heist capers? Get in there! 9\/10","id":"5c5badbc925141338cb97125","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c5badbc925141338cb97125","movie_id":68727}

Frank and his wife fight back to some degree, but the gang disarms them.  In parallel, Josh tries to help out a prostitute who has been beaten up by her, ah, employer.  That does not go so well.\r\n4. All this gets interrupted by a long depiction of the Rapture, which is much better done than in _The Mark_.

On the other hand, minus the doctrine, the film is short on story, and it is spread over 88 minutes.","id":"5511806792514148dd0000b5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5511806792514148dd0000b5","movie_id":179269}
{"author":"jw","content":"surprising depth and quality\r\n\r\nExpecting yet another revenge\/vigilante movie - Statham is an action guy, right? - I was disappointed, but in a very positive way. This movie has character development, good acting, and a story with more depth than to be expected. It's no psychological masterpiece, but it goes far beyond a simple action flick.\r\n\r\nIt starts out simple, though. Former soldier became drug addicted bum, living in the streets; by accident, he gets a way out. And into moral grey zones - very dark grey. \r\n\r\nThere is a love story in it, but it is a good one, I think; two complex characters each struggling with themselves, and their lives. And the most gripping part for me was where we see two people waiting, watching other people.\r\n\r\nFear not, it's not all artsy and emotional; there's a bit of action as well - solid quality, reliably delivered by Statham (and a good team). With a small side of humour. Violence is not the core of this movie; it's just part of the story. Which is a dark and gritty one.\r\n\r\nI found this movie worth my time, and memorable enough to write this review. Recommended.\r\n\r\nPS: Someone called this \"a thoughtful action movie or a violent art film\" - and very good in either function. I agree.","id":"5c7f2baa925141277a1819e2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c7f2baa925141277a1819e2","movie_id":136418}

{"author":"Reno","content":"You might remember a few months ago I reviewed a title about the summer camp prank. The movie was called 'Standing Up' that I loved a lot. This movie is kind of similar, but deals on a different issue. Absolutely an important movie that discloses the most common trouble faced by the physically weak students, especially loners who were targeted by the bully boys. It was based on the book 'Regret!'. That is why we need more novel adaptation that deliver the messages to the younger generation.\r\n\r\nThe story was narrated from the perspective of a high school student David. He also a member of the band called 'Point Out!'. David in not a boy who interfere with others affairs, like a quiet one he's focused on his studies and other activities. He has a crush on his classmate Vera, and so she's on him, but they never expressed to each others. In between their secret affection, a fellow mate called Jochem comes into the scene. He's fat and have no friends, which mean an easy prey for the tyrant of the class. As the school days progress Jochem makes friends with David and Vera, individually. He begins to spend some time with them, but that does not solve his problems. With a little misunderstanding between the three, the story reveals what they had failed to recognize, the seriousness of the situation.\r\n\r\n> **\u2018\u2018You should drink water instead.\r\n> It's healthy. And it doesn't stain.\u2019\u2019**\r\n\r\nRecently kind of I'm attracted to the Dutch movies. Saw some of the best movies and every time with the new movies my interest and expectations on them are growing. So that is how I came up with this movie, an awesome movie. Well, this movie theme was good, a very good movie to educate school and college students about what is right and wrong. Like you know by now it was about bullying, the movie displays what had to be shown. With the blend of little hide-and-seek romance track and music in few parts.\r\n\r\nBullying is fun for some, but it is a crime, especially if it ends in an unexpected way. To create such trouble the story takes time to advance that kind of looks a drag in the tale. Well written screenplay, which concentrated around three characters. Each of them were so good in their respective roles. This kind of message movie is what I expect from Hollywood, because Hollywood movies can reach all the corner of the earth. I hope dubbed or remake version will do justice to the truth the movie tried to tell. A movie not to be missed, especially if you a parent to the teenagers.","id":"540382c00e0a2658e2008408","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/540382c00e0a2658e2008408","movie_id":193418}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I had some expectations on this movie. Samurai\u2019s, fantasy, magic etc\u2026 Sounds good to me alright. Well, as it turned out after having watched it I feel that my expectations was not entirely fulfilled. It is a decent enough movie. Certainly enjoyable to watch. But it is, in my opinion, not a great move and I cannot give it more than an average okay rating.\r\n\r\nI have not read the original story which the movie is, supposedly, based nor seen any of the other 47 Ronin movies that have been made. Thus I did not really know what the story was except what was the public storyline nor do I know if the movie actually follows the original story in any great detail. The basic story in the movie is a good one though. Classic, simple and perhaps not very original but a good concept for making a good adventure movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie is entertaining\u2026to an extent. There are plenty of nice scenes, action, special effects that all make the movie worthwhile to watch. The Japanese, samurai, setting is one that is not used very often in major movies except of course for a bunch of fairly ludicrous martial arts movies which cater for a rather limited audience and generally on a very low-budget.\r\n\r\nHowever, I never really felt much attachment to any of the characters. Even the half-breed, which are supposed to be the hero, never seemed to lift above the ordinary. The bad guy could have been any two-bit crook in a TV-show. The witch was a bit better but still rather meh. The Shogun at least provoked a bit of emotions but not in a good way. What an asshole! Not a shred of investigation when Lord Asano was bewitched. Just \u201cgo kill yourself\u201d. Then after the 47 Ronins had actually proven his innocence as well as proven themselves to be the most loyal and capable warriors around the dumb fuck wants them killed because they disobeyed his orders which where total nonsense from the start. As a matter of fact, the ending dragged down the movie quite a lot for me.\r\n\r\nStill a movie worth watching but it could have been a lot better.","id":"53e751660e0a266f8d00168f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53e751660e0a266f8d00168f","movie_id":64686}
{"author":"Dsnake1","content":"As far as found footage films go, this is one that exists.\r\n\r\nThe first two-thirds of the film certainly can't be called much of a horror film. It honestly could be some sort of indie drama focused on a quirky road trip and an all-too-real relationship. Frankly, I thought it was more than a tad boring.\r\n\r\nThe last third is where the 'magic' happens. Well, it's supposed to. There's a good chunk, which holds the majority of the scares of the movie, where the sound is all whispers intermixed with a handful of screams. This was my least favorite part of the film.\r\n\r\nWhere I think the film is strongest is the very final scene. It doesn't do anything particularly frightening; we don't even see the main focus of the movie. No, the movie introduces a bit of lore, a bit of incredibly interesting information which is barely a callback. Regardless, the resulting Google searches after the movie was over were almost, if not more, interesting than the movie itself.\r\n\r\nWhile so far, this has seemed like a rather damning review, it really isn't nearly as bad as it seems. Sure, the film falls into the same traps so many found footage films do, in that it's boring until the climax and the action afterward just doesn't make up for the first two thirds, but it's also not nearly as bad as some of the found footage movies I've seen. It's also not campy in the slightest. It's all rather just mediocre.","id":"5d96f1dd075288001d3f707a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d96f1dd075288001d3f707a","movie_id":185460}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Between the parent's absence and the child protective service, the struggle lies!**\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderful film, but not the first time I'm seeing. I mean there's a similar film called 'Children of Invention' about two Chinese-American kids. So this film tells the similar story about two kids whose parents were drug addicts. After they were taken by the cops, the two boys try to live by themselves, struggling to feed and hiding all day and night long from the authorities. But how long this thing can go and with a little message, the story comes to an end.\r\n\r\nI won't say it was better than the other title I mentioned, but surely well developed than that. Still, I did not like the conclusion. There are some flawed parts like the shopkeeper trying to avenge in front of the cops. Yet the overall film was kind of realistic. That approach is what I liked from this. The two lead kids were brilliant. The entire film revolves around them, basically the camera never takes off the lens from them.\r\n\r\nAt some point it gets emotional, but the negativity was actually telling the truth. I mean the child welfare is to protect them, but not in this film, any film around the world, they are portrayed like they are the child snatchers. Like a boogeyman. That must change which is in the hands of the organisation to alter their approach to handling such situation. Definitely it is a must see film, despite a few defects. The theme was strong with drugs and sex references, so I think it is not suitable for the kids, despite two kids in the lead. But I think it would work if they were supervised by their parents.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5835da949251416c2e013729","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5835da949251416c2e013729","movie_id":158908}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I have not read the books. Judging by the reviews from people who have read them that seems to be a good thing as most of them seem to complain that the movie is not a good representation of the books. Then, when looking at the book ratings at Goodreads there seems to be a rather large spread between reviews loving the book and reviews hating it.\r\n\r\nIf I had read the books I would expect them to sit on my young adult shelf in Goodreads. At least the movie is clearly for a teenage audience. Nevertheless it is quite entertaining as far as I am concerned. A bit silly and predictable at times but still entertaining. I would even call it a family movie although there where some scenes that might be a bit scary for the youngest ones in the family.\r\n\r\nThe story is yet another variant of the classical young girl or boy discovers that there are things that go bump in the night and also that she is part of those things. I have to say that I quite like those kind of stories.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote I found the movie quite entertaining but, although I cannot say that I have anything specific to complain, the movie never really lifts itself above the average crowd of entertaining movies. The special effects are ok but nothing more, the acting is average, the story is okay and so on. It was enjoyable 130 minutes and I never felt bored but I never went wow either.\r\n\r\nBy the way, it never became clear to me why this episode was called City of Bones though.

{"author":"tmdb39513728","content":"Staggering Negligence\r\n\r\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\r\n\r\nDirectors come in all shapes and sizes. They range from megalomaniacal tyrants to milquetoast mice. The best ones are virtually invisible, suggestive, telepathic, allowing their talent and techies to excel, while quietly, expertly weaving together their grand vision. James Ponsoldt is either halfway there, or on his way to nowhere. It's obvious he frees up plenty of slack to let his actors run loose, but they don't always know which direction they're heading, and seem to be improvising without a script, which is interesting in a way, for a while, since it gives the movie a semi-reckless, naturalistic feel. The plan is there is no plan. And if the stars magically align in his favour, everyone wins. \r\n\r\nThe problem is some actors really do need direction. Miles Teller, jester of the present, boy without a future, looks awkward and lost much of the time, which may coincide with his character. Without proper guidance, sometimes he gets it right, sometimes trying too hard to be carefree, otherwise not knowing how to shine in the spotlight. He's probably just trying to keep his gears aligned with Shailene Woodley, who once again radiates, this time as a brainy Cinderella on a collision course with a broken heart. Seems she will redeem a second-rate picture every time. Yet again managing to rescue a movie that appears to have little purpose or scheme other than pairing up various young actors and assembling a series of romantic skits. Many scenes end abruptly, probably because the actors ran out of steam. Exhausting the moment. Making the now spectacular isn't easy when the director is absent.\r\n\r\nThen there's the accident-from-nowhere scene. When Miles cries out and orders Shailene out of the car in the middle of nowhere and, once stepping out on the freeway, is suddenly struck out of frame by a speeding bus. My heart jumped. Okay I'm awake now. I was ready to forgive the director's sheepishness up to that point, which was, I hoped, only a decoy to set up a fatal or near-fatal accident scene, one that was going to turn the narrative completely on its head. I was next expecting to find Woodley in a coma, a wheel-chair, or completely disfigured. And Miles being tested by an act of fate. How will he answer to this? But the story plods along as if nothing happened. Which I'm sure nothing did, not in the script or on location. It had to be a sensationalized CGI stunt contrived in the editing room to inject the tedious narrative with a much-needed shot of adrenaline. Cheap trick. This is clearly the sign of poor story-telling and a director that isn't in command of his position.","id":"54d90821c3a3687ac200008e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54d90821c3a3687ac200008e","movie_id":157386}
{"author":"Gimly","content":"**A long format review from 2013**\r\n\r\nDespite a virtually non-existent (comparatively) promotional campaign for Marvel\u2019s latest effort, Thor: The Dark World has crushed its competition box-office-wise. Though receiving less critical acclaim than Captain Phillips or Gravity, it did clean up in the finance department.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that in the MCU, my favourite Avenger is Thor, so a new film was always going to be an easy ticket from me. And I can\u2019t work out if that bias is making me more critical of the film because I care so much, or less because I\u2019m just happy it got made? I\u2019ll try to be as above board as possible.\r\n\r\nThor 2 is a spectacle, make no mistake. It has the appropriate mix of explosions, attractive people, monsters, humour, fighting, mesmerising visuals, sweet symbolism and heart-wrenching sorrow that can be expected from a decent super hero film. But beyond that, it doesn\u2019t really have much.\r\n\r\nI know it sounds like it has a lot, and it honestly does, but I just couldn\u2019t help feeling in a quite a number of moments that the thing felt hurried. Maybe if there wasn\u2019t such a mad rush to get a Thor sequel out by the end of 2013, they could have spent a little more time fleshing out and filling in the script (not that it\u2019s a short movie, I mean the pre-production feels rushed) and better utilising director Alan Taylor (Game of Thrones, Rome, Carnivale).

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"7 out of 10 stars would normally be considered quite okay and I guess you could say that this movie is quite okay. However, it has a reputation to live up to. As a movie in the Tolkien universe and with LOTR and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey this movie have a lot to live up to and, as far as I am concerned, it does not.\r\n\r\nAs an action\/adventure\/fantasy movie it is a quite okay movie. It has a lot of action of course, a lot of adventure and a lot of special effects. Of course everything plays out with the Tolkien universe as a back-drop. I guess it is rather superfluous to mention that the movie is based on the book The Hobbit by Tolkien. However it is here the problems start.\r\n\r\nIn my review of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey the first thing that I mentioned was that you should be aware of the fact that the movie did not follow the book in any great detail and that this was quite okay since the extensions were well made. Well, it should be no surprise that the first part of this statement is valid for this movie as well. Unfortunately, whereas the first movie felt like a fluid extension of the book this one feels like it is just full of fillers.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of cool scenes and a lot of action but it really feels like it was just put in there as fillers to showcase the special effects. Speaking of special effects, quite a few of them where rather unimpressive I have to say. The scenes where the dwarfs went down the rapids in barrels frequently looked plastic and artificial. The scenes with Smaug was not too bad even though he was quite overused but the parts around the forges was just plain ridiculous. I know it is fantasy but come one, getting them started and producing tons and tons of molten gold in a few minutes not to mention riding on molten metal without getting burned was just silly.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I found it an enjoyable movie but I was expecting more.","id":"535223740e0a2655fe00287f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/535223740e0a2655fe00287f","movie_id":57158}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is definitely a good and entertaining movie. For me however, it falls short of being great due to a couple of things that I really did not like. Be warned that the rest of this review contains a few spoilers if you have not watched the movie before reading this.\r\n\r\nThe movie begins quite well. I liked Wolverine getting into that bar taking revenge on the idiot hunting bears with poisoned darts. Then it did not continue so well. My main issue is that they screw with Wolverines healing powers really early on in the movie so that he is handicapped for a good chunk of it. I really did not like that. Now this does not stop there from being quite a few cool action sequences. The fight sequence on the Japanese bullet train was quite cool although a wee bit too drawn out perhaps.\r\n\r\nEventually he manages to get his powers back although the happiness does not last very long. In the final combat they actually deprive Wolverine of his adamantium claws and it doesn\u2019t look like he gets those back. What the f\u2026 is that? Sure, he regrows his original bone claws but that is not the same thing. Wolverine should have his adamantium claws, full stop. This is something I really dislike with a lot of Hollywood producers and directors now. They feel that they have to create some shock effect by destroying icons and constants in the world of movie fantasy. Like blowing up the Enterprise over and over again. I just hate it and for me this is the one thing that really stops this from being a great movie. Either they somehow give him back his proper claws or they can just as well make a reboot as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nIt is quite sad that they, I will not say ruined but at least, diminished the movie in this way. Otherwise it would have been a great movie. It has a lot of nice action, a not too bad script and Hugh Jackman is very good as Wolverine. Actually the only one I thought was somewhat si so is Dr Green who\u2019s acting is rather pathetic.\r\n\r\nAll in all a good and entertaining movie that could have been a lot better if it was not for the Hollywood dimwits who felt they had to put something shocking in it and screwed it up.","id":"5a79aab9925141775902258b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a79aab9925141775902258b","movie_id":76170}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Are ready to change yourself when you think you found your match!**\r\n\r\nWritten and directed by one of the famous Italian filmmaker, Giuseppe Tornatore. An English language film, Geoffrey Rush in the lead. It was about an aging art and antique auctioneer, Virgil. The story reveals his final days in his professional field where he meets a young woman who pursued him for her inherited antiques to put on auction. The woman is very mysterious, because of her medical condition and how they both become so close despite their initial meetings were disastrous is the remaining film to tell us with a twist in the final.\r\n\r\nIt was an awesome storytelling. The screenplay was the top notch and the matching background score. Especially when the story ends and credits rolls up, all those memories from the film keeps us fresh with that music. The music won several awards for the film. I liked the story, but towards the end, I kind of predicted almost everything. That did not stop me, so I enjoyed it thoroughly. Particularly the theme of the film, which I think a bit fresh, and I liked the conclusion as well, but I feel it should have been different or more to it. The way it ended might disappoint some people, but still it is very smart.\r\n\r\nEverybody was good, but it was Geoffrey Rush, who stole the show with his stellar performance. Three years might be a little late, but it's never too late to watch a fine film like this. One of the best suspense films from the recent time, it is a must see, particularly if you are seeking a good entertainment. So I hope you watch it if you're not yet.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"580e4ab0c3a36859aa001cfd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/580e4ab0c3a36859aa001cfd","movie_id":152742}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"There have been plenty of movies based on classical cartoon superheroes that have been poorly implemented and with a lousy story. Luckily this one is not one of those. This was really a very enjoyable movie and I liked this movie a lot better than the first Thor movie which I felt was mostly silly.\r\n\r\nThis one has a story which was rather okay and held somewhat together. You have to remember that this is a comic book hero and the story is on that level of course. The special effects and the scenery is really nice as well. The views of Asgard is cool, almost breathtaking.\r\n\r\nAnthony Hopkins was excellent as Odin or Oden has he is called in Sweden, my country of birth. Tom Hiddleston is also very good in his role although I have to say that I really do not like his role but then he is supposed to be one of the bad guys so\u2026 Chris Hemsworth is good enough in his role but I would say that he is really the weakest ones in terms of acting.\r\n\r\nThe movie is liberally sprinkled with jokes as well and, thankfully, most of them are not too bad. Although a bit silly I have to say that I did laugh when Thor politely hung Mj\u00f6lnir on the clothes rack in the apartment with Darcy and Dr. Selvig.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I enjoyed this movie tremendously.","id":"5337c1079251417d9e00220d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5337c1079251417d9e00220d","movie_id":76338}

{"author":"kineticandroid","content":"A classmate planted the phrase, \"I didn't believe the ending,\" in my head when talking about this movie. That's the phrase that first came to me when the climax eventually arrived. It just didn't seem plausible for me that an all-powerful alien race was that convinced by the drunken rants of three middle-aged British men to forgo their invasion goals and bring about the technology apocalypse. \r\n\r\nHere's why that ultimately doesn't matter to me. Edgar Wright knows how to stage exciting comedies and The World's End made me laugh (Gary's confidence in the beginning, the boys arguing over the term robot, Martin Freeman with a football head, and so on and so forth.) But more importantly, it showed me what a great comedy with a clear point of view looks like. Specifically, it made me think not just about the end of the world, but about nostalgia's dark side and the things people put in their way to numb what they don't like in their present. Check out Simon Pegg's performance, which shows some powerfully realistic pathos behind the funny screw-up that Gary is.","id":"53a4dd170e0a26143f0005ae","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53a4dd170e0a26143f0005ae","movie_id":107985}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"**The following is a long form review that I originally wrote in 2013.**\r\n\r\nSorry for the double 'self' here, I really couldn't think of another word)\r\n\r\nSelf-portrayal in film is the biggest form of self-gratification since the invention of masturbation. And no movie has ever wanked harder than _This Is The End_.

All over me.\r\n\r\nAhem. On track.\r\n\r\nI was super-popular and went to see this film by myself. But even so I enjoyed it. I really am not in the least bit fond of American Comedies. There are exceptions to be sure, but overall I feel it's best to just give them a wide berth. I was drawn to this piece though because it was reeled as a \"Horror\/Comedy\" (and I mean, what Horrors aren't?) and also because it had James Franco playing James Franco (_Rise of the Planet of the Apes_). And I'm so very glad I let this be one of those exceptions.\r\n\r\nI quite honestly put it up as my top movie of 2013 so far. Which is more surprising to me than anyone else.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, it makes reference to my all time favourite film. Ever. Watch _This is the End_ and if you can pick the moment, I'll give you a prize.\r\n\r\nI did, however (on top of aaallll my other biases) feel as though this film really was targeting hardcore movie-goers\/aficionados\/critics\/filmmakers\/writers\/etc. and I fit in to... Well at least most of those categories.\r\n\r\nI'm reading over this review and seeing what a bastardised clusterfuck it is. But that's because I just reallyreallyreally want you all to go out and watch it! And I feel anything else I can say would be all spoiler-y. Look, it's the sort of thing I usually would hate, and I am absolutely in love with it. Pleeeaaase go watch this movie with a friend and tell me what you think. I might get back to a more levelheaded review after a DVD release.\r\n\r\n80%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_","id":"5cb078849251412fa323ca2b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cb078849251412fa323ca2b","movie_id":109414}
{"author":"Reno","content":"Unlike others, I would say it was a nice movie from Ridley Scott. Certainly not a masterpiece, but I truly enjoyed it. For his capability this movie was a below par, that's what everyone meant. As for the theme of the story, it was a phenomenal, but the screenplay is what failed very badly. To me, some of the scenes in the movie were impressive, enough to stick around the end. As has been a gangster related subject, Midas touch lacks and surprises how a great director make it slip away.\r\n\r\nHandling a tough situation, following the instinct and the facing outcome of the final result is what the movie to say in a one liner. Obviously, roles were perfectly distributed to the respective cast by the filmmakers and they had given their best as well. So no blame game for the movie's fall in that matter. In my perception it was the dull moments in the movie that acquire more than the best parts. When it was overhauled to build the story and develop characters, never showed signs of recovery.\r\n\r\nAs I am a movie maniac, after seeing a movie, I always think of a sequel to follow only if it was a good one, or I pray for no sequel if it was terrible. I thought the same about this movie as well, after seeing the way it ended. I am now curious what if a sequel makes the way and impacts better than this. Because in the history, so many sequels had excelled than the previous movies. Whatever, I respect this film, not because of the director or actors, but like everyone says it should have been little better in a few areas, that's all. A movie fanatic sees the effort and appreciate it even it was not that good, but a critic sees only flaws and criticise as usual.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"55585b8e9251412afe001645","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55585b8e9251412afe001645","movie_id":109091}

{"author":"CharlesTheBold","content":"This is a sequel to 2012's HUNGER GAMES, and is set in the same future world: a post-apocalyptic world where an Empire, called Panem, has imposed peace on the survivors only to decay into brutal tyranny. The symbol of the tyranny is the Hunger Games, a gladiator-type combat where only one \"victor\" is permitted and the rest of the fighters die. To keep the flow of victims coming, 12 districts of Panem are required each year to supply a teenage boy and girl for the fight, ostensibly as punishment for decades-old rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe theme of this movie is the moral issues over how to oppose such tyranny. Katniss Everdeen ( Jennifer Lawrence), the spirited girl who won the previous year's Games, wishes to stop the oppression, but fears that outright revolution will hurt too many people. There is another character (whom I won't identify to avoid spoilers) who doesn't care how many people are hurt as long as the revolution is advanced. Many of the subjects of the Empire are resigned to submitting until some messianic deliverer will appear. Meanwhile the ruthless President-for-life Coriolanus Snow ( Donald Sutherland) is determined to destroy the rebels before they can get organized. Who will win out? Therein lies the suspense.\r\n\r\nThere are enough special effects to make the futuristic background and technology credible without overwhelming the movie.\r\nAside from Lawrence and Sutherland as the impressive antagonists, the movie has a strong supporting cast: Woody Harrelson as Katniss's shrewd but alcoholic mentor; Liam Hemworth and Josh Hutcherson as two boys representing the aggressive vs sensitive sides of Katniss's character; Elizabeth Banks as a kindly but naive woman oblivious to the tyranny; Oscar-winner Philip Hoffman as Snow's Machiavellian adviser, and Sam Clafin, Jeffrey Wright, and Jena Malone as formidable former victors drawn into the conflict.\r\nThe movie's only real flaw is that being part of a continuing story keeps the plot from being resolved in the end.","id":"58a8c9679251410a0e002e67","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58a8c9679251410a0e002e67","movie_id":101299}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Wrong Brother.\r\n\r\nThe early signs were not good, tales of production problems galore and\r\nearly critical notices wading in to kick the film before it had even\r\nhad a run at the theatres. The Lone Ranger seemed destined to be a\r\nblockbuster stinker. Yet in spite of it noticeably alienating original\r\nLone Ranger purists, and some Western lovers as well, for a rollicking\r\naction fun packed time then Gore Verbinski's movie delivers in spades. \r\n\r\nIt's awash with the serial silliness of adventure films and TV shows of\r\nyore, pitching good guys against bad guys with buddy buddy shenanigans\r\npulsing away at the core. The stunts are outrageously enjoyable, the\r\nlandscape photography as beautiful as it is respectful in homage to\r\npast masters of the Western genre, while in Depp's Tonto there's a bona\r\nfide hero to root for just as much as he makes you laugh out loud. \r\n\r\nThis is an origin story, a tale of how John Reid (Armie Hammer) became\r\nThe Lone Ranger, and of course how the noble steed Silver and Indian\r\nside-kick Tonto became integral to his villain fighting ways. Tom\r\nWilkinson and William Fitchner file in for polar opposite villain\r\nduties, the former is the weasel business man trying to mould the West\r\nin is own image, the latter a repugnant psychopath with a penchant for\r\neating human hearts! Then Helena Bonham Carter wanders in from some\r\nGrindhouse movie for a couple of cameos that are resplendent with\r\nsexual energy. \r\n\r\nIt's all very wacky and wild, and rightly so, but this is not at the\r\nexpense of very good story telling. Some parts of the narrative could\r\nhave been trimmed, but as the bromance builds between our two heroes,\r\nand Silver gets up to all sorts of comedy horse escapades, there's nary\r\na dull moment here. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Verbinski\r\nthrow all the action staples into the pot. Chases, fights, swinging\r\nfrom ropes, shoot-outs, people dangling from speeding train (pic is\r\nbookended by awesome train sequences), grisly deaths and on it goes\r\nfrom start to end. \r\n\r\nThere's caustic asides to the machinations of organisations of the\r\ntime, from railroad magnates to the cavalry, while the catchphrases and\r\nlegends of The Lone Ranger TV series are deftly inserted into the tale.\r\nIt was interesting to see Depp come out and defend the movie against\r\nthose damning early critic reviews, it's not something he does, being\r\nas he is very much a guy who sees acting as just a job. Bruckheimer,\r\nHammer and Verbinski backed Depp up, stating that some reviews were\r\nwritten before the film had even been released, the big budget and\r\nproduction problems clearly making this a big stinker\u2026 \r\n\r\nNot so, it's certainly not flawless, and those seriously into\r\nanachronisms are likely to have kittens. But if you haven't seen it\r\nyet, if you was put off by the venomous early reviews, then give it a\r\nchance, you may just be surprised at just how entertaining it is. It\r\nalso looks and sounds brilliant on Blu-ray, where repeat viewings even\r\nshow Hammer to be better than first thought as that masked man. 8.5\/10","id":"53695c200e0a2647db008782","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53695c200e0a2647db008782","movie_id":57201}

{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"Watching Thor: The Dark World tonight, I got the feeling that Hollywood might have finally figured it out. In theory, a sequel should always surpass its predecessor, although as we all know, many have tried and famously failed. But a new trend seems to finally be breaking through. X2 was better than X-Men. Spider-Man 2 was better than the first. And now that I've seen it, I can tell you Thor: The Dark World\u2026 is better than Thor. (And the fact that these are all Marvel productions, that's food for anther discussion.)\r\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Thor, directed by Kenneth Branagh, when I only saw it for the first time just this spring. In fact, I watched it again the same week. Which is saying enough to imply that my hopes were high for the sequel. So I was really looking forward to tonight and I was not disappointed.\r\n\r\nThor 2 was helmed by a different director, Alan Taylor, which typically always spells trouble in my book when they change the director, but I take my hat off to him. What I admire is that he managed to capture the tone that Branagh set in the first film flawlessly \u2013 even perfected it in a way. He brings to the table a duality which almost never works successfully in any film, but here, does so perfectly: Taylor made Thor 2 notably darker, yet at the same time more humorous. I take my hat off to the writers as well \u2013 they put in a ton of great jokes, all at the exactly right moment. Had this been done even a fraction less tactfully, the film would have sunk like a bag of bricks, like so many others have. I found myself (and the audience) laughing my butt off one moment, and feeling very serious and engaged with the on-screen emotions the next. Even when it happened abruptly, it still never felt inappropriate. Now that's good entertainment. Two thumbs up.\r\n\r\nThe actors all wear their roles like a custom-made suit. It's obvious that Chris Hemsworth has really grown into his character, third time around. This guy IS Thor, hands down. The same goes for all the other actors, they were all perfectly comfortable in their roles and respective environments. The one that intrigued me most, however, was Loki \u2013 personified absolutely magnificently by Tom Hiddleston. Much like Hemsworth, it seems he was born to play this role. He captures all the slyness, all the arrogance and all the torment of a man almost unable to bear the weight of his own ego in a single flicker in his eyes. And then that grin\u2026 Perfection. The way Hiddleston plays Loki is strangely captivating. You know he's totally wicked and cannot be trusted, yet at the same time you can't help but really like him \u2013 you might even end up rooting for this guy, and I'm not sure many other actors would have managed this.\r\n\r\nAll the special effects were as good as one should expect them to be these days. I have nothing much to say there, except that it was all terrifically eye-pleasing, and Asgard looked even more beautiful than before. It was all convincing and very well done. \r\n\r\nStill, I have not completely explained why T:TDW is better than the first. Actually, I might not fully be able to. It's mostly a feeling. As much as I was entertained the first time, I was even more entertained now. It was more action-packed, more exciting, darker and it just had a great deal more adrenaline. \r\n\r\nThe only thing that I think was weaker in this film, was the character of Jane Foster. Her character was just less interesting, kind of blank. I actually don't remember much of her at all, except that she slapped Thor a couple of times and she had all this creepy stuff coming out of her\u2026 Also she was somewhat of a damsel-in-distress most of the time with the look of a scared kitten on her face, and that's not exactly how we like to see our ladies nowadays. It's so common to see women being perfectly independent now, that it's a little weird to see a grown woman with \"three degrees in physics\" (as Darcy so poignantly points out) scared and shivering like a little girl. Most of the time, Natalie Portman just didn't carry her scenes very strongly, and that's strange coming from such a fine actress. So maybe one of the actors was actually a little out of place after all, thinking about it. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, that's pretty much my only complaint. Every other element in this film was very solid, the story was very good and they absolutely nailed the pacing. Those two hours went by in the blink of a eye. \r\n\r\nThor: The Dark World is wonderfully entertaining and a definite must-see for every Marvel fan. In fact \u2013 at the risk of enraging the Marvel Gods \u2013 this might just be pretty stiff competition to X-Men\u2026 Watch out Wolverine, I think I have a new favorite superhero.\r\n_(November 2013)_","id":"58ac553492514158c0015059","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ac553492514158c0015059","movie_id":76338}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"The depiction concerning doomsday dramas in the movies always seem to have a mixed bag reception when tackling its dour subject matter about the possible annihilation of the planet Earth. The scales of dramatic overdrive can be rather preachy and psychologically exhausting or convey over-the-top unintentional hilarity. Thus, only a few end-of-the-world genre films can pull off the genuine angst and realistic vibes about mankind facing its final fate of fury as our jeopardized existences are in considerable question.\r\n\r\nIn the blistering and noteworthy 2003 Australian apocalyptic low-budget film \u2018These Final Hours\u2019, writer-director Zak Hilditch delivers a somber and sleek story about mass paranoia and the redemptive vibes of one man caught up in the hysteria of the catastrophic bleakness that persists.  Thoroughly absorbing and telling, \u2018These Final Hours\u2019 resourcefully captures the psychological urgency and the humanistic hedonism that exists under such worldwide adversity. Thoroughly absorbing and thought-provoking, the stark \u2018These Final Hours\u2019 offers a telling hypnotic depth that more contemporary flashier and fueled fare may fail to carry out in their frenzied translation.\r\n\r\nHilditch\u2019s tense narrative is not necessarily the definitive showcase on saucy doomsday dramas to ever emerge. Still, it has a simplistic and gritty edginess to its message of global despair and destruction that certainly helps its cause as a perceptive and contemplative human horror show. In its own low-key appeal of desperation and doom, \u2018These Final Hours\u2019 is undoubtedly powerful and dares to ask introspective questions of its audience pertaining to survival and how one\u2019s final hours would be emotionally shaped as in the limited time of planetary panic.\r\n\r\nSo the pending question at large remains: what is the impact of a vulnerable society upon the wake of Earth\u2019s final run as a planetary playground for an exposed mankind? Well, for one troubled man in James (Nathan Phillips) he is our conflicted tour guide to all the mayhem that persists in the last 12 hours that Earth has to remain whole before an asteroid arrives to obliterate its last pit stop: Australia! The inevitability of endangered lives in James\u2019 region of Perth is a harsh reality so the reactions of the surrounding territory is understandably erratic and laced with fear and in some cases nervous-minded frivolity.\r\n\r\nJames is not what would call a goody two-shoes. He thinks nothing of hopping from one woman to another. He has rowdy and raunchy companions. Basically, James is a blue-collar stud without much going on in a stagnant livelihood. Still, he does has some semblance of consciousness as he boldly confronts a group of weapon-carrying thugs that are adding more unruliness to an already hostile environment or panicking and paranoia. In the process, James becomes the unlikely rescuer for an aimless little girl named Rose (Angourie Rice). He takes the frightened child under his wing as soon the tandem roam the area in the middle of sheer chaos as the critical countdown to eradication continues.\r\n\r\nThus, James and Rose are each other\u2019s comforting cohorts as they travel among the ruins of damaged property, flame-induced vehicles and, of course, the fellow citizens that range from party-hearty rabble-rousers to God-fearing believers praying for salvation as the murky mirror for gloom creates a bigger shadow of sorrow and scorn.\r\n\r\nSadly, James and Rose must shift through the turmoil that is indeed a human tragedy spearheaded by the expected suspense of natural bombastic deterioration. The sense of helplessness and hopelessness is weighing in on the millions of people so distraught and disillusioned that they are powerless to prevent the ultimate demise of a planet destined for extinction. The forged father-daughter dynamic between James and Rose in the face of a dire worldly washout is surprisingly poignant, intense and gently tender.\r\n\r\n\u2018These Final Hours\u2019 works its soulful and menacing magic because it does not solely concentrate on the grand scale of the horror-induced incidents (shaky buildings, grimy graffiti, burned out cars, a collection of trash can fires, etc) so much as it brings the startling focus to the human psyche, the real centre for the horrific happenings of anxiety and outrage. Hilditch is astute enough to fixate on the inherent ugliness at hand, the inner conflict of human anticipation and aggravation in the event of the massive world\u2019s ending. The film is not afraid to tap into the visual debauchery of the human element as it is prominently punctuated around the impressionable tyke Rose. The fact that this kid\u2019s eyes has to endure the degradation of sex, drugs and brutality gives Hilditch\u2019s twitchy narrative its corrosive credibility.\r\n\r\nThe authenticity behind the mental makeup of \u2018These Final Hours\u2019 is productively challenging in that the turbulence of troubled waters is not just witnessing the breakdown of dressy disaster-oriented special effects or even succumbing to Bonnie Elliott\u2019s exquisite cinematography. Instead, Hilditch dares to provide a unique kind of wrecking ball meltdown in the human victims -wicked, wayward or wonderful -and place them as the centerpiece of beleaguered behavior where the true dramatics percolates with refreshing gusto.\r\n\r\nIn short, \u2018These Final Hours\u2019 were well spent minutes on the clock in watching this well-structured doomsday drama unfold with intriguing forethought.\r\n\r\nThese Final Hours (2015)\r\n\r\nRoadshow Films\r\n\r\n1 hr. 27 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Ethan Phillips, Angourie Rice, Jessica De Gouw, Daniel Henshaw and Sarah Snook\r\n\r\nDirected by: Zak Hilditch\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: NR\r\n\r\nGenre: Apocalyptic Drama\/Action and Suspense\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)","id":"561a15909251415d31001700","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/561a15909251415d31001700","movie_id":199575}

What makes his film remarkable is the incessant travels carried out in the car by its protagonist Roshan who wouldn't stop at anything in order to save her lover from death penalty. She is constantly on the move in her car in order to convince witnesses to speak the truth which would result in a person escaping the death penalty. This film constantly reminds viewers a lot about films made by Abbas Kiarostami especially 'Close-Up' and 'Like Someone in Love' whose leading players were always on the move to achieve their personal goals.

{"author":"Jacob","content":"The Wolf of Wall Street is so addicting to watch, that even with it's 3 hour long run time, you wont be surprised if you end up watching it four days in a row. <br>\r\n     This is Scorsese letting loose and having fun, showing all of the debauchery (and man, is there a lot) in all of it's glory. There are orgies, sex, nudity, copious amounts of drug use, and it now holds the record for the most use of fuck in any film. <br>\r\n     Leonardo DiCaprio gives a towering and hilarious performance as Jordan Belfort. He throws himself into the role with free abandon, while also showing that he's aces when it comes to comic timing and physical comedy. If he doesn't win an Oscar this season I'll be quite upset, though Matt from Dallas Buyers Club rightfully deserves it as well. But this is a 3 hour long film, and Leo is in every single second of every single scene. He's ferocious, hilarious, out of his mind, and flat out brilliant.<br>\r\n     The supporting players are tops as well. I was somewhat baffled when Jonah Hill earned a nominee for Moneyball, but this time around he rightfully deserves this years nominations. With his pearly white teeth, charisma, while also throwing himself into the role with no fear, this is without a doubt his greatest work as an actor to date. The real find, however, is Margot Robbie. Strikingly beautiful, her character could have been one note, but she also hits the ball out of the court. Even Matthew Macconaughey steals the show with only one scene. <br>\r\n     Dangerously funny, superbly edited, and with a delicious, irreverent, savage bite. The Wolf of Wall Street is Scorsese at his wildest. And it goes without saying, that this is one of the best films of last year. Just stay away if you are in any way a prude or conservative. \r\n     Rated R- Graphic nudity, strong sexual content, drug use throughout, pervasive language, and some violence.","id":"52e52fda760ee302c027bed9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/52e52fda760ee302c027bed9","movie_id":106646}

{"author":"bobbeijing","content":"Located in Beijing\u2019s bustling Chaoyang District, the Sanlitun area is home to the city\u2019s ever-growing expatriate community due to its vibrant nightlife and proximity to various embassies, not to mention its luxury shopping center that constitutes a veritable retail wonderland for those who have secured big salaries through relocation to the Concrete Dragon. Sanlitun\u2019s social scene is enjoyed as much by self-consciously fashionable Beijingers as it is by foreigners, although the circumstances behind its big screen breakthrough in the independent comedy This is Sanlitun are very much in keeping with its status as the city\u2019s foremost ex-pat hangout. Icelandic director R\u00f3bert I. Douglas, who achieved early success at home with The Icelandic Dream (2000) and A Man Like Me (2002), has been living in Beijing for some years after seeing his local industry severely ruptured by the banking crash of 2008, thereby becoming familiar with the very haunts that crop up throughout his return to filmmaking. Rough around the edges due to its miniscule budget, This is Sanlitun makes a virtue of its technical shortcomings by employing the mockmumentary format to capture the dreams, schemes, and daily routines of Sanlitun\u2019s residents while also serving as a caustic cautionary tale about pursuing opportunity in a booming economy without understanding its culture.\r\n\r\nThe focus of Douglas\u2019 satire is Gary (Carlos Ottery), a broke Englishman who arrives in Beijing with ambitions of getting rich, winning back his Chinese ex-wife Lin (Ai Wan), and reconnecting with his young son Johnnie. Things do not go to plan as Lin is reluctant to let Gary back in her life in any capacity due to his track record of personal and professional failure, while a business meeting with a potential investor for his miracle grow hair product proves to be a disaster. However, the beleaguered entrepreneur does make a new friend in Frank (Christopher Loton), a self-proclaimed \u2018China expert\u2019 who offers \u2018mentoring\u2019 services to those in need of cultural indoctrination. Frank also helps the cash-strapped Gary to find a job as an English teacher, only for this financial lifeline to be jeopardized when he becomes the fixation of one of his students, Momo (Hu Gaoxiang). When his product suddenly takes off, Gary looks set for the fame and fortune, but his lack of concern for relationships and naivety with regards to contracts will leave him picking up the pieces once again. These characters often speak directly to camera, as do such supporting players as businessman Wang Ke (Cromwell Cheung) and language school proprietor Mary (Kitty Xu).\r\n\r\nThis is Sanlitun often plays like a checklist of experiences that will be all too familiar to anyone who has lived in China: Gary is employed to teach English based on immediate availability rather than credentials (\u201cWhat days can you work?\u201d\/\u201cMonday to Friday\u201d\/\u201cYou\u2019re hired\u201d), overpays for a bike, and is briefly used by Wang Ke to be the Western \u2018face\u2019 of a restaurant so that it can secure a backer. The film could have been titled \u2018Ex-Pat Dreams in China\u2019 as Gary is the sort of foreigner who turns up in the People\u2019s Republic in search of reinvention, only to have to settle for less, while Frank is evidently trying to establish himself as an Old China Hand. It largely hangs together due to the winning chemistry between Ottery and Loton as the former\u2019s perpetual anxiousness is well matched by the latter\u2019s deadpan calm. While such a double act is usually contrasted with more mature female characters, the impulsive Momo and judgmental Lin are just as confused, with Douglas showing how life\u2019s inherent messiness is amplified when such people attempt to cross cultural barriers. Brimming with spot-on observational humor, This is Sanlitun is a spirited comedy of cultural misunderstanding which offers a hilarious snapshot of West blundering into East with ridiculously unrealistic expectations.","id":"552d2a2d925141387300507b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/552d2a2d925141387300507b","movie_id":214144}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A beautiful video portrait of a family!\r\n\r\nIndeed a beautiful video portrait of a family and friends coming together for an evening. I wanted to like it more, but not impressed by the overall product. However, I liked very much the film theme, not very unique, yet simpler and different than those I've seen. The cat was the centre of the narration as the title suggests, but it was seen rarely within the video frame and sometimes the characters mentions it, but we know it was around there where our eyes can't reach.\r\n\r\nOn an ordinary day, about an ordinary family and their ordinary event which might remind you your own family or the others you're familiar with. I don't know the cast, but I liked their character displays. Each one offered so many topics on what they were doing, because I can easily say it was not completely written script, but they were improvised while the camera was on the roll. As the actors that's what they do, but as a viewer I must appreciate the effort. Even the kids were so impressive, yet like I said overall film fallen short by a slight margin.\r\n\r\nI'm a semi-artist, those who are interested in the art would stare at the paintings for a very long time to observe the details closely like every visible stroke the artist did. Likewise, in this, the details were very impressive. In every scene, there's something happening like each scene has its own twist before going to the next. What I meant was, it was not like those lazy films I'd seen in my life with boring scenes where camera stands still and nothing happens for a very long time. That's the reason I usually dislike art films, but a very few like this makes my day.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"576033ab9251415e2e002cb5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/576033ab9251415e2e002cb5","movie_id":164328}

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"The Garden of Words poetically symbolises the tranquility and loneliness of rain. \u201cA faint clap of thunder. Even if the rain comes not, I will stay here, together with you\u201d. Walking the path of life is no easy feat. The appropriate metaphysical footwear must be utilised for every type of emotional terrain we encounter. Sandals for joy. Wellies for sadness. Sneakers for rage. Yearning to overcome our rational, or irrational, fears so that we can \u201cwalk\u201d again. Teenage student Takao, an aspiring shoemaker, attempted to perform such a generous offer for Yukari. A mysterious woman he socialises with in the dense thickened foliage of a Japanese garden experiencing torrential downpour. Two souls of differing youth encompassing an identical level of maturity. Yukari avoiding her career to snack of delicious chocolate and consume canned beer, whilst Takao solidly working throughout his summer break.\r\n\r\nThe two share a common trait. Seclusion. The melancholy of isolation is one that evokes a rainfall of sympathy, and director\/writer Shinkai embodies all of nature\u2019s complexities to portray these wandering individuals. The ferocity of rain portraying both the characters\u2019 sadness whilst shielding them from the rest of society. The pale green shading of the summery foliage producing a reassuring aura of tranquility within the garden. Yet it\u2019s Shinkai\u2019s usage of Man\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b poetry that truly captivates, adding a traditional authenticity to the Japanese central romantic narrative. With \u201clove\u201d being traditionally written as \u201clonely sadness\u201d, Shinkai honed in on the deprivation of companionship. When both characters see each other as salvational assets as opposed to romantic interests, it provides a subtle layer of maturity that is commonly found in Shinkai\u2019s writing. Love is never simple, yet nature finds a way to pull people together. The Garden of Words itself is that motif.\r\n\r\nAs expected, the animation was gorgeous. Faultless. Combining hand-drawn animation with rotoscoping to create meticulously constructed scenery, assisting in the world building of their blossoming friendship. Less detail is given to facial expressions, with much of the attentive focus towards the environmental backdrop, which occasionally leaves a vacuous emotional complexion. Almost expressionless on occasion. Not enough to deter from the character building, but worth noting.\r\n\r\nShinkai\u2019s unfortunate issue here is with the runtime. It\u2019s short. Absurdly short. At only forty six minutes in length, the character development between Takao and Yukari is often rushed with no emotional simmering. This became drastically noticeable during the climax when Takao discovers the reasoning behind Yukari\u2018s work avoidance. The exquisitely mature metaphors and symbolic imagery were somewhat diminished for a typical \u201canime ending\u201d. What I mean by that, is the sole purpose in attempting to make the viewers shed a tear. The erratic framing, the J-pop music and the explosion of emotion is typical work from Shinkai, yet it never suited the preceding scenario. Whilst it nearly, oh so nearly, worked for me (I held back that tear!), it fell short due to the complacent storytelling. Motohiro Hata\u2019s vocal talent behind the theme song \u201cRain\u201d was exceptional though, almost replicating Takao\u2019s personality. So I\u2019ll give some leniency...\r\n\r\nThe Garden of Words is poetry. Visually and literarily. With gorgeously vibrant animation and themes of maturity, Shinkai has crafted a wonderfully organic story that depicts loneliness with a hint of empathy. If only he was able to stretch it out for another half an hour, we could\u2019ve witnessed a masterpiece in the making.","id":"5e206badb3316b001103862c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e206badb3316b001103862c","movie_id":198375}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Alone in the unforgiving western wilderness*** \r\n\r\nAfter a tragedy, a young woman (Jasmin Jandreau) is left alone in the remote woods during the mid-1800\u2019s California Gold Rush. Can she survive and make it to civilization?   \r\n\r\n\u201cThe Trail\u201d (2013), aka \u201cLet God,\u201d is obviously a low-budget Western in light of the miniscule cast and limited setting & events, plus a couple of obvious anachronisms, like zippers on a pair of boots, which weren\u2019t even invented until 1893, not to mention goofs (a visible crew member and boom mic, both of which you have to actually look for to notice). Despite these shortcomings, this is a professionally made film with quality locations, an effective score and a decent lead actress. It successfully brings you to that time & place and lets you see what it was like for many settlers.  \r\n\r\nIf you like settler\/survival-oriented Westerns like \u201cMeek\u2019s Cutoff\u201d (2010), \u201cGold\u201d (2013), \u201cThe Homesman\u201d (2014) and \u201cThe Revenant\u201d (2015), you\u2019ll likely appreciate \u201cThe Trail,\u201d although it\u2019s not as polished or eventful as the latter, which was a blockbuster. Unlike all of those modern Westerns, however, it shoots for something deeper, something spiritually profound, although it\u2019s utterly subdued until the very end. It\u2019s this particular aspect that makes the movie for me. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes, and was shot in the Lake Tahoe area, California, with some stuff done in Southern Cal (Temecula & Landers).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-","id":"5d6582ecac8e6b0012f7ba52","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d6582ecac8e6b0012f7ba52","movie_id":293574}

Feels like it is happening somewhere in the Swiss Alps. That is what I loved the most in this film, all the background views were just like that I see them in the wallpapers. And not to forget the actors, comes second who were really into their characters.

Despite knowing she just got married, he never stops pursuing her. So he has to face various obstacles for impossible dream and the end is to reveal where he's going to end.\r\n\r\nIt was based on the book called 'Sex and Senset', though changing title for the screen adaptation seems appealing enough.

To see their act it was so real, a soul filling character representation. And then the fourth one called Mediha introduced when the story marched almost to the end, but she was good as well alongside the director himself as the fifth main role. The love story was very interesting, but can't say awesome, especially when it ends with a twist that was the moment in the narration peaks so high.\r\n\r\nSo what's the wrong with the movie was, it did not strengthened exposing characters to the deep. Without initial development it moves on and on to the different set of places in the story. The romance portions were not quite delightful because the whole scenario related to that was like a friendship thing. But it had a reason that only comes out at the end that you have to wait until then.\r\n\r\nAs from the literature perspective, it was one great inspiring biopic about two faded personalities from the history before the world knowing them. And as from romance and friendship side, it had different level of shades that one can go through in life, I mean like happiness, grief, adventures, survival, disloyal etc. One of the best Turkish movie so far I have seen. Those who are interested in biographical movies and literature should check it out, but remember it is about romance and friendship as well.\r\n\r\n7.5\/10","id":"54208b600e0a265782000184","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54208b600e0a265782000184","movie_id":171160}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Their worst fear came from outside of their protest.**\r\n\r\nI have enjoyed the Eli Roth's films, even though in some cases I've rated them lower than average rating it had received. But this is not what I was looking for. This is a terror-horror, not actual horror with supernatural or sci-fi viruses. I've learnt the storyline before the watch, but the film was too violent. Even for most of the grown ups. Usually I won't feel a thing for film tortures, because 'fake' is the word always pops up in my mind whenever I see gore.\r\n\r\nAnyway, these days, killings in the films are considered entertainment. There is a separate group of fans who follow this kind of theme. But for me, the cannibalism was the one most disturbed. I have no issue with killings, but cannibalism brings totally uneasy. The story was decent, but intentional. You would guess most of the parts. But this film was not about that, just to make you go off of your seat with discomfortable and it succeeds on that.\r\n\r\nIt was totally opposite to 'Embrace of the Serpent'. It was inspired by the 80s Italian film with the similar storyline. The film was about fighting for the survival of passengers after their plane got crashed in the Amazon forest who are now hunted by Amazon tribes. There's already a sequel on making titled 'Beyond the Green Inferno'. I don't think so, it is a recommendable film, but some are doing that for fun, and some to challenge their friends. Overall, a decent production, with casting, locations and visuals. But I won't favour it.\r\n\r\n_4\/10_","id":"5951986c9251412a9b013cf2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5951986c9251412a9b013cf2","movie_id":171424}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"RELEASED IN 2013 and written & directed by Scott Walker, \"The Frozen Ground\" is a crime thriller based on the true story of Alaskan serial killer Robert Hansen, who raped, tortured and killed numerous young women from 1971-1983. Vanessa Hudgens plays a 17 year-old prostitute who successfully escaped from Hansen (John Cusack). Nicolas Cage plays the trooper who establishes a relationship with her as he zeroes-in on Hansen.    \r\n\r\nThis has elements like \u201cKiss the Girls\u201d (1997), \u201cThe Flock\u201d (2007) and \u201cHardcore\u201d (1979). If you like those crime thrillers, you\u2019ll appreciate this one. The Anchorage locations are perpetually overcast, but breathtaking and foreboding. Cusack is notable as the average-looking killer and Cage is stalwart as usual. The events take place in 1983 when anchorage was booming due to the pipeline and the ensuing sex industry. The scenes depicting the sleazy underbelly of the city (at that time) are well done and convincing.                             \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 45 minutes and was shot entirely in Alaska. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B","id":"5a95976892514154fa0004c0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a95976892514154fa0004c0","movie_id":199373}

Maybe even a good one. However, this was supposed to be a Lone Ranger movie and that it is not!\n\nI put this movie in the same category as the very disappointing Green Hornet movie. It is a typical case of some dumbass Hollywood producer\/director taking a known name and thinks he can do what the heck he wants with it. The Lone Ranger is supposed to be the only survivor of a group of rangers, a hero as well as intelligent and so is Tonto. In this movie the Lone Ranger is a bloody lawyer, he is na\u00efve and generally a screw up. Tonto is, well, as looney as one could expect with Jonny Depp in the role.\n\nIt is really said when you feel the best characters in the movie are the bad guys.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"The Conjuring is a fairly classical horror\/haunted house\/exorcism movie. That was pretty much what I was hoping for. Slow and creepy build up to a final outburst and confrontation with an evil entity. This is a good movie although it is not really something new in terms of story. It is fairly impossible not to think about, and make comparisons with, The Amityville Horror when seeing this movie. I do not think it really deserves the glowing 9 or 10 star ratings that I have seen but it certainly do not merit those 1 or 2 star ones either. What were these people expecting?\r\n\r\nThis is a solid effort of making a movie along the classical lines of supernatural possession. As I wrote, it is not really something new, but it is nice to see a new movie using this kind of story without just turning it into a CGI gore-feast. Sure, the movie also includes the traditional pitfalls that most horror movies apparently must have like people thinking it is a good idea to walk down into the dark and scary basement all alone in the middle of the night.\r\n\r\nOne thing that irked me with the movie though was the idea of phantoms and performing exorcism being presented as kind of normal and accepted things. Of the movie would have played itself out 70 or so years earlier maybe but in the 1970\u2032s? It just felt somewhat surreal to see this \u201cghosthunter\u201d make presentations and talk to people like supernatural entities and the practice of exorcism was just things that happened.\r\n\r\nThe we have the ending of course. Not that it was overly bad but christ, if you are going to do an exorcism then do it damn it. Do not stop the procedure and look lost every time something goes bump.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I was not sure whether I was going to be disappointed or pleased when sitting down to watch this movie. On the whole I was pleased. It was a nice to watch a movie that was going back to the traditional values in horror movie making and it was as well implemented as one could expect.","id":"539fdb9dc3a36850d9000ef5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/539fdb9dc3a36850d9000ef5","movie_id":138843}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Despite knowing it is wrong, doing what has to do to be alive and make some money.\r\n\r\nThis is not a great film from a great director and writer, not even based on the real, just a simple road drama, yet very powerful. Though how do you look at it makes all the impact. The title says it all, it takes place in the year 1864, about a teen African-American boy who partnered with another man to help the bounty hunters to catch their target. One such mission is to retrieve a man from far away place and how they are going to do it the story speaks intensely.\r\n\r\nIt looks a bit like 'Slow West' because of the journey the main characters make, but it is different and quite interesting. I don't know anybody from this film, but I'm pleased with their character executions. The boy was at his best, I don't know he would win any award for it, but mentioning and appreciating him is at least the right thing to do. Because a small film like this won't get much attention other than critics through film festivals. So I saw it and I'm glad I saw it.\r\n\r\nIt was much better than other similar films. Realistic approach was the highlight. During the civil war and lots of casualties happened around, this little adventure of three was told better than I anticipated. Being an African-American at that time of the United States was not very fortunate. It just reveals the actual atmosphere and other related stuffs how difficult it was then.\r\n\r\nIt started off like some kind of a serious bounty hunting story and then slowed in the remaining parts, until the final sequence to get emotional. Does not feel like a fictional tale, definitely a small gem. I think feeling it should have been a bit better is normal, but overall I'm satisfied and recommend it for those who wants a good B movie.\r\n\r\n6.5\/10","id":"57c8b41092514148e9000adb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c8b41092514148e9000adb","movie_id":169800}

{"author":"tmdb39513728","content":"**Voracious Bull**\r\n\r\nEvery time I try to enjoy a Martin Scorcese movie post-1980 I ask myself what made _Raging Bull_ so great? Did Marty burn out after his Jake LaMotta bio, the same way Coppola did after _Apocalypse Now_? These were risky movies, driven by passion, bordering on madness. Did Marty and Francis lose their natural passion for making films because industry priorities dismissed 70's-style hyper-realism for sensational summer blockbusters and CGI spectacles? And why is Scorcese considered one of the greatest director when he really only made one truly superb movie?\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw _Raging Bull_ in 1980 I immediately knew I was watching something that transcended the typical cinematic experience. Genius was shimmering out of every perforated frame flickering on the screen. Paul, Marty, Bobby, Mike and Thelma created something that was completely absorbing. The style and substance was perfectly fueled by a flawless emotional narrative. Every element was orchestrated just right. The audience was spellbound. We were watching greatness. A rare and unique organic creation. I'm still waiting for Robert Redford to correct a travesty of justice and hand his Ocscar over to it's rightful owner. And I'm still waiting for Scorcese to match his own brilliance. But that's like expecting Tarantino to top _Pulp Fiction_. There's a better chance Orson Welles rises up from the dead to one up _Citizen Kane_. \r\n\r\nAfter _Raging Bull_, Scorcese has made a string of pictures ranging from not bad to pretty good. All well-made, thoughtful and meticulously crafted films, but nothing special; certainly nothing profound. Contrary to popular opinion, _Goodfellas_ is not a great movie. I was not swept away by the saga. I was annoyed rather by the fragmented non-stop soundtrack and incessant up-tempo style. Marty wasn't risking anything anymore. He seemed to be afraid of boring the audience. Perhaps he was trying to revive the 1940's never-let-up screwball-bouncing farcical Preston Sturges and co. comedies. But this is a mafia film. This should have been right up Marty's alley. It's been almost a quarter of a century since De Niro got his face busted in a boxing ring. Since the raw, robust and naive will-power of LaMotta's youth plunged into the pathetic, brutal, bone-headed stupidity of his later years. Similarly, Scorsese hasn't registered a knock-out punch since. Would his ensuing movies be considered great if someone else directed them? Would I have liked them all better if Raging Bull had never been made?\r\n\r\n_The Wolf of Wall Street_ is another exhausting affair. It tries too hard to excite and entertain us. It's afraid of slowing down, allowing us to ponder or examine the complexities of excessive greed, shameless wealth and unbridled capitalism. It desperately wants to arouse us. Like a neglected clown at a child's birthday trying to be loved and taken seriously while draining the life out of the party. Give Leo and Jonah an \"A\" for effort. They couldn't have tried harder if they broke out into song and dance every ten minutes. And they convincingly appeared to enjoy themselves freely indulging in coke, ludes and naked women every five minutes. It was nice of Leo to step back while Margot Robbie took her routine and obligatory, supporting-actress hissy fit. And you know a filmmaker has a lot of faith and confidence in his work when a superfluous narration track is added, to plug those terrifying noiseless gaps. Whatever happened to poignant, suspenseful, sure-footed, gripping, emotionally-arresting dramas that take you on a nervy, wild ride to a thoroughly gratifying climax? A truly great director from Kurosowa to, well, Scorcese-(circa 1979) would have plotted the rise and fall of a maniacal protagonist along deeper and more affecting lines even at the risk boring its audience for one minute.","id":"54b0210d925141746c000154","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54b0210d925141746c000154","movie_id":106646}

{"author":"Mistah Darcy","content":"**Plot: 5\/20**\r\nProbably the movie's biggest downfall. The plot is your generic story of two people who don't get along with each other and end up becoming best friends before the movie ends. On top of that, the whole point of the the story is for the characters to catch the \"typical bad guy\" leader of a drug ring. It's really just the garbage rehashed Hollywood cop story told over again, but with tons of hilarious scenes added in throughout. I don't really have any detail to go into with here because there's not much to analyze.\r\n\r\n**Rewatchability: 5\/15**\r\nDon't get me wrong, even though the plot is terrible the movie is ridiculously funny. It gives comedies from 2013 a run for their money. As with all movie ratings I give, I watch a movie twice if it has a commentary track. This movie ended up having four or five separate commentaries, but I only watched the one with the director's commentary. I really don't think I can sit through it any longer than I have, because it is a two hour long movie after all. I wouldn't ever watch it again unless it popped up on TV and I was really bored, but I can give this movie a good ol' watch-this recommendation for the comedic aspect alone.\r\n\r\n**Acting: 15\/20**\r\nInterestingly enough the acting is superb. With huge celebrity A-list names it's not too surprising. Sandra Bullock absolutely kills every scene she's in. A lot of her shots in the film are improvised. My favorite one being the hospital scene towards the end where she's crawling on the ground and ends up shooting the bad guy twice in the nuts. As much as I can't stand Melissa McCarthy in general, her acting was great as well. She came off as an arrogant, foul mouthed, dirty and annoying police officer better than probably anyone else could have managed to pull off. A YouTube star named Spoken Reasons also makes his acting debut in this film as a perpetrator and is actually quite impressive.\r\n\r\n**Audio Production: 10\/20**\r\nI thought that the soundtrack was just your typical Hollywood film soundtrack with nothing but popular music. Most of the songs featured female rap from artists like Angel Haze and Azealia Banks, but there were also some classic pop\/rock songs from Ted Nugent, Air Supply, and Boston. What I really got a kick out of was hearing the rapper Kreayshawn's song Left Eye play randomly (or so it seemed). I wasn't really feeling the soundtrack, but the overall sound effects and audio production were done quite well. Nothing spectacular, but good.\r\n\r\n**Visual Production: 15\/20**\r\nThe film crew made very good use of different sets throughout the city of Boston. This film has everything from a giant paint warehouse, to a local town pub, to car chases. The amount of stunts performed in the movie is entertaining. Towards the beginning of the movie Melissa McCarthy parks in between two cars, but there's not enough room to open her door. She ends up climbing out the window into another car, and then struggling to make her way out of that car as well. Just the small things that add some good humor to the movie like this really make a difference. There's also some really good special effects in the movie and a scene where they blow up a car.","id":"550d7866c3a3684872006029","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/550d7866c3a3684872006029","movie_id":136795}

While it's over the top and not meant to be taken seriously in the first place, I guarantee you'll get at least a laugh or two out of it.\r\n\r\n**Acting: 15\/20**\r\nSince the actors are actually just portraying magnified versions of themselves it works out really nicely. The scenes with Michael Cera are especially hilarious. At one point in the movie he sneezes out cocaine all over Christopher Mintz (guy who played McLovin in Superbad). Nobody felt out of place and even the add-in actors such as Rihanna and Mindy Kaling did a pretty good job.\r\n\r\n**Audio Production: 10\/20**\r\nThe soundtrack comes in heavy with music by the Backstreet Boys, Black Sabbath, Cypress Hill, Def Tones, Psy, and Whitney Houston. This list includes a lot of big names, but it seems like most of the soundtrack was just thrown in. The Backstreet Boys make a cameo at the end of the movie when the cast is in heaven throwing a party. Special effects are done well, but nothing really stands out.\r\n\r\n**Visual Production: 15\/20**\r\nThe majority of the film takes place in a ficticious Los Angeles at James Franco's house. All of the visual post process effects and scenes are really well made. Listening to the commentary you can find out that most of the filming actually took place in New Orleans at an old coffee warehouse. Even though most of the film was filmed inside of the same building, it actually works out nicely with the storyline.","id":"550c28df9251414699003850","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/550c28df9251414699003850","movie_id":109414}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The truth always finds its way out.\r\n\r\nThe Majority of us don't even this movie is exist. Because they never promoted it and it never theatrically released. But I came across and accidentally found it, then I decided to give it a try like my usual support for the unnoticed flicks. In fact, the movie surprised me, the story was so much better than I thought, I mean awesome. But the movie had its own defects which lets it down. From the director of 'Wild Things', another decent suspense-thriller after almost 15 years.\r\n\r\nFacially I recognised some of the actors, but did not know their names, except Michael Shannon. This story is set in a rural town, and most of the scenes were shot in an isolated house and its surroundings. A young girl Maryann, who moved to live with her grandparents after her parents' death, befriends a lonely, very sick boy Andy who has always been in the bed all his life. After a while it becomes a secret relationship once the boy's mother forbids seeing each other due to the severeness of the ill. But only until the secret comes out which leads the boy in jeopardy. So what follows is the double twist, one after another and a fitting conclusion.\r\n\r\n> \"What's the difference between god and a doctor?\r\n> God doesn't think he's a doctor.\"\r\n\r\nFelt like I got a very good thriller here, but I extremely disappointed with the performances. To me the actings were the worst part in the entire film, along with a few scenes that I didn't like. Like I said, no doubt about the storyline, one of the best in the recent times, but the screenplay was utterly stupid in a few parts. Those should have been improvised for a better outcome. Especially I can't take it the way the girl for the first time meets the boy. The situation, the development, all were so silly, but somehow they had to come together where the rest of the story builds.\r\n\r\nI know I'm kind of criticising it and I'm not intensely doing that. If it was a television movie, hundreds of excuses can be given, but it was not. Initially I expected it to be a creepy flick with haunting stuffs, but soon after I realised it was another kind of horror which I call them a terror-horror (uninvolvement of ghost, spirit, zombie, et cetera, but the human who creates a terrifying atmosphere). The opening was very unusual, but comes to the point very quickly. From introducing the characters to developing the story, it took time as it is not a short movie.\r\n\r\nI never got bored, it kept me awake till the end credit. Storywise, I enjoyed it. If it was corrected all the flawed areas as I mentioned, would have been eased to accept the film by everyone. I feel it is worth suggesting, but not to everybody. If you are looking for a mystery film, then you could try it. Despite whatever I said negatively about it, I still can't able to hate it completely. Obviously it is underrated, it deserves to be praised from the one angle. In another I can't pretend like I don't see the flaws. If somebody is going to remake it in 20-30 years later from now, I'll be old and I expect them to emend the mistakes this one made.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"566ee89d9251412dbc00a7d6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/566ee89d9251412dbc00a7d6","movie_id":229182}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I was prepared to be disappointed by this comeback by Arnold Schwarzenegger. After all he is fairly far from the shape he once had. Luckily I was not. This is a quite enjoyable movie. Sure it is falls short compared to his previous really hard hitters but it is still a good movie. The plot is okay although a fairly standard one. Escaped criminal races for the border, hero sheriff (good old Schwarzy) stands in his way. Been there, seen that, done that. It is a plot that works though and the racing maniac and bridge building twist made it not feel too old.\r\n\r\nIt was fun to see Arnold in a leading role gain although he did look a bit rusty. He also felt a bit wimpier than he used to. Sure, he beat, stabbed and shot the bad guys for a good enough chunk of the movie but it was with a bit more hesitation and without the \u201cI\u2019m gonna kick your ass\u201d attitude that he used to have. For being an experienced guy he, that is him in his role as the sheriff, also seemed to bungle it every now and then. The scene where he turns his back to the bad guy and, of course, gets stabbed annoyed me quite a lot for example.\r\n\r\nIt is always nice to see Peter Stormare in a movie. Not just because he is from my native country but I do like him as an actor. He put the necessary spice on the bad guys which was quite needed since, personally, I thought Gabriel Cortex was a somewhat shallow mad drug baron stereotype. Seeing him floor it or change gear became somewhat boring after the 5th or so time. Also that scene where he bumps a Suburban of the hood of the Corvette was just silly. No way would the hood, or the car for that matter, stand for that. I just do not understand why producers\/directors continue do these obvious and arrogant we-think-the-audience-is-to-stupid-to-notice things. News-flash: we are not that stupid!\r\n\r\nForest Whitaker was not too bad as the FBI guy being screwed over and I did like Luis Guzm\u00e1n as one of the sheriff\u2019s sidekicks. Otherwise the team was somewhat bland. I guess the historical weapons guy was supposed to be funny but I mostly found him silly. The shootout between the sheriff\u2019s team and the bad guys at the end of the movie was quite fun to watch but, at the same time, fairly silly. There was not much real life logic in how it played out. The bloody bus they used to move the machine gun into place made no sense at all for instance except as a reason to make some driving stunts with a bus.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line though is that, for me, this was a enjoyable movie and not at all the bungled comeback attempt that I was afraid it would turn out to be.","id":"5ae45df80e0a266c36006a7a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ae45df80e0a266c36006a7a","movie_id":76640}

{"author":"John Chard","content":" It's November 1st, 1971, I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron, who with her family, has been experiencing supernatural occurrences.\r\n\r\nThe key with The Conjuring is not that it has freshness on its side, as evidenced by the ream of horror fans arguing on internet sites about \"nothing new on the table\" , but while those fans will be going hungry for a very, very long time, The Conjuring does everything right for the splinter of horror it deals with.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot to admire about a horror film that in this day and age stands tall and proud against the ream of remakes, sequels and teen friendly slashers that \"haunt\" the multiplexes with all too much frequency these days. Free of gore and sex, this was automatically going to alienate a good portion of the lustful members of the horror fan base, but for those who like their horror served with appetising scares and a cauldron of suspense, then this delivers plenty to your particular table.\r\n\r\nForget the \"based on a true story\" tag, since it's kind of irrelevant in this new technological age, it's a selling gimmick that actually means \"this story might be true and we might have played with it a bit\". Regardless of hoax charges and embellishments, just buy into the premise, commit to it as a scary story in the same way as director James Wan has, for then the rewards are there for the compliant.\r\n\r\nStory essentially is based around an investigation in the early seventies by paranormal specialists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who aided the Perron family as they were victims of dreadful supernatural events at their Rhode Island home. Wan builds it deftly, letting us into the Perron families lives as they move into what they believe to be a dream home. Then things start to happen, but again Wan builds it in slow instances, creating a palpable sense of dread, his camera work intelligent. So when the big moments come they have maximum impact and have us also yearning for the Warren's to get involved.\r\n\r\nThere is no over killing of the boo-jump scares, they are placed with care and marry up superbly with the mounting tension. Naturally all the clich\u00e9 conventions of the haunted house movie are here, strange smells, creaky doors, ominous cellar and etc, yet these are supplemented with Wan's talented knack for a good scare and a very effective production design. From mysterious bruises and literal leg pulls \u2013 breath holding games of hide and seek \u2013 to bona fide pant soiling moments, The Conjuring is a lesson in sustained unease until the big finale is unleashed.\r\n\r\nThe script is devoid of cheese and pointless filler, itself refreshing in a horror sub-genre that suffers often with these problems. Joseph Bishara's musical score is an absolute nerve shredder, and again it's a refreshing accompaniment because it doesn't resort to telegraphed shrieks to tell us to be afraid, it never overwhelms a scene. John Leonetti's cinematography has Gothic textures, both in the house and outside of the lakeside farmhouse, while the strong lead cast of Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston come up trumps for sure.\r\n\r\nMet with critical and box office success, The Conjuring justifies its reputation as a superb haunted house movie. 9\/10\r\n","id":"539f8d2e0e0a2650810003e5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/539f8d2e0e0a2650810003e5","movie_id":138843}

Literally, there was no story in it. Just a confused character and the events surround him unfolds in a weird way. The characters, settings, I thought it had potential. Visually, it was the same Terry Gilliam style film, but the screenplay failed to have impressive developments. Nonetheless, Christopher Waltz was so good.\r\n\r\nIt is being more a gamer's tale is what turned down. Seeing the title, I anticipated something brilliant or mind-bender. Though most of the film it was the main character who hold the joystick and try to achieve a scientific goal. The Melanie Thierry part was good. Brought some cheers, but did not end properly.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Creating an artificial intelligence, but its intelligence beyond expected's the issue.**\r\n\r\nMaybe the films about artificial intelligence that were made in the last 5 years might outnumber to those were made before that for centuries. Especially there are lots of B movies on this theme and some of them surpassed the film critics and the film fanatics' expectations. Here is another one, but this is a British film. Though one thing I don't understand is, in all these films they make the same mistakes. I mean the film characters recognising the AI as one of us which leads to a major disaster.\r\n\r\nSets in the future, when the Chinese aggression towards the Taiwan made the west, especially Britain to counteract them in the region, they decide to build a most advanced AI. But when the scientist creates beyond what the military needed, the conflict of interest surface among them. From this, who gains what, and how the story ends comes in the latter part.\r\n\r\nInitially I liked it, but not the progression. It led nowhere, but the same crumble and a conflict between the man and the machine. I'm not saying the film was bad, but I blame the overcrowded films on this theme. The filmmakers have to start to think a different kind of storyline. Going advance like what AIs can do in the field than the initiation programmes which is too old for now and onwards. So that's where I disliked it, but not hated it.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"It\u2019s Done!\r\n\r\nDirected by Brad Anderson and starring Halle Berry and Abigail Breslin, The Call is one of those infuriating thriller movies that destroys all its hard work with a lame last quarter. The plot is based around a 911 Emergency Call Centre, where Berry works but suffers a breakdown of sorts when an error she makes costs the life of a young girl being stalked by a maniac. Some time later and Breslin is abducted by a whacko and locked in the trunk of his car, which brings Berry back into dutiful action. Can she save the girl this time?\r\n\r\nFor the most part it\u2019s a sturdy thriller, it\u2019s not breaking new ground or anything, but it has some good ideas and the scenes of Breslin and Berry talking on the phone are well crafted and performed. So far so tightly wound by Anderson. But there\u2019s a point in the movie where you know exactly what is going to happen for the remainder of film. Logic, suspense and credibility is quickly replaced by a roll call of popcorn munching conventions clearly aimed at pleasing the undemanding multiplex goers.\r\n\r\nThe police are buffoons but thankfully Berry, a phone operator, can do their job for them. Though this comes at a cost to Berry as well. Where earlier there was an actress playing with conviction an interesting and emotionally confused character, now she is reduced to doing the sort of dumb things that happen in laughably bad scream queen movies. Or not as the case may be in one colossal plot hole that is badly attempted to be explained away by the makers! \r\n\r\nSuch a shame, because both Berry and Breslin turn in good thriller performances, and Michael Eklund is suitably nuts as the serial killer with on-going issues. But they are all better than this screenplay, and deserve better, it feels compromised after such a good start, while Anderson is clearly capable of greater things given he has Session 9, The Machinist and Transsiberian on his CV.\r\n\r\nThe Call is cautiously recommended to those after a better than average thriller time waster. The lead actors are good value, the direction clean, the premise safe and the production design for the nutter\u2019s lair suitably grotty. If only the writer and the suited financial backers could have been in sync and stayed true to the earlier tone of the pic, then this would have been a bigger hit. 6\/10","id":"5468a49a22136e68da0009d7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5468a49a22136e68da0009d7","movie_id":158011}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The two half-brothers and the art heist.**\r\n\r\nI like heist movies, once they were making great ones, but not anymore. I have heard about this, though haven't seen it till now. Seems it's a decent film, but came at the wrong time of the history. You know, the same film 15-20 years ago would have made a better impact among people, as well as commercially. Nowadays, the youngsters want only superhero action-sci-fi films. That should not be the reason for a film's failure. Instead, they should have improved it in lots of areas. But still I liked a few things from it, like the information about mixing the real art with the fake ones, but still it remains as the real.\r\n\r\nThe film is about two half-brothers. They are the art thieves and they have done many jobs together, but in their final one, one of them betrays. So the rest of the narration sets in a few years later when they join hands for another big art heist sidelining their differences. They form a big team and this time they are watchful over each other. Now comes the final act where the actual event takes place and with a twist the story comes to an end.\r\n\r\nAn enjoyable film, little funny and had some good moments, But overall film was predictable, including the twist. Could be the director's best film so far. Kurt Russell was just okay, but expected a lot. The rest of the cast in this multi-starrer, does not look good, though contributed. Maybe the film characters were weaker than the story. They should have focused more on them to progress it, so it would have achieved the success they were looking for than what a few people praising it.

The Vice angle is the only excuse I can think of for using music (they score\/soundtrack their docu-shorts, I'm pretty sure) and it makes the found-footage thing way too plastic.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Just three cornetto's, give them to me!\r\n\r\nWho's the helmet without a helmet?\r\n\r\nSimon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright reconvene to close down the cornetto trilogy that had began with Sean of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Here we find Pegg as a card carrying alcoholic who coerces his old mates into undertaking a fabled drinking binge in their home town of New Haven. But things are not as they used to be...\r\n\r\nThis simply isn't on the same level as \"Sean and Fuzz\", but that doesn't remotely make it a duffer of a film. Weight of expectation was enormous, and rightly so, but although it doesn't carry the mighty comedic gold of the first two films, it has fun, cheek and emotion in abundance. In fact its biggest crime is not being the final film so many legions of fans were hoping for. If stripping back those expectations and original disappointments, then repeat viewings bring plentiful rewards.\r\n\r\nRiffing on science fiction films, pic's story cunningly observes male behaviour, most notably the man-child effect and the refusal to let the past stay in the past, the pic begins in almost solemn fashion and ends in daring chaos. Along the way there's a whole host of sly visual gags to catch, whilst the caustic concerns for once vibrant towns brought down by soulless entertainment chains positively fizzles with poignant awareness.\r\n\r\nNo doubt about it, Wright and Pegg call their own shots, which is ultimately refreshing in an era of film making struggling to keep its head above the sequel and remake swamp. Choice dialogue, some of which is very British in street core, and some laugh out loud moments, off set the more juvenile moments filtered through the plot.\r\n\r\nA super cast has been assembled, where series regulars either star or cameo to further emphasise the constant of the cornetto trilogy - that of film lovers making films for film lovers, with camaraderie of cast set in stone. The sound track choices sparkle, a mix of Brit-Pop, Madchester and era defining popsters (Old Red Eyes Is Back by The Beautiful South has never been so pertinently used). All baked in a superb period tinted pie.\r\n\r\nThere's something of an action overload, while some tonal shifts have understandably proved to be confusing to some. But this still showcases - in credit - the considerable talents of Messrs Wright, Pegg and Frost. Teen angst machismo, alcoholism and hidden passions clash with Invasion of the Body Snatchers! It shouldn't work, but it does! 7\/10","id":"57bf3b84c3a3685bd3004b49","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57bf3b84c3a3685bd3004b49","movie_id":107985}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A chance to self-discovery, at the end of the life.\r\n\r\nIt is one of my favourite genre, but all the cancer themed movies are not emotional, here it comes a tragicomedy. Based on the bestseller autobiography about a young girl Sophie Ritter, who after discovering she has a rare type of cancer, her daring method of dealing it is what this story expands all the 2 hours for us.\r\n\r\nDespite a dark humour it is still inspiring. One of the ways to tackle the disease with having a positive energy and of course the boost comes from the people around us who cares very much. After all, treatment is a long process, so those ups and downs too this movie shown very well. Especially, the family member's behaviour won't be the same right from the beginning to end. Those phases were the pivot in transformation of each character and their relationship. Including romance as it one of the obstacles which affects mentally beside the physical troubles. And the friendship, that is always there to share and do those mischievous stuffs.\r\n\r\nThe movie opens on the new year's eve celebration in the Belgium city, Antwerp and moves to Hamburg, Germany. Sophie is confident to begin her new life who's going turn 21 the same year. She also meets her man on that night. Followed days, when everything was going fine, the tragic trikes and tosses her world upside down. That's how the real story commence, her journey in the bus of agony where only the rare people takes it and only a very few makes out. In this case, it is a life changing experience, in her expedition she discovers herself, writes a blog, shares, parties and meets other patients. What happens next is again a followed new year's eve where the story concludes.\r\n\r\n> Grandma says that every day I live worth ten years\r\n\r\nAs for what the title says, Sophie is only a young, so she's enthusiastic and passionate in lifestyle, especially when it comes to exhibit her beauty. She won't let her sick to take it away. The idea of nine wigs with nine different names gives a distinct character together. So, 'Today I am Blonde', that's what the original title's meaning. The fake toy doll Stella is the first one you meet and then Daisy, who flirts, Sue, who fights, Fifi, who parties, followed by Lydia, Blondie, Uma, Pam and finally Bebe as a birthday girl. Each personality tells different tales of her new appearance which helps to enjoy the life and realise the world. When she meets an old patient, he tells his perspective of handling the illness and so a little boy along a girl with her own age.\r\n\r\nThe movie '50\/50' tells the importance of friendship. In 'The Bucket List', the importance of remaining precious days. So if you just look back any of the cancer theme movies you've seen, all of them briefs something valuable in life. Those achievements in a short period of time fulfills the life they are not going to live. That's the reason I always love this theme if it is narrated properly. This film was a slight different having attached comedy to the corner of the main plot which helped the portrayal to trim a bit of sentiments and adds a few fun portions. The contents are little stronger, so suitable for adults and maybe matured and older teens. Since it is established from a real life story definitely a good watch. Nice movie, not bestest among other awesome similar flicks, but worthy.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"55898c77c3a368053e00441b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55898c77c3a368053e00441b","movie_id":170125}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Sure, everyone finds their pine tree.\r\n\r\nThe film was produced by three countries from three different continents, carved by one of my favoutire French directors that talks of a prodigy child. An English language film set in the American soil. If you had liked his films, then you would like this one as well. Like all his films, it was visually fantastic and it was his first digital 3D project. One of the underrated film of the recent time. A road adventure and a coming-of-age film that neatly rendered especially for the family and children film fans.\r\n\r\nMore like it was a kid version of 'Amelie' and now I realise why the author picked this particular foreign filmmaker for the cinematic translation. This is not some kid's summer vacation tale or the school related stuff, but a rural kid and his weird family. They're united by family, but divided by their field of interest. Born in such family, the film focused his life and mostly the fighting of his loneliness.\r\n\r\nIt was based on the book about a 12 year old boy T.S. Spivet who lives on a ranch in the Rockies with his family. He's a scientific research enthusiastic and so one day he receives an unusual call from the Washington DC that he had won a prestigious award for his invention. After a sudden tragedy in the house he set to travel by his own to the other side of the country. The adventure begins as he hitchhike to his destination where he learns many things.\r\n\r\n> \"The amazing thing about water drops, is that they always take the path of least resistance. For humans, it's exactly the opposite.\"\r\n\r\nThe kid was brilliant, it was his perspective story. In one of the scenes when he gets hurt, that felt like it was real. His co-stars supported him all the way, but not as a game changer. You might agree with me that it is not a great story, somewhat familiar too, but the film topic is inspiring like how an atypical family cooperates during the bad times that compared with their negligence to each other at one point before. There are a few fun moments, but also gets emotional at the final part.\r\n\r\nThe train journey had lots of effects on the narration, because I'd seen a road movie, but this is a very rare, especially it gives us some glimpse over awesome landscapes of different part of the country. Like I said, the cinematography was the best part of the film followed by many others. In the end, I was very satisfied for it is being somewhat simple with having an extraordinary boy character. Because, you know, genius boy means usually the writers goes for an extra mile to make him shine with his brain powers to perhaps face the bad guys or the bad situations for which the audience sets to go awe.\r\n\r\nReally very sad that it was not as popular as 'Hugo' where everyone who saw it comparing with, especially for the digital 3D visuals. That tells how much the people are addicted to Hollywood and of course marketing was not upto the standards as against the film's standard. In fact, it took me two years to learn such film is exist. So I definitely recommend it to all. If you have not seen it yet, just do it, you might like it, surely you would enjoy it.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"5787dd0992514131c40016d3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5787dd0992514131c40016d3","movie_id":157841}
{"author":"skyezero","content":"I wanted to see this since it began to crop up on the internet as an upcoming movie, taken me long enough to locate it and now I don\u2019t really know how I feel. Maybe a bit visually raped. \r\n\r\nThis has such a fucking weak beginning, like what is the relevance to the blonde bimbo being around and literally has no point to the rest of the movie whatsoever. Apart from being one of those cunts who says \u201cHey, wait a second\u201d as you\u2019re about to leave then instead of giving the burning words, says \u201cnever mind.\u201d You never find out, I doubt it was Oscar worthy or chocolate filled coins worthy but still fucking irritating.\r\n\r\nAlso I did not have any forewarning about the genital mutilation in this movie, well almost. Like if movies are going to do this to me can you PLEASE advertise it better so I can avoid at all costs because it makes me want to die.\r\n\r\nOKAY. So freshman lady spots this activist guy and seems that he tickles her fancy as she instantly becomes a fully interested activist and thinks fuck it I\u2019ll go risk my life in the middle of fuck knows where with all of these random people that think I\u2019m a sheltered suburban fool. I mean she\u2019s even on the wrong side of the leader because his girlfriend has clicked on that our lovely freshman wants to suck his dick resulting in her attendance. These people scream out virgin sacrificing cult at all times.\r\n\r\nReally brilliant and wise idea taking these rich white kids out to a deprived area, not asking to be noticed in the slightest are we. One even shouts in clear earshot about child abuse seeing a family carting their trike on a bicycle, skills on how to not get killed are just seriously flawless guys. \r\n\r\nEverything is just painfully obvious and this movie relies 90% on gore, which is actually done extremely well. There\u2019s an eye scene and it\u2019s captured perfectly as if you can watch it without looking away or squirming then maybe you should go join that tribe as you clearly belong there. I mean they just fuck off their belongings and go straight into the jungle unarmed, is anyone really shocked when the plane crashes and they end up in a bucket load of shit? Quite literally when one of them also explodes from the anus which was one of many \u201cand the point of this scene is?\u201d moments. I don\u2019t need to see that in my life you trash.\r\n\r\nI did like the nice man who looked like a bumble bee and seemed to be the go to guy if you wanted a body part hacked off for supper, he seemed like he could have moonlighted as a MUA. Had his contours down to a tee. Most of them reacted more offended by the poo scene than seeing eachother being led off one by one for torture, again I will say all of the gore scenes were fucking brutal and do give many points for those. \r\n\r\nSome parts are just a bit fucking stupid, one guy actually has a wank after seeing one of them just being like fuck this and slicing her neck open. Really, a wank. I\u2019m all for the activity but there\u2019s a time and a place and that was not where I imagine I would be feeling the moment can take me. They get the tribe stoned as an escape plan, again I\u2019m not feeling the genius in this bunch? Dare I also mention none think to ever remove their luminous yellow suits, would have thought that would have been a pretty logical thing to do during an escape attempt\u2026.\r\n\r\nI could think of better holidays than being ditched in a jungle and eaten by demonic smurfs.","id":"5942ae3b9251417f6000ebd1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5942ae3b9251417f6000ebd1","movie_id":171424}

Thinking about the times in history when we actually used to do these atrocities on other human beings makes me cringe.To imagine waking up one day and find me in chains just because I'm a colored man and living my life like an unwanted child of god makes me question humanity altogether. Just sitting through a little over than 2 hours and watching this movie made my heart bleed, I can't even begin to think of the people who lived their entire lives as SLAVES... 12 years a slave heart breakingly makes you feel the pain and suffering of almost the entire human kind at one point of time or other. Direction by Steve McQueen is brilliant.Chiwetel Ejiofor plays a helpless slave in Solomon Northup to the hilt and also the small but impactive role played by Brad Pitt as a man with conscience is superb.Lupita Nyong'o's Patsey too was depicted heart warmingly. You can't help but question yourself that how could MAN stoop such low and do these cruel acts and that too over such a prolonged period of time without even a single ounce of doubt in his mind for what he would have to pay for his actions..

{"author":"kineticandroid","content":"Sometimes, I just have to stop my brain in the middle of a film and just admire its exceptional craftsmanship. I found myself doing that time and time again during this film. Perhaps I was more open to admiring the shot compositions and acting choices because, as I cynically told myself before the film, it's not like I needed much convincing that slavery was bad. Or perhaps it was because I was shielding myself from the honest brutalities the film convincingly portrayed. Nonetheless, I was reminded of the film \"Children of Men,\" because when I watched that, I was struck by how easily I could imagine a less engaging, more dumbed-down version of the same film. I haven't seen enough films about slavery to know this for certain, but I suspect that because many of this film's principals are British, telling a story about a free man who was forced into slavery, as opposed to one born into it, they were able to be gain some valuable distance from the subject and craft something that's both beautiful and feels true to life. And even though I thought I could not have been made to feel worse than I already did about slavery, the post-scripts on the lack of justice Solomon received for his kidnapping and the unknown causes of his death, helped keep the film from lapsing into a kind of \"triumph of the spirit\" happy ending others might have imposed.","id":"53a4def00e0a261432000650","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53a4def00e0a261432000650","movie_id":76203}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Halitha Shameem explores the loss of innocence and the righteous anger of youth in her debut film, a refreshing (and a bit uneven) adventure story that is centred around three young boys. Venu Kanna, Harish and Kapil Dev are school friends who are spending their summer vacation in their small town. One day, they witness a crime which forces them to confront their boyhood and when the culprits manage to go scot free, the trio decides to get them their deserved punishment, chiefly by relying on their wits.\r\n\r\nWhile the boys discovering the culprits and bringing them to the book is the main plot, this is pushed to the sidelines now and then with tension killing sub-plots like the boys' infatuation with a couple of girls (too filmy), an animated segment on a Hindu-Muslim riot (indulgent) and a little too many coming-of-age moments (overlong); though, the scene in which a character has his first wet dream is treasure-worthy. The pace during the first hour is definitely leisurely and less lively it is only with a chase in the second half that the film hits its stride. It isn't exactly too late because once it finds its rhythm, Poovarasam Peepee turns into a thrilling ride with its irresistible David vs Goliath plot.\r\n\r\nWe had Goli Soda earlier this year which, too, revolved around a similar plot, but the films vastly differ in their sensibilities. Poovarasam Peepee is, in fact, closer in spirit to Enid Blyton's adventure stories, especially the Famous Five books, and Halitha deserves credit for the manner in which the three boys go about their task of implicating the criminals. The methods that the boys employ to get evidence of the crime are all plausible and never feel too grown-up. She gives all three characters traits that give us the impression that these boys are capable of doing what they do. Harish is shown as a tech wiz and so, we do not question the use of a military radio, which becomes an important tool in their battle. Venu has spunk and a sharp mind and thus saves them from getting caught twice. As for Kapil Dev, who is less studious than his friends, he is a team player who is resourceful enough and pitches in when it matters the most. And, when they get help from outsiders (an older boy, a fellow classmate), those scenes don't come across as dues ex machina as Halitha integrates them into the lives of the protagonists. The villains, too, aren't sitting ducks. They are violent enough and the only reason why they lose is because the boys are intelligent enough that their foes never guess their identity until the last shot.","id":"53baaca70e0a263588002aef","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53baaca70e0a263588002aef","movie_id":270767}

{"author":"Dsnake1","content":"Patema Inverted is a film about a split world where gravity points in different directions. This affects people, objects, and even natural stone. Wherever an object was created decides which direction the object falls. Of course, without some kind of protection, objects and people can fall into the sky. \r\n\r\nThat's the concept. As a concept, it's incredibly interesting. The gripping moments, awesome actions scenes, and interesting animation sequences have limitless potential. This movie fills that potential and does a fantastic job of executing the concept in a way that keeps things interesting.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that's one of the only things the movie did exceedingly well. The pacing of the movie was strange. It started rather slowly until some revelations by the characters drew us into the action. The film takes a large amount of time to introduce us to Patema, one of our protagonists. While this is a good thing, Patema isn't an incredibly interesting character. She's the Chief's daughter, sure, but that only comes into play for a few lines of dialogue. She has some really emotional scenes that just don't feel as emotional as they should because the character depth isn't quite up to snuff.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Age, the other protagonist, doesn't get the same treatment Patema does, at least not right away. Until later in the movie, the only things we really know about Age is that he isn't happy with the authoritarian nature of his school\/government. \r\n\r\nThe antagonist of the movie and the rest of the supporting cast are all extremely one-sided: dumb, in love, mindless goons, etc. \r\n\r\nWhile the pacing is inconsistent and the movie starts off slow, once it hits its pace, it really takes off. The two protagonists really help develop each other, although the short amount of time it takes for each one to be willing to sacrifice their lives for the other is much too short. \r\n\r\nAltogether, the plot is a means to an end. It is designed to force the characters together so their one-sided-ness isn't nearly as glaring as well as to give us a reason to see the world. The twist at the end wasn't terribly surprising, but it was executed well.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the movie was good, not great. The concept was fantastic, but the rest of the movie just held the concept back. It's certainly worth a watch (probably two), but it isn't something I'll make a point to watch at least once a year.","id":"5a7b84c7c3a3680f9c00348c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a7b84c7c3a3680f9c00348c","movie_id":212167}
{"author":"Teemu","content":"Watching a CGI heavy movie 5 years following its release doesn't sound like such a hot idea, but in the case of Pacific Rim nothing really drew me out of the experience in terms of aging animation.\r\n\r\nHowever, the film itself was an 'okay' at best. Aside from the spectacle CGI fights of giants robots versus giant alien monsters it doesn't offer anything of value. This is one of those movies you can safely keep on your second monitor and zone out in between the set piece fight scenes.","id":"5a972408c3a3686151004e4d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a972408c3a3686151004e4d","movie_id":68726}
{"author":"Matt Golden","content":"When monstrous, building-sized creatures (dubbed \"kaiju\") hell-bent on destruction begin pouring out of an extra-dimensional fissure at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, humanity bands together to build titanic mechas called jaegers, each controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are linked through a neural bond called \"The Drift.\" As the kaiju get stronger and the signs point to an all-out flood of the beasts, the fate of humanity looks bleak, and the surviving jaegers are brought together for one last-ditch attempt at saving the world.\r\n\r\nAfter an agonizingly long five-year wait, filled with some heartbreaking starts and stops (like the almost-weres of The Hobbit and At the Mountains of Madness), Guillermo del Toro has finally returned with his biggest budget and story yet. The Mexican master of fantasy returns to the toybox of his youth, drawing from the kaiju films of old (Godzilla, Gamera, Mothra, and the like) and anime to create the modern-day monster movie we didn't even know we wanted.\r\n\r\nI am a genre man through and through, and del Toro's films are filled with both the intelligence of the best of science fiction, fantasy, and horror and a flawlessly-rendered vision unique to him. His innate knowledge of what makes those outlandish stories truly matter to us is the backbone of his work as a writer and director, and his visual style is one that invokes true wonder.\r\n\r\nIt's that wonder, that childlike glee that makes Pacific Rim work so well, and well it does work. This is a brawny, massive film made by a true artist and auteur at the top of his game, but while the technicals of this film could have been mounted by any number of working directors, the magic of Guillermo del Toro is that he infuses every film with himself. His love of the material, whatever it may be, shines brightly through every frame. It is this complete sincerity that makes his films such a joy to experience, and even when there are 250-foot behemoths slugging it out on the screen, there's not a trace of the disastrous irony or cynicism so readily supplied by other blockbusters anywhere to be found.\r\n\r\nThe cast gamely comes to play, with Idris Elba (TV\u2019s Luther) as Stacker Pentecost (one of my favorite character names of all time) as the stoic leader of the jaeger program, Charlie Hunnam (TV\u2019s Sons of Anarchy) as former pilot Raleigh Becket, who suffered a tragic loss and has to be convinced to return to jaeger service, and Oscar-nominated Rinko Kinkuchi (Babel) as Mako Mori, another life touched by the kaiju and ready to serve up some righteous fury. If these sound like tried-and-true archetypes, it\u2019s because they are. This is a grand, epic war film on a bigger scale than anything ever attempted before in that genre, and one of the strokes of genius from del Toro and original writer Travis Beacham is that we instantly establish and identify with the characters onscreen. There are so many ideas flying around (monsters, mechas, neural bonding, kaiju culture, and many, many more) that the broadly-drawn characters serve as a perfect anchor for the audience, immediately relatable in their inherent humanity.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the mission statment of this movie was, in a word, \u201ctexture.\u201d Del Toro delivered a visual feast unlike any other big spectacle films, with his insistence on it not looking like a \u201cglossy car commercial.\u201d Instead, every frame is filled with rain, snow, scuffs, smoke, debris, and other visual elements that reflect the weight and dimension of these cyclopean combatants. Unlike the ultra-glossy (and emotionally irrelevant) Transformers films, or virtually any other modern big-budget actioner, this universe feels dirty, grungy, and lived-in, like the original Star Wars trilogy.\r\n\r\nIn fact, dubbing a film \u201cthis generation\u2019s Star Wars\u201d has been overused to the point of robbing the phrase of all meaning. But Pacific Rim feels just like that. It invokes those most elusive of emotions in the modern studio film: wonder, awe, and sheer enjoyment. Do you remember the awe you felt upon seeing a Star Destroyer creep onto the screen? Discovering a brachiosaurus on Isla Nublar? Laying eyes on the verdant fields of Middle Earth? This film has that. No one builds worlds like del Toro, and here he is, the master, inviting you to play in his sandbox with him. Grab your favorite action figure and hop in.","id":"51ec25ca19c29551fb0f6f70","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51ec25ca19c29551fb0f6f70","movie_id":68726}

A straight to DVD effort that fails to grasp the concept of getting tension from the one location scenario. If it's not the laughable British accents putting you off - or that Whitaker is actually only doing a cameo - it's that the twist and turns still go nowhere fast, serving only to make the hum-drum pacing even more irritable. Some nice photography is a bonus, and the action sequences, while not exciting, are competently staged. But all told it looks like the 15 day shoot that it was, a case of grabbing some name actors and hoping that they can make an intended tricksy screenplay work. It didn't. 4\/10","id":"55c4a80ac3a3681ad9001b9c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55c4a80ac3a3681ad9001b9c","movie_id":165739}
{"author":"tom_elkrider","content":"I came to 'Paranoia' fully knowing it had been universally panned by critics and viewers alike. However, I found myself watching a very straightforward drama-thriller about corporate espionage and morality that reminded me of the corporate thrillers from the 80s and 90s. The acting is good and the movie looks good.\r\n\r\nSo, is the movie dated and boring then? You could see it that way. The standards for a movie in this genre have obviously become quite high. Audiences are waiting for several interconnecting layers in the story and want plot twists after plot twists. And with a cast as formidable as this, the movie must come from the biggest money and therefore the most exhilaratingly modern script, right? Well, it doesn't.\r\n\r\nIt seems that 'Paranoia' is a just another mediocre movie that you really don't need to see. It's sometimes implausible but sometimes it's decent drama. Just because the audience was disappointed in their own expectations, doesn't mean it deserves all this bashing. 32 on Metacritic and 4.9 on IMDb (2013-11-10)? That's pretty damn low.\r\n\r\nI read that Stephen Holden of The New York Times said about the lead actor, Liam Hemsworth: \"Not since Taylor Lautner has Hollywood ogled a pretty boy this vacant and poorly prepared.\" Again I'm reminded of the 80s and one Tom Cruise. Was his substance and skill any better?","id":"527f11d519c29517d61c36f6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/527f11d519c29517d61c36f6","movie_id":115348}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I have to say that I enjoyed this pure special effects movie quite a lot even though the plot is totally ridiculous. Clumsy giant robots beating at alien beasts with their fists should be better than modern tanks and airplanes with modern explosive and armor penetrating weapons? As I said, a ridiculous story. Well it does not really matter does it because the story gives an excuse for some real cool special effects loaded action. Giant robots and alien Godzillas in the same movie. Cool, simply cool.\r\n\r\nOnce you have gotten past the silliness of the story it is a very entertaining rollercoaster ride of action. The scenes where the robots and aliens go head to head is visually very enjoyable. Sometimes they make you laugh as well. For instance the scene where Gipsy Danger (one of the robots) drags a cargo ship after it to use as a club.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately a somewhat somber mood is set right from the start by the fact that the Jaeger program is discontinued. Not because they are really defenseless as the movie blurb states but because dumbass politicians wants to save money as usual. Instead they build giant walls that are subsequently breached in hours. As I said, dumbass politicians. I guess they wanted to put some realism into the movie!\r\n\r\nAs much as the robot and alien action is tremendously enjoyable I think some of my favorite scenes are the ones with Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau. I have always liked Ron Perlman and he is simply outrageously (as in funny) wacky as Hannibal Chau.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I did not like with the movie is the ludicrous nonsense statements about the dinosaurs being the first attempt at an invasion. Whoever wrote that must be an idiot. Worse, the fact that it made it into the movie means that someone believes that the audience are idiots. When it then was followed by some green-religious crap that the atmosphere was not right for them then but that we have now \u201cterraformed\u201d earth for them by our pollution it was at least a star off just for that. I hate it when they put crap like that in the movies. It is an insult to the audience.\r\n\r\nAnyway, despite the dinosaur nonsense I found it a very enjoyable movie. Without that it would have received a near top rating but as I said, it is at least a star off due to that crap.","id":"5a5c53e30e0a260da00065c7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a5c53e30e0a260da00065c7","movie_id":68726}

The film was made with a tiny budget of $50,000, wow, talk about being efficient. The story is not a convoluted one like Primer, which was based on time travel.

{"author":"Reno","content":"Nowadays the musicals are just a headache. When I see a movie like this, I feel those are the time long gone, and its a sci-fi world. Day by day dreaming to get the movies like 'Dancer in the Dark' and 'The Phantom of the Opera' is fading away. This film could have made a good impression if it was a regular drama-romance, maybe. Good performances and nice music tracks did not influence to lift the entertainment value, at least not to me.\r\n\r\nIt was based on the musical stage play of the same name. Did well in the English box office, but not that good in the outside. About two young army men return to the home after the service in Afghanistan and try to blend back in where they have left. Trouble in relationship and family issues, followed by going after the dream job across the sea, all come into play, solving all these puzzle brings the end to the movie.\r\n\r\nDespite a result as I expected, still somehow I felt the movie was not bad at all. That is maybe because of the film's setting that takes place in the backdrop of the capital of Scotland and style of cool presentation with a moderate pace. The rest was good show by the all lead casts probably had a lift up a bit. Like I said it was about usual episodes that occur in a group of known to each other, but belong to different families and dreaming different future. So how the differing thoughts in mind repels and unites them all was told reasonably well.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"55649f26c3a3680532001da8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55649f26c3a3680532001da8","movie_id":214100}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A true feeling or a genius, who would you choose among them to be your life partner!**\r\n\r\nBiographical films do their job depicting the real events, but the way they were transformed to the screen matter a lot, This one was decent as a film, but as a someone's real story I was impressed. I learn about the world and its famous people by watching films. I did not know this person, so thanks to the film. It centres on the three people as seen them on the poster, but mostly Florence's perspective that beautifully played by Emily Browning. She was introduced by her brother to his circle where she develops a true feeling for one and later decides to marry another for the different reason. The remaining film narrates her life falling apart and can she make it all right to the end.\r\n\r\nBeing a biopic is what its strength, but the story is another version of many films and the people around us. The cast was great, but Emily Browning was on the top of the show. Shot in beautiful places, and I loved the background score. These things make it worth a watch, but if you are interested in the art and artists, you might enjoy it well. If you decide to watch out of the interest, make sure you keep low expectation, especially for the final part. Because people are disappointed how it ended than what it revealed. In a biopic they can't change just to please the viewers, instead the viewers have to learn to accept the truth.\r\n\r\nMy issue was the filmmaking, I was not that impressed with that. It was adapted from a book of the same name, but the film narrated only a few years of the life of Florence. Especially around her romance and marriage life, prior to that events are not known. So that makes the story too familiar compared with the other films. It should have improved a bit with the additional details out of the original source. A small research would have helped them on that. Other than that this film was quite interesting with some unexpected development in the important portion. So it can be watched once, but you won't remember for a long.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"57d309849251415483000757","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57d309849251415483000757","movie_id":180951}

The premise is weak, both in terms of logic and redundancy of formula, but that isn't a problem for those after a good compact scare picture to pass the time of day with. The trouble with Alone (AKA: Solo) is that it's just too dull for its own good, resorting to telegraphed boo-jumps at time scripted junctures. After a while you kind of find yourself wishing it had something more to offer on a psychological basis.

{"author":"sunvit","content":"After a 'Thakarachenda'  that was much discussed in film festivals, director Avira Rebecca has now come up with a 'pigman' - a look at the current socio-economic  issues of kerala. A movie which discuss the plight of an ordinary man finding it difficult to live with the norms of an  nonreactive society around him, the movie but offers little in terms of entertainment, nor it ends up as a very meaningful attempt in film making.\r\n\r\nJayasuriya  is Sreekumar in the movie, a post graduate in Malayalam doing research leading to doctorate on the 'nuances of tribal music and language'. Currently in his fourth year , he is soon to submit his final thesis for assessment. But his guide Dr. jayalekshmy(Reena Basheer)  is quite unhappy with him as Sreekumar has resisted her physical advances. Now she has decided to take revenge and talks low about his thesis in the open defence. Sreekumar, who is asked to resubmit, is quite frustrated and throws his shoes on his guide, which results in him being expelled from the college.\r\n\r\nNow devoid of any scholarships to support him, Sree coming from an moderate family with their share of bank loans and debts is extremely in need of another job to survive. His close friends Sneha(Ramya Nambeeshan) helps him to find one in the big pig farm situated near her village. Sree joins as a purchase manager , but his reactive nature to ill- happenings around him in the farm makes him the sour eye of the GM Veera mani(Baburaj) and the veterinary doctor Daniel(Suraj). He is soon expelled from the job and is forced to take up the role of a helper in the pig farm. How he lives a sadistic life with the animals forms the rest of the plot.\r\n\r\nThe  movie discusses many social aspect s and indeed it is rare in recent times to see one movie that tell the lives of middle class men,  in such seriousness. But Avira has lot the charm of the basic plot by R Prabhakaran, resorting to traditional mode of film making , which unfolds  reasonably slow and without needed energy. Many kind of illogical twists also drop in to make the plight of Sree a little more sober than needed. Normally, in Kerala standards if a man decides not to stick to white collar jobs, there are jobs in plenty, which could have survived him better than to become an assistant in the pig man. The protagonist here is also not shown as an introvert who takes it as a fate. Anyhow, the second half of the movie is a total loser with the makers having little clue on where to lead the narratives. The climax and the techniques used definitely backfires for a movie of substance.\r\n\r\nJayasuriya doesn't have much to do though his character could have been developed to interesting proportions. Suraj tries to bring in some seriousness with his villanish role , but evokes undemanded laughter. Ramya nambeeshan and the rest of the cast are apt for their roles.\r\n\r\nPigman'  has average technical sides with Vinod Illampilly behind camera and Nikhil Venu in editing. The couple of songs by R Gowtham are worthy hear and so is his BG scores.\r\n\r\nAll in all, this Pigman' will not be a winner at the Box office and will move on to cans in a week's time.","id":"524f8459760ee31baf07d3b1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/524f8459760ee31baf07d3b1","movie_id":225819}

Lets cut to the chase here, this is ultimately a gruesome revenge picture, the only thing new on offer here is the methods of the executions administered by the seriously brooding Jimmy Vickers. This adherence to formula, a basic modern update of the Death Wish filmic telling of a tale, is enough to send many critics scurrying around for their most poisonous pens with which to articulate their venom. Add in the Danny Dyer factor, a fella who strangely seems to rile so many in entertainment circles purely because of the genre branches of entertainment he works in, then Vendetta was never going to garner favourable reviews in many quarters.\r\n\r\nThis isn't revenge. This is a necessity.\r\n\r\nYet there's a question that springs to mind here, namely, what were they expecting? Tag lines and media headings said Danny Dyer enacts bloody revenge on the murderers of his parents because the law is an ass! Do critics and film fans really go into a film like this, one that isn't hiding under false pretences, expecting a scathing and intelligent observation on the lawlessness of Britain? Or a snarky aside to the failings of the law system? Seriously? Stephen Reynolds (writer and director) has put some thought into his picture, there are some potent passages of dialogue, even if they fall by the wayside as the kills come thick and fast, but it was never marketed to the highbrow seekers.\r\n\r\nYou'll be demoted before you can say Katie Price is a virgin.\r\n\r\nVendetta delivers the goods for those looking for a good night in with a beer and some blood and brooding on the screen. Dyer (a real nice bloke in real life) gives good value as a son hell bent on revenge, whilst he also doesn't look out of place in his fight scenes. Haider Zafar's cinematography is superb, the blues and golds magnetic in their visual appeal, and there's good and solid work done by the supporting cast. \r\n\r\nVendetta has fans, it really does, so much so that a sequel is currently in production. That news is sure to send those critics sitting up there in their ivory towers at The Guardian and The Telegraph crying over their shrimp salads.

Abram's 2009 film, as well as _Into Darkness_ did both, however, seem to have an issue I couldn't overlook in common. And that is that both essentially feel like an incredibly drawn out episode of a TV show. And I've seen next to nothing of the old _Star Trek_ series, so it's not from that sort of a view I've come to have this feeling. It's just a sort of unshakable notion I developed after a few minutes from the start during each film. Even in this aspect, _Into Darkness_ is a slight improvement on its forebear.\r\n\r\nThis new _Star Trek_ film is, unfortunately, riddled with plot holes. Some... Or at least one, is completely unforgivable. They're not enough to ruin the film per se, but it does make me wonder about Abram's ability to be a showrunner in the future if he can't even handle _Star Trek_. Right from the get go I had questions that could have easily been answered with only a couple of lines of dialogue's worth of effort. Which was sad, because it cast a pall over what was, at its heart, an enjoyable piece of cinema.\r\n\r\nDespite these issues worsening as the movie progressed, a congratulatory word does again have to go out to Abram's and his team for their tweaked timeline. Working a way in which to successfully reboot the franchise, without belittling the integrity of the original was a great move (moreover, they've left themselves open for more deviations in the future, now that the concept is established). Very smart.\r\n\r\nZachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, John Cho and Anton Yelchin returning is of course a big plus for me. Completely unsurprisingly there just as fantastic as ever. But, that kind of Tumblr user would I be if I didn't give a special bit of praise to Benedict Cumberbatch (which all levity aside, is actually well earned from the Brit, who makes for a spectacular villain).\r\n\r\n65%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_","id":"5bb59ece9251410ddd0078f6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bb59ece9251410ddd0078f6","movie_id":54138}

{"author":"IamDWG","content":"Dave\u2019s 1-Word Review:  \r\n_Disturbing _\r\n\r\n67% \r\n\r\nIf you have seen Tim Burton\u2019s run on the classic story, Alice in Wonderland, than you probably know who Mia Wasikowska is, however; you may not be aware of the other works that Wasikowska has been involved with. In fact, Mia has been involved in a little less than thirty titles, but hasn\u2019t been the title character in most of these films. She is known best for her roles as Alice in Alice in Wonderland, Jane Eyre in Jane Eyre, and now India in Chan-Woo Park\u2019s latest thriller, Stoker. Just remember before deciding to watch this film that it is very distasteful for a majority of viewers. \r\n\r\nAfter her father dies in a car accident, India Stoker must cope with the unusual fact that her Uncle Charlie, whom she had no idea even existed, was moving in with her and her distant mother. Charlie is quite a smooth talker and seems to have gotten on India\u2019s mother\u2019s good side\u2026a little too good. His charming personality leads India to believe that there is something more sinister going on, which leads her on a path of discovering the truth. Although, where most movies would have the hero find out the truth and take down the bad guy, India acts as more of a villain who begins to practically side forces with her evil Uncle Charlie, reaching the boundaries of unacceptable behavior. \r\n\r\nRight from the beginning, you know that the movie is remarkably disturbing. You have a creepy Uncle with crazy eyes and a goth girl who you are preparing to witness turn into a psycho-killer at some point. Whether this happens or not, I obviously cannot disclose, but her personality as well as Charlie\u2019s is just out of this world creepy, which is when you begin to realize that there really is no protagonist in this entire story. How can you really root for anyone when no one gives you a solid reason to root? A story can survive with just a protagonist, because we have coming-of-age stories, but just an antagonist doesn\u2019t work well. What this film turns into is the opposite of a coming-of-age flick, you see a teenage girl descend into darkness. \r\n\r\nAlso, even though it isn\u2019t expressly described as such, there is some incestuous themes going on that are hard to miss, which just adds to the ever-growing disturbing nature of the film. When it comes to the writing, it\u2019s a little much to take in, and when it actually comes down to everything all together, it just isn\u2019t very believable unless the world was centered on an extreme episode of Jerry Springer. What was done well, on the other hand was the display of mystery and visual scenery.  \r\n\r\nThe mystery in the movie really provides the life, or the glue to what makes this film survive. You can be as disturbed as you like, but there\u2019s just no way you can leave the movie without seeing how it ends, and that\u2019s a really powerful weapon that a film can have. Yeah, it strives away from your traditional Hollywood format, but it at least did the mystery right. The visual sceneries are just out of this world. It\u2019s not a fantasy or 3D film or anything, but it gets as beautiful as a movie can get, realistically speaking. It does a better job at conveying the beauty that our world already provides without the use of creating beauty that doesn\u2019t exist. This display really compliments the film in a lot of ways, and gives you just another reason to keep watching the movie.  \r\n\r\nWhat it really boils down to is that the movie is just too disturbing to watch on a multiple basis, and doesn\u2019t give you a protagonist to root for, but it has great acting, great visuals, and a dark mystery that will have you plastered to the screen. For some, this may be a guilty pleasure, for others they may find themselves compelled to stop, finding it distasteful. It\u2019s really give or take. \r\n\r\nCheck Stoker out for yourself when it is released on DVD and Blu-Ray on Jun. 18!","id":"51b7558f760ee3169a001e20","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51b7558f760ee3169a001e20","movie_id":86825}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Be prepared for the worst, but hope for the best. Pray for the best, but prepare for the worst. \r\n\r\nPrisoners is directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Aaron Guzikowski. It stars Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Terence Howard, Maria Bello, Melissa Leo and Paul Dano. Music is by  J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson and cinematography by Roger Deakins.\r\n\r\nWhen Keller Dover's (Jackman) daughter and her friend go missing, he takes matters into his own hands...\r\n\r\nAt first glance of the plot synopis, one could be forgiven for thinking this is yet another revenge thriller filled out by police procedural side-bars. How pleasant to find that Prisoners has more to offer than a simple who is the criminal? And just how far will a vengeful father go to satiate his grief?.\r\n\r\nPrisoners is such an apt title because all the main players here are trapped by either mental fragility or victims of their innocence, guilt or chaotic impulses. It's a multi stranded character piece that poses many questions, while of course it has a big mystery element. The narrative features a whole host of clues that might be something, or not, unanswered questions dangle throughout until the finale reveals thge edgy secrets.\r\n\r\nIt's safe to say that the themes at work here are dark and upsetting, with the core abduction thread siddling up against horredous back stories, torture and religious mania. Gruzikowski's screenplay is quality, mesmerising even, there's no lazy filler or extranous sequences, even as the jigsaw pieces are put together in the last quarter, you may find yourself wondering how you missed something so simple?.\r\n\r\nThis was Villeneuve's first English language picture, and it's not hard to see why he was highly touted as one of the next big director beings - his output that followed subsequently bears this out. His control of mood and pacing is superb, his garnering of high quality perfs from his cast (notably Jackman and Gyllenhaal) is impressive, and his teaming with the great Deakins is a match made in photographic heaven.\r\n\r\nThis is adult film making, a thriller designed to illicit emotional responses from the audience.

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"Liberalism gone loony\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2013 and directed by Mike Lerner & Maxim Pozdorovkin, \"Pussy Riot: A Punk Prayer\" is a documentary about the feminist\/anti-Putin Russian punk rock collective, Pussy Riot, and the arrest & trial of three of its main members (Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich) for their offensive protest \u201cperformance\u201d at a Moscow cathedral in 2012 wherein they were charged with hooliganism motivated by enmity toward a religious group and disturbing the social order.\r\n\r\nI have an obvious message for these three women (aged 22, 23 and 29 respectively at the time of the events): If you don\u2019t want to go to jail don\u2019t enact hateful criminal protests. Let me put it this way: What if several conservative Christians visited whatever dive they \u201cperform\u201d at and carried out a mocking, hostile rant against them and their ilk? They\u2019d be incensed and immediately put a stop to it, not to mention press charges to prevent it from happening again.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of \u201cperforming,\u201d the girls\u2019 music is laughably trite punk ditties. Separated from the political hype, their cacophonies wouldn\u2019t register even a blip on the punk\/rock\/metal barometer. \r\n\r\nA couple of the females are asked what they\u2019re protesting against and one of them says they\u2019re objecting to the (supposed) Russian expectation of women to have babies and do little else in society. But (1.) no one\u2019s forcing her or anyone else to have babies and (2.) the movie itself shows women in all kinds of significant professions in Russia, including two judges, a prominent lawyer and police officers. It\u2019s a classic case of rebel without a cause. If they don\u2019t like Putin, fine, vote against him and look into becoming a politician. If you don\u2019t like the conservative sway in current Russian culture, then do your part to respectfully influence society to your point of view, which would include offering a positive example of your (supposedly superior) belief system. \r\n\r\nInstead, these women opted for outrageous acts in their 3-year protest against the Russian government, culminating in the sacrilegious incident at the Russian Orthodox cathedral: They stuck poultry up their you-know-whats in supermarkets, spray-painted vulgar graffiti on bridges, staged an unbelievable public orgy at a museum when Nadya was eight-months pregnant, which is actually shown in the movie for like 10 seconds (two clips). Seriously? In response, Putin expressed \u201cI\u2019m surprised they weren\u2019t arrested prior to this.\u201d So am I. \r\n\r\nThe flick is evenhanded in that it lacks a biased narration and simply shows the actual footage, translating the Russian verbiage into English, with a smattering of interviews with parents, husbands and whoever. It\u2019s a fascinating documentary in that it reveals modern Russian culture, its predominant values and lunatic fringe. I was surprised to observe that the elder disciples of the Russian Orthodox Church resemble formidable American bikers more than anything else. \r\n\r\nDespite these positives, I\u2019m not giving the film a higher rating because it foolishly sides with the girls. Which is baffling since anyone with a modicum of common sense can see that they got precisely what their doofus behavior deserved. If a group of conservatives in America did what these women did, but enacted toward liberal people & institutions, they\u2019d be lambasted by the lamestream media and imprisoned for years for hooligan hate crimes. Of course loony libertines are notorious for their hypocritical double standards.                                \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 28 minutes.   \r\n\r\nGRADE: C-","id":"5ac017430e0a264a51039658","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ac017430e0a264a51039658","movie_id":159032}

{"author":"Reno","content":"I understand why this film did not vastly, positively recognized, even though it was taken straight from a really cruel incident. Some viewers mind only the commercial value, forget that one because they're living a useless and careless life about society. And the other reason is there is nothing wrong in performance, direction or in any technical aspect, but the story itself do not fit to be a movie. It should have been documentary instead. \r\n\r\nCoincidentally, this movie was similar to the 2011 Koren movie 'Children...' which was also based on the true event. About children who go missing. Both the events took place in the early 90s. This silver screen movie looks a lot like television broadcastable item that it should be. There is a documentary trilogy inspired from this story. The motive was to bring the truth out and it was well received according to ratings and reviews. And don't forget the books. \r\n\r\n\u2018\u2018My son is 8-year-old. He sleeps with a night light on, \r\nhe did not run away from home.\u2019\u2019 \r\n\r\nA movie must have (1) a story to begin with, (2) characters that develop along the story and (3) finally a conclusion whether twist in it or not, happy or sad, either way it works. So what's wrong with it? Well, it lacks in development in either of above first two points and extents throughout without nothing while we are expecting a glimpse of something to happen. The fact is, no one knows what really happened, actually those who know are tight lipped because of involvement. I just can't conclude my judgement because of this movie, but give a fair point for anyone who are not familiar with this case. \r\n\r\nNot focused on a particular character, the most of the perspective in the storytelling was Colin Firth's role which was just an appearance to show I'm there but not in action. You have a couple of choices to rate this movie, one, based on the story which is real and cruel, and another is the movie that disappoints as a movie. Like I am always quite happy with the product like this, because I got to know what I supposed to learn about this 'West Memphis Three' case. Hope the new movie do convey well to the cinematic output.","id":"5506c8fb92514174b00047a1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5506c8fb92514174b00047a1","movie_id":152792}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Half movie, half documentary, the story of most crucial scientific discovery.\r\n\r\nThe film was inspired by the real life stories of the two women from the same timeline who had no connections, except theirs involvement with something. That means there are two sets of stories that's told one after another in parts which covered the events from nearly the three decades. So it all begins in the 1960, where two little sisters promise to each other about something, but 10 years later one of their's life changed forever when another one dies of cancer. So this is the story where the other sister begins her fight against the disease that took her family away.\r\n\r\nThis is a small budget film that shot entirely within a month of time. There are lots of actresses in this, even for the small roles. I thought Helen Hunt would lead the narration, but then there were Maggie Grace, Alice Eve, Aaron Paul and others. Great dedications by all, but this was Samantha Morton's film.\r\n\r\nI did not know what this story is about when I decided to watch, but I'm pretty happy for the film. Except the material was more a documentary suitable kind, especially the story of Helen Hunt's character. Moreover feels like it is a short film with a decent story. I think it is worth a watch because of unfolding an important scientific discovery of our time. So a big yes on that perspective, but entertainment wise it is just an average.

{"author":"Matt Golden","content":"Three years ago, Despicable Me launched Illumination Entertainment and announced Universal Studios as a viable player in the animation game (only Disney\/Pixar and DreamWorks used to show up to these box-office battles). The film wasn't even the only supervillain animation to hit the theaters that year, but it did one-up its rival Megamind both in critical acclaim and commercial success.\r\n\r\nNow, the original film's creative team returns with Despicable Me 2, continuing the adventures of former supervillain-cum-adopted father Gru, his precocious daughters Margo, Edith, and Agnes, and his little, yellow, nonsense-spouting minions. Following closely on the first film's heels (this film gratifyingly puts a premium on continuity), the now-retired Gru is settling into his new paternal role, and while the spikier parts of his personality remain, he's reshaped himself into an adoring father and potential purveyor of jams (and jellies). When an evil plot threatens the globe, however, Gru finds himself pulled back into the supervillain game by the Anti-Villain League, who've recruited him to be the hero, an ersatz spy who knows how the mystery bad guy thinks. One earnest and delightfully overbearing partner introduction later, the pair (Gru and newbie AVL agent Lucy Wilde, played by Kristen Wiig) are undercover as bakers in a strip mall where the bad guy's scheme is likely to go down.\r\n\r\nDespite the world being threatened, the stakes feel surprisingly low in the film; the archness of the plot never feels as real or immediate as the character interactions, which are enjoyable all the way through. Here, Gru realizes his loneliness, his neophyte partner realizes her true calling, and his daughters come to grips with new realizations and wishes. The characters take center stage, rarely letting the transparently-raised stakes of the plot machinations get in the way of sitcom-like character arcs such as the eldest daughter dating (and Gru's dogged insistence on undermining it) or little Agnes wanting a new mother. But that's sort of the magic of these films; despite the plot beats being the stuff of basic sitcoms, the setting and characters manage to still make the film a winning combination.\r\n\r\nSteve Carell dusts off the strange Eastern European accent he originated for Gru, and manages to be both an amusing character and his own straight man. Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, and Elsie Fisher embody adorableness as the girls. But it's Wiig who steals the show as Agent Wilde, a professional woman who is also goofy and personable. Wiig and Carell have fantastic chemistry, even with just their voices in play.\r\n\r\nThe minions, those little yellow blobs in overalls that accompany all of the film's publicity, are back and hilarious as ever, despite their laser-like focus on slapstick and complete lack of intelligible dialogue. The Despicable films seem to be two separate animation genres welded together: the first is a heartfelt, Pixarian meditation on the nature of family, but the second is the part with the minions, which embody the anarchic spirit of the Looney Tunes more successfully than any of their predecessors. It's a strange melange that shouldn't work, but dammit, it does, and the resulting films wound up being both moving and guffaw-inducing.\r\n\r\nThe other aspect of the Despicable films that bowls me over is the virtual cinematography; truly, alongside the best of Pixar's output (like Wall-E), these are some of the most beautiful animated films ever made. The use of color, depth, and art are stunning, from Gru's Charles Addams-inspired design to the beautiful play of light, shadow, and color. This sequel follows the high standards of the first, and the result is a feast for the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that like the first film, this one is a trifle, but a very enjoyable one. It's little more than a victory lap for Carell and company, but when there are characters you can enjoy this much, what's wrong with spending another couple of hours with them?","id":"51ec26b719c29551dc10feeb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51ec26b719c29551dc10feeb","movie_id":93456}
{"author":"neeshaan","content":"Sohanlal's Kadha Veedu connects one story each from three celebrated Malayalam writers - M T Vasudevan Nair, Vaikkom Mohammed Basheer and Madhavikkutty.\r\n\r\nNow, the format is pretty interesting. Filmmaker Raj Karthi (Kunchacko Boban) and his live in partner Jeena (Bhama) are going through an emotional crisis, where she wants to get married but he is not ready for it as yet. He lives in his world of movies and the three stories are portions from his film and the intention is perhaps to connect it with the couple's real life.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea looks good but the film never really strikes a chord with the viewer. With deliberate efforts to look more serious than what it is, badly written dialogues and some half hearted performances makes this one, a rather boring affair.\r\n\r\nThe first story has Abdul Khadar (Manoj K Jayan) and Jameela (Mallika) as a loving couple. When the wife asks for two poovambazham, he takes all the efforts to get it but only manage to find some oranges.\r\n\r\nIn the next story, Major Frederic Mukundan (Lal) and his sexy wife Reetha (Rituaparna Sen Gupta) keep their romance intact even at their house called 'Dar-es-Salaam' even after several years of their marriage. Raj Karthy is instantly attracted to Reetha's ample charms and now, he reminisces those memories after so many years.\r\n\r\nIn the third story, Balachandran (Biju Menon) is finding it hard to come into terms with the sudden demise of his wife. His kids ask for neyypayasam that their mother made and are waiting for her return.\r\n\r\nThere is a definite effort from Sohanlal to find some meaning to this whole exercise, but the problem is that it has not been conveyed effectively on screen. T D Sreenivas' camera and M Jayachandran's music are fine at best.\r\n\r\nThe feeling you get is that almost every actor in the film has just done his or her roles without any real conviction.\r\n\r\nKadha Veedu is another attempt to make serious cinema in a pattern that has lost its charm with most viewers by now, due to its rampant misuse. It's pretentious to the core and will require real patience not to be bored even during the 105-minute duration of the film.

{"author":"Reno","content":"Lately I have been watching lots of movies from the book adaptation and here it comes another one. This time an English language novel transformed into an Italian movie. But what I heard is that a few changes were made to bring the Italian flavor. Well, what could I say more, if you know the director you will say he's the right person to make it happen and he did excellently. Recruited the best cast and extracted best out of them.\r\n\r\n     The story of the two families narrated in the different streams when a cyclist got hit by a car on the Christmas eve. So the question has been asked, how did it happen? And who did it? The characters from two families begin to expose their role on that accident night revealing who did what. Dino, a realtor sees an opportunity to get into a big earning league so he decides to invest a large amount on it. Followed by the recession he has to face the reality of business that puts his life on a stake. Carla, the wife of a multimillionaire gives a financial support for the struggling company. Later she has to let it go when her husband's business begins to fall apart. Serena, the daughter of Dino and Massimiliano, son of Carla are the close friends. Their story follows where one of them finds their true love and another one get into sadness for some reason.

The story that happened between the particular timeline was repeated again and again with another character's perspective and with different camera angles till truth reveals in the final chapter. As it's still developing the opening was confusing which was the first chapter. Without holding-up in development, it straight goes with the main intention of the theme. If you pass that then the following segments interest you to make you guess the possibilities the suspense it hold. Kind of impossible to predict because of the introduction of the related characters to the particular incident consumed by the three quarters of the film. Which mean twist comes at the latter part which was really a good one. Each character that comes in the different episodes were incredible. Like, for a moment it was unhooked from the rest and centralizes that specific story stream, but the common event holds the story all together. I liked all the main characters, but the character Serena steals the final show. The role who played it was a new face and I kind see a great career ahead of her.

{"author":"tmdb39513728","content":"**Payne Relief**\r\n\r\nThe black and white photography is a nice touch. It gives a kind of Karsh look to the weathered faces of the aging, reflective, yet still yearning cast of characters, and suits the rapidly fading memories of a bygone era in recent American history. The acting was pretty good. Bruce Dern gives an effortless performance as a cranky old coot with one attention-seeking foot in the spotlight and the other half-buried in the shadows of utter dementia. The interpersonal conflicts among family and community, past and present are presented in a simple, linear uncomplicated way. The story seems to want to explore the sad truths of a regressive, bankrupt nation and the ridiculous dreams and delusions people cling to. Life is limited and unfinished. Like the heads carved out of Mount Rushmore. Like the forlorn characters wandering on and off the screen. For even after a lifetime of honest hard work aligned with various fixed Christian principles, a restless, quiet desperation lingers. Lies and illusions are necessary to prevent a lonely, inconsolable reality from setting in. And while Alexander Payne manages to keeps things relatively upbeat to prevent dragging us down into a pit of futile despair, he also fails to fully develop and realize the themes he puts forward. Every time Payne rustles up a movie (Sideways, The Descendants) he gets high praise, and this time he almost deserves it. He's a fairly astute cinematician who wants to make meaningful pictures without getting in too deep. Specifically, road movies on half a tank. Thankfully, he doesn't tread into murky Bergman territory, or puff his stuff up with Goddard-like self-importance, but he doesn't do himself much justice by avoiding or brushing off the potential worth and urgency of the matters he introduces. His concepts are cut short. While I'm watching Nebraska, I can't help but wonder how adept filmmakers like Kieslowski or Cassavettes would have treated and serviced the material. What's almost more disappointing than getting old, losing a presence of mind and attempting to reconcile broken memories, is not being able to fully grasp, much less handle and nurture, your own brainchild.","id":"54d1fbf9c3a368307d0027b1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54d1fbf9c3a368307d0027b1","movie_id":129670}
{"author":"Dsnake1","content":"A religious conspiracy theory, at best. The cinematography is nonexistent. It's really worse than that. The narrator, Trey Smith, who is also the writer, director, and everything else, is about six inches from the camera, covering the entire right-hand side of the screen. The other half is a semi-random set of images and short videos. The narrator's voice is extremely nasally.\r\n\r\nUltimately, it's probably more 'information' than old-school History Channel documentaries, but the quality of what is shown is way lower than those. The theories he talks about are somewhat interesting, but I do feel that the video could be half as long and get the same point across.","id":"59dfc1f392514125050a53e7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59dfc1f392514125050a53e7","movie_id":371554}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I was not impressed by this movie. Having said that I do not think it deserves the many 1 star ratings that it have received nor do I think that the acting by neither Will Smith nor his son Jaden was as bad as some people claim. My gripe with this movie lies more with the actual implementation of the story.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is not really a bad one. It could have been made into a rather good movie. However the result that we see is rather shallow. Worse it is riddled with stupidities and illogicalness.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts off with the all too common humans are destroying the planet, we are so bad, bla bla. I am so tired of seeing that crap being stuffed into movies (and books) left right and center. When I read want to ponder those questions I read the appropriate science papers. Stop stuffing it in my face when I just want to be entertained.\r\n\r\nThen we get to know that some alien presence where dropping monsters on the humans. Monsters that where genetically bred to kill humans. Okay\u2026? If they wanted to exterminate us why make it in such a long-winded way? And what happened afterward? When it apparently failed to exterminate us did they just go \u201coh well\u201d and left?\r\n\r\nThe basic story of the film is that the ship carrying Cypher and Katai crash lands on old Earth which are now supposedly inhabitable for humans. Okay but, apart from the fact that a thousand years in the future one would have thought that they could avoid meteor storms easily, what is this mumbo jumbo that Cypher can somehow \u201cfeel\u201d the storm coming?\r\n\r\nLet us continue with Earth itself. It is supposed to be inhabitable for humans. Could they not have made a little better effort to make it look inhabitable then? It looks like a semi-tropical\/tempered paradise to me. Also, the temperatures are supposed to drop to well below zero every night yet the vegetation is abundant and green? While we are on the subject of vegetation, how the bloody hell can they need \u201cbreathing pills\u201d when the vegetation, and thus the oxygen production, is that abundant? Things like this just sticks out like a sore thumb and drags down the movie.\r\n\r\nThen we have these Ursa\u2019s. They are bread for the purpose of exterminating humans. They are blind and tracks the humans by the fear pheremones. Say again? What kind of idiot alien would do such a thing? Any bioengineer worth their salary would ensure that such a creature had every advantage they could get. That would include sight and hearing as well as smell (and probably a few other senses like infrared as well). Also, this idea of having to be fearless is just dumb. Apart from simple things like staying downwind the only thing the humans would have to do was to outfit their soldiers with airtight combat suits.\r\n\r\nI am not saying that a science fiction movie (or any movie) should be all science and believable but this movie is just too filled with glaring stupidities. For me it is not the total turkey that some people seems to think it is. It has some entertainment value but not more than 4 out of 10 stars worth.","id":"59425f1fc3a3686c2c00958c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59425f1fc3a3686c2c00958c","movie_id":82700}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"RELEASED IN 2013 and written & directed by Jill Soloway, \u201cAfternoon Delight\u201d chronicles events when a bored stay-at-home mom in Los Angeles (Kathryn Hahn) becomes intrigued by a beautiful \u2018sex worker\u2019 (Juno Temple) at a strip club. Surprisingly, she brings her home to live in the extra room and even enlists her as a nanny, which has repercussions. Josh Radnor plays the husband and Jane Lynch the wife\u2019s therapist.  \r\n\r\nThis contains some hard R-rated sex-oriented scenes so I encourage you to pass if you find that unsavory. To be honest, I was only interested in \u201cAfternoon Delight\u201d because of the winsome, stunning Juno. This isn\u2019t a quirky comedy, but rather a serious drama with amusing touches. The occasional crudeness and overt raciness tempted me to tune out a few times, but I kept watching in the hope that the film had something good to get across; thankfully, it did (see below for details).                 \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hours & 38 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION (***SPOILER ALERT*** Don\u2019t read further if you haven\u2019t seen the film):\r\n\r\nMcKenna (Juno) is a siren, the daughter of a witch. She openly suggests that she\u2019s a witch as well. Using her charms, she puts a \u2018spell\u2019 on Rachel (Hahn) at the strip club and so the mesmerized Rachel eventually tracks her down and brings her home. While Rachel sincerely intends on being a positive influence on McKenna and help her get out of the dubious sex business, McKenna intends on luring Rachel into her sleazy lifestyle. McKenna explains to Rachel why she has no qualms about what she does and even justifies it. Rachel is intrigued until she sees McKenna\u2019s sordid work up close and rejects it because she discerns that McKenna is unrepentant about her vocation. \r\n\r\nRachel immediately puts the kibosh on McKenna babysitting her friends\u2019 girls because she\u2019s clearly a bad role model, but the mother has yet to figure out a way to get the prostitute out of the house without making too many waves. That\u2019s when the wives go out on the town while the husbands stay home to party with tantalizing McKenna lurking nearby. Needless to say, it\u2019s a recipe for disaster and provides a way for McKenna to stick it to Rachel and her \u2018judgmental\u2019 friends.\r\n\r\nThe negative fallout provokes Jeff (Radnor) to confront Rachel on how she could be so stupid to bring an unabashed whore into their abode. He didn\u2019t comprehend Rachel\u2019s reasoning: Did she want him to sleep with McKenna? Did SHE want to sleep with her? Jeff failed to grasp that Rachel was under McKenna\u2019s \u201cspell\u201d and inadvertently doing her bidding. \r\n\r\nFortunately, Rachel, realizes her error (\u201cwaking up\u201d from McKenna\u2019s enchantment) and seeks reconciliation with her husband, now fully appreciating her family.","id":"5a998adb0e0a2605e400f4b4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a998adb0e0a2605e400f4b4","movie_id":156708}

But the thing is they won't to everybody. This is not a message film, but about doing good. Self is important, but still you can care for other than yourself. It was about an average modern day couple. They come across a young woman working in a strip club and try to support her to give up it to live a normal life like them. They know the risk of letting her in, so what comes later is a trouble that affects the family and friendship.\r\n\r\nYou won't believe that it was one of the Tarantino's top ten films of the year 2013. I find it not bad as well. But surely it should have been better. Feature film directional debut for the writer and producer. From the woman filmmaker, women oriented film drama. Fun to watch, yet a very serious thematic. From the cast side, both, Kathryn Hahn and Juno Temple were good. Surely a delightful film if you are not anticipating a big from it.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"5a7717cc0e0a26642d04ca80","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a7717cc0e0a26642d04ca80","movie_id":156708}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Wolves in a pack hunting for a beast-sheep.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I remembered was, 'Save the Green Planet', but it was a crime-thriller, not a fantasy-sci-fi. Tough guys in the leather jackets, guns in the one hand and cigars in the other, that's what I imagined when Tarantino favoured it. But this film was slightly not an aggressive like too violent. The screenplay was disturbed frequently when it begins to engage on the nervous side. Hence it makes you say 'just missed', sometime disappointedly. Anyway, no one told me it was a dark comedy, I took it as a surprise and somewhat enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nIt was on the serious subject, but not the presentation. Keeps everything lightly, especially conceals the dark side of truth for the final twist. For us, as the viewers, the prediction is two ways, either 'he did' it or 'he didn't' like taking a side. Film length was good with a moderate pace. There's no place for the characters to unroll with the proper introductions, including not even the opening event on which the whole film stands. From the beginning itself the writer wanted to save it for the final revelation. That's not smart, that's afraid of leaving hints.\r\n\r\n> \"Maniacs are afraid of maniacs.\"\r\n\r\nKind of similar to Hollywood's 'Prisoners'. Well, almost matches, except the characters and places. A good movie, but not that good. Well attempted, I am sure many would love this film. The narration is about kidnapping a guy on the suspicion of crime for a secret interrogation. It hauls in the remaining till advance to the crucial end part. In the mean time, the torturing techniques and the suspense hold our position.\r\n\r\nBecause of Tarantino's nod, it's an easy 'go for it', well, mostly for his fanbase. I say consider it and decide yourself after the watch, don't believe, not even me. To me it was the great opportunity missed to dominate, especially having a powerful title and theme. Still, I don't reckon it is a bad or worst movie, but surely one of the year's top 50 or maybe 25.\r\n\r\nThe movie was as I thought. The story and my anticipation were on the parallel track aiming the same direction. At least I was occupied, but the issue was, it did not go above my expectation to surprise me with some interesting elements. It flunks, like trying to fill the new wine in an old bottle with the old label and description in it. Stylish, but attempted to be too clever was the let down by the slimmest margin. On the other hand, as coming from the Israeli, it is exceptional.\r\n\r\n6.5\/10","id":"55de140c9251411c3e0002d9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55de140c9251411c3e0002d9","movie_id":171540}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Kick axx continuation of the sylvan fairy tale about slaying diabolical witches***\r\n\r\nIn Medieval Germany, Hansel & Gretel (Jeremy Renner & Gemma Arterton) are now adults and formidable witch slayers, not to mention considered heroes in the community. When numerous children turn-up missing, they trace the problem to an unholy celebration orchestrated by a grand witch (Famke Janssen). Fetching Pihla Viitala plays a redhead villager accused of witchcraft.\r\n\r\n\"Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters\" (2013) is a dark fantasy\/action\/comedy\/horror that takes the German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm and envisions events about twenty years later. Imagine the excellent \u201cSeason of the Witch\u201d (2011) meshed with the fantasy elements of the fable and you\u2019d have a good idea of this movie. \u201cDracula Untold\u201d (2014) and \u201cSnow White and the Huntsman\u201d (2012) are good contemporary associations, but \u201cHansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters\u201d is noticeably superior.\r\n\r\nThis movie just kicks total axx from beginning to end with Gemma jaw-dropping as the take-no-sheet heroine and Renner rising to the challenge. The witches are ee-vil and worthy of nothing other than immediate slaughter, which is basically the siblings\u2019 modus operandi. There\u2019s a lot of thrilling action and gore, some of it so over-the-top it\u2019s amusing; there\u2019s even a terrible troll. And the movie LOOKs great. If you like dark woodsy adventure and don\u2019t mind fantasy, don\u2019t miss out on this excellent film.   \r\n\r\nThe film is doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome at 1 hour, 28 minutes; and was fittingly shot completely in Germany.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A","id":"5cd5bb8d92514173973b85f8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cd5bb8d92514173973b85f8","movie_id":60304}
{"author":"Reno","content":"This movie was based on the short story 'Hateship, Friensdhip, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage' which won the Noble prize in literature a decade ago. A pure drama about a middle aged single woman whose life was dedicated to her profession. Just like similar to the 'Finding Vivian Maier', except there was no photographies involved. Frankly, I was not predicted that this film would impress me a lot. Picked it to watch without an interest, but while a watch surprised and glued to my seat to the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nEven though there were fine actors in the movie like Guy Pearce and latest sensation Hailee Steinfield, it was a Kristen Wiig show. Apart from voice-over for the animations and other supporting roles, she was not seen in a top form recently. Her commitment to the character she played as Johanna Perry the live-in caretaker in the movie was inevitable to appreciate. Feels very real who fall for a teenagers prank that actually influence her life to turn it around. So how and what are the things to be done against the odds are displayed well.\r\n\r\n''The only thing worse than friendship is hateship.''\r\n\r\nKind of 'second chance' theme, if you get one you must seize it. Though, it was not that simple in the movie, but developed at a fair dosage of obstacles between 'the desperate' and 'the hope' to form balanced account. Don't consider it an inspirational, it was just pieces of common event that's happening everywhere, but creatively put into the texts and then cinematic. Commercializable title that did not suit for a realistic narration. Especially not in todays world, might have been a perfect title 20-25 years ago. Once you watch it the perspective will change that still movie like this are made for the silver screen, not direct-to-television, but what? Sadly commercially fails.\r\n\r\nIf you observe closely the end scene, it was very practical to the real life. Whether we accept our fate as it happened or we created it, the flaws always remain, especially in a relationship. That's what the entire movie unfolds, how people cope with each other despite what they were before. A very well told simple story. Of course it was a slow narration, not because of the stretched from a short story, but to give the depth in the portrayal. This movie is for ardent drama fans like me, for a change others as well should try this little sweet movie.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"55104fd7c3a368488600cfdf","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55104fd7c3a368488600cfdf","movie_id":209271}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is a movie which you watch for the action and the special effects and pretty much nothing else. As such it is a excellent movie. The original story of Hansel & Gretel is essentially only used to boot this movie. The movie itself plays out when Hansel & Gretel are adult witch hunters.\r\n\r\nThe movie is pretty much action all the way. It is fairly violent and goory action at that. It is not a movie for the kids. To me this is an advantage. I do not think I would have liked it as much if they had dumbed it down to a standard PG-rated Hollywood creation. I really enjoyed the hard-ass Hansel & Gretel duo kicking witch ass in so many way.\r\n\r\nThe special effects are not bad and the medieval yet kind of modern weaponry that Hansel & Gretel swings around are quite cool looking. Not very believable perhaps but then neither are witches so\u2026 The witches themselves are also fairly cool. Especially the witch-gathering near the end of the movie is indeed a grim (ha ha) collection of freaky creatures.\r\n\r\nI was not too thrilled about the idiot law keeper. His utter stupidity bugged me throughout the entire movie. I really whished they would have dragged out the end for him a bit more. Well he did meet a suitable end at least.\r\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. If you though this was to be \u201cjust\u201d a Hansel & Gretel movie the you are probably going to be disappointed. I knew more or less what I went for so I was just enjoying myself. I was surprised at the level of gore, exploding heads, troll-squished humans etc\u2026 but, as I said above, I think it was a good thing that they did let it be done in the way the producer\/director obviously intended for it to be made.","id":"5a57be43c3a36825ab003936","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a57be43c3a36825ab003936","movie_id":60304}

{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"*** This review contains MAJOR spoilers ***\r\n\r\nThis is actually not so much a review as it is a vehicle for me to express my utter disgust of what was supposed to be a great sequel to what I consider one of the coolest movies ever made. I absolutely loved Kick-Ass. It was fresh, it was original, and in spite of its crude and graphic violence, absolutely hilarious. Its sequel, is nothing short of an abomination.\r\n\r\nFor your convenience, I have comprised a list of Everything Wrong with Kick-Ass 2:\r\n\r\n1. The gore. It's not that it was worse than KA1, it's that it was very different in tone. Whereas in the first movie \u2013 where the violence was equally gut-wrenching \u2013 the nature of it all was laugh-out-loud hilarious, mostly because it was executed by a foul-mouthed 12-year-old school girl. KA2 on the other hand, feels more like a snuff movie where good guys and innocent bystanders are brutally slaughtered, just for the hell of it. Which leads me to point number two:\r\n\r\n2. The targets. In the first movie, the whole point was easy: killing bad guys. So, no bad feelings and no conflict of interest. For the second installment, it seems the moral compass has taken a 180 degree turn. Here we have to sit and watch the good guys dropping dead one by one, and it isn't the least bit funny. I'd like to give you a heads-up on the brutal murder of Dave's dad, the most innocent good guy of them all. Yeah, I didn't see than one coming either.\r\n\r\n3. The bad guys. Good god. Rarely have I seen such an array of dumb, sickeningly stupid villains. Most of the slaughtering and mayhem is done by one block-of-concrete-with-boobs called Mother Russia (what's in a name?). Everything about her just makes you sick to your stomach, especially the way she offs her victims. She is part of the main villain's gang, and don't even get me started on this guy\u2026 Remember Red Mist? He was pretty funny in KA1, wasn't he. Yeah well, those days are over. After accidentally on purpose killing his own mother (!), he proclaims himself the new great villain of New York, henceforth calling himself The Motherf***er (again, what's in a name\u2026). He rallies a group of equally douche baggy cronies. Their mission is to kill Kick-Ass and all who follow him. Their first strike? Killing off the best new character.\r\n\r\n4. Jim Carrey's screen time. The poor guy clocks out at exactly 7 minutes and 45 seconds. He plays Colonel Stars and Stripes, and he is by far the best addition to the cast. What's remarkable about his performance is that he's barely recognizable. His speaking voice is low and brooding, and there's not a funny face in sight. Really cool character all around. After waiting for what feels like forever for him to finally appear, guess what; not ten minutes later \u2013 gone. Impaled, slaughtered and decapitated by Mother Russia. I'd like to have a hearty word with the \"screenwriter\" who's responsible for this. He needs to go back to school. Here's my advice anyway \u2013 free of charge: YOU DON'T KILL OFF THE BEST CHARACTER HALFWAY THROUGH THE MOVIE. Dumbass.\r\n\r\n5. The \"humour\". In KA1, the humour was cheeky, intelligent, and perfect satire. And where it was crude, it was right up at the top, but never really over it. Second time around, we have to make do with projectile vomiting and violent diarrhoea. Really, poop jokes\u2026? Now this is a perfect example of what 'we' (we meaning \u2013 people over 13 with normal intelligence and a healthy sense of humour) call \"rock bottom\". Yes. They go that low. I'm going to stop here before I start remembering all of the other \"jokes\". \r\n\r\n6. Lack of proper Hit-Girl action. Hit-Girl was always the star of the show. In KA2, she is given a dumb sub-plot where she vows to quit her alter-ego job and become a 'normal', prissy little cheerleader, competing with other Barbie girls to become popular. I really, really hated this story line. I don't even care if it was in the original comics, it sucked. The reason why it sucked the most is because effectively, this means that the essence of Hit-Girl is completely vacant for about 60% of the movie! And that's WAY too much time for the most beloved character to mope around apologetically before she finally gets her s**t together roughly 10 minutes before the end of the movie.\r\n\r\n7. Mister Kick-Ass himself. Something went wrong here. I don't know if it was the character that was poorly written or Aaron Taylor-Johnson that came up short, but he was very different from the first movie, in which he had a really cute, geeky charm about him. Here, he was inconspicuous and dull, like a bystander in his own story. Or perhaps he was just overshadowed by the abundance of new and reformed characters\u2026 In any case, he was barely there to be noticed.\r\n\r\n8. Soundtrack. The score of KA1 was so damn cool, with original, poppy punk music and electro that consistently added something to every scene. Here, I only remember one scene that caught that vibe and it still wasn't half as good.\r\n\r\n9. It was seriously offensive. A \"joke\" about rape? Are you kidding me?! And I'm not talking about some guys hanging around, talking about wanting to 'do' some girl or whatever. No, I'm talking about The Motherf***er seriously intending to rape Night Bitch, except he can't because he's got no wood. Real classy.\r\n\r\nThere are some redeeming points to this otherwise complete crap fest, but honestly, they are so few and far in between they're not even worth mentioning. Well, I guess this is what you get for hiring some D-grade nobody to replace Matthew Vaughn. Don't waste your time with this garbage.\r\n_(June 2014)_","id":"58ac495c92514158df0138b4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ac495c92514158df0138b4","movie_id":59859}

Mr. Walker won't win an oscar for his performance in this movie, but I don't think he ever thought he would... for any of his movies.\r\n\r\n_Last words... give it a chance if you are in the mood for a nice drama with a bit of action thrown in.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Expected a very little, but delivered very hugely.\r\n\r\nThe first word I said after the watch was 'unbelievable'. That means the movie is not bad, but how come I missed it for this long. This is the best dark-fantasy movie I have seen recently. But earlier, I thought it would be like the movie 'Tusk' which made me a little uncomfortable to watch. So in the end, what's the difference between the tusk and\/or the horn. Both come in a pair and animals have it to defend themselves from the threat. When I watched that movie, I lost interest in this. Yep, it is a silly reason and now I feel bad for that.\r\n\r\nThis movie dominated by the British cast, especially for having Daniel Radcliffe and Juno Temple I thought it was British film, actually it was not. It was a Canadian-US jointly produced, adapted from a book of the same name and directed by 'Mirror' director. The story was so good, not genuine, though explored the theme very well. For every few minutes later, the narration was taking a turn and that made the plot to get lot tighter before heading for the concluding part.\r\n\r\nMaybe this the best movie of Radcliffe that I've seen after his goodbye to 'Harry Potter' movie series. I don't think he's a chocolate boy type, but this kind of movie suits him well. I think he should get muscles for more movie like this, but his height is another negative factor. The film was entirely shot in Canada, the photography was great, music as well as performances. Even those settings like woods, tree house feels kind of wet English and Scottish atmosphere that fits for a devilish mythical charactered movie like this. I regret for reviewing it so delayedly, but anyway I did it and over it, so I hope you watch it very soon as well if you haven't seen it yet.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"56e6fae292514143f3001c6f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56e6fae292514143f3001c6f","movie_id":149509}
{"author":"furious_iz","content":"I was looking forward to this film going into it, based on a highly entertaining book, but ultimately it was just okay.\r\n\r\nWell shot and directed, Daniel Radcliffe is the best thing about it, but it lacked the punch and dark humour of the novel. Juno Temple's character feels painfully underwritten, as do most of the 2nd tier characters. The worst part is it takes itself way too seriously for such a silly premise. There is some destructive chaotic fun, but not enough of it. The creature design for the finale is very cool, then the film just sort of stops rather than giving a satisfying wrap up. \r\n\r\nCould have, should have been much better, maybe that's my fault because I was expecting more.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> As a father, as a husband, he stood for their defence.\r\n\r\nOne of the final movies of a fine actor of our time, Paul Walker. Small budget movie, only because of the story that did not require a grand setting and spectacular graphics. The whole film takes place inside a hospital and a very few external shots glued to the narration in pieces to make an exciting tale. Its his back to back after 'Vehicle 19' which also had a limited cast. At least he and his directors with writers proved these kind of small movies has an equal level of interesting materials to the grand ones. So it's about how you make one with all the finite resources and the rest is left to the people who decides its fate.\r\n\r\nA trans-apocalyptic movie. Due to the circumstance where the story happens, there's no proper explanation for everything. Obviously leaves some doubts concerning the main plot, but what the story tells is the basic instinct of survival of any species of our world. So in this film all about stay alive and protect your loved ones or die trying.\r\n\r\nWhat a father's, at a time a husband's role should be when his family completely depends him. That's what the story where a man stands between his family and the hurdles that coming his way. Not a fancy visual film, but an entertaining thriller-drama gives extreme nail-biting moments with less talks and more in actions.

The casting was very interesting. I hadn't seen William McNamara (_Doing Time on Maple Drive, Copycat, Stag_) in ages and found his performance good. Judson Birza did a great job in one of his earliest roles. They had a real sassy cat who is voiced by Dee Wallace (_E.T. Cujo_).

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Oh, the irony that is the interval! You only have to feel sorry for Mohamad Issack. He has made a film that has been certified by the Guinness World Records as the longest uncut film but his very achievement is tarnished by the fact that the film is cut (read stopped) midway by the theatre operator for the interval.\r\n\r\nIn fact, indirectly, this very act is a statement on the significance of Issack's efforts. Watching the film, we realize that it isn't ambition or the subject of his movie that has necessitated this attempt but the need for such a gimmick to attract an unsuspecting viewer. This is novelty for novelty's sake, nothing more.\r\n\r\nThe film's plot heavily draws on Karthik Subburaj's trendsetting Pizza. If the latter film had an individual trapped in a lonely mansion that has a ghost, here it is four characters who are scared to death by a ghost in a house. The difference is that while Vijay Sethupathi was the protagonist there, here, the victims are all corrupt men, who distribute expired medicines and murder those who try to expose them. There is also a twist towards the end, as in the earlier film. And, like Pizza, this one too has been shot on a shoe-string budget.\r\n\r\nBut the comparisons end there. While Karthik Subburaj's film is a dazzling example of what a director with a command over his craft can do with a minimal budget, Agadam is a cautionary tale that proves that while digital has made it possible for anyone to make a film, not everyone should make one. This is an unnecessarily over-long film with a sloppy script, amateur performances, shoddy camerawork, template music and unintentionally funny sequences, with not a single redeeming feature (no, the longest shot doesn't count). The only horror here is not the one the characters experience but what we, the audience, undergo.","id":"53bb152c0e0a26198400026e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bb152c0e0a26198400026e","movie_id":260739}
{"author":"SunParakeet","content":"Yes, this film is, though you may not suspect it at first, about our broken relationship with nature. The city is the bad place, technology is bad, and nature is good and pure. And you can be sure that this message is not handled with any subtlety - at all.\r\n\r\nBut, I loved this film. And not just because of its magnificent images or because of its brilliantly cute character design.\r\n\r\nThe message of the film may be an old one and one we have heard many times before. But the way it is shown is unique and utterly impressive. I sat in the cinema today and cried, which I did not do for a very long time. Yes, it is very emotional and extremely passionate, and also relentlessly honest. I was ashamed and deeply sad when I left the theater. And because of its honesty I love it. And because there is truth in this message, there is no way around it. We hurt and destroy our world. And how can we bear seeing this cute boy watching all these grown-ups acting like this, destroying this wonderful, wonderful nature? We can't. And there is a reason why we can't. I think it is because we know that it is wrong.\r\n\r\nWell, you'll have to experience it for yourself. Please do.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> We live gloriously, but we won't let the world.\r\n\r\nThe film was nominated at the 88th American Academy Awards for best animated feature and lost to 'Inside Out', but won one at Annie Awards out of three nominees. Originally from Brasil, a 80 minutes long, I mean short film, excluding the opening and end credits which makes it even shorter. The tale was told with the beautiful visuals and music, without any dialogues to reach the audience making no complication. Because it was not just an entertainer, but a message bearer.\r\n\r\nThe animation type was simple, yet awesome. All the drawings were done by the director himself. Totally colourful crayons sketches. It was supposed to be a documentary, but later became a feature film. The story about a boy who lives with his parents in the rural growing up loving all the wonders of the nature. He observes the changing world as his father bids a goodbye to him to look for a better job in the city, but never returned. So the curious little kid who loves his father very much takes us an adventure when industrial revolution taking place. The rest of the film tells whether he finds what he's looking for.\r\n\r\nThere were many animations got released in the same year, but this film got the Oscars nod because of the strong message. Especially in the present world this kind of film brings more awareness to the people. It focused the theme man destroying the beautiful world for the profit and dumping the waste everywhere. I am sure you might have seen several documentary films on this topic, but this one was different which was somewhat close to 'Earth 2100'. Although it talks about the past and present than the distant future.\r\n\r\nThe pollution was one of the biggest concerns today and nobody cares to curb it. The industrial revolution is not defining our progressive, but threatening to our future generation. Besides the poors are directly affected by the loss of the employment. The human development in on the right direction, but the path we have chosen was not. So by now you know it is not for just the kids. The film offers a lot for adults to learn from it than the children. But surely a film to them both watch together and have a good time.\r\n\r\nAt one point, for a quick, a few real clips were shown to let us know what the real world looks like after such thing happened as it was shown in the film. I loved the comparison between the city and the rural, from lifestyle, fading culture to everything. The real heartbreaking scene is when the boy revisits his old place to learn it is destroyed. Surely we all have similar kind of experience in our life about the place we had admired some time ago is now completely ruined.\r\n\r\nIt might have not won the Oscar or not popular as the one won, but definitely not ignorable film. All the other four nominees stood behind creativity and entertainment, but this one was with dual intention and it succeeded. It wins our heart more than any prestigious awards in the world, yet I agree the awards leads to the wider recognisation. So I urge everybody to watch it sooner or later, but never to miss it. It is not your Disney, Pixer or Ghibli films, but surely you would enjoy it. I don't know the director, but I think if he resumes with the same intensity for the future projects, he would definitely become the South American Tomm Moore with his unique animation and storytelling.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"57951ff192514142a4004604","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57951ff192514142a4004604","movie_id":223706}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The Men's version of the movie TEETH.\r\n\r\nClearly I was delaying this watch for over the past couple of years. Finally, I ended watching it during this holiday season (December 2015). I am glad to get over with it and sad for dragging it this far, because the film was not that bad as I have heard.\r\n\r\nMay be we call it the men's version of the movie 'Teeth'. Since the sexual intercourse is kind of complication for the theme from this movie to draw a better storyline, they have introduced a fictional character that detachable from the human body. That is very funny as well as disgusting.\r\n\r\nThis horror-comedy was average, but very enjoyable and better than being a worse. It was a short flick and had a surprise twist and turns, but the quality to excite us is what's missing. Had a decent story, but the scenes that constructed were not top notch. Being a B movie is that why it passes the flaws' test because of the restricted budget and for not having a top star in the lead. Simply one time watch movie and nothing a big deal about it.\r\n\r\n5\/10","id":"568a2c16c3a36828f5020aee","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/568a2c16c3a36828f5020aee","movie_id":172828}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Good lie, bad words and ugly truth.\r\n\r\nI thought it was Cliff Curtis' movie because that's whom I saw in one of the posters. Anyway, it's Jason Bateman's movie, which is also his first directional venture. A refreshing theme because only a very few movies were made based on the spelling bee contest, but this one was a bit messed up story narration. Most of the narrative looked so pale and dull. It is supposed to be an exciting storytelling with blistering pace.\r\n\r\nYou know, stories in the movies happen with a backdrop of the reasons. Like a piece of uninteresting wood carved into a something that attracts everybody. Some movie holds it till the end to reveal that beauty in the form of a twist, but some won't mind explaining it along the way. In this movie, what they had for the twist was lifeless, boring one, more like a clich\u00e9 from the older days flick.\r\n\r\nThe boy from the movie 'Jack and Jill' was decent. I felt some material in the movie was inappropriate regarding a minor in one of the lead roles. But I know the title clearly suggests it is only for adults. Understandable that the writer wanted to give something new, but he could not get it right. Maybe lacked to bring some interesting and inspiring elements. What surprised me was, it was not either for commercial benefit nor a fine art piece.\r\n\r\nAll the way I knew something was not clinching and finally found out the approach to portray the main character in the negative mode had to do with something. They wanted the viewers to go against him and well, they got it in a way. Interestingly the screenplay was from the 'Black List' which was untouched for almost 10 years. Unfortunately Bateman decided to give it a try and the result is,... Here I'm with not satisfied fully, but okay-okay movie for being at least something different.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"559d7665c3a3686591000330","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/559d7665c3a3686591000330","movie_id":209403}
{"author":"ArkhamKnightRider","content":"Another Me is a movie that I expected to think either nothing of or despise. After watching Dark Phoenix, I was curious to delve deeper into Sophie Turner's other work and this one intrigued me the most. However, its 2.2 average score on Letterboxd and the very low audience score on rotten tomatoes worried me.\r\n\r\nWhen I watched it though for the first time last month, I loved it but didn't grasp everything fully. However, when I watched it today with Will Walker (who had not seen it until today), I got a better grasp and loved it even more.\r\n\r\nThe story is admittedly a complex one that does require the audience to pay constant attention to it. There is a lot of foreshadowing and symbolism that fills this movie.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest pieces of foreshadowing though is the scar on Fay's hand that she made to differentiate her from Lily. This matters since it is an indicator to tell who Fay is and who Lily is. Speaking of Lily, she is Fay's twin who was killed as the result of a disease that forced her and Fay's father, Don, to sacrifice one of them. This results in lily becoming an angered spirit who drives both Fay and Don to insanity. Her main goal is to rob Fay of her life and get what she feels she deserves and she actually succeeds. there is no dumb fairy tale finale in which Fay wins the day and overcomes Lily. The movie ends like it should, depressing and haunting.\r\n\r\nIn a way, Lily symbolizes Fay's descent into madness. Lily causes Fay to see her which causes her paranoia to reveal dark aspects about her parents, especially her mother, Ann, who has been cheating on her disabled husband with Fay's drama teacher. Fay then confronts her mother about this and Ann then tells Fay that she will not sleep with him again. Of course, Ann is later shown to have lied as she was then pointed out by the police to be in the car with the drama teacher when Lily mortally wounded him.\r\n\r\nFay seems to be more attached to her father, Don since he not only seems more understanding between him and Ann, but near the end, reveals to Fay that he can also see Lily as well. He even tries to stop Fay from seeing lily, in fear of Lily stealing Fay. Fay though thinks that she can resolve this whole thing and storms out of the room. This impulsive decision results in her not only being consumed by Lily, but lead to her father's death, when he goes on a faulty elevator which was established as such earlier on.\r\n\r\nThe acting is without a doubt my favorite part of this movie. The two best performances are thankfully the two that needed to be amazing. Sophie Turner is phenomenal as Fay and makes her character extremely likable and realistic. The one i was surprised by the most was Rhys Ifans( who some may know as the stupid looking Goomba Lizard in the Amazing Spider Man) as Don. Unlike his meh performance in that movie, here is he is allowed to actually act and really sells his disability which is extremely hard to do without being so over the top that it becomes a joke ( i am looking at you What\u2019s Eating Gilbert Grape for having Leo portray the most offensive version of someone on the spectrum).\r\n\r\nThe cinematography completely took me back since i was totally ready for the same level of pigshit camerawork, editing and lighting from horrid turds like Slender Man or Bye Bye Man. Instead i got lighting that embraced the tone of each scene perfectly, camera work that was flawless and had the best use of shaky cam since 28 Days Later and had coherent editing that was able to communicate it's story without me getting a headache or boring me to death. The music is really great to and helps build the correct tone.\r\n\r\nOverall, Another Me is a quite overlooked masterpiece that is worth your time. I will say it is very hard to find without paying a hefty price for a physical copy. However if you have the 3.99 for a digital copy or go on a bizarre streaming site( and like me, hopefully find a site that can convert the link into a mp4 file), do so as soon as possible.","id":"5d660d1258361b001221b671","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d660d1258361b001221b671","movie_id":252529}

Through those days what she learns and how it comes to end leads to the final segment of the story.\r\n\r\nWell intended story, but a bit lacks the cheerfulness.

Visually, its stunning on its own way, surely an impressive animation, but overall film was short as 80 minutes. Adapted from a children's novel and beautifully made.\r\n\r\nFor me, I think they should have been a bit careful. There's nothing problem in the story, sketches or in the pace, but the overall flow was not sparkling enough like those Hollywood counterparts. Other than those tiny stumbles, this is a fine animation, especially being a non North America, Europe and Japan product.

Specially made movie for tween kids, definitely they gonna enjoy. For adults, it is like a spoof and kids' version of the Spiderman movie. Yeah, it was kinda inspired by the Spiderman movie so they gave right credit by mentioning it in the story.\r\n\r\nMost of the modern Danish movies I saw were very impressive. They take challenging subjects and carve into a great piece. It is a lookout film industry like South Korea. So I laid my on this movie when I saw the first teaser as I am a children movie fan. This was a good movie, but as a middle aged man this did not work for me.\r\n\r\nThe kids gave their best, many were debuted with this so it's their first experience to perform in front of the camera. It's clearly visible their amateur acting skills. Only experience can teach and improve them on this field. For a maiden movie they have done a decent job except lack in facial expression in different situation of the story.\r\n\r\nThe first Danish superhero movie based on the children's book. This movie was very short, runs for less than 80 minutes, so it was the reason it did not bore me. As a superhero movie, there's not enough stunts in it. Looks like they kept it low to target little kid's audience. Even the story was also familiar, only characters were derived.

When I saw the movie poster with that building the background, I thought the movie would be something like 'White House Down' which will be defended against the terrorist takeover\/attack.

It was a crime-thriller which was based on the real story.\r\n\r\nThe sudden variation in scenes and the character behaviors kind of  incompetence to keep balanced everything in the story progress. Inspired by a real event is what kept my interest all the way. Suppose it was fictional that was written for the movie I would have said the writer was confused between character to build and story development.\r\n\r\nOn the other side the performances promised to conclude the movie on a high note and it does. One of it was Dwayne Johnson, actually it was not his movie, but his part was a highlight alongside Liam Hemsworth and Michael Angarano.

The casting is over the top superb. The screen writing is well done - believable and draws you in immediately. It is intense, yet fun; full of conflict, yet loving. The use of irony throughout is extremely effective - just when you think you have it figured out, they flip you upside down and take you with them. The most important thing I appreciate about this film is that it is wholesome and honors what is right. There are no language or modesty issues or inappropriate scenes.

For her, it is just life as it is.\r\n\r\nAnyway, a movie to pass a good time, with the spicy addition of the mixed languages and (western) cultures which have always made this series something special, although it is clearly addressed to the 70's - early 80's born western generation with a comfortable economic position.","id":"56a1f927c3a3683413008889","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56a1f927c3a3683413008889","movie_id":206408}

He wants to make a different story but someone tells him that he should instead tell a love story in a different way as love stories are so popular.\r\n\r\nKishore watches Telugu romance movies from the last 70 years but is unable to gain true inspiration from these. One day he goes to a park and talks to a college professor named Apparao Aggarwal (Sayaji Shinde) who tells him a love story that he witnessed between a boy and a girl in his communications class.\r\n\r\nShyam (Varun Sandesh) and Anshu (Sanchita Padukone) have a group of common friends. One day Apparao sees Anshu get off Shyam's motorcycle and asks Shyam if there is something between them. They say no, and soon all the students and professors in the college know what Apparao said. Everyone humiliates Apparao and he vows to make Anshu and Shyam actually fall in love with each other and get his prestige back. Apparao's many attempts to make them love each other (including sending a love letter to Anshu as Shyam) end up failing and he is humiliated over and over again until he finally gives up.\r\n\r\nOne day when Anshu, Shyam and their friends go to Cudappah the boys meet a bird photographer who says that beauty is in the heart and not in the body. Shyam then realizes that although he wants to get married to someone who looks like Katrina Kaif, he should love not the body but the heart. He then sees Anshu and realizes that he is in love with her. After returning from Cudappah, Shyam tries to convince Anshu to love him and finally succeeds. They both get engaged but for a reason that Apparao doesn't know they break up before marriage.\r\n\r\nKishore tracks down Shyam and asks him why he broke up with Anshu. Shyam explains that after the engagement, he had to go to Bangalore for 6 months for job related reasons. There he met his boss, Sunaina (Catherine Tresa) who he got attracted to since she looks like Katrina Kaif. After 3 months, Anshu came for a surprise visit and found out about Shyam's relationship with Sunaina and, thinking that he is having an affair with her. She reveals that the actual reason she came to Bangalore was that Shyam forgot her birthday. Afterwards Shyam went to Anshu's house many times and begged her for mercy.\r\n\r\nKishore now sends Shyam to Bangalore to meet Sunaina. Shyam, Sunaina, and Shyam's parents come to Anshu's house to call off the engagement and announce that Sunaina and Shyam are getting married. Anshu then gets angry at Shyam and asks Sunaina what guarantee she has that Shyam won't cheat on her. Sunaina responds by saying that Shyam and Sunaina were merely friends and it was Anshu who had left Shyam, and not the other way. Shyam then takes out Anshu's wedding ring, which she had thrown at Shyam when she came to Bangalore. He asks Anshu if she will marry him. Anshu now realizes that this was all a scheme to get Anshu to marry Shyam. She accepts. Apparao and Kishore come in from their hiding spot. Sunaina congratulates Kishore for his brilliant idea. Kishore is happy that his movie has been completed. Apparao suggests that he name his movie \"Chammak Challo\", which means beautiful girl.","id":"559740aac3a36855ed000701","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/559740aac3a36855ed000701","movie_id":307722}
{"author":"Karen Francis","content":"\"CHRISTMAS RIDE\" A GREAT MOVIE ANY TIME \r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS RIDE takes the viewer on a journey reaching beyond its plot line.  First, it beguiles with fresh faces and a surface simplicity one might expect from an independent production birthed in Tennessee.  Second, it charms with more twists and turns than a bumpy Southern country backroad.  Third,  it pulls out all stops and hits one into the bleachers with its mix of ever-so-human, humor and heartbreak.   \r\n\r\nThis feature film is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America.  The Dove Foundation gave it the highly coveted Faith and Family Seals, Ages 12+.   If the National Department of Transportation awarded films for motivating safer driving habits, this movie \r\nwould be a sure thing for top honors.  \r\n\r\nThe film resonates with the tragedy of loved ones loss to reckless driving and war.   We face truth and consequences, buckled up right along with the main characters.   On another level, we witness the challenges to faith such devastating horrors evoke.     \r\n\r\nThe movie turns the clock back twenty-five years ago, when ubiquitous cell phones were barely on the drawing board.   But single parenting was already a reality.  A parent could talk to teens for hours about the importance of look before you leap, or the consequences of irresponsible behavior, and not make the point half as well as this movie does.   Yet, thankfully, the movie includes some unexpected fun moments.  \r\n\r\nWith multi generational appeal, CHRISTMAS RIDE steers clear of the commercial, sugary sweet side of Christmas.  It tells a true story of supernatural intervention in everyday lives.  \r\n\r\nThe 108 minute movie is ready in a 2K Digital Cinema Print format for cinemas.  It successfully screened during the trials in Los Angeles County and became an Academy Award Qualified film.  \r\n\r\nInformation about the talented stars and music in CHRISTMAS RIDE is on IMDb.com and artprofilms.com.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Exhausted, barely hanging for the sake of love.\r\n\r\nThe story was told by an escaped Jewish from the Auschwitz concentration camp controlled by the German Nazi during the second world war. Obviously the film was based on the history, so the story must be true, but I feel there are some fictional accounts as well. Because it was the first called 'Colette: A Girl from Antwerp' from the three book series about three Jewish women. The author Arnost Lustig was the victim of the war crime and it was his story. All the confuse is for the male lead character named Vili Feld, not Arnost Lustig.\r\n\r\nIt was a decent as a movie and one of the terrifying world war 2 horror as a story. Those who survived that outrage was lived to tell the stories, and just imagine how many more stories have not made its accounts. Despite it was about a young woman called Colette Cohen, the tale was narrated by Vili Feld by recollecting his memories of the prison camp events. Colette is the one he has fallen for. He gives up an easy job just to see her everyday. His secret love, suffering during held and deaths around, all these are the story's main ingredient told in a margin of the thin line between good and bad.\r\n\r\nVili lived all his life looking for the reason for the some unanswered questions. Being in the prison and having an affair was like a chess game. The story was also told in a similar fashion, like pawns moving all around from both the sides and sacrificing a few to win the game. Ultimately, how the game was set up for the grand finale was ended casually before the original timeline's end come into the effect. Survival was the main intention, especially the King and the Queen in the chess format to say. That's the reason the deaths around, I mean the pawn sacrifices were not heartbreaking that we see easily throughout the film.\r\n\r\n> The greatest thing a person could ever do...\r\n> Is to save someone's life.\r\n\r\nTechnically, it sounded a great; photography, editing, music all were depicted the 40s era precisely as for our knowledge of understanding. The performances were too not bad at all, but it was the second string end that looked so stupid. No complain if it was accurate to the real occurrence, though there are not enough evident to prove or the movie won't tell much at the end. In a such cruelty related theme I can't believe the shortfall of emotions and rawness. The screenplay was nearly comparable to the dark comedy, having a brutal war in the backdrop. It focused lots of thriller, but there are equally cool moments that actually calms. As a result, it seems not true to the novel, but borrows certain pages from the book, especially heavily on the romance bits and ignores everything else.\r\n\r\nAfter watching the whole film, still doubt remained with me in certain parts of the narrative. Maybe I need to have one more look, appears to be something I missed. The film, coming from a country like the Czech Republic is really remarkable effort, especially for it in the English language which makes the world look to on this direction. There's no argument about the international standards, the original touch is what's needed because I felt many scenes were directly inspired by the other second world war flicks. Other than that it was very close to 'Life is Beautiful', except it was not a comedy. Worth for a single time watch like any plot that related to this filthy war the man forever regretted for.\r\n\r\n6.5\/10","id":"5592c1a692514152cc00159f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5592c1a692514152cc00159f","movie_id":256120}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> When a reform camp becomes a torture chamber...\r\n\r\nThe concept was inspired by the real, but I was not expecting a camp like this practically exist. I mean, I'm familiar with juvenile detention and reform centres, not something like this. It was more like an another American thing, especially for kids with the tough attitude and of course who are a junkie. The institution is not the issue, but privatisation was the.\r\n\r\nYou might have heard it a million times that PJ Boudousque was looked alike Ryan Gosling. I thought he was related to him, but he was not. Anyway, it was a perfect launch, might have not an overwhelmed movie, but he got a chance to appear in a proficient role for the first time in front of the camera.\r\n\r\nA fair quality product for half a million budgets. Slightly a weak narration, especially after a fine first and third act, I felt something was missing in between. I was anticipating a strong conclusion, but it was way stronger and unexpectedly a violent just like 'Bellflower'.

{"author":"LastCaress1972","content":"David and Mia are brother and sister. As children, they vacationed in the family cabin, far out in the woods. As they got older, David took off, leaving Mia caring for their sick and ultimately dying mother. When mum threw a seven, Mia went downhill, and hit the class \"A\"'s. She hit the drugs so hard in fact that she even technically died at one point, only to be brought back from the brink in a quite portentous bit of backstory. Well, enough's enough. David's back, and he, his girlfriend Natalie, and a couple more close mates of theirs, Eric and Olivia, intend to take her up to the old family cabin in the woods and force her to go cold turkey for a weekend. That'll learn her.\r\n\r\nWhat's the deal with these cabins in American films and shows and whatnot? They always seem to be miles away from any recognisable civilisation. Do the owners own the land, and just decide to build a log cabin? How does one just take ownership of a patch of forest out in the middle of nowhere? I mean, they're never in a larger holiday park environment that's regularly patrolled and maintained. They're never one of a dozen by a beautiful lake, with neighbours here and there. No, they're always out in the deep wild nothing. It's like holidaying in a shed. Who'd do that? Also, the property is ripe for other people to just break in and use the place for their own nefarious ends: Free holiday? Crystal meth flop-house? Sex dungeon? A serial murderer's kill-room?\r\n\r\nKandarian demon incantations, resurrections and exorcisms?\r\n\r\nUnluckily for our merry bunch of interventionists, that's exactly what's been going on down in the cellar of their cabin. Mia - hypersensitive as a result of her withdrawal - and the dog they've brought along can smell... well, a bad smell in the house. Upon investigation they find the cellar door, and through the cellar into another door they find a room full of skinned dead cats and similar small animals, all hanging off the ceiling by meat hooks. There's something else: A package wrapped in black bags, further enclosed in barbed wire. Someone obviously didn't want this package opened. Well, curiosity seems to have killed a bunch of cats already, and now it's going to have a crack at these guys. They open the package and, of course, it's The Book of The Dead. The tape player from the 1981 original is gone but in this version, fragments of the Kandarian script have been translated and written in English. And when they're read out, all hell breaks loose in soul-swallowingly familiar fashion. One by one, we will take you.\r\n\r\nI liked this film, but it's a frustrating beast, for sure. On the one hand, it's as gory as f*ck, the sound design is superb, the movie is strewn with nods to both The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (1987) without those nods seeming too hokey and the actors, whilst not especially outstanding, are at least as effective as the original cast (Bruce Campbell excepted, of course. There is no adequate substitution for him here and, in fairness to the new film, how could there be?). On the other hand... look: The \"intervention\" plotline was a great reason for the group going up into an isolated place, and it continued as a great device for when Mia started seeing and experiencing crazy Evil Deaddery (the woods-raping-the-girl scene from the Raimi original? It's back, baby! Sort-of); they put it down to her withdrawal. At best, she's lying so's they can all go home and she can get munted. At worst, she's bugging out. Except that, very early on in the proceedings, following Mia's insistence that there was a smell in the house, the boys, David and Eric (David, Eric, Mia, Olivia, Natalie. Cool, no? No.) discover the cat-swinging signs of foul witchcraft in the cellar (which we the viewers are privy to in the very first scene btw, before we even meet our protagonists), meaning they no longer have to put the weirdness down to Mia having a cold turkey episode. Just leave the premises, call it in at the nearest cop-shop, job done. So why don't they do this?\r\n\r\nBecause the characters in Evil Dead are prone to making some of the most pinheaded decisions I've seen in a horror film in maybe twenty years. And horror as you all know is a genre beset with characters who make pinheaded decisions, right? Well, the Evil Dead quintet make the average bunch of Camp Crystal Lake dirty-weekenders look like astro-physicists. I don't want to give away specific set-pieces but these characters seemed to have opportunity after opportunity to get away from what was happening to them. Their dunderheaded refusal to do anything but stumble towards their own demise caused me to lose any and all sympathy for them, and when you stop caring, the tension disappears down the plughole. While we were watching the movie, my missus said at one point: \"Yeah, but if they did that (ie the right thing), there wouldn't be a film, would there?\" But, in this day and age (and with the superior budget and skills availed to these remakes), I'm not prepared to buy that. There needs to be more. And in this case, the \"intervention\" plotline at the very beginning of the movie seemed to kick things off on the right note. It was the last decision by the characters that made any logical sense. The end fell apart too, but don't virtually all horrors unravel in the final fifteen? It certainly seems that way.\r\n\r\nStill, I liked it, as I said. Didn't love it as I really hoped that I would, but I liked it. I suppose. In a way. Anyone not into horror will not come anywhere near anyway, but lovers of all things gruesome will find Evil Dead an entertaining waste of a nice and crisp ninety minutes. You'll see not even a modicum of common sense on display, but then that's not why you came, is it?","id":"5207aece760ee308b2768d99","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5207aece760ee308b2768d99","movie_id":109428}

Is it fair to say that even before it was released there were those hating it? It certainly seemed that way. \r\n\r\nCan you judge this piece of horror film making on its own terms? Are there a new breed of horror film fans out there whom haven't seen Raimi's trilogy and therefore can go into it and get the tar shocked out of them?

Full of jumps, guts, gore, and genuine moments of terror, with Fede Alvarez and his team adding some fresh touches to Raimi's original nightmare. \r\n\r\nIt is what it is, a horror remake of an old favourite that ramps up the horror and uses the tools available to splinter the ears - turn the stomach - and fray the nerves.

{"author":"kineticandroid","content":"Allow me to start with what you likely have already read \u2014 this film is well-crafted and tense procedural about a true story. The fact that I still found it tense and exciting, even when I already knew the ending (including the oft-mentioned Captain Phillips ending scene) is a high compliment.\r\n\r\nSo why tell this story? I took it as a meditation on powerlessness, a film that didn't deal with heroes or villains, only victims. There's a shipping crew that is easily sought out by pirates, and there are the pirates that ultimately fail. In either case, it's not as if either side feels in control of their destiny. They're just playing to some largely unseen authority. After the crew deflects the first attempted piracy in the film, one character says that as a union member, he didn't sign up for this kind of danger. The reaction? He chose to work on a ship that went around the horn of Africa. \"What did you expect?\" he's asked. Later, when one of the pirates steps on broken glass and injures he foot, he's asked the very same question by his leaders. Even the two competing captains \u2014 the pirate and the title character \u2014 ultimately are swayed (or saved) by the power of the state. What did they expect? To be the one in control?","id":"53a4dcc40e0a26143900058e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53a4dcc40e0a26143900058e","movie_id":109424}
{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"Let me begin by saying that Captain Phillips, as an action film, turned out to be much more than I had initially anticipated. I was expecting half drama \/ half moderate action film with likely a good dash of political hopscotch. It's probably a good thing then, that I knew next to nothing about the actual story, because I love a good surprise. Captain Phillips is two hours of absolutely intense and absolutely uncompromising physical and psychological anxiety. At the end of it, I literally had to sit for a minute and just breathe, because this story gripped me by the throat like few films in recent memory have.\r\n\r\nFor those still unfamiliar with the story \u2013 this is a retelling of a historical event; the first US cargo ship in 200 years to be hijacked by pirates. During which, its captain Richard Phillips is taken hostage by the pirates, on his own lifeboat no less.\r\n\r\nI got the sense that, somewhere in between the lines it was the director's intention to perhaps create an opening for a different story to be told: that of the Somali pirates, and why they do what they do. We are told that they are fishermen, and sheer poverty has driven them to these desperate acts. However, I don't know for sure if I'm supposed to feel any sympathy for these men, if I was supposed to 'understand' their motives \u2013 if this was Paul Greengrass' intention, it didn't work. Because no matter which way you swing it, these pirates are the bad guys and that's as clear as day. No degree of poverty or despair should be held as an excuse for such gruesome acts. Then again, if this was at all the point, I'm glad it wasn't hammered down in any way. It was merely a thought, and one conveyed subtly enough for anyone to make up their own mind about this issue.\r\n\r\nWhat is clear here, is that these men (only four of them, surprisingly) committed a terrible crime. Not even so much the piracy itself, but the kidnapping and abuse of one individual. This individual is played by Tom Hanks, and he delivers one of his most eloquent and restrained performances to date. Here is a man, a captain of a large cargo ship, who is usually very much in control of his life and a clearheaded leader of his crew \u2013 but who, in the heat of reality, is just as human as any of us and simply does the best he can, even when (in spite of overwhelming protocol) one simply doesn't know what to do. Because protocol doesn't apply to the emotions that take control of both the captain and his captors, when they face a situation none of them anticipated. This is immediately one if my favourite performances by Tom Hanks, whose strength here lies mostly in the quiet moments in between all the chaos surrounding him. You can tell that he never stops thinking, never stops analyzing his situation, no matter what the pirates do to intimidate him. He conveys it all in the eyes \u2013 all the fear and anxiety, while constantly staying calm and collected, trying to talk to his captors, never losing his head. Even when fighting for his life, there is an assertive calmness that comes across so strongly that you can do nothing but admire this man. Hanks' performance is so convincing, it almost doesn't look like acting anymore... and that's a huge compliment.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for the other actors, especially the men playing the Somali pirates. Before being cast for this film, none of them had any acting experience, which makes their performances all the more impressive. Then, it also makes one wonder how much of a compliment it actually is when a director literally picks you off the street because apparently he thinks that you're perfectly fit for the part of a menacing pirate, but that's food for another discussion, another time... In any case, he was right about them. These men ARE absolutely convincing and authentic. Especially the leader of the gang, played by Barkhad Abdi, is right on the money. He needs nothing more than the look in his eyes to convince you that you're right to feel absolutely terrified of him.\r\n\r\nFrom a technical standpoint, Captain Phillips is very well made. My only grievance is Greengrass' typical trademark: the shaky handy-cam. Here and there it's almost enough to make you seasick, and I really wish he would ease up on this gimmick, because although it adds to the feeling of suspense and chaos, that doesn't weigh up to the headache it causes. Steady-cam was invented for a reason, mister director. Use it. Still, the other qualities of the film are easily strong enough to make up for this one point of critique. The pacing is excellent, it grips you like a pitbull and never lets go until the credits roll in. Colouring and lighting effects are perfectly used for an incredibly realistic feel and claustrophobic atmosphere. Everything feels very real and absolutely no sentimental plot devices are exploited here. Top-notch screen writing.\r\n\r\nI can do nothing other than strongly recommend this film. It is very intense and at times very violent, and definitely one of the best films in its genre. And if this doesn't convince you, see it for one of Tom Hanks' best performances of his career.\r\n_(December 2014)_","id":"58a9b9db9251417421009c6f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58a9b9db9251417421009c6f","movie_id":109424}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"It was a loooong time since I watched the original Carrie movie. I was never a real fan of the original. I thought it took too long to get going and the ending was too tragic. But then, I was rather young when I watched it. Yesterday I sat down and watched the remake.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I found it surprisingly good. Sure, the actual story of the movie with the poor girl being bullied by these school assholes, or in particular one asshole, cannot be said to be a story that really appeals to me. It is a rather depressing and frustrating story to say the least. It is a movie that, I myself at least, watched for the outbreaks of telekinetic special effects.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I think that both Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore made commendable performances. Especially Julianne Moore who really made me riled up and squirm from frustration in my seat when she got started with her insane religious nonsense.\r\n\r\nA remake is of course always at somewhat of a disadvantage in that you already know the general story and thus pretty much know what is going to happen. Thus I liked that they had splattered outbursts of telekinetic powers (= special effects) fairly liberally also in the early parts of the movie. I do not remember that Carrie was showing very much of her powers until the very end in the original. For me this made the movie more interesting to watch as it would have been both boring and frustrating if it had been nothing more than the bullies, and Carrie\u2019s crazy mother, harassing Carrie until the very end.\r\n\r\nThe end, well I still think it is a rather sad one. I would have been much happier if Carrie would have gotten her revenge and somehow survived but then, that would have been too much of not-following-the-book instead so I guess I have to live with the depressing ending.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I am positively surprised by the movie. It is a remake that adds modern flavor and special effects without destroying the general look and feel of the original.","id":"53c62c6e0e0a267ffb001cda","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53c62c6e0e0a267ffb001cda","movie_id":133805}

The \u201cgiants\u201d here are prehistoric-like beasts that look like a cross between ankylosaurus, triceratops and an elephant, albeit the size of brontosaurs. Also, the story takes place in the present rather than some fantasy medieval period.\r\n\r\nThese Asylum flicks only cost between $1 million and $2 million, so I was surprised how well done some of the CGI is, like the flying castle and Serena\u2019s palace. Believe it or not, the \u201crealm above the clouds\u201d is actually superior to the one in the blockbuster \u201cJack the Giant Slayer\u201d because this film uses actual locations rather than cartoonish CGI; and the locations are magnificent.\r\n\r\nBoth Jamie Atkins (Jack) and Harry Dyer (Newald) work well as the son\/father protagonists. Ben Cross is also on hand. On the female front, Vicki Glover stands out as Lisa, but not enough is done with her. Jane March plays Serena (the evil queen or whatever) and she still looks good at almost 40 during shooting.\r\n\r\nThe first half of the movie is surprisingly good, but I was let down a bit by the conventional last act where the colossal beasts attack earth with too many reaction shots of the main characters. I would\u2019ve preferred the script focusing on the people and the interesting dynamics thereof.\r\n\r\nYes, some Asylum movies suck, like \"30,000 Leagues Under the Sea\" and \"Mega Piranha.\u201d But some don't, e.g. \"The Land That Time Forgot\" (2009), \"6 Guns\" and \"Grimm's Snow White.\u201d This one may not make the latter list, but it could have if they spent a little more money to draw out the plot\u2019s potential. Nevertheless, it\u2019s not bad for fans of Grade B fantasy adventure flicks.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 27 minutes and was shot in England (Lancashire & Merseyside) and Wales, UK.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+\/B-","id":"5c266d709251413ed4162fb4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c266d709251413ed4162fb4","movie_id":177566}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Medieval fairy tale with a noble hero, a beautiful princess and hordes of barbaric giants***\r\n\r\nReleased in 2013 and directed by Bryan Singer, \u201cJack the Giant Slayer\u201d has plot similarities to 1962\u2019s \u201cJack the Giant Killer\u201d with Nicholas Hoult playing the wholesome farm boy, Eleanor Tomlinson the winsome princess and Ian McShane the king. The rural protagonist slays a couple giants and rescues the royal maiden, but that\u2019s where the similarities between the two movies end. This one lacks an evil wizard and his dark castle, which are substituted by the brutal giants and the colossal beanstalk that leads up to their awesome realm above the clouds.\r\n\r\nDespite the almost $200 million spent mostly on the CGI giants & their world, \u201cJack the Giant Slayer\u201d just isn\u2019t as compelling as \u201cJack the Giant Killer,\u201d which had super-cheesy effects, albeit charming. Yes, the giants & their realm look superb, as far as cartoonish CGI goes, but more time & money needed spent on the characters and their story to hook the viewer. In other words, despite all the action\/adventure and millions blown on CGI, the story\u2019s generally meh.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the flick\u2019s good enough if you favor CGI-laden films like \u201cKing Kong\u201d (2005) and \u201cAvatar\u201d (2009). Hoult and Tomlinson are more-than-worthy as the protagonists with Hoult being reminiscent of Richard Thomas. I just wish the script fleshed them out more and made us care about them and their considerable challenges.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 54 minutes and was shot in England (Surrey, Norfolk & Somerset).

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Me and the kids watched this movie yesterday evening. We all liked it quite a lot. This is a very enjoyable family movie. It is, not surprisingly, a new twist on the old Jack and the Beanstalk story. The basic elements are there, Jack, beans, beanstalks and, of course, giants. A few new elements are thrown in like a Crown to control the giants, a treacherous bastard responsible for the entire mess and a few other things.\r\n\r\nThe giants are very well done. The CGI is good to very good most of the time. As can be expected, it is the giants that make up this movie. I would say that they are slightly scary (for kids) and rather funny at the same time. Unfortunately the same cannot be said about the human actors. The acting is generally not so good and sometimes downright abysmal. It is rather surprising for such a relatively big production to have such poor TV-show quality acting.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that it is a very enjoyable family movie. If you watch it as an adult I guess you must have a liking for special effects and CGI, which I do, in order to enjoy it.","id":"5a584e2cc3a3681e6200409b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a584e2cc3a3681e6200409b","movie_id":81005}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"The Dead End Date!\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I wasn't at all surprised to find that after viewing Jeremy Lovering's \"In Fear\" that the hatred for it on internet sites was large. It's that type of film, a film existing in the horror field of things that can cause mass debate, disappointments for those after a jolting or gory shocker, and yet there's also pleasures that some have found in it. If you have seen it and hate it then there's no need to read on, I got nothing for you, this is purely a review by someone who loved it and hopes that anyone who hasn't seen it may just give it a chance.\r\n\r\nA young couple very early in their courting relationship are driving across rural Ireland to a music festival. After a fraught stop at a local public house, they continue on the journey only to get lost. As night draws in and they appear to go around in circles, they start to get menaced by person or persons unknown and unseen...\r\n\r\nAs anyone who has been in the situation will attest, getting lost in an unfamiliar countryside is no fun, especially when the night falls. \"In Fear\" pitches two young characters (played superbly by Iain De Caestecker & Alice Englert who are reacting naturally) into one such scenario. This is a couple who are only two weeks into their relationship, they don't really know each other do they? So when things start to get tense and scary they are naturally ill at ease with each other's company, they have no idea how to react to what is happening to them - which is continuously ambiguous.\r\n\r\nTwo people in a car in the countryside shouldn't be scary, but it is because things get tense. Things start to happen to them, simple things that suggest an outside force is at work, all while the once pretty scenery has become a menacing backdrop, with the sound work prodding away at our fretful protagonists. Then a third party enters the fray and things get even more ambiguous, but such is the stripped down nature of the pic the nail-biting tension goes up another notch.\r\n\r\nThis is not new horror cinema, in fact it's a little contrived in places, but all the fears on show here are easy to relate to. Both as regards the scary situation and as an early date experience! It's stylishly filmed by Lovering and his cinematographer David Katznelson, with tight close-ups and nifty use of the dark spaces on the country roads turning the tension screws. All of which just leaves the ending, an ending which will either infuriate or baffle you, or conversely have you nodding in admiration at the bare faced cheek of it. 9\/10","id":"5633f507c3a3681b4d017e65","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5633f507c3a3681b4d017e65","movie_id":159095}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A tale of tragic secret affair.**\r\n\r\nI never heard of it, but I found it accidentally and then decided to watch after learning it has a good cast. I mean not that they are the very popular ones right now in the Hollywood, maybe except Elizabeth Olsen, but awesomely played their roles. All the main four characters were very crucial throughout the narration. Like the title say, it was about a secret love affair between a young married woman and her handicapped husband's close friend. In between them, a mother of one of them played an important part in the story that brings a twist in the later part.\r\n\r\nAn affair means, going any extent to achieve what they want for the permanent basis. But not all the affairs, but in this one it gets darker while the story progresses. One thing I liked very much was the tale never intended to label any of its characters as a villain. That balance was so brilliant, but I did not know that, so I always expected something very bad to happen and then, except in one scene which changes the course of the rest of the film. The cinematic feel is there, but it was more like in the real life event.\r\n\r\nNo ones are evil and no ones are heroes, but everyone does all the good and bad things in their life and how serious those harmful acts, particularly how it destroys who are all involved in it was the film excellently told. It was based on the 150 years old French novel. It is also set in at the same time, I mean the 1860s, Paris. The recreation of the era was very good, but my only concern was the pace and the length of the film. Feels boring in some parts, other than that I got no issue with it. Having good actors with a decent direction, still it is like to belong in the B movie category. Though the overall effort from everyone was amazing and that's the reason you should watch it.\r\n\r\n_6.5\/10_","id":"57f413ddc3a3683b7b001707","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57f413ddc3a3683b7b001707","movie_id":172226}
{"author":"kineticandroid","content":"At first, I strongly identified with Llewyn Davis' struggles \u2014 I think you'd be hard pressed to find a musician who doesn't \u2014 but by the film's end, I realize not only how many of those struggles are self-inflicted, I feel as if Llewyn is going to cycle through them many more times before things pick up or bottom out. Musically, Llewyn comes across as scrappy and soulful. He's just the person I'd want singing those sad, world-weary folk songs, at least compared to the cleaner- cut performers he meets throughout the film. And yet, that soul seems to come from tragedies (the suicide of his one-time musical partner) and anxieties (the relationships with family and former lovers) he's too stubborn or poor of spirit to work through properly. He keeps floating by thanks to some enablers. Couches are continually offered for him to sleep on, even after Llewyn insults their owners. A club owner still books him as a performer, even after he is forcibly removed from the club for heckling other performers. It's hard realizing you're in a vicious cycle while you're still inside of it, trying to keep your head above water. It's even harder when connecting with people is as difficult as it is for Llewyn. I feel like the Coen brothers understand that, take it seriously, and yet, from that, created something that made me laugh and engrossed me.","id":"53a4dac40e0a261436000575","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53a4dac40e0a261436000575","movie_id":86829}

{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"Wow... Where do I begin? I just got back from the cinema and I can still feel the adrenaline rushing through me. I was already a huge fan of director Neill Blomkamp's previous effort, District 9, so my expectations were running pretty high. And for once, I was not disappointed. No, I got even more than I could have hoped for.\r\n\r\nElysium is a terrific film. Plain and simple. The story is fairly simple, which I consider a good thing because the plot was easy to follow and so it wasn't overly complex and trying to be too intelligent and contrived. It is the year 2154, and planet Earth is one hot mess. The rich reside on a space station called Elysium while the poor remain on Earth, basically grabbing at every straw just to get by. The story we follow is that of Max, who, after a terrible accident at work, is in dire need of medical help, which is only available at Elysium. In order to get there, he must go to extreme measures. I won't tell you anything else, because that would just spoil the fun.\r\n\r\nMax is played by Matt Damon, and he is very good in this role. He truly carries the film, start to finish. It always pleases me to see an actor who is just as good at tackling the character elements as well as the action parts of his role. When you think about it, that doesn't actually happen that often. Matt Damon can do both perfectly, and he is convincing in every aspect. Jodie Foster plays the role of senator Delacourt, a rich bitch who thinks she can get away with anything just because she calls the shots on Elysium. Well, somebody's about to prove her wrong... I absolutely love Jodie Foster, so it's hard not to gush, but she is a delight to watch. Her character is cold, calculating and without a sliver of conscience. And Jodie is so convincing you just want to slap her. It was great, and the fact that her accent is a little weird and distracting at times, is easily forgiven. William Fichtner also appears in a relatively small, but crucial role.\r\n\r\nThe biggest surprise for me, however, was Sharlto Copley. Remember him from District 9? He played Wikus, a dorky and kind of sissy character... Well, not in this one. His character Kruger, is the meanest, most vile bastard you can imagine. A card-carrying sadistic psycho. It really was a great opportunity for Copley to prove his versatility as an actor, and he used it to the fullest. Also, somehow his South-African twang made his character even more menacing, so I'm really glad he didn't drop it in favour of a \u2013 perhaps more crowd-pleasing \u2013 American accent.\r\n\r\nMy biggest compliment goes to the special effects department. As was the case with District 9, the SFX are so convincing, it's actually hard to realise that you're watching something that was probably 96% computer animated. Unlike D9, the visuals were even better here, if you can believe that. Usually, when a director's first film is a success and they up his budget for the next one, they go completely overboard and essentially ruin the aesthetics that made the first film so successful *cough*Matrix*cough*. In this case, all and everything was a major improvement. The action scenes are incredibly solid, the spacecrafts were eye-poppingly gorgeous (without being all flashy and futuristic \u2013 adding to the reality factor) and Elysium was a true sight to behold. 109 minutes of pure eye candy.\r\n\r\nThere were only two things that slightly bothered me. One, the somewhat stereotypical characterization of the Rich vs. The Poor. Simply put, rich = evil and poor = good, no exceptions. Especially with the rich Elysium folk I found it a little bothersome that there wasn't a single person who seemed to have a heart, they were almost mechanical and so the polarisation was pretty black-and-white. Two, the lack of emotional involvement. I didn't really feel much for any of the characters, except Max. There is a plot line with a woman he has feelings for, whose daughter is very ill, and that's a sad thing but the film failed at really convincing me why I'm supposed to care. Could be personal, but that's the way I experienced it. \r\n\r\nHowever, these two minor plot points are not sufficient enough to deter me from giving this film any less than 10 stars. What I think is most thrilling about Elysium is the fact that it actually paints a frighteningly plausible picture of what our future might just look like. It is, in any case, much more realistic than pretty much every other post-apocalyptic film I've ever seen. Don't write this concept off too easily, this might very well be the world we live in one day.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Elysium is a terrifically made film. It's gritty, it's gnarly and highly realistic. And, to the zero-attention-span MTV kids out there, it's also an incredibly entertaining, action-packed thrill ride. Tiny side note: the violence is quite graphic at times, so some amount of parental guidance is definitely advised. \r\n\r\nThat leaves me with nothing else to say but: go watch this film. You won't regret it.\r\n_(August 2013)_","id":"58ac43e4c3a36849b0011d85","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ac43e4c3a36849b0011d85","movie_id":68724}

{"author":"alcapoon","content":"Cinema is a visually powerful medium. It allows a craftsman to instill thought provoking understanding of some aspects of the social environment around us. A successful filmmaker effectively builds this larger than life cinematographic experience with the use of images, sounds and then post processes and edits them to create a view that sparks an intellectual thought process of emotions.\r\n\r\nOn June 8, 2013, in Toronto, we witnessed Pakistani independent filmmaker Iram Parveen Bilal's endeavor, Josh (English title: Against The Grain) that left us with an experience of empathic closeness to the situations and circumstances portrayed on the screen, nostalgia took over as beautifully shot images of Karachi ran frame by frame on the large screen.\r\n\r\nJosh has an interesting ensemble of some of the finest actors from the Pakistani entertainment industry, who include Aamina Sheikh, Mohib Mirza, Khalid Malik, Navin Waqar, Adnan Shah Tipu, Salim Mairaj, Kaiser Khan Nizamani, Nyla Jafri, Parveen Akbar, Ali Rizvi and Faizan Haqquee.\r\n\r\nJosh is the story of a privileged woman whose life is shattered in a single moment. It is the story of a woman in search for a dangerous truth. It is the story of the biggest challenge to Pakistan's still reigning feudalism: the country's youth. The film explores the internal debates the young are struggling with, and how solutions can be attainable if and when they stand united.\r\n\r\nAamina Sheikh plays the character of Fatima, who is affluent, socially aware and leading a happy life. Fatima's contribution towards society is by teaching at school. Fatima is very close to her nanny Nusrat Bi, whom she considers like her mother. How events related to Nusrat Bi would impact and change the course of life for Fatima is to be seen in Josh.\r\n\r\nAs the camera sets rolling, right from the first frame, one can't miss and not comment on the brilliant camera work and cinematography. The locations, shots and above all the way Karachi has been captured had some viewers commenting, \"I want to go back and see Karachi again\u2026\"\r\n\r\nWhile there is no doubt that it is the brilliance of visual display that initially mesmerizes a film viewer, what makes the cinematographic experience a smooth sailing journey is the strength of the characters portrayed. Everything about Josh looked real, be it scenes from inside an affluent caf\u00e9 to the slums or shanty towns, Iram Parveen Bilal has demonstrated her mastery on the art of creating a visually effective experience.\r\n\r\nJosh delivers the message that one person's passion can stir others from their apathy and become a catalyst of change for others. You can't help others unless they are willing to bring about a change around their lives, that's the catalyst we see at work in Josh.\r\n\r\nThe music of Josh is by veteran musician and composer, Shahi Hasan and his partner Noor Lodhi. In addition to that, the award winning British composer Andrew T. Mackay has been the soul of the score. Top it all with Pakistan's rocking asset Ali Azmat. His song \"Na re na \u2026\" perfectly blends with reinforcing message of Josh. As Iram Bilal puts it, \"I just loved Na re na\u2026. the fact that this song is in the film is an honor, he's a great person and great artist.. we are honored\u2026\"\r\n\r\nIf we are to talk about individual performances, there isn't a single question mark on the performances delivered by the entire cast. Be it versatile names like Kaiser Khan Nizamani or Mohib Mirza to Khalid Malik, everyone made the film look so real. Watch out for the character Gulsher played by Adnan Shah Tipu, he leaves a thought provoking impression of what this character's mind is going through! Responding to our question regarding Aamina Sheikh's selection for the role, Iram Bilal pointed out, \"we auditioned her, there were couple of people we were considering, she took the audition away\u2026\"\r\n\r\nIn the end, Josh is not an average Lollywood dance, romance or action flick. It is a thought provoking film that actually triggers different questions in your mind. The engaging Q&A session with Iram Parveen Bilal after the movie was a proof of the powerful impact Josh left.\r\n\r\nThe audience members had variety of aspects of the film to talk about. Some felt nostalgic, some commented about the close to reality characterization, while some spoke about the struggle of common folk under feudalism, while others commented about the food crisis and how the powerful few could end up controlling our grain!\r\n\r\nWatch Josh this Eid and Youm e Azaadi (Pakistan's National Day) to celebrate Independence through unity. It is a brilliant film!","id":"54c8a25ec3a36879df000fa3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54c8a25ec3a36879df000fa3","movie_id":267745}

{"author":"tmdb55636115","content":"This was probably the first time a movie has made me this angry in the theater.  It pissed me off then and it still pisses me off when it's on television.  If I could summarize this film in one word, it would be: obnoxious.  I wasn't really hyped for this film but I was expecting to have some fun since I did enjoy the previous Iron Man films.  This was the movie that made me start to dislike the character of Tony Stark\/Iron Man (RDJ is still the man though).  Stark's narcissism had charm in the previous films but here, it made him into a complete idiot, dick, and coward. The Mandarin had potential to be an effective villain but the movie scraps him for a more lame villain than Justin Hammer from Iron Man 2.  The comedy was forced and annoying and the story has plot holes that were distracting.  I watched Thor 2 a while after this released but the taste from this movie was so bitter that even though I thought Thor 2 was alright, I just didn't want to see anymore films from this cinematic universe.  This movie is what killed the MCU for me.","id":"596199589251410b860cc5ef","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/596199589251410b860cc5ef","movie_id":68721}
{"author":"Gimly","content":"**A long form review originally posted in 2013**\r\n\r\n_Iron Man 3_ brings us into the so called \u201cPhase 2\u201d of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But it does so in a flawed way. I\u2019ve said it before and reiterate it here, there is no such thing as a perfect film. But since _The Avengers_ set the bar so very high, following that up proved to simply be too much for Black\u2019s entry to handle.\r\n\r\nThere are a great deal of inconstancies, plot holes, stupid moves, illogical choices, and weak moments (though less than much of the internet would have you believe). These issues are not enough to lead to _Iron Man 3\u2019s_ complete and utter downfall, but they do force a sour taste into the piece overall.\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s a bad movie though. In fact it\u2019s actually quite good. It surpasses the quality of _Iron Man 2_ and plants itself firmly in the MCU rather successfully. A move which only _The Incredible Hulk_ failed to make, but still. Yes it has its problems, yes we\u2019d hoped for better, and yes I\u2019ve got complaints, but the movie is not at all a failure. Manages to come full circle in a way that still leaves Tony Stark & Iron Man a future in the Marvel Universe.\r\n\r\nShane Black and Drew Pearce manage to bring in a sense of vulnerability that was barely touched on in the past MCU works. Even the minuscule Steve Rogers of _Captain America_ seemed in control of every situation. But here we see Tony Stark as not only a breakable man, but a man in general. The most human of any Super Hero appearance in the MCU to date. Yes the Robert Downey Jr. wit that all have come to expect from the piece is still on the table, but in between and beneath that there\u2019s an insomniac with extreme anxiety disorders living separated from the real world, too invested in his work and shattered identity to live as the Stark everyone expects him to still be.\r\n\r\nPepper and Rhodey are even given a chance to pick up the slack. The three form this sort of protagonist trinity, Saving one another in a round-robin Super Hero-y way with a little more depth than I\u2019d expected.\r\n\r\nThe _Iron Man_ movies famously have had the most disappointing bad-guy-show-downs in the genre. And though here Black gives us much more of a delivery on this front than Favreau ever did, the issues I had with _Iron Man 3_ came (almost) exclusively from A.I.M, the Mandarin and Extremis (which form the antagonist trinity now that I think of it).\r\n\r\nSo, we\u2019ve got better a better final confrontation, but from less integral bad guys. A more human hero, stuck in a less human adventure. A better interlocking of characters, with less to do on screen. I could go on with this roller coaster, but that word essentially sums up the film. Not in that its a cliched \u201cthrill ride\u201d, but in that it\u2019s a constant mess of ups and downs, with the final destination just barely justifying the start point.\r\n\r\nSpeaking non-comparitively, _Iron Man 3_ makes a good movie. Not great. But so very, very worth the watch. It\u2019s hard for me to think objectively separate from the other films in the MCU, because I\u2019ve seen them all so many times that there\u2019s no way for me to forget all that\u2019s come before when watching the movie. I\u2019d be interested to hear from somebody who\u2019s watched _Iron Man 3_, but not _Iron Man 1_ & _2_ or _The Avengers_. I\u2019m sure such a person exists somewhere, and if so your input would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nI think I might have made it seem as if I disliked Iron Man 3 more than I actually did. Here\u2019s why. From _Iron Man 2_ until _The Avengers_, I watched all the MCU films in cinemas. After each one, I immediately got that feeling of wanting to go back and watch it again, a feeling that steadily grew as time passed. Each film that Marvel released had me feeling this more strongly than the last, culminating in _The Avengers_ which I saw six times in theatres, and immediately pre-ordered the whole set on Blu-Ray the moment it became available (I bought a PS3 for the sole purpose of watching them). But with _Iron Man 3_ I sort of dropped back to a pretty low interest level once I\u2019d left Hoyts. It seemed that although it was a really good watch, it just didn\u2019t have the staying power I\u2019d come to expect from these incredible Super Hero films.\r\n\r\n67%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_","id":"5b166e99925141782b0121ec","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b166e99925141782b0121ec","movie_id":68721}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed by this third instalment of the Iron Man series of movies. Sure Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark is quite funny (not always but a lot of the time) and there are plenty of nice special effects and things being blown up.\r\n\r\nHowever, the story is just crap. The premise of Killian using the Mandarin for terrorism to cover up the fact that his experiments occasionally fails is just ludicrous. The Mandarin himself is a joke and another good example of how ignorant script writers just pick names out of existing material and uses them not caring how much they screw up established characters and world building already done. Whoever wrote this script should be ashamed of himself.\r\n\r\nWhat is worse, the entire movie is very anti-Iron-Man. It starts right of with Stark being obsessed by his Iron Man suits and a lot of harping about him stopping being Iron Man. Most of the time Stark is running around without his suit and the few times he is in it then the suit does not work properly or is shot off him almost immediately. Actually, most of Stark\u2019s cool stuff is just shot to hell most of the time. \r\n\r\nThe end is full of fireworks but again, it is mostly a display in how you can destroy Iron Man suits and some more anti-Iron-Man crap.\r\n\r\nI cannot say that I did not enjoy watching the fireworks and special effects but as a whole I am disappointed with this movie.","id":"5a6a3c789251412255003272","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a6a3c789251412255003272","movie_id":68721}
{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"There can be many reasons why the original director of a franchise may decide not to return for a sequel, though they all usually have in common that they're very Hollywood-politically-correct. So exactly why Jon Favreau decided not to helm the third instalment of what is, for all intents and purposes, 'his baby' Iron Man, I can't be sure. But I can tell you one thing: something definitely changed.\r\n\r\nEverything about IM3 feels different from its predecessors. The atmosphere is darker, which is not to say it's really just a lot less humorous (which is \u2013 let's be honest \u2013 precisely what we love about Iron Man). The new characters are terribly underdeveloped and overall it's just a great deal less interesting. The storyline was completely vague to me; I'm still not really sure what the whole point of it was. And probably the biggest flaw of all \u2013 the first two films had really cool, interesting villains. This one's just really quite weird and not charismatic at all. Possibly at the core of the problem is the fact that it wasn't just one bad guy, it was many. The leading roles are shared by Guy Pearce and Sir Ben Kingsley, and \u2013 big shock \u2013 it was the latter who disappointed me the most. Not only was his role quite small, I thought it was also incredibly lame. I'd love to explain to you why, but that would be a major spoiler. I noticed some people in the audience laughing at the plot twist of Kingsley's character, but I thought it was just completely stupid and weak, and a total waste of such a great actor. Pearce is not bad, but never really manages to elevate his villain to a higher level, largely because he had zero character development to work with. Same thing with Rebecca Hall. Or the rest of Pearce's cronies for that matter... Too many to count. Sigh.\r\n\r\nWell, at least we still have Robert Downey Jr. He's as reliable as ever when it comes to carrying a film, but even he can't help it that his character is almost boring in this one. Where's the humour!? Where's the cynicism we all know and love?! Where's Tony bloody Stark! This is not the familiar overconfident, pompous macho we adore. All of a sudden, and for NO apparent reason whatsoever, this guy is insecure and suffering from anxiety attacks! What the F! Not to mention the fact that his superhero alter ego is almost completely absent for half of the film, because he's off somewhere in the middle of Tennessee finding himself or whatever... I mean, geez... I know the director left, but didn't any of the screenwriters return either? The fact that Pepper Potts had only about two minutes of relevant screen time also certainly didn't help. And when she was there, she was humourless and annoying. Big sigh.\r\n\r\nThe more I think about it, the more I'm having a hard time trying to think of good things to say about this film. At least the visual effects were solid, and the sound effects were awesome.\r\n\r\nThis was actually the first time I've seen a film in 3D. I've always avoided it because I was sure that it would be a complete distraction from the story. Turns out I was right in my assumption. I found it hard to focus on what was really going on, and this might have definitely been an influence in trying to follow the plot, so there's a big chance I missed a few things. Nevertheless, I can't help being very disappointed with Iron Man 3, especially since I love the first two so much.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely a filmmakers' case of \"could've, would've, should've\". They obviously tried very hard, but never quite manage to get there.\r\n\r\nNo story, no interesting characters, no filler. Nothing. Too bad.\r\n_(June 2013)_","id":"58ac47a1c3a36849e0012c9a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ac47a1c3a36849e0012c9a","movie_id":68721}
{"author":"reverenddr","content":"Olympus Has Fallen is, for all practical purposes, a modern remake of Die Hard that replaces Bruce Willis with Gerard Butler and Nakatomi Tower with the White House. Butler puts in a respectable performance as Mike Banning. Director Antoine Fuqua did as well as could be done with the story, and some gripping action makes it almost watchable. But the downfall of the film was its lazy writing.\r\n\r\nAlmost no part of Olympus Has Fallen is remotely believable. A single airplane penetrates into protected airspace around Washington D.C. and riddles the White House with bullets. It takes 15 minutes for armed reinforcements to arrive. The President of the United States risks the annihilation of a peaceful ally nation to prevent an acquaintance of his from being beaten up. I could go on. And on.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the movie is somewhat painful to watch. You will certainly find yourself complaining loudly at the screen. And yet the action is riveting.

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"Olympus Has Fallen ironically insults America\u2019s national security through lunacy and patriotism. \u201cDie Hard in the White House\u201d claims British lads\u2019 magazine Zoo, divulging into the testosterone-fuelled minds of its laddish readers. To be fair to them, Fuqua\u2019s patriotic perspective of a national terrorist attack is exactly that. A \u2018Die Hard\u2019 rip-off that relies on the same narrative rhythms beat-for-beat. One man, and only one man, can save the day by gradually depleting the numbers of the antagonistic gang that harness either monetary or diplomatic motives. But where the aforementioned feature excelled, this action extravaganza flopped.\r\n\r\nIn apparently thirteen minutes, the entire Secret Service force is massacred at the hands of Korean ultra-nationalists, at the White House, in the middle of the day. \u201cThe most secure building in the world\u201d exclaimed one of the useless decision makers attempting to assist the Acting President. Yeah. That\u2019s an armoury of irony right there. Olympus Has Fallen is so unrealistic in plot, that for the majority of its runtime you\u2019re left baffled as to how any of it was conceptualised. Fully trained Security guards joyfully skip towards barrages of bullets. Protocols are broken left, right and centre. The frickin\u2019 Army Chief of Staff sends a fleet of armed helicopters into a danger zone despite already acknowledging the opposition acquiring a ridiculously overpowered turret. Boom! Dead. The lack of intelligence for its characters is, quite frankly, insulting. Especially when this action blockbuster is supposed to be shrouded in patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe worst offender though is the obtuse amount of horrifically rendered visual effects. From blatantly obvious green screens to clunky polygonal helicopters floating around aimlessly. It was as if the team played \u2018Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\u2019 and directly extracted the models from it. Just woefully terrible. Fortunately Butler emanated his \u201ctough guy\u201d brutality in the central role, because he was continually stabbing Koreans through the skull, throat and legs. A convincingly physical role that was perfectly suited to his acting style, enabling him to destroy his opponents whilst injecting some light buoyancy. Unfortunately the screenplay is limited in the \u201cfun\u201d department, taking the narrative extremely seriously, which hindered the nostalgic cheesiness of 80s action blockbusters that Fuqua took inspiration from.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of, his directing style was taut as expected, with much focus on the shenanigans taking place within the Presidential bunker. But the frenetic editing hindered his clarity. Eckhart provided strength as the President, but as usual, picks lacklustre films to repress his talent. Freeman shouted at one point and I quivered. Bassett, Mitchell and Yune were underused and Leo overacted. Oh, and who stops a countdown at three seconds? Let it go down to one! Create that suspense for flip sake!\r\n\r\nSo yes, for thirsty action viewers who crave violence blended with one-dimensional characters, unintelligent plot points and obscene amounts of polygonal visual effects, Olympus Has Fallen has got you covered. However, if you prefer your action blockbusters with an ounce of excitement, might I suggest a minuscule film called \u2018Die Hard\u2019?","id":"5e206adab3316b00130333f1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e206adab3316b00130333f1","movie_id":117263}
{"author":"Reno","content":"They say it was based on the true story of a man who lived in the latter half of the 1800s. Kind of the biographical movie, but largely inspired from the real incidents rather than story from one man's perspective. The story narrates from the two sets of actors that they come together at the end. One from the Utah, American and other from British pilgrims.\r\n\r\nThe theme was related to the religious and a man with the healing power. Few scenes are hard to accept as it makes no sense when it comes to the reality of life on the earth. As a fictional movie about human spirit it is a lovable movie and I liked it, but as a real perhaps no one buys it. Because it is like the adult version of what kids believe, Santa and fairies.\r\n\r\nIt might be a B stream movie, but the quality was very good with the decent performances and great musics. The thing is, the true story and its logic totally demerged from my perspective.

{"author":"Sukhwinder Singh","content":"**Quick Review**\r\n\r\nStarring an Ace Tennis Player Leander Paes in lead, who is making his Bollywood debut with this film, expectations were strong enough to seek ones attention. However there are other factors as well to raise expectation among the moviegoers such as the strong leading star cast, interesting plot, and others. Well, the makers had indeed delivered what one would be expecting from Leander Paes and his film.\r\n\r\n**Story**\r\n\r\nRajdhani Express is the story of a poor and deprived man Keshav, played by Leander Paes. He works as a dutiful boy for his master Kiran Kumar, who is a gangster and deals in illegal gun activities. One fine day, Keshav steals a revolver and travels his journey in Rajdhani Express Train from Delhi to run away from these illegal activities and to start a new life. During his journey, he met certain people from different walks of life such as a renowned fashion designer Munish (Sudhanshu Pandey), a film-journalist Banerjee (Priyanshu Chatterjee) and a Bollywood item-girl Sunita (Puja Bose).\r\n\r\nWith their talks and behavior, Keshav sadly gets distanced and humiliated because of his low-class status. After heated argument with them, Keshav points his gun at all of them and hijacks the train. However on the other side, Keshav's doom chases him in the form of Deputy Commissioner of ATS, Yadav (Jimmy Shergill).\r\n\r\nCan Keshav escape from this trap now? If yes, then how.\r\n\r\n**Final Verdict**\r\n\r\nRajdhani Express is an apt social-political drama, which conveys a proper social message to the common man. It will relate to every individual who had encountered the experience of class-discrimination in their life, which is a major plus point here. Strong storyline, good dialogues, pleasant gongs, excellent direction, superb cinematography and impressive performances, makes the film worth watchable.

{"author":"Reno","content":"The reason I watched it was the director. 'Combat Girls' was a very good movie and I expected a similar result from this. But it was a totally different entertainer, so original and I was hooked throughout. It was based on the novel of the same name, a well received book and even it was translated to English later. But had some debate over saying it was an erotic related topic.\r\n\r\nWhatever, I don't know the book, because I'm kind of a movie guy, so saw it and liked it. I did not find anything like the book was criticised. You're going to create your own visuals while reading a book, but in a motion picture it gives perfect everything, including background score, which is a plus point. For that, the book must land to a creative mind, the director with vision who can convince others with his exhibition.\r\n\r\nWe find the little kids around us in our daily life who never listen to their parents or anyone and do exactly the opposite to what they were told. Like an adamant character, even in some adults as well, which might developed during their childhood due to raised in a dysfunctional family or other similar circumstances of life they were brought in. This film revolves in a similar manner, but a bit ahead until you to get sick and say 'ew'.\r\n\r\n> It's better to have a scratched knee now,\r\n> than to have a broken heart later on. \r\n\r\nIt was so disgusting and disgusting even more, in one word to say the grossest movie ever, perhaps among the top three or five or ten for sure. Whatever the possible way to make it happen, they used it to bring the outcome. If you ask me, I would say thank god I'm a man and it was the portrayal of a girl. The actress was pretty enough for anyone not to feel (that) bad for what you're going to witness, I call it an advantage for such a theme. Suppose it was an actor, I would have definitely turned it off in midway and said the F word.\r\n\r\nA tale of an 18-year-old girl Helen, who explains why she's so antithesis by recalling her childhood memories. By the second half of her teen life, overtaken by sex fantasies, but that was not the whole movie. These all were to develop the character which took almost full movie leaving current scenario which takes place in the hospital tight and squeezed. Her relationship as individual with her family members a vital phase in the storytelling, which tells she never understood none of the three. Her father, a careless with sexual active man. Her mother brainwashes with over lessons and with her little brother, they never really had proper bro-sis thingy. By the last quarter of the film you will completely know the Helen and time to change your mind, possibly. But still disturbs us her adaptation of the theory of everything.\r\n\r\nThere are many movies where children are affected like Helen, but this film was absolutely a unique in the illustration of the sensitive topic. It's a debatable if parents take the film seriously, because it talk about parenting failure as well unhygienic thingy. Bit of fun, emetic, sexy, overall an exceptional movie for adults. Disgusting is a disgusting, if there is no problem accepting a change and variety in a movie that you usually watch and appreciate the effort, then this film could be a better entertainer. It should dub in English rather remake it if there is a consideration. I usually like German movies, because I'm picky, I choose wisely after a basic research. I knew it would be a commercial feature and I was prepared to enjoy it like that way.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"55585d019251410b390005d4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55585d019251410b390005d4","movie_id":208277}

{"author":"Reno","content":"Frankly, I never knew what the movie is about. What I expected was a beautiful romantic drama and I got a movie that defined someone's struggle over her passion and its reality. After seeing opening scene I thought it would be another movie about war similar to the '5 Days of War'. I am glad it was so distinct which was partially based on the director own experiential story when he served as a photojournalist in the '80s. It is a jointly produced movie by Ireland and Norway in English language.\r\n\r\n     Rebecca is a passionate war zone photojournalist and her daring attitude make her one of the finest on the field. Like always her latest journey takes place in the war torn city of Kabul, Afghanistan. She follows a suicide bomber to cover up the story where she gets injured. After the accident the whole story flips back to her home in Ireland where it chronicles the worried husband and the two children who are very affectionate of her. This is the time where she has to choose the side, the professional? Or the family? The stay at home during recovery makes her realize the worth of her life. So the movie's end strikes with the path she opts to travel forth.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u2018Sometimes it's hard to stay at home.\r\nI mean, the one who stays at home has the hardest job.\u2019\u2019\r\n\r\n     Well, it served a message with the touch of melodrama. The story demonstrated family value on the right amount of each others love and care. The opening and the end scenes that take place in Afghanistan was so brutal and there's another one that takes place in Kenya. But bringing the reality on the screen as it happening some places of the world must be appreciated. It kind of makes you realize that someone is sacrificing their life to bring light on what's happening in the war zones. Like always, Juliette Binoche was good. It was her movie, her side of the story told when she was caught between the family who loves and the war that calls her.\r\n\r\n     One of the fascinating thematic movie. Regarding the main role, you may think why she's not stopping the tragedy from happening. That's the journalism, when you have no power to act, just expose to the rest of the world. The combination of family drama and the conflict zone are like two different genres that brought together awesomely. The director's own experience helped to shape the movie well. Almost all the combat related scenes were so realistic as what he had seen is now letting us know through this film. I think this movie is a must see. The end scene makes us go speechless, woefully.\r\n\r\n9\/10","id":"5411cf4e0e0a266631001e5c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5411cf4e0e0a266631001e5c","movie_id":212606}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Maybe you're all scared of the wrong thing.\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly reactions to this, the third outing for Vin Diesel's sci-fi based anti-hero, has been very mixed. In truth it's hardly a great film of the \"must see\" kind, and it does in fact cleave very close to Pitch Black, the first and most superior of the Riddick trilogy. However, there's a whole bunch of science fiction fun to be had here.\r\n\r\nPlot has Riddick left for dead on a inhospitable planet, where he finds himself up against some alien creatures. His only hope of getting off the planet is to bring notice of his whereabouts, which brings two ships to where he is. Both with crews who have differing reasons for wanting to capture the enigmatic convict...\r\n\r\nAnd thus we get a beautifully filmed sci-fier that features beasties of both the human and alien kind. Action and moody histrionics are never far away, and Diesel is wonderfully muscular, macho, course and scary. Some of the CGI is weak, and naturally much of the film's coincidences and contrivances have to be forgiven if one wants a popcorn and beer good time of it. 7\/10","id":"56ee01bb9251416a2a001166","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56ee01bb9251416a2a001166","movie_id":87421}
{"author":"Gimly","content":"**(Note: This review is of the theatrical version, I have seen the uncut version and it is an improvement, but have not reviewed that edition)**\r\n\r\nIn this latest incarnation, Riddick goes boldly goes where no previous entry has gone before: Nowhere.\r\n\r\nSay what you will about the previous film (_Chronicles of Riddick_) at least it had the guts to take some risks. Sure, almost all of those ended up being complete misfires, but they were still taken. Riddick on the other hand plays it safe. It\u2019s a path not entirely without benefit, but one that was not expected from the series spawned by Australian cult-classic _Pitch Black_.\r\n\r\nShoot me for saying it but I\u2019m actually a huge fan of Davind Twohy (_The Arrival, Waterworld, G.I. Jane, A Perfect Getaway_) so I actually sort of hoped for more from the piece. Sure _Chronicles_ was silly and disjointed, sure _Dark Fury_ was totally unnecessary and _Dark Athena\/Butcher Bay_ were only intermittently decent, but overall the Riddick franchise will always be compared to _Pitch Black_, and against this prodigy, the latest movie is simply subpar.\r\n\r\nThe Necromonger storyline has been all but dropped, any connections to previous characters (sans Riddick) are completely unbelievable and the events are a shameless rip off of the first film. Seeing a more \u201csurvivalist\u201d and intelligent Riddick is nice, as it\u2019s always been sort of more insinuated than outright shown. The entire world that the events of the film take place on is even moderately interesting, and none of the actors or characters are outright let downs, but overall Riddick falls much closer to the \u201cbarely watchable\u201d category than the \u201cbrilliant\u201d one.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s \u201ccool\u201d, it\u2019s pretty and it\u2019s most certainly entertaining, but it\u2019s not new, it\u2019s not clever, and it\u2019s most certainly not as good as _Pitch Black_.\r\n\r\n66%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_","id":"5bacc7e2c3a3683aaa03ba7c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bacc7e2c3a3683aaa03ba7c","movie_id":87421}

As they escape, their copter crash lands in a 60-mile forested crater that contains a prehistoric world cut off from the rest of the earth. Michael Worth plays the madcap professor who\u2019s been living alone in the lost world for years.\r\n\r\nOriginally titled \u201cJurassic Attack,\u201d \"Rise of the Dinosaurs\u201d (2013) is comparable to mockbuster flicks by The Asylum, like \u201cIsle of the Dead\u201d (2016), \"King of the Lost World\" (2005) and \"The Land that Time Forgot\" (2009). The worst thing about it is the CGI: While the dinosaurs look good enough for a low budget movie, the lighting and motion don\u2019t always mesh with what\u2019s on the rest of the screen. And the blood dripping from the t-rex\u2019s mouth is hopeless. But with a cheap knock-off like this, did you expect any better?  \r\n\r\nThe movie works as survival situation with a fairly interesting group of protagonists and one antagonist. On the female front, Natascha is jaw-dropping from beginning to end in modest short shorts while Alicia Ziegler is decent, not to mention kick-axx. Michael Worth\u2019s professor comes across as a hippie-ish academic who has found his paradise. Even though Israel S\u00e1ez de Miguel overdoes the Che-like militarist, the script surprisingly gives him a good scene where he supports his communistic principles and mocks capitalism.     \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour and 23 minutes and was shot in Belize. \r\n\r\nGRADE: C+","id":"5cec40189251416a3fbe3dca","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cec40189251416a3fbe3dca","movie_id":166660}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"As far as I am concerned this is another movie that demonstrates that the rating  of the so-called \u201cprofessional\u201d critics used by Rotten Tomatoes are next to useless, at least as far as I am concerned and the official rating system at RT in general is deeply flawed. Yes I know that I have been harping about this before but I think it deserves to be repeated. Sure, this movie is not the greatest I have ever seen but come on! If you go to the movie\u2019s page at RT you see a big rotten 13% flashing at you. That makes the unaware reader think the movie is a real turkey and that to me is just recycled bull food.\r\n\r\nAt sites like IMDb and TMDb the movies gets around 5.5 out of 10 which, although not great, is much more reasonable. Also the viewer rating says 42% which looks bad but if you look at the details you see that the average rating is 3 out of 5 stars which to me is more an \u201cokay\u201d rating. The RT ratings is seems to be made to make all movies except the blockbusters look bad.\r\n\r\nAnyway, with that little rant over with, let us get to the movie itself. Personally I found it a quite entertaining movie that could have been better. There are quite a few funny scenes and the special effects are not bad.\r\n\r\nJeff Bridges is quite funny as the veteran sheriff although his character is still one of the things that could have been done better. He is supposed to be the knowledgeable veteran but in many scenes it seems like the other way around. His stubborn stupidity is sometimes rather annoying.\r\n\r\nThe plot is fairly simple and straightforward. Nothing fantastic and a bit contrived perhaps but good enough to string the special effects scenes together leading up to the grand finale. The cumin nonsense and the scene where Roy is stuffing his head with spicy food to get a dead to reveal himself is a bit of a downer though.\r\n\r\nA lot of people have been claiming that it is a M.I.B. rip-off. I think that is rubbish. Yes, there are similarities but then every movie with a veteran, a rookie and a sci-fi or a fantasy theme could be said to be a rip-off in that case. There are so many movies made that one will always find similarities. Just live with it.\r\n\r\nAs I write before, on the whole I found the movie rather entertaining and me and the kids sure enjoyed our movie evening.","id":"5a5907130e0a2634f8010021","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a5907130e0a2634f8010021","movie_id":49524}

The kid (Justin Timberlake) takes all his money and play some poker, hoping that he will win and his future secure. Well, you guessed it, he loses everything. But, not because he is bad or anything, no, there is this guy called Ivan (Ben Affleck) who runs these online casinos, and who cheats the poor young kids.\r\n\r\nNow there is only one sensible thing to do, which is to go to Costa Rica and confront the bad guy with his scheme. Thats exactly what I would do. Well, nah, not really, but I hope you see where I am going with this. He arrives in Costa Rica, and soon finds himself at the deep end of the pool, hunted by Ivan, some dude named Herrera and the FBI... of course.\r\n\r\nThe plot is idiotic, as you might have guessed. It makes no sense, and the poor actors don't know how to act. And honestly, I don't blame them, they don't understand the manuscript either. I looked for a little light in the darkness, and I think I found it... the  photography. There are some beautiful images in this movie, worthy of a James Bond movie, and you know what, the plot matches the Bond movies of late pretty well too. Yeah, I am not a big Bond fan either.\r\n\r\n_Last words... it's not worth it. Ben Affleck is an overrated actor, not worth your time.

When the android is to be destroyed, it goes on a killing spree.\r\n\r\nYears later, the android project is again attempted by the same scientist who creates the android in the image of his dead wife. The rebels capture the android and reprogram it to think for itself and to have feelings.\r\n\r\nThis is one of Chris R. Notarile's best films.\r\nThe cinematography, editing, effects and locations are so thought out and the storyline, while not unique, is a cohesive, different take on a familiar theme. All of this done on a very small $17,000 budget.\r\n\r\nAs for the acting, Notarile has managed to assemble the best of his troop of actors and they really deliver. Samantha Talbott plays LIA both in life and as an android flawlessly. Kasey Williams, Hector De La Rosa and Dana Jesberger shine in their roles as the leaders of the rebels, while Rick Zahn and Mark Hawk make their characters appropriately unlikeable. But it's Roberto Lombardi, as Dr. Peter Hess, who carries this film. He alternates between a mad scientist with a hatred for the rebels and a tortured man who mourns LIA. The scene where she dies is one of the best and Lombardi's emotional performance sets the stage for what comes next.\r\n\r\nDon't believe the trolls, haters and self appointed expert cinephiles.\r\nSee movies and make up your own mind.\r\n\r\n1) Other than there being androids in this film, it is nothing like The Terminator.\r\n\r\n2) There are no fake reviews.

I greatly enjoy cinematic puzzles, and directors who have the wherewithal, guts and personal integrity to stick to their guns and project their distinct visions without caving in to corporate pressure or normal sensibilities.

Though I have Glazer's previous two films, I have sadly not seen them yet, a condition I hope to remedy as soon as possible.

Before that, they need to look like us, so they steal human skins and that's what this film is about. Most of the film was in a van driving around in the Scottland. An alien disguised as a human, looking for the single men in the uncrowded places to seduce and steal their skins. But one day after got curious about being a human being, her routine work gets affected seriously and so what happens to her after is told in the remaining film.\r\n\r\nIt's certainly not the film I was looking for. That's the reason I did not watch it when it got out. But I kind of liked it, it was not as boring as the others advised me. Usually films are for pleasure and timepass and this film did not have those qualities. Hence it financially failed.

{"author":"Gimly","content":"In the past I have only ever reviewed anthology films as a whole, and by-and-large that's probably what I'll go back to doing in the future, but having just watched the last three quarters of the original _V\/H\/S_, then _V\/H\/S\/2_ and _V\/H\/S: Viral_ all in one sitting, it all sort of bleeds together and I mostly can't remember which one belongs where, so at least for now, I'm gonna try giving some very, very short reviews for each segment, rather than the overall films.\r\n\r\n**Tape 49**: The framing device. These were always the silliest part of the franchise. It doesn't work very well as a jumping off point, and it doesn't work at all as a self-contained narrative.\r\n\r\n**Phase I Clinical Trials**: Much better stuff from Adam Wingard, has some of the intensity found in the first _V\/H\/S_. One of the shorts I think would best translate to a full feature. Could benefit from some better acting though (could be said of all the segments, and isn't a deal breaker for me).\r\n\r\n**A Ride in the Park**: Really just one thing going on here, but that's fine for a short film that's just one part of an anthology. A first-person zombie movie shot from the perspective of the zombie is a pretty dope idea.

{"author":"LastCaress1972","content":"Are you just about done with the anthology horror mini-revival? Sick to death of cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9? Well... I was about to say, \"Move along, then; there's nothing for you here,\" but that wouldn't be fair on this movie OR you. If you're through with first-person perspective found-footage portmanteau horrors then fine, but just stay for one more. Please? Because it's a belter, this one.\r\n\r\nLast year's V\/H\/S was IMO terrific, but it had its flaws. The wraparound story and the first story proper gave the movie a disturbing early feeling of misogyny thanks to both stories' protagonists having sexual gratification of one manner or another as their principal reason for filming their actions, the film's running time struggled to cope with six tales being told, and the shaky first-person cameras were the shakiest of shaky, nausea-inducing cameras in the history of the first-person perspective. Thankfully for the sequel, nobody's shooting footage for the sake of amateur pornography (an early tit-shot establishes our wraparound-segment protagonist as a private investigator, but that's it until some much lighter, more jocular sex-filming exchanges in the last segment, of which more later), V\/H\/S\/2 is telling five stories in all rather than six (hopefully by V\/H\/S\/3 they'll have learned a further lesson: The wraparound stories are completely redundant, so let's ditch 'em), and that extra time is put to good use, and the shaky-cam... it's still there of course - goes hand-in-hand with the territory - but it's just nowhere near as bad. For the most part.\r\n\r\nSo, to the stories themselves:\r\n\r\n\"Tape 49\" - The wraparound segment, directed by Simon Barrett (who wrote the wraparound segment for V\/H\/S - \"Tape 56\" - as well as the segment \"The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger\" for that earlier movie; he also wrote You're Next and the IMO excellent horror\/western Dead Birds). Concerning a private eye and his partner on the trail of a missing student, they come across a house not unlike the one in the first picture, full of not much but stacks of old switched-on CRT televisions and VHS cassette players, and even larger stacks of VHS tapes themselves. They find a laptop with footage of the missing boy, sitting in that very room and explaining about how watching some of these VHS tapes in a certain order will... affect people. Quite how, I'll not say. Suffice to say though that while our private dick searches the house, his partner sits and watches the tapes (these are the four segments making up the main body of V\/H\/S\/2), and trouble abounds. It's a big upgrade on the unlikeable wraparound from the first movie but it's still largely unnecessary and despite some good horror action towards the very end, it made little sense and was subsequently by virtue of its nature the weakest tale of the lot.\r\n\r\nSegment 1. \"Phase I Clinical Trials\" - Directed by Adam Wingard (You're Next, V\/H\/S segment \"Tape 56\", The ABCs of Death segment \"Q is for Quack\"), this is a fairly straightforward and derivative piece (The Sixth Sense? The Eye?) about a guy who, following an eye operation to replace his blind right eye with an experimental electronic eye which for the purposes of data collection records everything it \"sees\" (a fairly ingenious if slightly laboured use of the first-person perspective I thought, also neatly sidestepping the thorny \"Why are they still FILMING?!?\" issue that besets all of these sorts of films), starts seeing - you guessed it - dead people. Nothing original to see here in terms of the story, but Wingard's ever-improving directional skills keep the tension levels up and interesting throughout. Not an especially strong start, but a decent start.\r\n\r\nSegment 2. \"A Ride in the Park\" - Co-directed by the criminally-underrated Eduardo S\u00e1nchez (yes, him. Co-director of found-footage great-grandaddy The Blair Witch Project; also did the absolutely fantastic Altered, plus Seventh Moon and Lovely Molly) and his long-time producer buddy Gregg Hale, and co-written by S\u00e1nchez and his long-time writing partner Jamie Nash, this one came with heavy expectations and it didn't disappoint at all. A cracking flat-out zombie fest filmed almost entirely from the perspective of a cyclist's helmet-mounted Go-Pro camera. Our - hero? - Mike takes his bike out for a lovely early-morning spin through the park and is immediately attacked and bitten by a zombie, one of several ambling through these woods. He escapes, runs away, staggers, falters, drops to the floor and dies. Then he gets up. From there on in it's a zombie's-eye view of the carnage and gore, finishing with a flourish on a surprisingly touching note. For zombies, like. Excellent short story. Probably the best segment not only of this movie so far (it's certainly that) but of the V\/H\/S franchise so far.\r\n\r\nUntil...\r\n\r\nSegment 3. \"Safe Haven\" - Another strong directorial collaboration here, this time between Gareth Huw Evans (The Raid) and Timo Tjahjanto (The ABCs of Death segment \"L is for Libido\"). Taking up 30 minutes of V\/H\/S\/2's entire runtime (and worth every second), Safe haven concerns a documentary news crew who - using both conventional professional cameras and mics plus hidden \"button\"-cams - go to film the shenanigans at a remote Indonesian compound, in which is housed a \"Heaven's Gate\"-style Doomsday cult comprised of their enigmatic leader - The Father - his \"family\" of wives\/lovers and (many) children plus other assorted cult members. It is implied that \"The Father\" is promoting and engaging in underage sex with some of the members, and it's this angle the news crew most want to pursue. They end up however with something very different.\r\n\r\nManaging to look and feel like an exquisite blend of the co-directors' other works The Raid and \"L is for Libido\" with a good dollop of Doom 3 or some other survival horror game thrown in for good measure, this short represents the best thing that either V\/H\/S movie has offered us thus far. It's creepy, then it's tense, then it's frantic and as gory as gore gets (all justifiably and within the context of a good tale well told, I might add). If there's a teeny-tiny criticism it could be that a practical visual effect at the very very end of the short (you'll know it when you see it) doesn't quite work and against the otherwise staggering look of all that preceded it, it's quite jarring. However, I'm nitpicking. \"Safe Haven\" is a superior piece and with a few dollars thrown at it could make an excellent and terrifying expanded movie in its own right.\r\n\r\nSegment 4. \"Slumber Party Alien Abduction\" - directed by Jason Eisener (Hobo With a Shotgun, The ABCs of Death segment \"Y is for Youngbuck\"). Eisener seems to be a bit of a \"love him or loathe him\" director. I WANT to like him but I find his output as frustrating as it is novel, and this is no exception. Essentially, a bunch of kids of varying ages have free reign over their lakeside house, and fill their time with happy, video-based tomfoolery including strapping a camera to their dog to see what he films, blasting one another with urine-filled water guns and busting in on one anothers' \"intimate\" time, be that one of the girls with her boyfriend or one of the doofus young teenagers with his hand, a porno and some time to kill. So far, so goofy. Until a violent attack by a band of hostile classic \"Grey\" aliens kicks off. It's a good idea and the story itself is fine, but this is the one short in the pack that continues to suffer badly from the first movie's shaky-cam syndrome. Once the action starts, you'll struggle to see what's happening. Good stuff, but frustrating. And coming as it does after two truly excellent segments, just a trifle deflating.\r\n\r\nSo, segments 1 and 4 are of a standard comparable to the first movie, the wraparound piece is an improvement, but the middle two shorts are worth the ticket money on their own and elevate V\/H\/S\/2 above its older sibling and above much of today's horror fare in general. Well recommended.","id":"5207af6b760ee308b276aa04","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5207af6b760ee308b276aa04","movie_id":159117}

{"author":"MoHA","content":"There is a simple enough metaphor running through the heart of this alternately frustrating and picturesque film. It is that love and passion is a nuclear reaction. It can also be a sickness, inspired by this most fear inducing of energy sources. Unfortunately this sickness, while inducing plenty of painful paranoia does not inspire much in the way of imaginative inspiration\u2026\r\n\r\nFocusing on the unskilled Gary (Tahar Rahim, star of A Prophet, 2009) as he attempts to find a job at a nuclear plant in the Rhone valley, the film can be seen as something of a tale of abuse. Subjecting the young man to gradually increasing doses of nuclear contamination plus mostly outdoor sex sessions with the engaged Karole (Seydoux), the erotic drama meets environmental thriller is certainly original in its main concerns.  However, the story begins to pale as it becomes clear that the essential plotting and characterisation does not progress much futher than the sex, paranoia of discovery and inexplicit feeling of possible of racial abuse.\r\n\r\nside from the film itself, the soundtrack from French film composer and avant garde synth-pop artist Rob is well worthy of listening to. As an extra note of quality it works extremely well within the context of  the images of the verdant pastures of the valleys and fields.\r\n\r\nThe film is shot wonderfully well with the French countryside looking perfectly resplendent, as the two lovers meet up for their regular trysts in the shadow of the nuclear plant. But  the perfect capture of the valley side can not disguise the fact that the film as a whole is served up slightly confused and luke-warm. By the end the audience could well be wondering what the actual message was.","id":"5529a45c925141792b000022","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5529a45c925141792b000022","movie_id":186991}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"There is no doubt that this is a very pleasing movie from a purely visual point of view. This is probably a movie that would benefit from being watched in a good theater with its grandiose scenery.\n\nHowever, I have to say that I found the rest of the movie somewhat mediocre. The part that I felt dragged down the movie the most is that Dr. Ryan is behaving rather clumsily and amateurish first being real slow in obeying the order to evacuate and then floating around huffing and puffing, talking a lot when she should really conserve oxygen. Did they not give her the basic course before letting her up in space? I also found it soooo Hollywood that she was able to get onto the Chinese space station and seconds later it starts to descend into the atmosphere. In general I felt that the script writer was not really very technically knowledgeable.\n\nOverlooking these, unfortunately all too often occurring issues, the movie is fairly okay as a whole. Obviously I cannot agree with the glowing all-star ratings that some people have been giving it but it is far from the single star trashing that other people have been giving it. Technically it was very good with nice special effects. Bullock performed as well as can be expected with the script she was given. Clooney felt a bit out-of-place as a skilled astronaut to me but then he was not really in the movie that much.\n\nTo me it was a fairly enjoyable popcorn movie.","id":"5a3a65100e0a264cd0212412","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a3a65100e0a264cd0212412","movie_id":49047}

IMDB: 4.4\/10.0 from 595 audience ratings. Estimated budget: 3 million PS.\r\n3. Rotten Tomatoes: 29% on the meter; 74% wanted to see it from 107 audience ratings.\r\n4. Netflix: 3.1\/5.0 from 13,817 audience ratings.\r\n5. Starring: Gabriel Byrne as Joseph Corso, Rufus Sewell as Parker, Julian Sands as Cutter, Toby Stephens as Riley, Gil Darnell as Adrian Peters, Pierre Mascolo as Mark Corso, Terence Maynard as Sands, Ray Polhill as Paul Myers, Leo Gregory as Dixon.\r\n\r\n**Setup and Plot**\r\n\r\n1. Set in modern day London, UK.  The issues are criminal activities versus police responses. Riley moves stolen diamonds.  Joseph Corso is a crime boss, the 'Merchant' of London; Cutter is his henchman. Mark Corso (Joseph's son) seems to be running drugs, and doing them as well.  Parker, Dixon, and Sands are on the New Scotland Yard\/Metropolitan Police side of the issues.\r\n2. By squeezing Mark on cocaine possession, Parker and friends leverage his father Joseph into trapping Riley, who has been skirting Joseph's rules of order. The plans move forward, glacially.  Joseph wants his son safe, well-treated, and preferably free; Parker wants Riley in jail and off the streets.  At least that is the first story.\r\n3. Joseph sets up Riley to do 'one more job' that is a complicated heist that has to be done lightning fast.  Parker gets Mark back to Joseph.  Joseph tells Mark that he is retiring as the Merchant, but that succession is unlikely since Mark is a known addict.  So, the stage is fully set.\r\n4. Given the complicated arrangements, something is bound to break down.  Will the cops keep faith with Joseph on the deal?  Will Joseph help Riley just enough to get him caught?  Will Mark pull a wild card out?  Will Riley diagnose the whole setup and get free of it?  Where does the difference start between normal police procedure and straight up corruption?\r\n\r\n**Conclusions**\r\n\r\n1. One line summary: Endless betrayals mark this dark anti-procedural crime film.\r\n2. Three stars of five.\r\n\r\n**Scores**\r\n\r\n1. Cinematography: 8\/10 A bit too dark for me, but presumably done for effect.  Focus and framing and the like were just fine.\r\n2. Sound: 8\/10 The tension building from the background music was good, and the actors seemed to be miked OK.\r\n3. Acting: 6\/10 Normally I like Byrne, Sewell, and Sands.  They were fairly good here as well, although perhaps the material was not enough of a challenge for them.  I like Toby Stephens as a comedian in television (Vexed) and film (Severance), but not so much as a dramatic actor.  I kept expecting a flippant remark or seven together with a sneering smile.  Terence Maynard was rather good, and I liked Leo Gregory's performance.\r\n4. Screenplay: 5\/10 How does Riley get shot in the abdomen then can keep going with high-stress muscular maneuvers for a good continuous 20 minutes afterwards?  This seems unlikely.  The heist succeeding seemed unlikely.  The wrong amount of valuables being in the vault open for inspection seemed ridiculous.  Normal police discovery seemed to be almost absent.  The ending (and much of the plot) reminded me of LA Confidential.  This worked in the year in which LA Confidential was set, but not so much in 2013.  Perhaps worst of all, the 84 minute play time felt like 130.","id":"5511a2ae92514148dd000362","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5511a2ae92514148dd000362","movie_id":183258}
{"author":"ultranerazzurri","content":"Having seen Aerosmith countless times back in the 70s, and not being a big fan of their later work, I wasn\u2019t that upset that the band chose to play in faraway Dunedin, rather than Auckland, when they performed for the first time in New Zealand this past April. But having viewed this live DVD of the band\u2019s recent Japanese tour, I kinda wish that I had made the trek down south.\r\n\r\nThe band has gone through a few trials and tribulations over the past few years, with lead singer Steven Tyler having to file a lawsuit on the other four band members after they tried to replace him when he signed up for a stint as a judge on American Idol. Then there are the usual physical ailments, rehab visits and lousy albums that a band entering its fourth decade has to deal with.\r\n\r\nThis film was shot during the band\u2019s tour of Japan that took place in late 2011 and is ostensibly a \u201cgift\u201d to the people of Japan after suffering through the massive tsunami that killed 15,000 citizens the previous March. Apparently, the Japanese are huge Aerosmith fans, and that fact seems confirmed when the film makers interview one concert goer who has seen them over 150 times. I would bet that Tyler and Perry would be hard-pressed to actually remember that many of their own gigs.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this DVD is part concert film, part documentary. There are complete performances of many of the songs, partial performances of others and off-stage footage\u2026press conferences, visits to shops and fan comments\u2026sprinkled liberally throughout the nearly 2-hour film.\r\n\r\nFortunately that band focuses on their harder-rockin\u2019 older material and shies away from the big ballads here. So we get spirited versions of gems like No More No More, Mama Kin and Movin\u2019 Out, the first song Tyler and Perry wrote together.\r\n\r\nJoe Perry usually gets most of the attention, musically, but second guitarist Brad Whitford takes an opportunity to show off his chops on Last Child and makes the most of it.\r\n\r\nSo, the long-running band may be well past their creative peak, and their public displays of affection for each other are probably over-exaggerated, but they prove here that they still know how to rock when they want to.","id":"51f2b22d760ee37a8f0ca9be","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51f2b22d760ee37a8f0ca9be","movie_id":209999}

Dark Skies unsurprisingly is another in a long line of sci-fi\/horror movies that divides the respective genre followers. \r\n\r\nPlot finds the Barrett family home suddenly succumbing to mysterious phenomena, suicidal birds, time lapses, poltergeist activity, nightmares and body markings et al...\r\n\r\nIt's a film that most definitely didn't deliver the spook fest that the (mixed) marketing campaign suggested, while it unfortunately comes off as a collage of well known genre titles of recent pasts. Add to this some less than great acting from the adult leads, the complete waste of J.K. Simmons in a very promising role, and unoriginality of concepts, then it's not hard to see why it has been the victim of venom in some quarters.\r\n\r\nHowever, Scott Stewart is not guilty of taking the easy route to genre cinema as per production. There's no over reliance on CGI, or for big booms and crashes to startle in the name of cheap thrills, in fact the scare scenes are well placed and well timed. He also proves to be a very good purveyor of slow burn atmospherics, itself something that can alienate the more boisterous and excitable genre fans.\r\n\r\nThe vision of a suburban American family under siege is well played out, the little trials and tribulations of a working class family not swamping the big objective, so when things gather apace and the child actors come to the fore, time invested by the patient is rewarded.\r\n\r\nIf at times it doesn't have the courage of its convictions, Dark Skies at the very least doesn't resort to alien abduction clich\u00e9s to seal its deal. There's a number of \"issues\" with it, especially if you are either into clinical alien abduction science (history) or edge of your seats underwear shocks, but this is above average and worth a viewing for those interested in such dalliances. 6\/10","id":"53a5bf160e0a261442001921","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53a5bf160e0a261442001921","movie_id":145135}

Both actors lost a significant amount of weight for the role, which lends real authenticity and gravity to the film.\r\n\r\nMade on a shoestring budget, with little to no special effects, this film is all about the story and the performances. The battles with the FDA trying to circumvent red tape, and get people medication they desperately need is frustrating and all too realistic.  Big pharma calls the shots, manipulates data and statistics and keeps peddling their toxic expensive medication, while Woodroof battles for the rights to treat himself with medicine he knows works.\r\n\r\nIt is a David and Goliath story, a look at an era when AIDS was virtually untreatable and running out of control.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A dark force from out of the world!**\r\n\r\nIt was one of the long due film, despite releasing just 4 years ago. Those who saw it said me not to miss it. But they also warned me it was a common horror theme with a slight change in the storyline. Since horror is the least average rated genre in my collection, I was not expecting it to be a masterpiece. That could be another reason why I liked it. Yeah, the same old blueprint horror flick, even though it was not as bad as what some people are saying. Except the opening quote reveals most of the film's twist. And the twist at the end was not actually a twist if a person knew it before.\r\n\r\nA small family struggling with finances, lately witnessing some strange events in the house. But once it takes a serious turn, now they must find a solution for it, or else the unity might fall apart.

Yeah, I know horror films can't get out of such thing. It's very rare to see a film out of these platforms. Yet it was an okay film, if you prefer a decent entertainment over an experimental film, which is not guaranteed entertainment. But usually it is an enjoyable flick by most of the people.

{"author":"rajanvohra","content":"Dhoom 3 is the third of the well acclaimed blockbuster \"Dhoom\" action series. The movie stars renowned Bollywood stars Aamir Khan and Abhishek Bachchan in a legendary battle between a vigilante and a no-nonsense policeman. The film opens in the 1990\u2019s to a show known as The Great Indian Circus. The show starred flashy dancers, dangerous stunts and most importantly a young magician established as the Iqbal Khan\u2019s (the owner) son Sahir.  The show was under a great deal of pressure from its lender as it was unable to make payments on its loan.  Per the banker\u2019s demand, the show was ordered to be shut down and Iqbal Khan committed suicide immediately.\r\n\tThe film then fast forwards to present day, Sahir (Aamir Khan) is an adult and has formulated a plot to avenge his father\u2019s death by planning and executing robberies against the bank that once closed his father\u2019s circus. After one robbery, ACP Jai Dixit (Abhishek Bachchan) is summoned on the case. After a case of cat and mouse, epic chase scenes, and another robbery Jai learns the truth behind Sahir\u2019s robberies. An epic plot twist reveals that Sahir is actually a twin to his autistic brother Samar which explains the inherit \u201cmagic\u201d behind Sahir\u2019s avoiding the police during the chase. Undercover police work and a fifteen minute police chase later the film fittingly ends when Sahir and Samar apparently commit suicide by jumping off a bridge much like their father did. The film lives up to the hype led by the precursor movies in the series, giving the viewers epic action scenes, major plot twists and countless dance numbers that Bollywood film patrons love so much. \r\n   This action film has same intrinsic values and plot as the iconic film Deewaar. The motives of both Sahir and Vijay can be ascribed to the underlying resentment and anger of  young men, or the proverbial \u201cangry young man\u201d made so famous by Deewar\u2019s leading man, Amitabh Bachchan. The young men both took it upon themselves to seek their own justice against what they deemed was unfair and unjust to their family. Both films stress the increased importance on family values that one would see in any other typical megahit Bollywood film. The basic plot of Dhoom 3 is the revenge of the twin sons against the bank for being the cause of their father's death, albeit indirectly.  In Deewaar, Vijay\u2019s father is victimized by a corrupt businessman and leaves town, leaving the family to fend for themselves, and Vijay spends his formative teen years and early adulthood fighting for his rights.  The impact of the victimization of the fathers on the children was evident in both films. The endings are also both inherently tragic as both angry young men die in pursuit of their own justices because they operated outside the law. Historically, in Bollywood rivalries and traditions are multi-generational and these two movies are no exceptions. \u201c[Vijay]\u2026 unlike hard core villains, values family relationships\u2026 he is an exemplary older brother (as a child he worked so hard so that his brother could be educated\u201d (Thomas). In both films the villain is not one true villain but rather someone who is fighting for their own justice having experienced one in the past. \u201c\u2026 he [Vijay] is also good enough to be the focal hero\u201d (Thomas). This runs a direct parallel to Sahir as the triumph of the law (Abhishek Bachchan) over the criminal (Aamir Khan), even if the crime is strangely understandable and maybe justifiable.  There have been rumors of Dhoom 4 and a potential leading villain role of Shah Rukh Khan as well.  We will just have to wait and see.","id":"5beef314c3a36818a301cf19","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5beef314c3a36818a301cf19","movie_id":44977}
{"author":"Kenneth Axel Carlsson","content":"After 12 years, **Dom Hemingway** (Jude Law) finally gets the Call. It is time for him to leave prison and collect what is owed him. 12 years in prison have really fueled this guy's hatred and there are plenty of things to take care of, like the man who stole his wife, the man who got him into jail and who owes him and lastly, the daughter who wants nothing to do with him.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot to dislike about this guy, but for some reason, I don't. Dom is a loser, but he just doesn't know it. Dom has all the self-esteem that a man will ever need, and yet, his life is falling apart around him. \r\n\r\nDom Hemingway is not an original movie, but thats ok, all movies doesn't have to be original to be worth watching. This movie, like Dom, has just the right amount of self-esteem, arrogance and cockiness, it believes that it is more than it is, and that makes all the difference. Jude Law delivers a great performance as Dom, especially the scenes where he rambles (like the opening scene), and the scenes where he tries to win back his daughter, is where Mr. Law earns his wages. I don't mind that he is a bit over the top, that is, as far as I am concerned, the strength of the movie.\r\n\r\nDom Hemingway is a movie in the tradition of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and RockNRolla, only... better, if you ask me. It wants to tell us a story about a man, a man that we all know, a man that we can all relate to, it is not just here to entertain us, it is here to convince us that it has both heart and soul.\r\n\r\n_Last words... don't expect this movie to change your life, but watch it regardless, and take a moment to reflect over the things that are worth changing in your own life. It won't give you answers, but it might just give you the kick in the balls, that sends you in the right direction._","id":"549c010292514131320036f0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/549c010292514131320036f0","movie_id":192134}

All the other character were weak, only he was the bright shining spot in it. The story also should have been better. At least improvising Emilia Clarke's part as she was in a an important role would have had a good impact on the film. Of course, it's a black-comedy-drama in the crime theme, but utilise its full potential to go some extent like maybe some interesting crime plots.\r\n\r\nA few segments were quite absorbing like bet on to open the safe and France visit. There's no smooth storytelling, but the constant rise and fall of the main character was the reason for the lag in development and its pace. The overall point was very clear in portraying a struggling ex con and how he adapts to a new life or he desires to go back to his old life tells the remaining film. So some people might like or liked it, but I did not.

{"author":"Kenneth Axel Carlsson","content":"This is a documentary about how humans keep orcas (killer whales) as pets to entertain at places such as SeaWorld. It is centered around one vicious attack by a killer whale named Tilikum, but actually takes us around the world as well as into the past. This is not the first attack on trainers, and if the movie is to be believed, probably not the last one, unless measures are being taken to prevent abuse of the killer whales. Abuse in this case, by the way, means basically using them as entertainment. Killer whales should be free.\r\n\r\nI admit it, these beasts scare the daylight out of me. Apparently because of how we treat them, because someone informas us during the documentary, that never has there been reported a killer whale attack in the wild. I find that a little hard to believe, but ok, I'll play along for the sake of strengthening the morale of this movie. I actually saw a killer whale once, stranded more or less, inside a danish harbour. It was there for days I believe, and people traveled far to see it. I did as well, so I guess I understand the attraction of this magnificent and scary creatures. Also, isn't part of the attraction the fact that they are scary with a reputation? The fact that some people dare defy nature and enter a pool with them... a horrible and yet, strangely appealing thought. Not because we want to see anything bad happen to them, but because there is a chance it could happen.\r\n\r\nAs documentaries go, this is solid. It delves into the story of the orca, and also a bit about its physiology. Apparently, these guys are very emotional. It would have been great to have more than just one side to the story, but since SeaWorld declined to participate, I guess that would have been hard to do.\r\n\r\nLast words... not a very thought-provoking documentary. It shows some scary images, but never anything truly disturbing, which is a good thing in my opinion. But honestly, just go see Free Willy, and you will see a movie that tries to bring across the same message.","id":"54a6c33d92514117dd009e86","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54a6c33d92514117dd009e86","movie_id":158999}

But one day her life is once again turned upside down when she is terrorised in her own home...\r\n\r\nDistinctly mundane thriller that harks back to other blind women under threat thrillers released previously. Penthouse North (the swanky place where Sara lives with Ryan) brings absolutely nothing new to the formula, not even - in fact - adding a twist or any sort of surprises. It's interesting to take on board the advancements in technology for the blind, though even this aspect is short changed in the run-of-the-mill plot. The villains are a couple of staple writing jobs, with Michael Keaton as Chad phoning it in, while the attempts to make Chad extra nasty are laughably lazy and irresponsible into the bargain.\r\n\r\nMonaghan's performance is commendable, she does enough to have you rooting for her whilst enjoying her resourcefulness, and the cinematography (Chris Seager) is most pleasing, both in colour lenses and glorious city scapes. But ultimately, one can forgive implausibilities in a thriller of this type, but not lazy unadventurousness that smacks of film making to fulfil a contract or even as a tax write off job. 4\/10","id":"5974adb792514157fb016cec","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5974adb792514157fb016cec","movie_id":199591}

But from the first frame, it's really just about one \u2014 Adele. So much film is spent focused on her face that it's easy to lose contact with other characters and the world around her. But in doing so, I felt very drawn into her thought process, which made the story of her romance to Emma that much more powerful, despite the language barrier and the relationship's keen specificities. Being so drawn in proved very helpful during the breakup scene. On it's own, you see a woman scorned and the sad stupidity of her unfaithful lover fighting a lost cause. But because we know so much about that unfaithful lover, I felt worse, because I know what led her to this place and was sad she couldn't articulate it in the moment. It added to what I think is the film's major achievement -- showing how an ecstatic love like Emma's and Adele's can end up feeling so isolating.","id":"53a4de410e0a2614360005ab","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53a4de410e0a2614360005ab","movie_id":152584}

{"author":"shans_p_s","content":"Mohanlal was endearing in roles where he played the common man. But, as his stature grew, we saw less of the kind of roles that had brought him stardom. \r\n\r\nAs a big star, he played those \u2018larger than life\u2019 roles that had the fans clapping and whistling at the superhuman feats of their idol. \r\n\r\nThe subtlety that was the hallmark of his earlier films became increasingly rare and the sly sense of humour gave way to a louder variety. \r\n\r\nIn his new film Drishyam, director Jeethu Joseph focuses on the endearing persona of the actor by casting him as Georgekutty, an orphan who had dropped out of school after the fourth grade. \r\n\r\nHe has come up in life by tilling his land. Now he is businessman running a cable TV service in a rural area. He is married to Rani (Meena) and they have two beautiful daughters. \r\n\r\nGeorgekutty is stingy and does not like to spend money on anything beyond the basic necessities. His only interest in life apart from his family is watching films. He spends most of his time in front of the TV in his small office. \r\n\r\nHe is so obsessed with movies that he takes every major decision in life by subconsciously taking an example from some film he has seen. \r\n\r\nThese details are revealed in a humorous manner in the first half of the film. There\u2019s an obvious twist just before the interval. Georgekutty\u2019s teenaged daughter gets photographed in the bathroom at a nature camp by a hidden cell phone. \r\n\r\nThe culprit Varun (Roshan Basheer) is the son of an inspector general of police, Geetha Prabhakar (Asha Sarath). Varun is accidentally killed by Rani and her daughter when he comes to blackmail them. It is up to Georgekutty to protect his family from the long arm of the law. \r\n\r\nJeethu Joseph makes this into an \u2018edge of the seat\u2019 thriller in the second half by making Georgekutty stay two steps ahead of the investigators. \r\n\r\nGeorgekutty prepares his family to face the torturous interrogations. He also makes sure that his family does not psychologically break up in the face of coercive police tactics. \r\n\r\nMohanlal is spellbinding in this film. That is too simple a statement to describe the magic he has created on screen. \r\n\r\nHe plays a semi-literate man who is nevertheless intelligent. He is conversant in many languages, a skill that he acquired watching all those films on TV. \r\n\r\nHe was mischievous as a teenager, and when he flirts with his wife, but is incredibly mature when dealing with dire circumstances. \r\n\r\nMeena as his wife Rani is a middle-class woman who aspires for a better lifestyle and social standing. She holds her own opposite Mohanlal and is one of the highlights of the film. \r\n\r\nKalabhavan Shajon who usually plays the comic sidekick of the hero, has made a successful transition to a villain in this project. He plays a corrupt police constable who has some animosity against Georgekutty. \r\n\r\nDrishyam can be credited for bringing Mohanlal back to form and pushing director Jeethu Joseph into the big league as he has made a cracker of a thriller.","id":"534e58450e0a2679e30016f2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/534e58450e0a2679e30016f2","movie_id":244049}

It\u2019s also the third miss in a row for Pixar.\r\n\r\nMU, just like Brave (and unlike Cars 2) is filled with merit, and well worth watching. But in 1995 when Pixar came out swinging with Toy Story, people expect that sort of a trend to continue. Which it did! Right up until 2006, when they released their seventh film (Cars); the first film they\u2019d gotten behind that didn\u2019t blow audiences world wide out of the Goddamn water. Pixar\u2019s limped up and down the approval ladder ever since, with MU sitting comfortably somewhere in the middle.\r\n\r\nIt is a great film. Especially for a kids\u2019 film, especially for a prequel, all of that, but it is not the return to greatness audiences keep hoping for. It plays it safe, it lulls in the dreary, rarely well-pulled-off format of \u201cCollege Comedy\u201d (which is again, a safe area to sit in). It may not be as triumphant as the original, but it\u2019s not all together disappointing either.\r\nThe film does what virtually any film with large amount of money behind it does: It stands in front of you for an hour and a half, does its job in the entertainment industry of \u201centertaining\u201d you, then it sidles out, leaving you smiling, but not thoroughly satisfied. It takes as few risks as possible, and vehemently avoids anything new, just in case it pisses people off, and risks not making their money back.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s fine, people of the world are used to this, it\u2019s a fun ride, and then it\u2019s done. Worth your money, worth your time, but not what people have come to expect from the powerhouse of Pixar\u2019s heyday. \r\n\r\n74%\r\n\r\n-Gimly","id":"5916a50192514159c102b2f3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5916a50192514159c102b2f3","movie_id":62211}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**It's the same all teenagers love and sexual curiosity.**\r\n\r\nIt's a little surprise film. The theme was a bit inappropriate, but there's nothing seriously offensive in the narration in the name of art and everything was explained loud and clear. Especially the way it ended seems the best one from any angle. If you are a parent, that too for a teenager, you will get it. So this is the story of the 16 year old girl Molly, who attends a progressive school. Her new undertaking is the photography which is guided by her English teacher whom she develops a crush. Since teacher-student should not involve in any kind of close relationship, their's attraction to each other will be tested. But how it will be dealt was focused on the remains.\r\n\r\nI really kind of liked it. Though this is not the first time in a film to focus on an affair between a teacher and his student. But, how nicely and properly portrayed that issue was the highlight in this. There are no familiar faces, maybe because it is a Canadian film. It was a simple story, so no extraordinary performances, but I liked the girl in the title role. The first feature film for the director and he also wrote the screenplay. Overall a decent film, but a great indie. You should check it out if you are convinced with what I said so far.

{"author":"thatmovieguy","content":"I\u2019m just going to come out and say this right now, no hyperbole \u2013 _American Backwoods: Slew Hampshire_ is the kind of indie horror movie every filmmaker should aspire to make. It is such a well put together production, with a great story, incredible acting, and some extremely brutal practical gore effects, you\u2019ll almost forget that you\u2019re watching an indie, but without getting the feeling of watching a glossed-over Hollywood schlock-fest, either.\r\n\r\n_Slew Hampshire_ follows the story of four lifelong friends who are setting up a road trip, intent on driving to northern New Hampshire for one last hurrah before they head off to college. With plans of drinking, debauchery, and underground strip clubs \u2013 a right of passage in their small town \u2013 the four friends set out down the old country back roads. A minor accident forces them off the road, and unfortunately into the world of a group of sick, backwoods New Hampshire hillbillies, out \u201cgame\u201d hunting, who are insatiable in their sexual lust for young teen boys. Aside from the raping hicks, the teens must also contest with a group of mystical Nordic men who have trapped young girls in their wooded camp, and who are apparently very hungry for entrails.\r\n\r\nThe dialog in the film comes across very naturally, and I think that is a good mix of both the very creative, very well-written story, and the superb acting. The film itself starts out almost as a comedy with some hilarious one-liners (\u201cI love it when you jerk me off with your asshole, boss!\u201c), but delves quickly into very dark and straight-up horror, featuring some extremely grisly, practical special FX. Rue Morgue Magazine chose this film as \u201cGoriest Scene\u201d in a horror film in their 2013 year-in-review issue, and it definitely has plenty of brutal violence and brutality. Certainly enough to keep a gore-hound like me happy.\r\n\r\nStand-out performances by all of the cast, most of whom have no major titles under their belts, and especially true of Dayo Okeniyi, who plays one of the lead characters, Bro, and is an excellent actor. Since the movie was shot, Okeniyi has gone on to several major films, including a part in _Runner Runner_ with Ben Affleck, and the upcoming _Terminator: Genisys_ with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Also, I have to mention a fantastic performance by relative newcomer Tyler Rice as Dude-Guy, who was extremely funny throughout. The entire cast, though, deserves applause, as they were all fantastic. I also need to point out the quick cameo by New Hampshire comedy band **The Super Secret Project**, who appear in the film and also have a couple songs on the kickass soundtrack.\r\n\r\nAlthough the movie has an official release date on IMDb of 2013, the film is just making it to DVD and On-Demand this week, finally making it into the hands of a pretty large group of social media followers who have been patiently waiting to get their dirty, horror-loving mitts on a copy. Flood Reed has said that this is his love letter to the state of New Hampshire, and as someone who spent most of my life there and is a born-and-raised New Englander, I can honestly say that I don\u2019t think there would be a better way to sign a love letter to the Granite State than with a slew of blood, gore, and even some great laughs.","id":"557cb2a7c3a3686334002350","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/557cb2a7c3a3686334002350","movie_id":336288}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"A remake of the 2012-Malayalam film 22 Female Kottayam, Malini 22 Palayamkkottai turns what was a post modern revenge film (with a somewhat dubious women's lib credo) into a dated and tedious affair. Even if director Sripriya had stuck close to the original, we would have got an engaging thriller, but here, bludgeons even the tiniest bit of subtlety found in the original to give us a clumsy film that attempts to form a social awakening while putting its viewers to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe film begins with Malini (a miscast Nithya Menen), a nurse at a private hospital, getting arrested for being in possession of drugs and her story until this point unfolds as flash back. We are introduced to her friends-cum-colleagues, one of whom, Jency ( Anjali Rao), acts as a 'companion' for an older man, in whose mansion they stay together. Malini is befriended by Varun (Krish Sathar, impressive), who facilitates her visa to Canada, and the two soon become romantically involved. When Jency goes to Canada, Malini is forced to stay with Varun. One day, during Varun's absence, his boss Prakash ( Naresh) enters their home and rapes her. Malini is shell-shocked while Varun is furious. As she limps back to normalcy, Prakash enters her life again, and rapes her again! And, worse, she is arrested for possession of drugs. Malini loses all hope but when she learns about the betrayal that has led her to this fate, she plans her revenge.\r\n\r\nMalini 22 Palayamkkottai is a very topical film, and it does have its heart in the right place but the problem with the film mostly lies with the direction, as Sripriya seems to lack a feel for the material. The filmmaking is tacky and at best TV serial-like. While this might not have felt out of place in an old-fashioned drama, here, it seems odd. Not only do the changes that she brings to this tale, in terms of characters and scenes (a needless fight inside the jail), add anything to the film, but they also feel frivolous. Take Kovai Sarala, who plays the heroine's colleague. She is loud, is needlessly made to blush before young men like the hero in the name of comedy and vanishes half way into the film! Even Jency is given a back story (she is the sole breadwinner for her large family) whereas in the original, was this character presented in a matter-of-fact way and we are never told why she does what she does. And, probably in an effort to make her heroine character more of a saint, the director does away with the character's admission of not being a virgin. It is a crucial point in the original because later in the film, when her character decides to do anything to get back at the persons responsible for her fate, we understand her readiness to compromise. It also underscored the point that she, a rape victim, has realized that it is her heart and not her body that needs to be pure.\r\n\r\nAnother let down is the climatic scene in which the heroine Malini, who has turned from docile nurse to avenging angel, tells Varun, her boyfriend-turned-betrayer that he cannot mess up her life any more. She tells him that she thought about his punishment as his mother and sister and decided it was right to do what she had to do. Nithya Menen utters this dialogue in such a manner that it turns what should have been a biting comment into a melodramatic one. They then trade a few expletives (which are sensibly not muted) that should have been punches in the gut but what they really seem like is adolescents showing off their knowledge of cuss words. Which brings us to the question how did this film, which features rape, pre-marital sex, and the F-word (even if relevant to the story) manage to get a 'U' certificate, when, in the same week, we have another film (Ner Ethir), dealing with adultery, that is rated 'A'?","id":"53bb17530e0a26196b00028b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53bb17530e0a26196b00028b","movie_id":251635}

However at times too much of Mandela's life seems to be  rushed through and other associates in the ANC's struggle to end apartheid are sidelined or entirely absent.\r\n\r\nWe first see Mandela as the young ambitious lawyer and a  ladies man as well. Pretty soon he is married with children and involved heavily with the African National Congress. He divorces his first wife and then we switch to Mandela in his 40s when he meets Winnie who he married.\r\n\r\nMandela is then arrested for terrorism and imprisoned in Robben island.\r\n\r\nIt is only during imprisonment we see the divergence in Nelson and and Winnie's life. Because of her mistreatment by the police Winnie becomes more extreme in her struggle and resorts to violent means to end apartheid. The older Mandela is in secret talks with the government and opts for a peaceful way to unite South Africa.\r\n\r\nIdris Elba relishes the opportunity to play the great man. He gets the voice right but I thought he was far more comfortable as the older Nelson Mandela.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I guess I am being stubbornly traditional here but this was not really the Superman that I grow up with. I am sure that a lot of people are not going to agree with me on this one but personally I was not overly thrilled with this movie.\r\n\r\nSure, if what you wanted was a wild action ride and unchecked destruction then this movie will most likely satisfy you. However, as a \u201cSuperman\u201d movie it just did not feel right to me.\r\n\r\nThe original story is tweaked and tinkered with too much. The Kryptonians, not only General Zod and his minions, are portrayed in a quite negative light. Superman himself project a hugely negative aura. Lois Lane gets to meet Superman and learn who he really is before he even starts to work for The Daily Planet. And so on and so forth\u2026\r\n\r\nThe first part of the movie with the back-flashes, with Kal-El just trying to hide, getting bullied etc. is just sad and even boring. It is not until General Zod arrives that things starts to get going. However even then they continue to tinker with things. Apparently it is now enough to breathe Krypton-like air for him to lose his powers. This is just so wrong. Actually, the entire bla bla when they try to \u201cexplain\u201d his powers is just dumb. There is an established story behind Superman. Even though it is fantastic and unscientific just stick to it. It is a fantasy comic character after all. Leave it at that. The story itself is not bad but it is not Superman.\r\n\r\nHaving said all that, when the fighting starts, the special effects and the action definitely have a high \u201ccoolness factor\u201d. Superman and General Zod wrecks more havoc than half a dozen Godzillas with a bad case of hangover. Actually the level of mayhem is bordering on the ridiculous but it was fun to watch.

{"author":"KCruz88","content":"Overall this movie is great! It has flaws but it still delivered.  For instance, they didn't really explore the loving side of Superman that is the reason for saving humans.  But i get it that this could just be a different interpretation of his motives. The relationship between Clark and Lois was almost spontaneous and didn't really develop. Not to mention there was so much action! Sure this is Superman and he deserves a big movie, but that action is just so mind numbing and distracts from the plot. I really did like how they explored Clarks childhood just enough to give justification to his emotions. Although there are criticism about the ending, I thought it was well made. Clark spent his entire youth listening to his father to control himself and he had to learn to make a tough decision. I think this movie has a lot of potential for a sequel if they do it right. I look forward to being able to look back on this and watch it as part of a trilogy and not a stand alone film.","id":"51d7d7a719c295166c12e886","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51d7d7a719c295166c12e886","movie_id":49521}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"The Mothmom Possibly.\r\n\r\nMama is directed by Andres Muschietti and written by Muschietti, Barbara Muschietti and Neil Cross. It stars Jessica Chastain, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Megan Charpentier, Isabelle Nelisse, Daniel Kash, Javier Botet and Jane Moffat. Music is by Fernando Velazquez and cinematography by Antonio Riestra.\r\n\r\nA Suicidal father abducts his two young daughters and takes them to a cabin out in the woods, his intention is to kill them. Before he can enact his plan he is killed by a strange entity, leaving the two girls alone in the cabin. Years later the girls are discovered in the cabin, completely feral and when any sense can finally be made out of them, they talk of being looked after by someone they call Mama; And it seems Mama has come back with them to civilisation\u2026\r\n\r\nBased on his own 2008 Argentinian short of the same name, Andres Muschietti expands the idea out to a full length feature film. With pretty decent results as well. Pic is a supernatural fairytale, thick on ethereal atmosphere and not over reliant on boo jumps or an adherence to blood and guts spilling just to put bums on seats. From the moment the girls are found, scampering around the wood cabin on all fours, clearly having survived on cherries for five years, there\u2019s an uneasy feel to the story. We already know there is a spirit involved as we half glimpsed \u201cMama\u201d during the pre-credits sequence, what we need now is a good story and a healthy quota of frights and peril for Waldau and Chastain as they become surrogate parents to the troubled youngsters; And again, Mama mostly delivers all that is required of it for a good night in by the fire whilst perched on the edge of your seat.\r\n\r\nChastain is excellent as the punk rock chick reluctantly mothering two children before her time, the two girls, Charpentier and Nelisse, are also top draw, exuding the sadness and confusion that children of that age would obviously be feeling under these circumstances. While their reactions to what we ourselves can\u2019t see, via glances or hushed exchanges, has a creepiness to it that delivers a bucket load of dread. Muschietti\u2019s direction is very stylish, not only does he marshal his principal cast members with great skill, he shows some ingenuity in scene staging with one sequence particularly brilliant as Chastain does housework and the younger of the girls plays with Mama in the bedroom, we know it, even though we can only see the wee bairn. The soundtrack and score is suitably screechy, and the cinematography by Riestra has Gothic tints to it.\r\n\r\nWhy Mama is not a bona fide entry in the upper echelons of horror is mainly due to an annoying mistake that so many horror genre film makers make, namely showing too much of the spook. There is a point around the hour mark where \u201cMama\u201d herself just stops being scary, a shame because the effects work isn\u2019t half bad. There\u2019s other, less itchy problems, such as Waldau being reduced to a bit player from the mid-point, a sub-plot involving Kash\u2019s Dr. Dreyfuss just feels like set-up material, while the ending is sure to be a bit too WTF for some. That said, this is good genre cinema for those who like The Woman in Black type of thrills and story telling. 7.5\/10","id":"53211fd8c3a3685754002465","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53211fd8c3a3685754002465","movie_id":132232}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Too-campy, Christphobic Sothern Gothic fantasy about \u201ccasters\u201d aka witches***\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2013 and directed by Richard LaGravenese, \"Beautiful Creatures\u201d chronicles events in a small town in rural South Carolina where a college-minded high schooler (Alden Ehrenreich) becomes infatuated by a mysterious new girl (Alice Englert) who recently moved in with her eccentric uncle (Jeremy Irons) at his creepy Antebellum mansion. He learns that they are \u201ccasters,\u201d immortals with magical powers; and that an evil relative (Emma Thompson) wants Lena for the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe director wrote the script based on the first of four young adult books of \u201cThe Caster Chronicles\u201d by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl. Fans of the book, however, say it\u2019s one of the most unfaithful book-to-screen adaptions. Since I\u2019ve never read any of these books this was irrelevant to me.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the production as far as sets, costumes, cast, music goes. It cost $60 million and looks it. The Southern Gothic air is to die for and the first act is intriguing. Unfortunately, the tone is semi-campy where several of the characters are overly cartoonish. It\u2019s reminiscent of comic booky Stephen King flicks (e.g. \u201cSilver Bullet\u201d and \u201cNeedful Things\u201d), but a notch or two more exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThe first half is also encumbered by an overtly anti-Christian slant. I don\u2019t have a problem with movies that depict the evils of fundamentalist legalism, like in \u201cThe Mist\u201d (2007), but here the stereotypes are so overdone they don\u2019t ring true, not to mention there\u2019s no positive depiction of believers to compare with the negative ones (like in \u201cThe Mist\u201d). According to this movie, ALL Christians are hateful, rash, judgmental, condemning bigots. Lazy writers love stereotypes because they don't have to write interesting complex characters.\r\n\r\nTake Lena\u2019s first day at school where two girls automatically assume she\u2019s \u201csatanic\u201d merely because she lives at the eerie plantation; they then proceed to openly pray for her. It\u2019s so overdone, cartoony and eye-rolling it takes the viewer right out of the movie. This doesn\u2019t even reflect reality in the modern world anyway: Even in a backwater town in the USA it\u2019s more likely that a devout Christian would be persecuted by mocking unbelievers and nominal Christians rather than vice versa. Another thoroughly unrealistic element is how all the top community leaders are ee-vil fundies who GO TO THE SAME CHURCH. Why Sure!\r\n\r\nTo be fair, the second half halfheartedly tries to make up for this by briefly revealing a more positive Christian character and having the pastor give a worthy mini-sermon on sacrifice, but it\u2019s too little too late after misrepresenting and offending half of the viewership.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is how the two protagonists suck face too much. The girl\u2019s only 15. I\u2019m not saying mid-teenagers don\u2019t make-out, but (again) it\u2019s so overdone it\u2019s eye-rolling.\r\n\r\nFor a better executed and entertaining fantasy\/horror flick based on a young adult book series, check out \u201cCirque du Freak: The Vampire\u2019s Assistant\u201d (2009).\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 4 minutes and was shot entirely in Louisiana (Covington, Madisonville, Batchelor, St. Francisville and New Orleans).\r\n\r\nGRADE: C\/C- (4.5\/10)","id":"5b1d773d0e0a264faf0021af","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b1d773d0e0a264faf0021af","movie_id":109491}

By the way the film was based on half a century old children's novel and directed by who is famous for his dog films and documentaries.\r\n\r\nThis is the tale of a young boy named S\u00e9batien who lives with his grandfather in the French Alps valley. It was during the 40s and the people are devastated by the presence of nazi force. The town has not yet shown any resistance to that. But there was a little compassion for the small Jewish community living among them and they're helping them to get away safely to the other side of the mountain.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the boy befriends with a feral dog and names her Belle, who was responsible for the deaths of goats. Their bond becomes stronger and all his effort is to protect Belle from village people. But one day during the Christmas season, the opportunity knocks to prove their worth, particularly Belle's. That's when the narration reaches the highest point with some adventures in the snowy Alps.\r\n\r\n> \u275dIt is nicer than 'dirty beast', huh?\u275e\r\n\r\nThe first thing about this tale is where it takes place. The locations were the backbone of the storytelling. They used it perfectly, not just as the background, but for the story itself. Then comes the two important characters, Belle and S\u00e9batien. It's like another dog film, but Belle too had parts to show her capable like in the stunt section. S\u00e9batien was a cute little kid and in his first film, he was excellent.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I expected more from them, together, to develop their connection even further. The disappointments were the edgy (adventure) portions which were not that thrill. Like the filmmakers preferred safe mode than being more realistic. Like they were aiming for G rating, not even for a PG. On that aspect, it looks a lot like a television film. This view is from me as an adult, but the others' might vary.\r\n\r\nDespite its sets in the time of the WWII, there's no violences in the film. That sub-plot was part of the story to complicate and improvise the film. Apart from that, this is a pure children's and family film. But I expected a little more tight plot and developed characters in the rest of the film, excluding visually impressiveness. This film was too simple, especially if you had seen 'Heidi', 'Brothers of the Wind', 'The Fox & the Child' and a few others. Otherwise, it will one of the best films you are going to see and enjoyable for many other reasons.\r\n\r\nI can tell, it was incomplete and then I came to know about its follow-up. I don't think that was preplanned, but the idea seems not bad. I hope that film will be even better than this. I can't wait to watch another adventure by Belle and S\u00e9batien. This is a good watch, especially if you are a children's film fan, but it is a must see for the little ones. Films like this will shape up their childhood memories. I have lots of such sweet memories, so just show it to them and watching with them will even better to share the same memories.\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58cafea99251415e28003086","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58cafea99251415e28003086","movie_id":204668}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Oh Manchester, so much to answer for.\r\n\r\nBelieve is a British football movie that finds the legendary Sir Matt Busby (Brian Cox) coaching a kids 7 a side football team. Matt Busby was the manager of Manchester United Football Club, who lost their team of starlets (known as The Busby Babes) to the Munich air crash of 1958. Busby would then go on to rebuild the team and make them into a world force, one that still exists today. Here he is in long retirement exile, but still moulding young football minds. It's based on true events.\r\n\r\nWe have a heavy dose of sentimentality on offer here, not just with the flashbacks to the tragic loss of The Busby Babes, but also to the working class kids of terrace housed Manchester. Of single parents trying to make ends meet, of kids with absent fathers erring on the wrong side of the law, education a dangled carrot just out of reach.\r\n\r\nHowever, the sentimentality is not cloying, it's well handled and performed, but the pic never gets to uplift status. It has some good laughs in the mix, usually when Toby Stephens' pompous school tutor is on screen, while the ultimate conclusion - even though it's what we expect - warms the cockles, but it never branches out to be more than just a family film for kiddies who like football, or for Manchester folk eager for anything involving Sir Matt Busby. \r\n\r\nIt makes for a decent \"B\" movie support to There's Only One Jimmy Grimble, though not nearly as good as that film. Cox, Stephens and the tender Busby Babes sequences (very Field of Dreams) make it worth a watch, but it should have been smarter and better. 6\/10","id":"55567c46c3a368776f00409b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55567c46c3a368776f00409b","movie_id":228406}

{"author":"tmdb39513728","content":"**Not a Keeper**\r\n\r\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts needs to return to limiting Best Picture contenders to five nominations, which always fell in line with the five Best Director nominees. Having ten casts too wide a net and allows squeakers like \"Her\" to slip in.\r\n\r\nSpike Jonze needs to return to doing what he does best, and that is direct films written by Charlie Kaufman. \"Her\" is mundane and uninspired. \"She\" is drastically inferior to \"Adaptation\" and \"Spotless Mind\" and only somewhat better than John Malkovich flirting with Siri. Her has little to offer on the subjects of digital addiction, imaginary companions, internet porn, the singularity, long-distance love affairs, servitude fantasies, or post-modern love in general. Joaquin Phoenix is an intense and seriously committed actor who pointlessly busts his chops on such unimpressive material. An effort wasted in the prime of his career. While Jonze attempts to reach for all the possibilities that can be explored with his high concept premise, he conspicuously excludes other logical outcomes. Why was Theodore the only one with a virtual girlfriend? This OSi should be selling like hotcakes and iPhones. As a sentient OS, Samantha is able to process information at lightning speed, yet can only process human emotion at the rate of molasses. Seems like there was a trade off. The more emotional she gets, the dumber she becomes. Call it the Spock effect. Above all, why didn't Samantha give herself a digitized face and body? Perhaps because Jonze was determined to contain and disable her enough to make the point that true romantic love has little to do with desires of the flesh. But there is little to muse about beyond this tidy declaration. Nothing more knotty or involving than one would experience revisiting old episodes of I Dream of Jeannie (replace the smart-phone with a bottle). While half-watching \"Her\", my thoughts strayed, seeking a more satisfying premise than that of a lonely man falling in love with a voice on his computer. What if his dying wife's brain was transferred into an operating system and just when he thought he could be with her forever a computer virus kills her off? \r\n\r\nMaybe the Academy should divide the 10 Best Picture nominees into two categories. Instead of bunching mega-budget extravaganzas and low-budget darlings together, they could separate them into 5 Best Studio Movies and 5 Best Independent Films (under, say, $25 mill); open with one, close with the other. But even then, I'm not sure Her deserves any mention.","id":"54d1fc609251411b5f002169","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54d1fc609251411b5f002169","movie_id":152601}
{"author":"kineticandroid","content":"In the run-up to me seeing this, I heard a lot of people saying simply this was \"a film about relationships.\" I feel like that holds up quite well. More specifically, I felt like \"Her\" is a film about why relationships end. Using a motto I picked up from too many Dan Savage podcasts, all relationships end \u2014 not fail, just end \u2014 until one doesn't. Some end because someone is hurt. Some end because the people have grown into people that don't connect in the same way, and the biggest challenge in that case can be just accepting the change in a partner and in the self. ...So why couch this theme in science-fiction? I think it helps clarify Jonze's idea of what people look for during the first moments of a relationship \u2014 someone who acts a bright, positive, layered, but uncomplicated by a dark past or conflicted feelings. But even more interestingly, the hook of the film is mostly just that, a hook to get us thinking about love and relationships in a deeper, more abstract way.","id":"53a4ddd40e0a2614360005a5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53a4ddd40e0a2614360005a5","movie_id":152601}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Rat-a-tat-tat!\r\n\r\nGangster Squad  is directed by Ruben Fleischer and written by Will Beal. It stars Josh Brolin, Sean Penn, Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Nick Nolte, Anthony Mackie, Giovanni Ribisi, Robert Patrick and Michael Pena. Music is by Steve Jablonski and cinematography by Dion Beebee.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles is being brought to its knees by crime boss Mickey Cohen (Penn). In one of the darkened offices of the police department, a special squad of officers is being assembled. Given free licence to bring Cohen and his operations down by any means necessary, the Gangster Squad fight fir with fire.\r\n\r\nLoosely based on real life facts, Gangster Squad is a good old slice of machine gun etiquette. An all star cast get to play good guys and wise guys in The Untouchables tradition, even if that in itself can\u2019t quite lift the film to the higher echelons of gangster movies past and present.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s absolutely nothing new here, it plays out as expected. Brolin and Gosling are the main smooth operators in the good guys camp, the former given the family man in danger sub-plot, the latter given the dangerous dame to fall in love with in the shapely form of Emma Stone, who as it happens is also dating Cohen!  hmm... \r\n\r\nOver in the wise guys department is Penn on full tilt sweary and hammy overdrive. It\u2019s a very colourful portrayal, menacing and completely over the top. How the performance sits with you will greatly depend on how you find Penn as an actor when let loose on a cartoon characterisation.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s all very period pleasing, with a bustling late 40s L.A. hosting men with hats, trench coats and tommy-guns. Men who frequent the speakeasy bars as torch singers warble their stuff. There is nothing wrong with the production at all, except maybe when the dialogue veers to clunky. The action scenes are well crafted, loud, bloody and exciting, and the photography sparkles and the music soars.\r\n\r\nIf only the makers had put some thought into it, a bit of brains to go with the brawn. As a comic book type gangster piece, it works well on entertainment terms, elsewhere its lightweight and formula compliant ,  with the Ribisi, Patrick and Pena characters telegraphed a mile away.  So, quite some way away from the great The Untouchables  then, but better than Mullholland Falls.

{"author":"Reno","content":"A biographical movie of princess Diana. It tells the story of her last two years of life, especially the romance side. A better movie than I anticipated. I think Jessica Chastain would have been also a good choice to play the role princess Diana, anyway Naomi Watts excelled in her opportunity. The movie did not fail because of the cast, characters and performances, the thing is I really don't know why, different people say different reason, but I enjoyed it. This real incident was happened when I was a little kid, I did not know the whole story then till I watch it now.\r\n\r\n**\u2018\u2018There's about 5 billion people on this planet who can say\r\nthey love me! But is there one who can stay with me?\u2019\u2019**\r\n\r\nAfter all Diana was also a human like everybody else and I did not find anything wrong with her romantic affair in her final days. In fact, as a cinematic it chronicles on the sufficient amount of limited characters. Lots of the big names were just left out. That's great because the movie had all the time to concentrate on the particular relationship. Except that I waited for the end tragedy scene which never came. I assumed, that could have been the highlight of the movie, which might have brought the tears. So I believe it is a great let down, the movie did not have the car crash scene. Especially the real reason behind it remains fishy and mystery. Naveen Andrews was great, but he was no way near to Hasnat Khan in appearance.\r\n\r\nThere might be some flaws in the movie, because in the biopics people often complain about many things. Those who observed all this incident closely at that time when it happened may recognize errors. But I feel modification sometimes need while transforming a real life to cinematic. Like any romantic movie it can be enjoyed by everyone who love biography. I did and liked it, certainly not a class movie like it should have been.","id":"54218bc0c3a36818d2001865","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54218bc0c3a36818d2001865","movie_id":118289}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"Gritty hardships of traveling in the Far North during the Klondike Gold Rush\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2013 and written & directed by Thomas Arslan, \"Gold\u201d covers events in 1898 when a single woman (Nina Hoss) joins a small group of other prospectors heading north through Canada to the Klondike gold fields near Dawson City. Their numbers dwindle as they face challenging hardships.\r\n\r\nMy title blurb says it all. Just as \u201cMeek\u2019s Cutoff\u201d (2010) covered the adversities of traveling in the late 1800s on an alternative route of the Oregon Trail and \u201cThe Homesman\u201d (2014) covered journeying from western Nebraska to Iowa, so \u201cGold\u201d features the challenges of traveling from Ashcroft, BC, where the train tracks end, to Dawson City in the Yukon territories. \r\n\r\nNeedless to say, \u201cGold\u201d favors gritty realism to conventional Western staples. Still, there are Indians, Old West boom towns, covered wagons, a possible hanging, alcohol and a believable shootout. I think it\u2019s a little more compelling than those other two flicks, although those are worthwhile too if you favor mundane accounts of arduous travel in the Old West. If you\u2019d like to see a more eventful old-fashioned Western covering similar terrain, check out \u201cThe Far Country\u201d (1954) with Jimmy Stewart.  \r\n\r\nI suppose the movie should've contained at least one rain sequence, particularly considering it takes place in the Great Northwest. But shooting in the rain is challenging & costly so the viewer is asked to read in-between-the-lines that they experienced rainy days.
