For former Squeeze frontman Glenn Tilbrook, touring meant 18 wheelers, hotel suites and police-escorted limos. Almost 20 years later, like many other established artists, Tilbrook's music now finds its audience through an independent route. In November 2001, to support the release of his debut solo CD, Tilbrook embarked on a different kind of independent route as he took to the road in America: One man, two guitars and a mobile home. \"Glenn Tilbrook: One for the Road\" follows him on every step of that journey: arriving in the States; picking up his mobile home; performing the shows; meeting the fans; camping at campgrounds; packing away his guitars. All access, all of the time. It's an intimate look at how an established musician adjusts to his new independent surroundings. It's a commentary on the current state of the music industry. But, most importantly, it's a human-interest story that transcends its musical base.","poster_path":null,"popularity":0.6,"id_imdb":"tt0397062"}

Tracing the origins of his remarkably unique sensibility, the film journeys back to Bickford's childhood in a competitive household during the paranoia of the Cold War and examines his relationship with his father, George, who is facing the onset of Alzheimer's Disease. Bickford's films, especially the dark and magical clay animations he created for Frank Zappa in the 1970s, have achieved cult status worldwide. Entirely self-taught, the 56-year-old Bickford works alone in a makeshift basement studio in his house near Seattle. Bickford's father George, a retired Boeing engineer of the Cold War era, is the other main character. George's talent for maximizing the space inside airplanes and missiles parallels his son's animations, which often contain dozens of inch-tall figures fighting battles on a tiny set.","poster_path":"\/nfzFnl7AdoVA7GdXqG0Kv48cjQf.jpg","popularity":2.69,"id_imdb":"tt0397538"}

Poised for huge commercial success, Jeff Buckley's untimely death kept him on the periphery of popular music. \"Amazing Grace: Jeff Buckley\", a passionately crafted documentary, sets out to investigate the extraordinary phenomenon of Jeff Buckley, a deceased musician of modest commercial success, with only one full-length album, who has become a veritable tour de force of inspiration for artists across the globe. Interviews include all four of the Jeff Buckley Band members, friends, family, colleagues, critics, DJ's, producers, and fans. From Sydney, New York, and London to Memphis, Montpelier, and Los Angeles, the film takes viewers on an expansive yet incredibly intimate trip through the world of Jeff Buckley, and explores how he continues to inspire his fans - from classical composers to rock n' roll superstars and everyone in-between.","poster_path":null,"popularity":0.872,"id_imdb":"tt0429570"}
