{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Exceptional drama about a detective in Sydney\u2026 and so much more***\r\n\r\n\"Lantana\" is an Australian drama from 2001 about four couples in the Sydney area (where the film was shot). There are some important peripheral characters as well. The husband of the main couple is a detective going through a mid-life crisis (Anthony LaPaglia). His wife (Kerry Armstrong) knows something's wrong and is getting counseling. The marriage of her counselor (Barbara Hershey) is also troubled due to the death of their young daughter 18 months earlier. The woman the detective is having a fling with (Rachael Blake) lives next door to a couple whose marriage is the only solid relationship in the story (Vince Colosimo & Daniela Farinacci). Or is it? When one of these women turns up missing the counselor's husband becomes a suspect (Geoffrey Rush).\r\n\r\nThe reason the film's called \"Lantana\" is because lantana is a tangled shrub common in Australia, which represents the entanglements of the lives of the characters. It also symbolizes marriage since lantana has a sweet but bitter smell: it's beautiful with its flowers, but has \"stings\"; its branches weave together in a complicated way and in the story a woman is caught in the complexity of it.\r\n\r\n\"Lantana\" is the antithesis of big, dumb, effects-laden \"blockbusters,\" which oddly enough often become boring with their overload of \"exciting\" things going on. \"Lantana\" effectively shows that ordinary life is more interesting and compelling, if done right. Human nature is explored through a blend of passionate emotions, misconceptions, betrayals, anger, premature conclusions, vanity, duty, ethics, lies, honesty, loyalty, repentance and restoration.\r\n\r\nThree of my all-time favorite dramas are \"Grand Canyon\u201d (1991), \"Snow Angels\" (2007) and \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d (1994). I place \"Lantana\" in their company. That's how exceptional it is.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 1 minute.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A","id":"5dd0d1062d531a0018d905bb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dd0d1062d531a0018d905bb","movie_id":9523}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***War of the rats in crumbling Stalingrad during WWII***\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2001 and directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud, \"Enemy at the Gates\" takes place in the last four months of 1942 during the pivotal Battle of Stalingrad. Russian troops are carted in by the literal trainloads as the Germans attack\/bomb the city. Once the dust clears the situation settles into a more personal battle of sharpshooting wills. A lowly young Russian soldier named Vassili (Jude Law) distinguishes himself for his shooting skills and is promoted as a national hero to motivate the Russian cause. After numerous German officers are assassinated, Major K\u00f6nig (Ed Harris), the top German sniper, is assigned to seek out and eliminate Vassili.\r\n\r\nMost WWII films take place on the Western Front whereas \"Enemy\" is one of only two mainline films I can think of that address the Eastern front, the other being Sam Peckinpah's underrated \"Cross of Iron\" (1977).\r\n\r\nThree things stuck in my mind after seeing \u201cEnemy at the Gates\u201d years ago: (1.) The opening sequence where the Russian troops are boated across the Volga to join the fight is extremely harrowing, not far removed from the opening D-Day invasion in \u201cSaving Private Ryan\u201d (1998), but different. \u201cEnemy\u201d is worth viewing for this sequence alone. (2.) The city-in-rubble sets with bodies strewn everywhere had a lasting impression on me as did the scurrying-like-rats-through-the-rubble warfare. (3.) Some may find this weird, but I always remembered the discreet lovemaking scene while the soldiers lain in the rubble trying to sleep. I'm not sure why this left an impression, maybe because it struck me as so real: Men & women would be drawn to one another and mate even in the worst possible scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe film was based on the book \"War of the Rats\" by David L. Robbins and thus intentionally provokes the imagery of human rats scurrying through the debris. The cast also includes Joseph Fiennes as the political officer who elevates Vassili to hero status via his pamphlets and articles, while Rachel Weisz plays the romantic interest between the two. Ron Perlman is also on hand in a limited role as Vassili's sharpshooting comrade.\r\n\r\nAs with any film based on historical events there are facts-obsessed critics who decry the lack of authenticity in this or that detail (e.g. \"The zippers on the trousers aren't right, blasphemy!!\"), but \"Enemy\" gets the gist correct and, besides, it motivates the viewer to research the actual Battle of Stalingrad. What more can you ask for? \r\n\r\nThe fact is Vassili had 260 verified Nazi kills and played a key role in motivating the Russians to victory in the Battle of Stalingrad, the largest and bloodiest battle in the history of warfare (with roughly 2 million killed, wounded or captured). The movie effectively shows how the Russian combatants weren't necessarily professionally trained soldiers; many of them were peasants, workers, teachers, mailmen, farmers, etc. They knew they could die the next morning hence they celebrated (and made love) while they could. Stalingrad was one of the major turning points of World War II; from then on it was all downhill for Germany.\r\n\r\nFINAL WORD: \"Enemy at the Gates\" details an oft-ignored important aspect of WWII, the Eastern front. It has several memorable scenes, especially the opening crossing of the Volga and also a clever sequence involving a large shard of reflective glass.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 11 minutes and was shot entirely in Germany (Brandenburg and Bavaria).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+","id":"5b353c659251413c5802717f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b353c659251413c5802717f","movie_id":853}

I quite liked that film, although I did feel their vivacious stylizations interfered with the telling of the story. Seeing this earlier film of theirs confirmed that suspicion, though it's still a fine film. Though Johnny Depp (the brothers' 5th choice for the lead) does a fine job as the film's protagonist (I haven't read Alan Moore's graphic novel yet, so I can't say how this filmic adaptation compares), it certainly would have been interesting to see how any of their previous choices would have done (in order of their preference): Daniel Day-Lewis, Sean Connery, Jude Law and Brad Pitt (but especially either of the first two). It has a fine supporting cast, is beautiful to look at and is consistently intriguing. I especially liked Heather Graham (I think this is solidly amongst her best work), Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane and, most significantly, Katlin Cartlidge. Boy, do I ever miss her in films made ever since.","id":"57b3795cc3a36875d5000d71","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57b3795cc3a36875d5000d71","movie_id":768}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I cannot say that I am an outright fan of old era British crime stories but I do fancy them now and then. This one is a rather dark, grim and gloomy story perfectly suitable as a evening movie at this time of the year when darkness already starts to come quickly and matches the candlelight mood of Victorian London.\r\n\r\nI found this a quite nice movie. Well up to its very end which I have to admit is way too tragic for my taste. The voyage to the end was well worth watching though. The dark scenery is very well done. Beautiful and depressing at the same time. It is yet another Jack the Ripper based story and it is pretty much pure fiction loosely based on the character of Jack the Ripper. It is a good and well implemented story though and it was enjoyable to follow Inspector Abelard unravel to true reason behind the murders.\r\n\r\nAs far as I am concerned the acting was without any major faults and generally of high standard although it is perhaps a bit sad that Johnny Depp again proves that he plays best in roles that portrays a more or less crazy, even insane, character.\r\n\r\nThe movie is not as gory as one perhaps and it certainly would not classify as a horror movie. Most of the violence is hidden from the viewer although there are a couple of scenes which are a wee bit \u201csplattery\u201d but only if you really have a weak stomach for these things and if you do perhaps you should not watch serial killer movies in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe ending took a star or two off this movies rating but otherwise it was surprisingly enjoyable.","id":"543d28d7c3a36815f60019ad","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/543d28d7c3a36815f60019ad","movie_id":768}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"From Alan Moore, the Hughes brothers and Johnny Depp\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2001 and directed by the Hughes brothers, \"From Hell\" details the Jack the Ripper slayings in the slummy Whitechapel district of London in autumn, 1888. Johnny Depp plays an opium-addicted detective while Robbie Coltrane appears as his colleague. Heather Graham is on hand as a prostitute that captures the Detective\u2019s interest.\r\n\r\nThe film was based on Alan Moore\u2019s graphic novel of the same name. Moore condemned the change of his \"gruff\" version of Frederick Abberline with an \"absinthe-swilling dandy,\u201d referring to the protagonist played by Depp. In real life, there\u2019s no evidence that Abberline \u201cchased the dragon\u201d or that he had \u201cpsychic visions.\u201d Speaking of real life, Moore\u2019s graphic novel was based in large part on the royal conspiracy theory popularized in Stephen Knight's 1976 book \u201cJack the Ripper: The Final Solution.\u201d This is one of several theories on the identity of the slayer. True or (probably) not, it makes for a good story.\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom Hell\u201d plays like a Hammer film, but with a blockbuster budget in the modern era. A couple of comparable Hammer flicks are \u201cFrankenstein Must Be Destroyed\u201d (1969) and \u201cTaste the Blood of Dracula\u201d (1970). \u201cFrom Hell\u201d even shares a minor subplot with the latter (high society \u2018gentlemen\u2019 in the Victorian era secretly partaking of taboo hedonistic pleasures). Like Hammer\u2019s Gothic horror catalog, you can expect top hats & black coats, cobblestone streets, alluring women, a ghastly killer (or monster) and lush colors.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 2 minutes and was shot in Prague, Czech Republic, and England (Boscastle & Goldings).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B","id":"5afb314e0e0a263b9300e603","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5afb314e0e0a263b9300e603","movie_id":768}

Lifting it just above average is the fact that our two sibling protagonists have viable discussions before venturing into the realm of horror staple requirements, although the picture is \"B\" movie in substance, it does however attempt to be credible in its story telling.\r\n\r\nSadly though, after a wonderfully edgy first half, the picture drops down in standard, the introduction of \"The Creeper\" may well be a necessity, but it shifts the film to such a degree, it rapidly loses its creepy momentum. Not that the second half of the film is a disaster, far from it, it's got a scary fun vibe to it, it's just that it promises so much, but ultimately runs out of steam. Jeepers Creepers was successful enough to spawn inferior sequels, with the \"Creeper\" of the piece firmly entering the horror hall of fame, thus an argument for the film having done its job seems totally viable, it's just sad that it didn't stay on the side of edgy and become a horror classic. 6\/10","id":"5cb3dd08c3a3683c20b1040a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cb3dd08c3a3683c20b1040a","movie_id":8922}

The story starts in the homeland of the Hobbits (innocent, diminutive humanoids) where Frodo (Elijah Wood) is instructed by the noble wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to quickly leave the Shire with the powerful One Ring in his possession. Gandalf and Frodo are later accompanied by seven others, the titular \u2018Fellowship of the Ring,\u2019 to take the ring to the only place it can be destroyed, the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the main cast include Sean Astin (Sam), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), Sean Bean (Boromir), Christopher Lee (Saruman), Orlando Bloom (Legolas), John Rhys-Davies (Gimli) and Hugo Weaving (Elrond).        \r\n\r\nThis three-hour fantasy features a diverse cast of colorful characters, quaint beings and settings, moments of genuine wonder, dark ee-vil creatures, high adventure, thrilling brutal action, a superb score, magnificent locations (forests, mountains, rivers, etc.), and wondrous CGI sets. The film LOOKS and SOUNDS so great that it\u2019d be sinful to give it a lower rating. \r\n\r\nThere are problems, however, at least for those who aren\u2019t uber-fans of Tolkien.

Thirdly, except for maybe Frodo and Gandalf, the characters are shallow and I didn\u2019t care much what happened to them. Fourthly, main protagonists getting seriously wounded and everyone else expressing their melodramatic concern gets redundant.  \r\n\r\nFifthly, there are only two females in the main cast (Liv Tyler as Arwen, a half-Elf princess, and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, a royal Elf); unfortunately, their parts aren\u2019t much more than glorified cameos. \u201cMythica: A Quest for Heroes\u201d (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $93 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. \r\n\r\nDespite these negatives, \u201cThe Fellowship of the Ring\u201d is the best of the trilogy and is a must for fantasy\/adventure aficionados, especially Tolkien fans.                      \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 58 minutes and was shot in New Zealand. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B\/B- (6.5\/10)","id":"5aa3628dc3a3687bfc004d51","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5aa3628dc3a3687bfc004d51","movie_id":120}

We just laid back in our seats in tedium for the remaining couple hours.\r\n\r\nIt's a curious thing that too much action and F\/X in a film can be boring. It may not seem logical but it's true; and \"The Mummy Returns\" is Exhibit A. I usually give certain movies second and third chances in the hope that my first impression may have been in error, which I\u2019ve done with this one over the years. Unfortunately I keep finding myself relatively detached from the story even though there are all kinds of exciting things going on; or, at least, things that SHOULD HAVE been exciting.\r\n\r\n\"The Mummy Returns\" has a lot going for it: A great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F\/X, etc. (although some of the CGI is woefully cartoony, like the Scorpion King at the close). It has great Indiana Jones appeal. Unfortunately it all adds up to a forgettable piece of cinematic dung. What went wrong? Simply put, no substance. \"The Mummy Returns\" abandons the characters while the plot is utilized as a clothesline for action and F\/X sequences.\r\n\r\nThe flick curiously has so many ingredients right, but it somehow utterly fails to absorb the viewer. It is unadulterated cinematic JUNK. It should be utilized in filmmaking classes as the quintessential example of style over substance or overKILL: having all the right elements, including budget, and yet stupefyingly fumbling the ball.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes (overlong), and was shot in England, Morocco, Jordan and Egypt. \r\n\r\nGRADE: C-","id":"5debe524daf57c0019ea570d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5debe524daf57c0019ea570d","movie_id":1734}

The scenery is of rustique planetary habitats and travel through interplanetary space in an equally rugged vessel.

Visually it is absolutely stunning in beautiful black and white with high contrast that accentuate the grittiness. The soundtrack is excellent and the musical numbers work well too.

{"author":"LadyGreenEyes","content":"Overall, I give this four stars.  Not five, because some of the changes really bug me, as a long-time Tolkien fan, but a solid four.  \r\n\r\nThe casting, to start, was brilliant.  Sean Astin was the absolute perfect choice for Sam, and did a remarkable job bringing that character to life for us.  He really WAS Sam, in this role, in a very deep way.  I always liked his acting, but here, he showed how talented he actually is.  Just amazing.  Elijah Wood gives a great performance of Frodo, and those expressive eyes of his really add a lot of depth to the emotions the character goes through, which are such an important part of the story.  Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan both did great work, for our other two main hobbits.  Their smiles, their singing; just every aspect of these characters was so real.  Viggo Mortensen, of course, was excellent.  He's always good, and though I never would have pictures him as Aragorn, he delivered everything we could hope for.  Great choice for that role!  John Rhys-Davies, as expected, gave us the Gimli we wanted.  Phenomenal actor, and I can't imagine anyone doing that role better.  Orlando Bloom plays a convincing Legolas, and handles the nuances of being an elf quite well.  Sean Bean as Boromir was outstanding, bringing the strength of that character to life, and making us love him.  Then we have Ian McKellen, as Gandalf.  I could never have chosen someone for that role, but the casting folks hit a home run with this one.  Everything about his character was just right.  Literally everything.  I can't read the books without seeing these people in these roles now.  The rest of the cast ws good as well.\r\n\r\nThen we have the setting.  New Zealand has to have some of the most utterly gorgeous scenery on the planet.  Seeing it in these movies was great, and convincingly Middle Earth, and seeing more since, in other videos, just WOW!  Thanks, to the people of New Zealand, for allowing this to be filmed there!  \r\n\r\nThe sets were just fantastic.  Everything looked as good as I'd always hoped it would look, with all the charm, mystery, and wonder  Tolkien fan could hope for.  From Bag end to Rivendell to the vastness of \r\nMiddle Earth, everything we saw was just right.  \r\n\r\nThe only issues I had were some of the changes.  Yes, I know things don't always work in movies as they do in books, but when whole sections are just omitted, that bothers me.  It's not like the movies weren't long already!  That omitted section, with which Tolkien fans will be quite familiar, was a very important part of the plot!  I also didn't care for some of the other changes, and the way Arwen was used, the scene at the river being one example.  \r\n\r\nAll in all, though, this was a well done movie, and even though some things bug me, this film, and the rest of the series, will be viewed many times.  Classics, worth collecting and treasuring.","id":"5c15adc5c3a36866cc3713d9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c15adc5c3a36866cc3713d9","movie_id":120}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Yeah, right, and no harm ever came from reading a book. You remember how that one went?\r\n\r\nAfter the financial success of \"The Mummy\" two years earlier, the sequel was inevitable. The big players from the first film are back, Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo and Oded Fehr. Stephen Sommers once again directs (and writes), Patricia Velasquez comes in to be a main player after her cameo in the first film, and young Freddie Boath plays the son of Rick and Evelyn who are now married. This time the cameo goes to Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson who plays The Scorpion King and who is replaced by a very bad CGI version of himself at film's finale.\r\n\r\nWhen the second sequel, \"The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor\" (2008), was released, Brendan Fraser went on record as saying that for \"The Mummy Returns\" they basically remade the film they had already made in 1999! This is absolutely true, some new characters and an expansion on the O'Connell romance have been put in to beef it up, while some Zombie Pygmies are around to add extra monster factor, but yes! It's a re-tread only with more money spent, more effects (and better effects apart from Scorpion King) and more noise. This actually is OK for those who enjoyed the first film immensely, because \"Returns\" is every bit as enjoyable as family blockbuster entertainment. The Worldwide box offices rang to the tune of over $330 million in profit. That's a lot of happy families you would think!.\r\n\r\nSo yes, it's a bit of a cheat, but much like the film before it, it gets away with it because the makers do everything they can to entertain the action\/adventure loving crowd. With legions of Anubis warriors, those awesome Pygmies and the all round funny by-play between a cast comfortable with the material (again), \"The Mummy Returns\" delivers exactly what can reasonably be expected of it. 7\/10","id":"5e13f7315907de0017e1dab6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e13f7315907de0017e1dab6","movie_id":1734}
{"author":"NeoBrowser","content":"Brooking no argument, history should quickly regard Peter Jackson\u2019s The Fellowship Of The Ring as the first instalment of the best fantasy epic in motion picture history. This statement is worthy of investigation for several reasons.\r\n\r\nFellowship is indeed merely an opening salvo, and even after three hours in the dark you will likely exit the cinema ravenous with anticipation for the further two parts of the trilogy. Fellowship is also unabashedly rooted in the fantasy genre. Not to be confused with the techno-cool of good science fiction, nor even the cutesy charm of family fare like Harry Potter, the territory of Tolkien is clearly marked by goo and goblins and gobbledegook. Persons with an aversion to lines such as, \u201cTo the bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm!\u201d are as well to stay within the Shire-like comforts of home (their loss).\r\n\r\nWith those caveats in place, it bears repeating: fantasy does not come finer. There are electrifying moments \u2014 notably the computer-assisted swooping camera through Isengard as it transforms into a factory for evil \u2014 when Jackson\u2019s flight of fancy approaches the sublime as the romantic poets would understand it: inspiring awe.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the thorny issue of Tolkien die-hards and their inevitable gripes \u2014 \u201cWhat no Tom Bombadil?\u201d \u2014 Jackson\u2019s screenplay (written in collaboration with Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens) is both bolder and more judicious than Steven Kloves\u2019 surprisingly timid retread of Harry Potter. In particular, rescuing the romance of Arwen and Aragorn from the footnotes and the elevation of Saruman to all-action bad guy actually has a corrective influence on Tolkien\u2019s often oblique and female-sparse source material.\r\n\r\nThere are problems, though. The three-hour running time is high on incident and low on discernible form. After successive detours to Elf habitats Rivendell (the watery home of Elrond) and Lothl\u00f3rien (the forest home of the Lady Galadriel), the uninitiated might well ask why these crazy Elf kids can\u2019t just live together and spare us all this attenuated dramatic structure.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the action clearly climaxes in the desperate flight from the Mines Of Moria, where the largely seamless SFX is showcased in the best possible light \u2014 total darkness \u2014 but the narrative demands a different, downbeat ending. Indeed, but for some fine emotional playing from Bean, Mortensen, Astin and Wood, the final fight might feel like a particularly brutal game of paintball in Bluebell Wood. But then, the real battles are yet to come...\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - Putting formula blockbusters to shame, Fellowship is impeccably cast and constructed with both care and passion: this is a labour of love that never feels laboured. Emotional range and character depth ultimately take us beyond genre limitations, and it deserves to play as wide as a certain Mr. Potter.\r\n\r\n5\/5\r\n\r\n- Colin Kennedy, Empire Magazine","id":"51ea51a4760ee3602024a27e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/51ea51a4760ee3602024a27e","movie_id":120}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"There can't be such devils out there. \r\n\r\nThe Pledge is directed by Sean Penn and adapted to screenplay by Jerzy Kromolowski and Mary Olson-Kromolowski from Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt's novel, \"The Promise\". It stars Jack Nicholson, Robin Wright Penn, Aaron Eckhart, Sam Shepard, Patricia Clarkson, Helen Mirren, Tom Noonan, Benicio Del Toro, Mickey Rourke, Dale Dickey, Vanessa Redgrave and Harry Dean Stanton. Music is by Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer, and cinematography by Chris Menges.\r\n\r\nPolice chief Jerry Black (Nicholson) is literally on his last day before retitement. But during his leaving party news filters through that a young girl has been brutally murdered. Talking his chiefs into letting him tag along to the crime scene, Black ends up breaking the dredful news to the girl's parents. There he pledges to the mother that he will find her daughter's killer.\r\n\r\nD\u00fcrrenmatt's source material has been mined a few times for other filmic ventures, where the best of the other bunch is \"Es geschah am hellichten Tag\" (\"It Happened in Broad Daylight\"). It is here, though, in Sean Penn's hands, that we get the version that got two thumbs up from the author, mostly because of the ending staying true to his work.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted from the off that this is not police procedural detective piece. This is a slow burn, moody and edgy picture, the kind that Penn excells at as an actor. Thankfully, in spite of it losing money at the box office, it shows Penn the perfect director for such material.\r\n\r\nIt obviously isn't a film for everyone, more so if not prepared for it being a picture about one man's tumbling emotional descent. As Jerry Black searches for the perpretrator of heinious crimes, he also is faced with a moral judgement call and a major affair of the heart.\r\n\r\nThe trick of the screnplay here is not in the red herrings and the little dangles of clues that appear to be on offer to Jerry, it's that we are never quite sure if Jerry is actually right in his belief of a child serial killer at work. Is it the product of a man so driven by the pledge he made, that he isn't thinking straight? Or worse losing his grip on sanity? The answer will only will out with the clinically daring finale. \r\n\r\nLead actors Nicholson and Wright Penn turn in some of their finest work, both responding to Sean's probing of troubled souls in search of an exit. There's an array of quality support actors in small parts, which is a testament to the pull that working with Penn did appeal. The musical score is nervy and sits smartly with the ethereal tones that Menges brings via his photographic lenses.\r\n\r\nThe Pledge is a haunting and disturbing character study that refuses to cop out. It achieves its aims and wasn't going to pander to any crowd pleasing bums on seats tactics. A dark thriller for grown ups who have the patience for such a telling, and perhaps more crucially are prepared to have their emotions tested with the finale. 9\/10","id":"5e94d6fd0792e100143ad07c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e94d6fd0792e100143ad07c","movie_id":5955}

As much as the film disturbs, it is as much an education of the human condition under trying circumstances. Moritz Bleibtreu & Justus von Dohnanyi play Tarek & Berus respectively, with both men giving superlative performances as the two lynch pins to the pic's unravelling terror.\r\n\r\nThis is not merely an experiment, but a test where the results are dangerously grounded in facts, it's bleak, it's at times harsh, but it actually is essential cinema for those looking for a kicker where the boot on the foot is all too real, one that and was once worn by the man next door to you.

Whiney libs that are unable to grasp fantasy and humor might be offended by the fat jokes, but the overall moral is commendable.\r\n\r\nThe flick scores pretty well in the feminine department with Paltrow in her prime and never looking better, speaking as someone who was never overly wowed by her.

But Harry is soon to find out that his past, and his destiny, is a truly remarkable, magical, and terrifying thing.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone arrived in a blaze of publicity, one of the most hyped and talked about motion pictures of the decade had finally arrived. The box office was guaranteed to bulge based on fandom book base alone, regardless of if the film got bad word of mouth or not, it was destined to be a monster smash hit. To someone like me who to this day has never read any of the Harry Potter books, it was easy for me to view objectively without comparison to the source - I enjoyed it immensely upon theatre release, and I still enjoy it equally as much now.\r\n\r\nDirector Christopher Columbus, I believe has wisely stayed loyal to the source material, and thus pleased the literature masses. Yet not all newcomers to the party were that taken by the magic on show, that's a little baffling to me because the budget explodes from the screen at every turn.

Pulsating and frantic with no amount of devilment to keep us intrigued throughout.\r\n\r\nThe characters are all perfectly formed in the first two thirds of the film, here Columbus pulls off a masterstroke by interjecting the character arcs with dashes of wonder so that we the audience never gets bored. The final reel plays out solidly as per the mysterious \"who done it\" core of the piece, but it's down to the previous work in the film that we actually care come the finale. Some great casting of the adults really helps to make the film triumph, with Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane (one of the best casting jobs of the decade I would say), Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Zoe Wanamaker all doing excellent work here. The kids are all newcomers that overnight were to become household names, all fresh faced and wet behind the ears, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint & Tom Felton are a delight to watch, and they all help to keep the feeling of charm constantly glowing up on the screen.\r\n\r\nOwls here, witches there, what's that strange three headed dog doing over there? The Harry Potter franchise begins with a bang and a whip of the wand, and I and gazillions of others personally love it. 8\/10","id":"5d38ee43b1f68d0012c2abea","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d38ee43b1f68d0012c2abea","movie_id":671}

But I think that this one can be liked by fans that aren't big fans of hip hop either because it boasts of such great quality and director Ernest Dickerson definitly knows his horrors with plenty of homages to old Italian horror, as well as serving as sort of a NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET in an urban setting.\r\n\r\nSnoop Dogg plays the 'boogeyman' and he does so really well, it was written with Snoop Dogg in mind so it works really well.\r\n\r\nNever aging Khalil Kain has one of the leads, he was also one of the leads in Dickerson's 1992 movie JUICE starring Kain, as well as Tupac Shakur and Omar Epps.\r\n\r\n'Scream Queen' Katherine Isabelle plays his sister, and yeah overall not a whole lot to complain about.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"1-0 to the Mean Machine.\r\n\r\nMean Machine is an English reworking of Robert Aldrich's 1974 beefcake Burt Reynolds starrer, The Longest Yard. Substituting Gridiron for Soccer, director Barry Skolnick, along with his roll call of British \"faces\", is only aiming for one market.\r\n\r\nThat of the footie worshipping clan that primarily resides within the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nVery much a long way from competing on the same playing field as Aldrich's superior movie, Mean Machine does have enough about it to make it an enjoyable viewing outside of the excellently constructed soccer match that fills out the last third of the piece. But with the film's reputation being far from good, the chance that many others feel the same as me are pretty remote. About as remote as Accrington Stanley winning the English Premiere League one feels.\r\n\r\nThe problem would seem to lay with the first hour, violence and humour thrust together does not always yield great rewards, and so it be with the wet behind the ears direction from Skolnick. Caught between a tough portrayal of British prison life and outright slapstick, it's an odd bedfellow that Skolnick can't quite get right. And with Guy Ritchie on the sidelines donning the \"supervising producer\" shirt, one can't help thinking that Ritchie would have made substantially more with the material to hand. But as \"I\" say, there's enough there for the discerning fan of blood and banter.\r\n\r\nLed by the watchable Jones, the cast, outside of the miscast David Hemmings as the Governor, pull out the stops to entertain the terrace faithful. Danny Dyer haters will enjoy him getting knocked about as he plays simpleton Billy Limpet, while Jason Statham is a joy as Monk, a Jock that even the Jocks are afraid of. While also putting in scene stealing shifts of note are Jamie Sives, Vas Blackwood and Omid Djalili. It's no piece of work to rank in the higher echelons of British movies - or sports movies in general for that matter. But in spite of its soggy formula and over reliance on the template film it's working from, it's very funny at times, and if you like soccer? Well the actual match is well worth the wait. 7\/10\r\n\r\nFootnote: The Longest Yard\/Mean Machine was met with another re- imaging in 2005 with Adam Sandler as the disgraced lead protagonist. Proof positive that it's either a formula that many can't resist? Or that it's one that some feel still hasn't yet met its potential?","id":"5772656192514147b1001679","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5772656192514147b1001679","movie_id":9991}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A wrong timeline, but a hilarious adventure!\r\n\r\nI remember seeing the French version of this film on the television when I was a kid, but don't recall much other than two men from the medieval in the streets of the modern world. Somehow I found this, and after some research I chose this version to watch which I thought easy to understand, as well as for the reason some updates were made in this. Well, I know nothing can beat the original, but for those haven't seen the original, this is not a bad one. Quite an enjoyable film with a simple theme and a simple adventure.\r\n\r\nSeems a very familiar concept, but surely a unique product. Jean Reno was brilliant and so his sidekick and other supporting characters. Top notch jokes, felt like I had some loud laughs after a long time. Of course, there are some flaws, but minors, like relocating from Europe to the US since it is a Hollywood production. It is a time travel theme in fantasy. There's no time machine, instead a wizard behind the adventure through the time.\r\n\r\nA perfect family film. It's not about prediction, since watching the first scene you would know what follows it and how it all ends. So you're relieved from guessing stuff and can sit back relaxedly and enjoy it as much you can. It is your average film, but if you're seeking a good comedy, then it is surely above that. There are thousands of masterpiece comedies, this is not one of them, though must see from this genre.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"5787cc5692514131c70012f1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5787cc5692514131c70012f1","movie_id":56715}

Sure enough, JP3 feels like (is) a quick coin in, the formula is straight up simple from the executive desks, dump a load of annoying characters on an island and see if they can survive being chomped on by dinosaurs. That the makers managed to get Sam Neil and William H. Macy on board with such a turgid script, is nothing short of amazing. Perhaps just as Neil's character is duped in the film, so shall it be in real life...\r\n\r\nStill, it's no abomination by any stretch of the imagination. Johnston, realising that the audience wants dino action, wastes no time in letting the critters loose on our motley crew.

You may find yourself hoping the irritable T\u00e9a Leoni gets eaten, and you may find yourself laughing at some of Alessandro Nivola's scenes when you are not meant to (is that a Superman homage?), but at least it's fun enough to get away with the bad points.

This is why I love movies, why I rent movies because every now and then you come across a gem. This movie reminds me of \"DIVA\", but it is ten times better the DIVA. It starts with a bang when an Algerian prostitute named Noemie begs for a ride from Paul and his wife Helene as they drive by the scene of her merciless beating at the hands of three pimps. Paul locks the doors and, after the pimps have gone, leaving Noemie unconscious, Paul gets out of the car only to wipe Noemie's blood off the windshield. The story is about Noemie and the other female characters' struggles to find individuality and freedom from under the thumb of the men in their lives. But the film doesn't stop there - it also makes observations (and hence, commentary) about French society, Muslim cultures, and a variety of other aspects of modern life.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"I got two words for you, mini-bar.\r\n\r\nLiterally fresh out of prison, Danny Ocean is busy setting up a seemingly impossible robbery. The plan, along with ten other experts he has roped in, is to rob the main vault at Las Vegas that houses the takings from the three main casinos.\r\n\r\nThe original Ocean's 11 released in 1960 is an OK film, more watchable for the Vegas setting and the irrepressible cast of Rat Packers than for any purpose or structure. That this Steven Soderbergh remake trumps the original in every department is a triumph of entertainment values over pure star appeal. Some would put a case up for the cast of Soderberg's film using stars to entice the audience in? But really at the time of release it was a stretch to put George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon (all excellent here) on the same pedal stool as Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin.\r\n\r\nThe most striking thing about this remake is that the whole cast seem to be enjoying themselves, mainly because they are not being asked to over exert their performances from their very astute director, they really are just asked to turn up, enjoy each other's company and deliver one of the coolest pictures to have been made in the decade.\r\n\r\nThe film is purely out there to entertain, it has geniality pouring out from every frame, this is a character based heist caper full of laughs and derring do shenanigans - even Don Cheadle's ill advised (and pointless character arc) cockney accent manages to create smiles instead of being an on going hindrance. Some critics said the film is far too shallow to have any real worth! What the hell do they want? So the crooks are nice guys, it's a refreshing change to see a Vegas sparkling bright without any seedy undercurrents, where these robbers aren't using AK 47s to obliterate the opposition, it's wits and dashes of cool that fills out their respective armouries.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack and scoring are themselves cool characters in the piece, whilst a big shout out goes to the bona fide stunt work from the wonderfully elastic Shaobo Qin - which merely puts another cherry on this already delightful cake. All the cast (too many to mention) are great, from Andy Garcia's suave and mean boss, Terry Benedict, to Julia Roberts' (walking like a goddess) Tess Ocean, all things in the film deliver a feel good movie that when all put together, and all things considered, is a film made by lovers of the medium for, well yes, lovers of the medium itself! 9\/10","id":"57b74810c3a36835260006a6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57b74810c3a36835260006a6","movie_id":161}

Two college professors, Dr. Ira Kane and Prof. Harry Phineas Block, take it upon themselves to investigate and mooch around. At the site, they discover worm like insects that are not of this world. Thinking they are on to Nobel Prize type history, they are dismayed when the government takes over the site and shunts them out the way. But as the insects start to evolve in the Earth atmosphere, they take on various shapes and forms of alien creatures. Pretty soon the whole place is over run and the government is at a loss in how to stop them. Enter Ira, Harry, Wayne and Allison to hopefully save the day.\r\n\r\nDirected by Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters 1 & 2), Evolution is a zany sci-fi comedy that achieves firmly what it sets out to do. Using the available special effects for great rewards, and lashing it in Technicolor, all that remained was to have a cast happy to be in on the joke itself. Up step David Duchovny (revelling in none serious X Files malarkey), Orlando Jones (getting all the best lines), Julianne Moore (accident prone) and Sean Wiillian Scott (goofball fireman wannabe).

He and another person are revived in the year 2455 by a professor and his students who are on a field trip from Earth Two to Earth One. Jason is unleashed on their spaceship and havoc ensues.\r\n\r\nThis entry is like 1979's \"Alien\" except with Jason as the monster and a sense of humor. You'll also notice that it's a great departure for the series putting Jason in space in the future. Most Friday fans look down on 1993's \"Jason Goes to Hell\" and \"Jason X\" because the producers tried something new. It's obvious that they felt the series had become stale and formulaic with an incredible eight-installment run from 1980-1989. I felt \"Jason Goes to Hell\" had a refreshing concept (ripped off from 1987's \"The Hidden\") and a great intro & opening act, but the tone was distasteful and the flick eventually spiraled out of control with its cartoony quasi-horror gobbledygook; still, it featured a couple of the best women in the series (Agent Marcus and Deborah), which should be commended.\r\n\r\nI heard negative comments about \"Jason X\" over the years, but the first half is sci-fi at its best with some amusing elements thrown in for good measure. It\u2019s stunning how well the filmmakers handle the sci-fi aspects of the plot and F\/X. The second half, unfortunately, becomes too cartoonish as Jason systematically annihilates most of the crew, particularly when he gets his new futuristic look, basically morphing into SuperJason (rolling my eyes).\r\n\r\nAs usual, this installment features an impressive assortment of women, but it's only Kinsa (Melody Johnson) that I find appealing, except for the cameo of the campfire teen #1 at the end, played by the stunning Mika Ward. They should have included her in the main cast.\r\n\r\nTo be expected in light of the spaceship plot, the film was shot mostly on sets (in Toronto) with a couple of outside sequences in Ontario.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 91 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-","id":"5d320886d19a3300114ea5c3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d320886d19a3300114ea5c3","movie_id":11470}

Yet the movie shoots for something deeper as this is an amusing and potent satire on the influence and manipulation of the entertainment industry.\r\n\r\nAlan Cumming is outstanding as the villainous band manager who uses bands, abuses them and throws them away at whim.

By the time of the brilliantly constructed assault by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor, and \"it is\" exhilarating and edge of the seat heart pounding, you are left with the feeling that all the main characters in the piece are not really worth our emotional investment.\r\n\r\nIt's not an outright stinker, situations such as the nurses trying to cope in the hospital during the attack are poignant, and there's a jingoistic - cum - romantic fervour that screams out that the film wants to be genuine in making you feel, well, emotionally battered.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Madness is just overactive curiosity. \r\n\r\nSession 9 is directed by Brad Anderson who also co-writes the screenplay with Stephen Gevedon. It stars Peter Mullan, David Caruso, Josh Lucas, Brendan Sexton III and Stephen Gevedon. Music is scored by Climax Golden Twins and cinematography is by Uta Briesewitz.\r\n\r\nDanvers State Hospital (AKA: State Lunatic Hospital at Danvers, The Danvers Lunatic Asylum, and The Danvers State Insane Asylum), Massachusetts. Built in 1874, opened in 1878 and closed in 1992. The home to misery, madness, tragedies and troubling treatments. Five men from an asbestos removal company, each with issues or points to prove, enter the vast bat shaped structure under the promise of a big pay off to get the job done in one week. But over the course of the week money will be the last thing on their minds.\r\n\r\nPsychological horror at its finest, Session 9, in the hands of Brad Anderson, pretty much gets everything right in this most skin itching of sub-genres. Like the ghost story splinter of horror, setting is absolutely everything, and few, if any? Horror settings are as imposing or eerie as the one time Danvers State Hospital. Sadly demolished in 2006\/7 to make way for an apartment complex (bastard property developers have no respect outside of the purse), the place positively oozes unease throughout the movie. With Anderson choosing to shoot his film on videotape, this further aids the sense of realism and palpable dread, and although it isn't a stretch of the mind to think about some of the misery that played out in reality at Danvers, Anderson and his photographer Briesewitz ensure that it never leaves our conscious. Tone is set from the off as being slow burn, this is perfect as it allows us to get a grasp of the characters, their psychological make ups and narrative worth.\r\n\r\nWith the Danvers facility proving to be the extra character, all things come together seamlessly to gnaw away at the viewers. It's a devilishly odd thing to say, but as the story and characters are given room to breath, the audience who have immersed themselves in the picture will start to feel claustrophobic, and then for the night time sequences, even achluophobic. It's pitch perfect pacing by Anderson, who prior to unleashing the unnerving finale, has pulled us (and his excellent cast) slowly through a labyrinth of dank corridors, wards, treatment rooms, caged stairwells and a morgue. Even on the outside during daylight hours everything feels bleak, either with characters loomed over by the building, or on a roof chatting while Gothic turrets watch over them menacingly, the ghosts and bitterness of Danvers Hospital exist fully in Anderson's movie.\r\n\r\nStory links a tape recording found by Mike (Gevedon) with that of the workers' unfolding plight. The tape tells of 9 sessions with a troubled patient named Mary Hobbes, to say anymore would be spoilerish, but for the record in this writers eyes it's the creepiest tape recording in horrorville. Add in the odd hospital prop such as a lone wheelchair, a hydrotherapy bath or an orbitoclast! Well you get the picture I'm sure. Climax Golden Twins provide a suitably jarring score, where disjointed noises and elongated tonal strains further enhance the pervading disquiet. Picture only falls down slightly with silly plot error involving a furnace, and for some folk the ending will inevitably be met with dissatisfaction. I liked it plenty but I also feel they could have gone another way with it. But it does work well and isn't a cop out, and certainly it's better than the alternate ending available in the extras section of home disc formats.\r\n\r\nIt's a horror film aimed at a certain horror fan, the one who has the patience to enjoy slow burn psychological pin prickery. All played out expertly by cast and film makers at a naturally unsettling location. 9\/10","id":"5da9214bb2681f00128e8055","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5da9214bb2681f00128e8055","movie_id":10972}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Cult flick with sophisticated themes, great cast, but meh story***\r\n\r\nReleased in 2001 and written\/directed by Richard Kelly, \"Donnie Darko\" is a drama\/fantasy starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a troubled California teen dogged by apparitions of a man in an evil rabbit suit who manipulates him to commit several crimes, after he narrowly escapes a peculiar accident concerning a jet engine falling from the sky. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays his sister, Holmes Osborne & Mary McDonnell his parents, Drew Barrymore his teacher, Katharine Ross his therapist, Jena Malone his girlfriend, Noah Wyle his science teacher and Patrick Swayze a self-help guru. Patience Cleveland is on hand as Grandma Death.\r\n\r\nWhile the movie flopped at the box office, it has since become a serious cult hit. I saw it recently for the first time and went into it cold without knowing anything about the intricacies behind the plot. The only thing I knew was that the kid was harassed by an ee-vil bunny apparition. The film mildly works as a high school drama with a satirical smirk. But the story's just not engaging enough on that level. While the movie has some quality women, it fails to capitalize on their presence (Barrymore, for instance, is barely in it). But Jake is a solid protagonist, even somewhat sympathetic despite the curious things he does.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the second act I found myself getting bored with the story and trying to figure out what was going on, but the film perks up in the last act, particularly when it reveals the truth about the scary bunny guy. After viewing, my overall impression was that the story never really took off and was burdened by perplexing ambiguities even while possessing some fascinating elements. I came up with a theory to explain the events (explained below) but, upon reflection, I realized that all the pieces didn't fit. And the movie simply wasn't entertaining enough to bang my head further trying to figure it out. I would've given the movie a mediocre 5\/10 rating, but after investigating the official meaning and the alternative explanations I had to admit that the film is genius in this respect. It just needed to be attached to a more interesting story with more stimulating characters.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 113 minutes, which is the version I saw; the Director's Cut runs 20 minutes longer. It was shot in Los Angeles and surrounding areas (Angeles National Forest, Long Beach, Santa Monica, Santa Clarita, Burbank & Calabasas).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL COMMENTARY (***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read unless you've seen the movie):\r\n\r\nMy casual interpretation turned out to be one of the alternative explanations of the movie, the so-called \"Donnie Is Shown the Future\" explanation, which suggests that Donne is shown the future via the future ghost of Frank and so he sacrifices himself at the end to save everyone. But, as noted above, there are too many holes in this interpretation.\r\n\r\nA couple of other popular explanations are the banal Schizophrenia Theory, where the film shows the protagonist going through an episode of his illness, and the Dream Theory, where it was \"all just a dream,\" which is too clich\u00e9d and idiotic to even consider.\r\n\r\nThe 'official' interpretation I would've never pieced together because it's just too sci-fi-oriented and complex: It's the Tangent Universe Theory, which suggests that time in the Primary Universe (i.e. reality) is occasionally corrupted and an unstable alternative universe is created, but it will only last a few weeks. Nevertheless, it threatens to destroy the universe. The events you see happening in the bulk of the film are this alternative reality where the universe (or God) is correcting the error to get back to the Primary Universe using an Artifact (the jet engine), The Living Receiver (Jake Gyllenhaal), a Manipulated Dead person (the bunny guy), and so on. Google it and you'll see that the Tangent Universe explanation ties up all the loose ends.","id":"5e0014ead236e6001090175b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e0014ead236e6001090175b","movie_id":141}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Powerful message in a melancholic drama bogged down by un-real contrivances and other issues*** \r\n\r\nA father and son (Billy Bob Thornton and Heath Ledger) are correctional officers in Louisiana who live with their father, a former corrections officer and hateful racist (Peter Boyle). After overseeing the execution of a black man (Sean 'Diddy' Combs) a couple of tragedies compel the father, Hank (Thornton), to meet the struggling ex-wife of the executed man (Halle Berry).\r\n\r\nThe cast, locations, score and directing are all excellent. The problem is the contrived script, which tends to focus on the worst in humanity and sometimes creates a feeling of surreal un-reality. As far as the former goes, the first half features ugly racism, prostitution (and the corresponding overt sex scene), hate, a prison execution, an unforeseen suicide and a sudden hit-and-run. If you can handle all that in the first 55 minutes, you might appreciate this movie.\r\n\r\nSome of these sequences work (the prostitute scene and the execution) and some don\u2019t (the racism, suicide and hit-and-run). The latter ones have a sense of unreality either because of dubious writing or weak execution, or both. Take, for instance, the racist remarks by the old patriarch (Boyle). They come off unbelievable and laughable (or maybe they wanted them to come off laughable?). With better writing\/acting\/directing they would\u2019ve worked.  Or take the hit-and-run: it\u2019s totally off-camera; and the segue into the aftermath is weak. The viewer is left asking, \u201cWhat just happened?

She should\u2019ve been made up to look older or, at least, more drained. Instead, she looks fresh and thoroughly beautiful from head-to-toe.\r\n\r\nDespite all these considerable negatives, the movie conveys a well thought-out message and contains some worthy intricacies, not to mention it refuses idiotic political correctness.

Moreover, the wife wants nothing to do with him and only visits for the sake of their son.\r\n\r\nA critic wrongly argued that a certain character was a hardcore racist and wouldn\u2019t have such a \u201csudden change of heart.\u201d Well, this critic wasn\u2019t watching closely. At the beginning of the movie this character was well into the process of metamorphosizing from his father\u2019s odious mindset. Yes, he does something hateful with his rifle near the opening, but this was a PERFORMANCE for his dad who was peering through the window with approval. In short, the hateful patriarch still exercised his insufferable iron will over the family even while he was restricted to a wheelchair and stroller. The film\u2019s about freeing oneself of that power and that hate; and much more.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 51 minutes and was shot in Laplace, Louisiana, and Louisiana State Penitentiary, Angola.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+\/B-","id":"5bceb90192514172df00715e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bceb90192514172df00715e","movie_id":1365}
{"author":"cadkaup","content":"Moulin Rouge has many things to like about it, but comes off as inconsistent at times.\r\n\r\nAll of the actors were top notch. I believe it was Nicole Kidman's best performance of her career. Ewan\r\nMcGregor usually doesn't add a lot of depth to his characters, but in this movie it was ample. Jim Broadbent was charismatic and Richard Roxburgh was a very convincing pervert, right down to his posture. I liked how well they developed each of these characters. The rest of the actors were also excellent, but the story didn't lend much depth to their character, and they simply came off as a backdrop or environment for the main four, often becoming a writers convenience or becoming a set of eyes we could see through from the outside looking in.\r\n\r\nThere were so many parts I enjoyed about this movie, more particularly the segments where Kidman and McGregor's relationship was explored. This made for a great second act of the movie. The first and third act I felt suffered from Baz Luhrmann's rapid, almost epileptic, editing style. His style is not not for everyone, but particularly in this movie, it didn't allow for much depth of the movie in the first and third act and came off as flashy and showy. This created pacing issues that I felt if he had slowed down and focused more on the characters instead of fitting as many shots into the move that he could, the story would have flowed a lot better.\r\n\r\nThe other major inconsistency of the movie was the theme it was building towards, and the theme it ultimately landed on. Throughout the entire movie, they are building a theme of faith in love no matter what the outcome, but the last minute and a half of the movie turns it into a tragedy that I felt was unwarranted and unearned. This would have been a palpable ending if the movie showed the characters doubting that maybe love wasn't enough, and then a tragedy strikes that proves the point.  But instead we have the ending segment that shows us that all this guy's belief in love was absolutely for not, and that we are left to assume he must have been faking his belief the entire time, because it sure didn't seem like enough for him. This isn't about always getting a happy ending, it's about not getting an ending that was a cheap and quick way to evoke a particular emotion in the audience without really building into. It felt rushed, and again, unearned. (And I'm not talking about the actual event, but more about how the event affected the character.)\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I really wanted to enjoy this movie more than I did. An excellent second act with outstanding performances and likable characters, but with the pacing issues and inconsistencies in building a movie that naturally flowed from one idea to the next keeps me from rating it higher. All in all, though, a fairly enjoyable and rewatch able film nonetheless.","id":"5cc5c40fc3a368219b81881f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cc5c40fc3a368219b81881f","movie_id":824}

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"American Pie 2 doubles the amount of crude toppings but lessens the characterised filling. A sex comedy can only be pushed so far before it miraculously transfers to soft-core pornographic territory. The original American Pie, whilst an influential milestone in the sub-genre, was a satirical take on high-school life by hyperbolising the quest for losing one\u2019s virginity. How would Rogers and Herz continue the saga? Well, shoving a trumpet up one\u2019s filthy anus, using super-glue instead of lubricant during an awkward masturbation sequence and the longest \u201clesbian\u201d endeavour ever. Suffice to say, the misadventures of these four friends do not retain the freshness of the original. After their freshmen year at college, the boys regroup for a party held by Stifler at a rented beach home, where they intend to spend the summer getting laid and participating in cringe-inducing phone sex (twice!).\r\n\r\nThe cast are back, ready to precariously thrust beds, the tainted air and Stifler\u2019s mother in a luxurious car (no pie though...). Yes, the aroma of crusty semen and raging hormones plague the summer season. Whilst that may be sufficient comedy for fans of the original, there\u2019s no saucy masquerading of the narrative structure. It\u2019s a complete retread of its predecessor. Almost identical! The characters go through the exact same scenarios, only heightened by a writer who clearly couldn\u2019t produce any enticing material. The equivalent of an adult magazine. Used once, thrown away shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe elongated and repetitive scenes of comedy, while slightly funny initially, tire themselves by never ending. The \u201clesbians\u201d persuading the guys to play with each other? That was essentially thirty minutes of the runtime, and as a homosexual, horrible to endure. God bless Hannigan though for stepping up her game, she was an absolute delight with an equal balance of comedic timing and heartfelt peculiarity. The remaining cast members, aside from Reid who was predicting her \u2018Sharknado\u2019 future, all performed consistently as expected. And by that, I mean with the overwhelming smell of mediocrity. I do not want to see Klein touch himself again whilst talking provocatively on a phone! The padding in the pants was too much *starts to heave*.\r\n\r\nOh, and the lack of basic mathematic knowledge. Right, simple arithmetics here, the whole \u201cRule of 3\u201d scenario. Pens and paper and the ready, please. If Kevin stated he slept with three girls, and this \u201cRule of 3\u201d means you divide the number by three, how many did he actually sleep with? Take your time now...! Got it? Well, the result is not zero. It\u2019s one. Why the hell are these college students objectively stating the answer to be zero? Are they mad? Fine, Vicky isn\u2019t the sharpest tool in the shed, but Kevin? C\u2019mon man. Arithmetics! Of course, it isn\u2019t an American Pie film without the alternative rock soundtrack. Blink-182, Sum 41, Green Day and Alien Ant Farm all make an appearance and give life to the teen angst shown on screen.\r\n\r\nJust a shame this sequel gave me unnecessary angst for never surpassing the original\u2019s hilarity. If you adored its predecessor and appreciated its exaggerated satire, then this sequel will only be viewed as watchable. If you just want crude comedy and are content with elongated phone sex sequences, by all means give this second pie a taste. It\u2019s not piping hot, but lukewarm at best.","id":"5e21da5d8f26bc001174572c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e21da5d8f26bc001174572c","movie_id":2770}
