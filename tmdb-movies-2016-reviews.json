{"author":"iieeef","content":"This film follows Claire and her son in the month after Claire's husband goes missing. Judging from the performance by lead actress Betsy Brandt though, you'd believe Claire never actually met the man as she has so little invested in his disappearance. With its deadly pace and quiet landscape, this film never quite picks up enough steam to level a feeling of honesty about the missing, and possibly dead, husband.  Instead the co-writing, co-directing team get so distracted with a relatively uninteresting wife\/mistress rivalry between Claire and her husband's colleague, that this turns into another story of an emotionally unavailable wife pitted against a younger woman who feels herself a bit too much. The husband's disappearance, it ultimately seems, is an absurd catalyst for a cliche set of circumstances. Deemed so unimportant by the writers in fact (SPOILER ALERT), the husband's disappearance is never even solved. With an underwhelming emotional landscape and a maddeningly unsatisfying ending, this film manages to bring very little to the table.","id":"58d0d247c3a36838c9006de6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58d0d247c3a36838c9006de6","movie_id":381008}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> From an action packed flick to a game mode!\r\n\r\nThe first film was a decent entertainer, I kind of liked that and a box office hit as well. So the producers saw an opportunity to bring another film and yep, this film did slightly better than the original, but the product was qualityless. The graphics were just okay, but overall very poor in those blow-up scenes which were the most essential for a theme like this.\r\n\r\nNot all, though some of the action sequences were terrible and the story was very weak. In fact, there's no story, the whole film was an action- thriller just like the previous film. But that's how this theme revolves, yet as a one, it is a bit disappointing follow-up without surprises. Anyway, I'm with the original film director who backed out of the project for giving him a bad script to direct.\r\n\r\nSo the London is the latest victim of the plot for the US president's assassination. Particularly this 2nd part looked so much more alike a computer game than actors who are exhibiting their roles. Like the London is a battlefield and level after level the story making its progress till the game over, but we know who wins in the end. I don't know whose performance was much better, because I did not find anyone with par to appreciate.\r\n\r\nWhat this film did at the box office was a miracle, so I don't think the filmmakers go for another script anytime soon. But if they do, I'm wondering which capitol would be the next victim of a terror attack. Expecting Tokyo or Canberra, especially Mumbai would be an ideal location. This is not a bad film, you can try it once, but watching it like sitting next to who's with xbox joystick.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"57602d6b925141660700145a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57602d6b925141660700145a","movie_id":267860}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The choices of life we want to live are ours to make.**\r\n\r\nThe film was inspired by the real life event, book and the documentary film. The message was awesome, but it's more like a personal. At least from the film's perspective about a couple and their struggle. Also the personalities of those two, who are so quiet, hence seems it was like a documentary film with a feature film touch. That does not mean Ruth Negga deserved the Oscars nominee. She got it only because of the black quota, otherwise there are many great performances to be considered who are not white, black or even American.\r\n\r\nSo coming to the film, I like this kind of drama, It was so realistic and I won't mind if it runs past two hour mark. The first appreciation must go the two lead actors, they were the soul of the film. Surely awards worthy performances, but like I said not the Oscars. Especially I loved the Joel Edgerton's part. It is one of his, maybe the best I have seen so far, For many reasons the people should watch this. Jeff Nichols of 'Take Shelter' fame did good in writing and direction, especially after his slightly disappointing previous film. One of the best biopic of the year and I recommend it not to miss, particularly for the family audience.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58b09780c3a368236d0002d2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b09780c3a368236d0002d2","movie_id":339419}

The skinheads are a problem, but they are never **our** problem, they're a mere periphery. The unemployment rate is sky high, but the lead stumbles into two jobs by the end of the first act.\r\n\r\nPerhaps these problems wouldn't be so stark, if the kid who is our eyes for this punk-journey, wasn't so much of an... unlikeable twat.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._","id":"592ef22b925141312001079e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/592ef22b925141312001079e","movie_id":394822}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A mother's quest to find a perfect man for her beloved daughter!**\r\n\r\nI am not the audience for it and I realised that only after watching it. There's no other way, besides, I like Kate Beckinsale a lot and don't want to miss it out. I like periodic drama, those colorful costumes, horse riding, proper English and the culture, all of them very interests me. Particularly Jane Austen's work, I don't think anybody would miss it if they know her masterworks.\r\n\r\nBut my issue was the presentation. It looked a lot like a stage drama than a motion picture, anyway all the Jane Austen work is like that only. I'm not doubting the actors, in fact, not just my beauty queen Kate Beckinsale, all of them were good. Also thought the story was good which I felt kind of similar to 'Emma' by the same author, yet I'm disappointed with the way it was narrated for the screen.\r\n\r\nI know some people liked it, and my choice of words may annoy them, but I don't want to offend them or the film, just wanted to say what I felt, that's all. My bad luck, the film was not what I wanted. Slow film, but the length was good enough to forget any lags in the pace. Other than one thing what I said bothered me the most, this is a nice film, definitely not bad to watch it once. I said that believing you might be different than me. So that is an indirect suggest, but if you are another me, I'll favour you to skip it.

{"author":"iieeef","content":"It's hard to discern exactly who this film is intended for. On the surface it's an adventure story about two young brothers who search for their grandfather's hidden treasure on the family island. At the heart though, it's a family drama about two older brothers finding their way back to each other after life has ripped them apart. Trying to walk the line between both genres, this film does neither particularly well. The kids watching for the adventure storyline will find the plot forced, with all clues and elements conveniently and sloppily revealed at the right moment. If you make your child watch this, expect him to be bored in the first fifteen minutes. Meanwhile, the adults watching this for the family story (elderly, I'm assuming) will find that it never quite goes beyond melodrama, with given circumstances too absurd to ring true. Though it was nice to see young Benjamin Stockham continue to get work after his failed television show About A Boy, I'd still only recommend this film as Sunday afternoon viewing on TBS if you happen to be with a grandparent who's hard of hearing and gets offended by anything even remotely challenging.","id":"58c6099ac3a368412000ab27","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c6099ac3a368412000ab27","movie_id":389272}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A road movie that extended to a different level of bonding between two.\r\n\r\nI was not overwhelmed by the overall film yet a very enjoyable film for the wonderful direction and the beautiful character displays. The first thing I remembered was 'Paper Moon', but it was when 'Last Ride' meets 'Natural Born Killers'. Clearly, it dealt with its own concept, but I won't deny the influence of those titles this film has. So I believe the writer has been inspired by them.\r\n\r\nIf you like the road films, then you might enjoy it as well, even though you're not desiring to give high marks. It begins when a 13 year old boy who lost his mother embarks a journey with a stranger to go and live with his grandparents who are on the other end of the country. On their way, the two struggles with their differences, especially in the conflict of interest to take such a trip. But they end up developing a close bond which is at one point comes to tear them apart.\r\n\r\nIt did not live up to my expectation. Actually, I was not having any expectation because I came to know about it a while ago before finished watching it. Without the character development how much a story going to impress its audience, but this film did by letting them to figure it out by themselves. There is a twist and other turns in the tale, but everything's very easy.\r\n\r\nSo the film kind of interested me, just for keeping everything simple and telling a tale with a good speed, but obviously not an original or anything extraordinary. Josh Duhamel was amazing, his role along with the kid's make you watch it. Especially after the 'Spotlisght', every a film with priests in it freaks me out like the one from this. Anyway, this is not a must see, but not bad to ignore completely.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"5760329c925141665400166c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5760329c925141665400166c","movie_id":360203}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A neverday tale.**\r\n\r\nFrom the director who is famous for great horror flicks, but I liked his only romance-drama 'Hello Stranger' that starred by the same actor as in this one. This is a similar type, I mean a travel based romance-drama, but a fraction amount of fantasy and\/or sci-fi influenced. Due to the way the tale was narrated, it makes no sense to label it with them. It also looks kind of the 90s style romance films from the west. So a bit old theme, however, surprisingly it worked out for me.\r\n\r\nThe concept was as same as 'A Few Portion Missing in the Centre', but it is entirely a romance-drama. When I started to watch, I thought it was going to be an average, the scenes could be predictable, but most of the film was like that, until the twist came at the midway. It was not about the twist, because that kind of twist was used in the films since the inception of the cinema. Not about what followed after that, thought those parts were decent. But the ending, that was different which saved the film I say.\r\n\r\nIf the climax was compromised, the film would have lost its charm. If I were only young like a teenager or in the early 20s, it would have been my favourite film. You know, 'been there, done that' kind mindset makes not to fall for the familiar appealness\/sentiments. So I'm not the target audience, but those who are, would surely celebrate it. Particularly the girls. Yet still be a watchable film by everyone, despite how much you are going to like it.\r\n\r\n> \u275dIt's like we're climbing Mt. Everest together.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe story of a 30 year old geek, Denchai, who works in an IT firm as a tech supporter. He's a perfectionist, but all he wanted was people around him recognise his presence, but nobody does. He develops a crush on a new co-worker, but he keeps it himself by stalking since she's seeing somebody else in the office. Then one day when the company takes its employees to oversea tour, his wish comes true to be her boyfriend for just one day. So the entire day was narrated for us how they made it, and following day what happens, all were revealed.\r\n\r\nThe initiation was a bit longer than I anticipated. It was necessary to make a perfect riddle for what comes in the later. But when they go foreign trip, everything changes, a different kind of film in front of us. Like any normal romantic-drama, the best parts can be expected. Those who have watched hundreds of romantic films, would feel a bit clich\u00e9, but worth it. Then moving towards the final stage, you might think you know what would happen, though the film reaches its highest point with a better conclusion rather going for ideal one.\r\n\r\nThe two lead actors won the Thai Academy Awards for their performances. I think they deserved it, at least for the Thai film standards. One more awesome film by the director. I think he should do more romance films, besides his favourite, horrors. Nicely used the Japanese locations to narrate the tale. The dialogues were okay, but the emotions should have been a little more stronger. Especially for this kind of ending. But anyway, I liked it mainly because of that part. One of the best Thai romance films in the recent time. So if you are looking for a pure, touching romance film, this is the one to pick.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59aca008c3a3682c22036867","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59aca008c3a3682c22036867","movie_id":420541}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Losing the loved one and getting lost in the life.**\r\n\r\nThe plot says it is a serious subject, but the film was fun. Not fun as you would laugh out loud, though that's how the characters behaves. As seen the whole film, I thought it was similar to the 'Sweet Bean'. Not thematically, but the characteristically. They did not balance on that, because clearly that was not an intention. It's only I saw that, which should have been explored much better possible way.\r\n\r\nYou might wonder what is that! Actually, it was three generations. A kid, a young man and a pretty close to be an old man. But it was that old man's tale. That's how it all begins and ends too. He had lost his son and now it is a week of mourning time. At the end of the formal, that's where our tale begins by avoiding the emotional parts. A good initiation.\r\n\r\nSeems he is approaching a different tactic to cope with the loss. Suddenly his behaviour has changed. Not being polite with everyone around him, particularly his neighbour couple with a reason. But their young son joins him, together they set to break the rules and do some crazy stuffs. At the last moment, a kid joins them and it all turns out their greatest day of adventure. All the fun has an ending, so how does it concludes was told with a little dramatic.\r\n\r\n> \u275dThe fact that you can't see it does not mean it does not exist. You're just not open minded enough.\u275e\r\n\r\nI have seen many films about coping with the deaths. Some of them were unique, some were not. This was a familiar one, except all the events were set in a different atmosphere, like culture and society. It is people's nature, tend to do opposite when they are not ready for it or forced to do. This father did not intentionally took that alternative route. It was a chain of events, he just sailed from one to another, only to realise where and how far he had come.\r\n\r\nMore or less, like a self-discovery. Rediscovering the life to live for. Some time emotions take us to unexpected destinations. But once it was released, the reality eyes open, to look forward in the remaining life. So this film was not an ideal film for everybody who are in the same situation. But it gives a different opinion. I liked the actors, all the main ones. The music was so good. It was one of the main ingredients of the film, made everything look better. Particularly in the transition sections between the events and the characters.\r\n\r\nDon't remember what was my last Hebrew film, but it was a good one, had a nice time. The developments, how the plots were extended is not going to satisfy all who watches the film. Because some viewers might expect a totally fun, with or without logic. But some look for the value it teaches, morale, message et cetera. Frankly, this film was none of those. But it was also all of those with less highlighting them. Better than the average, and below the awesomeness, surely a worthy film that some people would find it good.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59fe240792514146e8022faa","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59fe240792514146e8022faa","movie_id":393521}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Twenty years is a big gap for a big change to happen in anybody's life.**\r\n\r\nThis film had the potential to be the best comedy of the year, it opened so well, but did not conclude on high. Like everything suddenly halted, the story came to an end with giving clich\u00e9d reason. Though the actors were amazing, and many jokes were awesome. The lead two combination was among the best Kevin Hart worked so far like in the recently with Ice Cube and Will Ferrell.\r\n\r\nThe opening scenes set off the tone for the rest of the film. Twenty years later, an adventure begins, but that part was so familiar, except the influence of the opening part that carried till the final scene. Even though slightly unpredictable scenes, because the diversions were neatly done against what viewers could expect. The focus was largely on the lead pair, so theirs undertaking was kind of faded away.\r\n\r\nThere's a guest role at the end, also some behind the scene clips during the end credit cheers us. I think it is a good comedy than it looks, but definitely not the best. Its not the narration, but the actors that makes worth a watch.

And, in my opinion, for cinema to be at its greatest it needs to brave and vulnerable.\r\n\r\nCenter of My World is exactly that: brave and vulnerable. And intimate. And true.\r\n\r\nIts is the story of Phil, a standard teenager, who is just a little gayer than the rest. But him being gay is really not an important part of the story.\r\n\r\nHe struggles with his family, with deeply hidden secrets of the past and their effects in the present, which may break his family apart. And he falls in love for the first time. That's really it.\r\n\r\nAnd while watching this in the cinema some people laughed at the film. Because it shows how love is, unironically and over-the-top. It dives deep into Phil's emotions and shows us not only the center of his world, but maybe even the center of THE world (hence the original German title \"The Center of the World\"). And most people can not let themselves dive into these depths.\r\n\r\nAnd if you want to experience this small gem of a movie, you have to make yourself vulnerable, too.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**They'd crossed each others life while chasing their dreams.**\r\n\r\nI am not a big fan of modern musical films. So I was not expecting it to be a great or worst. The film opened with a song that I was not happy, because I did not like the verse or the music. And again to say, the modern timeline does not suit for the musical theme, unless it is a fantasy or an Indian film. \r\n\r\nThe best part of the film was, those song fades away as the film progresses. But I kind of liked the drama\/story part and the climax track with the quick flashback (kind of). Till that scene I was considering it an average film, but that one scene changed my stance. So, now I think it is a good film, but winning 6 Oscars, I don't know it deserved that.\r\n\r\nYes, the director is known for making music and musical film, but he has not made many. He's young and so his career. Yep, I loved 'Whiplash'. One of my all time favourite. If that film had won 10 Oscars, I would have not surprised at all. After that flick, the people were anticipating, to exceed that success in this film. As it was received, no doubt for those people it was a different flick, but not for me. Especially if you watch lots of Indian films. By the way the film characters were nice, and so the story, but not the songs.\r\n\r\nGosling and Stone were performed well.

Discarded by her husband, she finds a secret lover among the staffs of the house to satisfy her sexual urges. As expected, it does not go well when gossips comes out. Following the consequences, how the rest of the story unfolds was told with a series of twists.\r\n\r\nI liked simple settings. Maybe because it was a rural tale, but was so perfect. Florence Pugh has a potential to be a big star. The same goes to the director as well. This is her first film for me. She single handedly made this film look good. Not the year's most anticipated film, but definitely worth a watch. The Russian style British tale. One of the best films from such theme.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5a77088a92514105970442cb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a77088a92514105970442cb","movie_id":410117}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is definitely not a movie that I would have chosen to watch all by myself which perhaps explain why I thought it was just surprisingly okay to watch. However my girlfriend absolutely wanted to watch it so I got it. As it turned out my girlfriend had only gone by the number of Oscars and not really looked up what kind of movie it actually was so in the end I was enjoying the movie a lot more than she did.\r\n\r\nThis movie is pretty much a quite classical Hollywood musical with a non too original story, nice music and dancing. In addition the cinematography  is simply excellent. This is the strong point of this movie. The rest of the movie is of lesser interest to me but the cinematography is really, really good. The scene, pictured on the movie poster, were Mia and Sebastian dances and everything in the scene are dark blue tones except Mia\u2019s bright yellow dress is so simple and yet so beautiful.\r\n\r\nEverything else about this movie is\u2026okay. Okay acting, okay story etc.  As I wrote before this is really not my kind of movie so forgive me for not being overly enthusiastic. I am sure those into these kind of movies cannot understand how anyone can give it less than a full set of stars but hey, different tastes and all that.\r\n\r\nI cannot make up my mind about ending. On one hand I am a sucker for happy endings which this one falls a wee bit short on. On the other hand I have to commend the writer\/director for not taking the path of least resistance and instead putting together something a wee bit different.\r\n\r\nI did feel that a part of the movie was missing though. I would have liked to see the parts where Mia and Sebastian actually fulfilled their respective dreams. Jumping fast forward to the ending like the movie did felt a bit like they either ran out of money or they manage to misplace half the story!\r\n\r\nAnyway, I enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would.","id":"595e3425c3a36828fc07c036","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/595e3425c3a36828fc07c036","movie_id":313369}

Because, of course it was more cinematic than real, but thematically slightly inspiring. Inspiring to fight against the sexual abuse.\r\n\r\nThe film was like found-footage type, but then it used web cam for most of the time, so I'm not sure it still can be called that. Still, there some shots with outside this criteria. Anyway, a good film. Though not in the initial stage. Because it was like any small budget film like this, a casual opening. Then the middle part changed everything. Particularly the twist at the end.\r\n\r\nThis is about two online friends. They were never before, except childhood play buddies. So one day one of them finds another and befriends. Their's just online friendship, but they talk about everything. But then it becomes more than that when issues become serious. So how they confront it was revealed in the final act.\r\n\r\nThe actors were very good. The production quality too surprisingly good.

Ordinary characters like you could find them in rural, and they are fighting for their beliefs. Caught between what's right for his own eye, but wrong for others, a teenager named James who is about to admit to a college is tangled up in a romance puzzle. After returning from rehab, now he has to comply with the expectations around him. His father does all he can to help him out, but seems not understood his position very well. In his short period of stay before the college, all the developments he sees are revealed to us.\r\n\r\nFor a B movie, it has a better quality. Impressive in all the level, but not very exciting screenplay. Usually predictable scenes and dialogues. Seems more like would have been a better short film than a feature film. Being a 90 minute stretch, there's nothing to remember the film after a few days its watch. Everything's are already seen in one or the other films. So watching it once would make you no harm, but not a must see, even if you are a big backer of LGBT. Just have a low expectation, that's all.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"59cadca3c3a36877a9004e78","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59cadca3c3a36877a9004e78","movie_id":397992}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Well, everything's in the title itself, you watch it only to confirm.**\r\n\r\nI don't want to be so negative like the film critics, but this is a big disappointment for me watching being a film fanatic. I don't think anyone who loved 'Harry Potter' film series would thumb this new beginning. This is not like 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit' from the same universe, but different trilogies. I was excited for something like that, as a concept wise, for the fresh tale from from the fresh characters in the same universe. I don't know about the book version, but the film did not click for me.\r\n\r\nIt had a bunch of nice characters, and to set in the Harry Potter universe, really it should have been a masterpiece. The major drawback was the story. There's nothing to appreciate the screenplay. It's about some creatures from the magical world got out in the human world, just like 'Jumanji'. So our hero struggles to recapture them. Meanwhile, some others too involved in and the reason will be revealed in the final stage.\r\n\r\nNice casting and great visuals. I won't point out its director's fault, because he has done his duty very well. He's also will be the man behind the rest of the sequels. I think it deserved the Oscars for the costume design. Not a bad film, particularly for the kids. Comparing it with the Harry Potter franchise makes it a worst film, but independently it is an okay film. So the initiation was average, but I'm still expecting the follow ups to be much better.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"58f1581ec3a3681a30005600","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58f1581ec3a3681a30005600","movie_id":259316}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Personally I found this movie to be 2+ hours of excellent entertainment. This is one of these movies where I simply cannot understand how people can give one and two star ratings stating that it is garbage etc. I do not get what these people expected? Maybe they just have to complain? The original Harry Potter books are very much books for children or young adults and so is this movie. It is a highly entertaining story in a magical universe with some adventure, some suspense and a lot of humor.\r\n\r\nThe magic and the magical animals are quite cool. The pocket universe (or whatever they are called in the Harry Potter world) is simply gorgeous and cool. The story is not really much to write home about but it does not have to be. This is a magical movie where the magical atmosphere is what makes the movie. It is a good enough story involving a bit of suspense, action, friendship, bad guys, quite some humor and, of course, a lot of magic. More importantly perhaps, the story is not overly stupid nor does is try to peddle crappy SJW nonsense messages about gender or diversity nor climate. This movie delivers where it counts as far as I am concerned. It is entertaining, plain and simple.\r\n\r\nIf I should endeavor try to find something to complain about it would probably be that the lead character was fairly bland. He did not really have much charisma. That and the fact that I never really understood which, despicable (presumably) acts the main opponent, Grindelwald, had actually committed before the events of the movie.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I enjoyed the movie a lot and although it is perhaps not the absolutely best movie I have ever seen but it still deserves  a top rating.","id":"58e49760c3a3687326029122","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58e49760c3a3687326029122","movie_id":259316}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"For the first few minutes after Goundamani makes his appearance in Goundamaniyin Enakku Veru Engum Kilaigal Kidaiyathu, there is a flurry of jokes and punches from the veteran comedian ('En time, timing ellaame top-la dhaan irukku'). And he is in full flow, criticising caste groups and actresses with caste surnames, ridiculing movie titles that are colloquial and a mile long, and showing keenness to project himself as a tech-savvy individual (he keeps mentioning Twitter, Facebook and YouTube in his dialogues). We even get a line where he says he respects 'IT people'.\r\n\r\nBut then, the film gets down to the plot, and the jokes start declining. Goundamani plays Caravan Krishnan, who rents out caravans for film shoots. He is also a saviour for lovers who have eloped from home. Upon his underlings' suggestion, Krishnan decides to go on a trip on his caravan. On the way, he saves Prabha (Soundararaja) and Divya (Riythvika), a couple who are being pursued by goondas sent by the girl's father (Moonar Ramesh). After hearing their love story, he resolves to get them together at all cost.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the film is that the unfocussed script, which doesn't provide its star anything to bite into. And Ganapathy Balamurugan doesn't handle his star in the right way, and fails to marshall his strengths for the enhancement of the film. So, as he did in his previous film, 49-O, Goundamani adopts a 'every line of mine should be a counter' approach, that gives the feeling of trying too hard. The Prabha-Divya romantic track is stretched for long, and during this stretch, Goundamani's absence hurts the film. Further, despite all the build-up over this love affair, the resolution is anti-climactic. There is also needless drama involving Krishnan's wife (Shanoor Sana), who believes in astrology, and dreams that her husband is going to get into trouble. Like the romance, this one is given too much importance, but is resolved in a tame fashion.\r\n\r\nThe one promising element is a sub-plot involving a bunch of comic gangsters who are fans of Bobby Simhaa's Assault Sethu in Jigarthanda and are following Krishnan. One of these gangsters uses a tape to measure the distance between the two vehicles just to stick to the instructions received from men belonging to Divya's father. But such quirks are far and few. Sometimes, a lead actor can do only so much, and Goundamani, for all his attempts at raising a laugh every time he is on screen, cannot overcome the tediousness of the script. In the end, he comes across as a star in search of a better director and script.","id":"57e8b894c3a3684743010d87","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57e8b894c3a3684743010d87","movie_id":371097}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Of late, many filmmakers are resorting to a multi-strand narrative for a while to tell stories which fall under the thriller genre. Ennul Aayiram, too, begins with a 'somewhat' similar approach. There is the protagonist (Maha), an easy-going youngster who works as a bartender in a star hotel, a girl about to elope with her lover (Marina Michael), a woman disowned by her husband (Shruti Yugal) and a cop on a mission (Vincent Asokan).\r\n\r\nBut very soon, director Krishna Kumar changes tack and goes for a conventional narrative. Maha's devil-may-care attitude lands him in a bizarre one-night stand with Shruti \u2014 something which he regrets later. But he unexpectedly finds light at the end of the tunnel in the form of Marina. He woos her for a few days, and the girl (unsurprisingly) falls for him. The two of them enjoy the best time of their lives in each other's company until Maha realises that his lover knows Shruti! We expect the story to take an interesting turn from here, but disappointingly, it falls flat \u2014 with a twist incorporated just for the sake of it, leaving us baffled on how the plot would move further.\r\n\r\nMarina's parents fix her marriage without her consent, and she alerts Maha about the same. In his unconvincing struggle to win her hand, Maha becomes a person wanted by the cops. This unexpected turn of events isn't quite convincing and is also the least interesting among the options that the filmmaker has to take his story forward. With Vincent on his trail, Maha goes underground, and latter decides to elope with his lover. He chalks out a 'risky' plan, but can he succeed?\r\n\r\nThe problem with Ennul Aayiram is that it barely succeeds in keeping us hooked as the story progresses. Gopi Sunder's songs, though appearing unwanted most of the times, and his background score come as a relief as does the cinematography by Athisaya Raj. Debutant Maha, the son of veteran actor Delhi Ganesh (who has also produced the film) and Marina are apt, but the storyline is unnecessarily extended and tests our patience at times.","id":"57381713925141155f002eef","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57381713925141155f002eef","movie_id":370794}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Oru Naal Koothu revolves around a few characters who are all connected by one thing \u2014 marriage. There is Raj Kumar (Dinesh, unconvincing), whose colleague and lover, Kavya (Nivetha Pethuraj, impressive in her debut), is about to get married to another guy. She still loves him, but he wants her to wait because he has a family (which he admits he doesn't love, but has a responsibility towards) to take care of. Her family is well off and her father, who is practical and believes their relationship will anyway not work in the long run because of their social differences, has gone ahead and arranged the match. \r\n\r\nWe have Lakshmi (Miya George, effective), a timid small-town girl, who is facing the prospect of living her entire life as a spinster because her father (Nagineedu) has been turning down every prospective groom, citing one reason or another, for seven years! She has been doing the girl-seeing thing for so many times, that she laments that she doesn't even feel shy any more to stand like an object for inspection before a man. \r\n\r\nFor Susheela (Riythvika, good), an RJ, the man she is engaged to, Bhaskar, has decided to call off their marriage for a flimsy reason (he thinks she isn't a looker), but is too much of a coward to tell that to her family. In the meantime, she begins a relationship with her colleague Sathish (Ramesh Thilak, OK), who is ready to marry her, but fate has different plans. \r\n\r\nLast week, we had Iraivi that told us that women, most often, do not have any freedom when it comes to shaping up their lives, and Oru Naal Koothu seems to add that even men, too, do not have much say in their lives, especially when it comes to choosing a life partner (there is even a male character who gets bundled into a car for trying to have his way). And the film gives its women more agency than Iraivi. For better or worse, all the three women keep trying to make their own decisions. In fact, in one scene, Lakshmi's friend, a divorcee, jokingly tells her to leave her home and live-in with her. Though the next dialogue tries to make light of this comment instantly, it is refreshing to see a mainstream film where lesbianism is discussed openly. And the film, too, is centred around their characters, even though Dinesh is the one who is given top billing in the credits. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, the men are underdeveloped. Beyond moping about, Raj has nothing much to do; Sathish, on the other hand, is made to act the clown, but that's just that. And the script never bothers to tell us why Lakshmi's father behaves as he does. It is only the characters of Raghavendra (Karunakaran), Susheela's elder unmarried brother, and his friend Benjamin (Charlie), a man who has missed the marriage bus, who register as solid characters. \r\n\r\nNelson and editor Sabu Joseph ensure that the multi-strand narrative never confuses the viewer, and focus on all the three tracks equally (in this aspect, it is as efficient as Tamizhukku En Tamizhukku En 1-Ai Azhuthavum). The director also does a good job capturing the work place environment of some of the characters. The dialogues are humorous and often sharp: Marriage aagalana edho expiry aana product maadhiri paakaranga; Nooru rubaaiku napkin vikkara naatla pathaayiram kooda sambathikkalana eppadi; Edho picha podra madhiriye kalyanam panna varanga... The comedy by Bala Saravanan, who plays Raj's friend (given the support he lends to Raj, his nickname Shoulder feels apt), is forced into the narrative, but the actor makes the lines work with his timing and delivery. \r\n\r\nWhat doesn't work are the filmi touches that Nelson adds to the narrative. An accident in the opening scenes (included mainly to inject melodrama), a couple of twists in the climax (pulled off very unconvincingly by the director who treats them as if he is solving permutations and combinations problems), and a sequence where characters break out into a song (that hardly serves any purpose). These scenes actually clash with the understated nature of the rest of the scenes, but the somewhat open ending and the vox pop interviews in the end credits (an English-speaking auto driver almost walks away with the whole bit) manages to bring the film back on track.","id":"576bbe8ec3a36862f10021ad","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/576bbe8ec3a36862f10021ad","movie_id":367179}

Yep, I was not expecting that, it was a surprise and in the end, I happy that I saw it despite many negative responses.\r\n\r\nThis is a story of a London university professor Perry, who meets a Russian man called Dima during vacationing in Morocco with his wife. A simple meeting becomes a normal friendship, but later Dima reveals his true identity and asks him for a favour. Perry tries to do what Dima asked for, but that puts the couple in a tight spot. So now they're caught between the two people, not knowing how it all ends, the film in the next half is to reveal the result of the tale. I liked the line that said when Perry asked Dima why did you choose me?\r\n\r\nNot just the British actors, but Stellan Skarsgard looked so great, even in his limited part. The highlight was the swift pace, a quickly told story, but it ran for over hundred minutes. The overall atmosphere created to tell the tale was excellent, just like what a spy thriller needed. There are some edgy moments, but the stunts were limited. This is an R rated film, only because of the small scale of drugs, nudes and languages, but it does not deserve that. Maybe that was intentionally done to make it look like a grown-up's film. I think I can recommend it and I hope you enjoy it as well.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"57f40d5ec3a3680529000255","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57f40d5ec3a3680529000255","movie_id":205588}

The movie ends too fast, all the action takes part in the last 15 minutes so they wrap it up very poorly and not enjoyable. The horror scenes look more funny rather than scary and that makes it even worse.

{"author":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","content":"A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com\r\n\r\n\u201cOur Kind of Traitor\u201d is the perfect anti-summer summer movie: it\u2019s a thoughtful, talky, decidedly adult spy thriller that\u2019s elevated by exceptional performances from top-notch acting talent and a clever, sharp script. You aren\u2019t going to find lots of shootouts or pointless action scenes here, it\u2019s the situations that will keep your mind actively guessing from start to finish. Director Susanna White instead chooses to focus on brains not brawn, and the result is an engrossing dramatic film with much greater depth than I expected.\r\n\r\nPerry (Ewan McGregor) is a university professor who is on a getaway in Morocco with his barrister wife Gail (Naomie Harris). While sitting alone in the hotel bar, he strikes up a conversation with Dima (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd), who turns out to be a Russian mobster whose family is on the fast track to execution by even badder bad guys. Dima requests that Perry hand deliver a flash drive with secret information to the British government upon returning to the U.K. and sensing the imminent danger to the man\u2019s family, Perry obliges. Soon after, Perry is approached by MI6 agent Hector (a standout performance from Damian Lewis) and becomes an integral component of an involuntary spy game.\r\n\r\nAll of the leads play perfectly off each other, each bringing a contrasting, distinctive style of character to the screen. McGregor is perfectly clueless as a professor of poetry, Lewis is proper and resourceful as a by-the-books Englishman agent dealing with government red tape, and Skarsg\u00e5rd is spot-on as a genial, boisterous thug. Each of these men easily deserve major award nominations for their performances.\r\n\r\nThis is a well made tale of espionage and is far better than the last John le Carr\u00e9 adaptation (2011\u2019s dreadfully convoluted \u201cTinker Tailor Soldier Spy\u201c). \u201cOur Kind of Traitor\u201d is the perfect choice for adults who are just sick and tired of all the noise that\u2019s currently clogging theaters. This isn\u2019t your typical mindless summer fare, and I encourage all grown ups to seek it out.\r\n\r\n**A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com**","id":"579cfcabc3a36837b2000e39","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/579cfcabc3a36837b2000e39","movie_id":205588}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**So this is where it all began!**\r\n\r\nIt is a decent horror film, but surely better than the first. The previous part was an usual teen themed horror where everything started as a playful. But this one was a prequel and it focused on the origins. A single mother with two daughters is making money helping the people who want to contact their beloved dead ones. The things changes when her little daughter started to communicate the spirits of her own. The chaos unleashes, the house becomes haunted and the family begins to fall apart.\r\n\r\nKeeping it simple is what worked out well for the film, despite thematically borrowed from others, scenes were kind of familiar and characters intentionally developed. Particularly the priest role was the most overused in any horror film. Followed by the twist. That turning point was good, but not a new. Nice performances and well shot film. Ouija is a fine concept for a horror theme and with this film's somewhat success, I hope the next one would only get better. So it is worth a watch, if you're not anticipating a something special.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"597e0d2f9251415daa01a2c7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/597e0d2f9251415daa01a2c7","movie_id":335796}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"A remake of The Intouchables, a 2011 French film that was a box office phenomenon in its home country, Thozha is heart-warming and crowd-pleasing, two qualities that ensure that we don't dwell much on its formulaic plot that involves characters from varied socio-economic backgrounds learning life lessons from each other. Director Vamshi sticks to the structure of the original and this largely helps his film because more than story and plot, this is a film that is about its lead characters.\r\n\r\nHere, the two characters are Seenu (Karthi), a small-time criminal out on parole, and Vikramadithya (Nagarjuna), a man with an embarrassing amount of wealth. And Vamshi gets the crucial element of casting right. In Karthi, he has an actor who can be loud, blunt, and wide-eyed, and still remain charming. The character is even slightly lecherous towards Keerthi (Tamannaah, whose brief for this role must have had only two words: dress fashionably), Vikram's secretary, but it is because of Karthi that we look past this aspect. The actor also nicely captures the astonishment and anguish of the character. Seenu might come across as someone enjoying the perks that come in the way of his job, but we are also able to sense that deep down he would rather swap the riches for his family's love. His railway clerk 'mother' (Jayasudha), who is the breadwinner of the family, detests him for having become a criminal, while his sister and brother give a damn about him. The incidents involving this family's problems is something that we have seen often, and yet, as a drama, it works.\r\n\r\nBut the character of Vikram is one-note. He is written as an implausibly saintly figure even though his disability itself automatically makes the audience empathise with his character. Every other character in the film, even his ex (Anushka, in a cameo), speaks of him in a worshipful manner that there is hardly any edge to Vikram. He doesn't even seem to be angry at his situation, even at his lowest point. Nagarjuna projects the stature of a multi-millionaire effortlessly, but he is somewhat unconvincing when it comes to conveying the helplessness and trauma of a disabled person.\r\n\r\nStill, the strong sense of camaraderie between Karthi and Nagarjuna is instrumental in making us root for their characters. And even though it deals with disability, things rarely get treacly in Thozha. It even finds a way to have a Seenathana-like item number. And when things get emotional, there is always a humourous remark a couple of dialogues away. Take for example the scene where Vikram's friend Prasad (Prakash Raj in a tailor-made role) talks to Seenu on Vikram's past. Like Seenu, we turn misty-eyed when we learn what happened, but soon start laughing when Seenu lightens the mood by revealing the truth about a painting that Prasad had bought. In fact, more than the emotions, it is the laughs like this one that make the film tick.","id":"57036907c3a36822bd00090e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57036907c3a36822bd00090e","movie_id":369925}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**What is the most painful, the war or the lies?**\r\n\r\nThis is pleasantly a surprise film. I would say it is this year's the Oscar winning film 'Ida'. Frankly, there's nothing to compare between two. Not just both of them are modern black and white film, but they are quite similar in the portrayal of lead female characters. Just like 'Marie's Story', it was also inspired by another Hollywood film, 'Broken Lullaby'. I haven't seen that. Even not many people have seen it. One of the less known classic drama which I am going to give a try now. Coming back to the film, it was about the World War I that centres on a young woman who lost her fianc\u00e9.\r\n\r\nNearly two hours drama, quite slowly narrated, but I never felt drag in storytelling or boring to follow it. From the director of 'In the House', yet another masterpiece. Yeah, it looked like that way for me. Only a very few characters and they all developed so well, almost till the end when a few more joined them. The title role was appeared for like only 4-5 minutes in the entire film. Well, that was the topic, a reason for this story to begin along with the WWI. Though the following storyline was built on a different platform.\r\n\r\nLike there is a saying 'to hide one lie, a thousand lies are needed', that's what this film was actually about. Living and keep on evolving in the endless process. It is a moral, a message film, but the mistake was committed by someone else that another person has to take the fall for it, even after he goes out of the picture. Really a touching story, but not a tearjerker. The journey of life is sometimes unexpected, particularly when it comes to romance that blooms when one needed it last at the circumstance he's at his life.\r\n\r\n> \u275dWhat would the truth bring? More pain, more tears.\u275e\r\n\r\nThis is not a war film, just in case if you are expecting one. It was a subject under everything happen. So, there's only less than 5 minute clips of them in the film. Basically, those clips too were not required, but it's always nice to see them in pictures when a flashback come into play. It is a pure drama that sets in just after the end of the WWI. A young German woman is mourning for the death of her fianc\u00e9. She discovers a young French man who claims his close friend came to condole his demise. He meets the rest of the family and shares those happy days he spent with him in Paris before the war. During his stay, they all get along quite well, despite the people from society are against it\/him.\r\n\r\nThat was the first half of the film, developed slowly and steadily, but ended with a twist. The following half began on the new direction with lots of mysteries surrounding. Completely unpredictable, yet as a viewer, I had hundred of different thoughts about the upcoming developments. I was somewhat right on most of the occasion, but I was even happier about how it all went on its own style. Now the story entered the France. More twist and turns unfolded. The pace of the story looked the same, though lots of developments made it look advanced very fast.\r\n\r\nThe World War II is the most dominated theme in the war films. When you see a film on WWI, you will come to realise its perspective, if the film was made with the right dose of everything, even if it was not based on the real event or the person. Fighting the war, carrying the wound, grieving for the lost ones, struggling to rebuild the life and the nation. This is definitely one of the best WWI related, I mean about the aftermath of the war films I've seen. The screenplay was magic. I would surely give an award for it. And then the beautiful photography. I don't know it was because of the black and white, but virtually you would be taken back to the 1919. Simple, yet a great camera angles that must be appreciated.\r\n\r\nWonderful cast. Without those amazing performances, this film would have been nothing. Anna is the name you would remember for very long and the actress who played it. In a couple places, the screenplay turns semi colour, particularly when musics takes the front stage. Just in case if you are yet to watch, pay attention to that, because not everybody notices that. To me it looks like an Oscar product, but the release date confirms not eligible for the next Oscars. Different people have different opinion, but I think it is a must see. Those who struggle with slow paced narration, if they manage the opening half, then they would enjoy the remaining and love the overall film. Definitely a hidden gem, it just needs more audience, that's all.\r\n\r\n_8.5\/10_","id":"59430bbc9251417f6b013cff","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59430bbc9251417f6b013cff","movie_id":377263}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Full of mysteries, twist and turns!**\r\n\r\nThis was Michael Shannon's show as Frank, but the plot developed mysteries surrounded by character Lola that played by Imogen Poots. Basically the entire film is about these two and after the halfway mark, another character joins them to add more suspense. Well, it was the story of a decently succeeded chef and his new girlfriend. Their relationship strengthens in a short period of time. They think they know each other enough, but one day a new secret revealed from Lola's past. That's the beginning of everything in this film, following many turns in the narration, the story reaches its end.\r\n\r\nThe major issue was too much suspense. The writing should have been simplified. So not everybody easily understands the film or the purposes of film scenes\/events. But it is more revenge based than psychological thriller-drama. That does not mean you can rule out everything else possibilities. Lola is the key and till the final scene she frequently diverts the story developments to give a new perspective on where the film is heading. So definitely not predictable film, particularly not the conclusion. This is exclusively for neo-noir fans. But for others it is one time watchable film.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"58caf73a9251415e7600284a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58caf73a9251415e7600284a","movie_id":316021}

{"author":"EmkEyen","content":"One of those films that becomes difficult in giving a fair judgement. On one hand, it is very engaging when the action is on. On the other hand, there are questions that arise when it is not. \r\n\r\nThe narrative is an uncomplicated stage play. The arcs come and go as expected and characters and plot details are re-\/introduced accordingly. The characters have distinct roles and sides but little history more than what is immediately presented. The violence is grisly and more graphic than common in action movies but still glorified and not really a shocker in realism. It is still a suspense flick, so there is much crawling about after multiple gunshot wounds though there is the flesh wound in the arm that is a smart reverse take on seventies action movie tropes. The set and aesthetics are beautiful and so are the facial hairs. It is hard to not refer to Tarantino, but that is what you get when you do a retro gangster shoot out drama that drops pop cultural references. Thankfully it stays on a grounded level and does not try to be more clever than it is. Then again, there is not much development either but for the strenuous progressions of the positional wars of the battlefield.\r\n\r\nThere are other details that I will not mention for the sake of spoilers that I find worth discussion, which are not necessarily good or bad but they are still there. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I'd say it is a movie worth watching for the bullet ballet in itself. That is if you don't let the analysis get in the way.","id":"5a7e4a830e0a262aa20018fe","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a7e4a830e0a262aa20018fe","movie_id":334521}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The night of bullet business!**\r\n\r\nThis is one of the surprise films of the year. A limited cast and a one day event film. Except the opening few minutes the remaining film was a crossfire event. It's about two groups caught up in a firing from each other from one mistake to another leading the confrontation. In an abandoned warehouse, with a big amount and the cases new weapons lying in the centre, there's no way in or the out. The only way is to fight them all. So the surviving game begins. Whoever wins at the end can take it all with him.\r\n\r\nA very nice concept. With a simple storyline a nice gang fight was drawn out. If you like gangster films, this should watch it. But what bothered me the most was the common logic. You know, they all entered the building after checked for if they are armed, though it can be believed they hid their weapon somewhere and proceeded in. That's not it, the ammos for their gun, they kept firing many rounds like in the army conflict or a video game. That's why it is average to me. Otherwise an unexpected awesome film.\r\n\r\nThe casting was good, but the surprise was Brie Larson. To see the Oscar winner in such kind of small scale film. Also disappointed her role was very small. But there is still hope! All others were good. With their unique characters, nicely used to share the screen equally. The reason for the conflict is not well explained, so it is hard to say who's good and who's bad guys here. But behaviours and further development give out where the story is heading. The end was predictable, and also we can expect a sequel. If they have one in their mind, surely it would only get bigger.\r\n\r\n_6.5\/10_","id":"59b1e9e3c3a3682c2208b348","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59b1e9e3c3a3682c2208b348","movie_id":334521}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Having 800 friends on the list, but not able to handle one particular.**\r\n\r\nThis is a spin-off of the 2014 film 'Unfriended'. So there's no comparison between them But you can't stop people doing that, particularly saying which version they liked the most. For me, I enjoyed the other one which was a bit different than usual in the same themed films. This one was not a single day event based film. It was stretched and developed, especially for the film characters to give more depth in the storytelling. A brief flashback in the beginning, and then comes back to the present with twist and turns in the tale.\r\n\r\nLargely based on facebook culture of the youngsters and the filmmakers applied the same old horror film formula to the rest. For some viewers it will work, particularly facebook fans, I guess. But this was an average film. Everything was already seen before in different film and you are only seeing it which is associated with social media, that's all.\r\n\r\nA German film, but made in English language and cast. The actors were decent, but in some case I was not impressed. There were many flaws, but surely they all can be explained where the film did not do that exactly as it should have even stretched further. That's the point, for being too casual, so the film looked like one of those B category horror-thriller from the past. For watching it once, okay. That includes if you have seen the 2014 film or not, because it is completely different and not fresh enough to impress us.\r\n\r\n_4\/10_","id":"58a3754dc3a3683f59000fb5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58a3754dc3a3683f59000fb5","movie_id":368031}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A country that existed for a brief time in the history of American.**\r\n\r\nOnce again, it proves that the critics are so dumb. In this people to people and people to filmmakers contact era, no one listens to them. Let them do their own sideshow. This was partially based on the real events that takes place in the following years of 1862. When America was fighting a civil war, a man named Newton Knight returned home from the battlefield where he started to help the farmers who were robbed by the armymen. Its like they are fighting their own war, to protect the land and the crops. They knew the consequence and so they were prepared for it.\r\n\r\nThis is over a two hour long film and I think they had covered everything nicely. At some stage it looked like the Daniel Craig's 'Defiance'. But it reveals many events like changing time and the atmosphere, how they adapted to it along to move on. In the opening scene only they had shown us the war, but very soon it moved away to tell what's happening off the battlefield. Like how it's affecting the people. So the resistance emerges and the days going by they gain large power in the region. Very interesting perspective, though everything in the film was not true despite overall plot was inspired by the history.\r\n\r\nMatthew McConaughey alone steered the ship. You will like his performance. The locations were good, but most of them were either farmland or swamp. There's a little event that follows the 80 years later, just to disclose some court law debate over interracial marriage. Not a must see film, maybe if you are an American, then it might be, but other than that its a good watch. I hope the people would realise that and watch it.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"584463ee9251416b2600bcb2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/584463ee9251416b2600bcb2","movie_id":316152}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Fall and rise, a revenge tale.**\r\n\r\nNumber four for the director Affleck after his other film won the Oscars four years ago. He has also written the screenplay and produced it. It was based on the book of the same name. The story of a World War I veteran turned notorious gangster. Escaping from the war, falling in love with a gangster's woman, a bank heist, prison time, the son of a police officer and his journey to the top of the criminal world after losing everything at one stage of his life. More like a revenge film, but the intention was not aggressive. Only the time and the life passage give one to him.\r\n\r\nFrom all his directional films, probably this could be the worst one. It had everything a gangster film needed like gun fights, car chase, revenge, romance, yet I felt lacked depth in its overall theme. Actors were not bad, the settings looked fine. The length of the film was a bit long, but the film offered nothing new. It looked like someone's biography or made it look like one. I think that's the point. Even the end part of the film extends, only to annoy us after two long hours patiently sat for it.\r\n\r\nThe best part of the film, what I liked was the 1920s. The story about between two the World Wars, that too was about an internal affair like underworld activities looked nice on the screen. The cast and crew were best for the film, yet failed to impress us. Though it was not totally a bad film of the year, only it did not stand and deliver as it was promised. So, still it can be watched once if you prefer, but not guaranteed entertainment.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"59bd8db4925141353d017db4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59bd8db4925141353d017db4","movie_id":259695}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Where the sidekicks rules...**\r\n\r\nThis is life and it is animated. We all grew up watching animations believed they are real. They are our first friends and also the first step to understand between the real and unreal. So what happens if you have never got as far as to know they are simply the fictional characters. This film is not about that, but there's a reason to I bring that up in here.\r\n\r\nThis film is about a boy named Owen Suskind, who developed autism at the age of 3. Since then the journey of his life has been very hard, especially for his family who had tried to understand and find a solution for it. But until at one stage of his childhood, after years of observation, they have found a way to connect with their lost son in his own world as the way he desired to meet\/accept them at last.\r\n\r\nIt was not the permanent cure they have been looking for, but it enabled an access to what so far we had struggled to make that kind of progress. All we common people know is that autistic people are sensitive, but genius or mastered in one particular thing they love the most. There's a pattern, and we have to jump in onto it to clear the way to bring both the worlds together. This had been done in the past, so in the present, but this film gives a new perspective to learn new methods.\r\n\r\nThis is not some medical achievement, but the desperate Owen's family found a way. That's a lovely family, they never gave up on him. His big brother as well, trying to teach the grownup's form of love was honest and realistic. Beyond that, his plan for their future together, which eventually one day would come. I know that some of the scenes were recreated from the Owen's life, just for this documentary film. Particularly, I was impressed by the romance parts which reminded me 'Gabrielle'. But hearbreaking at certain satge.\r\n\r\n> \u275dI created a story about sidekicks searching for a hero in my head, and I called it 'The Land of the Lost Sidekicks'.\u275e\r\n\r\nI don't know who did the animation for this, but I loved it all. They used them to narrate the tale very beautifully. There are many fans in the world who love the sidekicks from their favourite films\/animations. Even sometimes, I love them more than the film's heroes. If you do as well, try this, but this film is not about them and they were mostly the blurred animation version. Or you can say, except the film clips, the remaining original animations were simple sketch and acceptable quality.\r\n\r\nIn reality, I don't know the whole life story of Owen, but according to this film, what I learnt, I truly admire his father Ron. He's lucky to have such a father. This film was based on the book he wrote of the same name. And the whole family's effort given a new life to Owen. This film is nominated for the Oscars in the Best Documentary Feature list. But I'm not sure it'll win. Anyway a big thanks to the filmmakers to bring this up.\r\n\r\nI know Disney is aware of this film since they allowed their contents to use in it. They can make a feature film out of it, a neat biopic. That would be a great honour for such a big fan of their works. But I'm particularly interested in the Owen's vision about his 'The Land of the Lost Sidekicks'. It's nothing less than the Marvel's 'The Avengers', but for the kids and for the fans of Disney's 2D animations like me from the pre 2000.\r\n\r\nThis film is not under-appreciated, but under-recognised as of now. So I hope you put this into your watch list. It is a good family film, a message in it. We're surrounded by all kinds of people, so it does not matter if the film is not for us, at least you will learn something out of it. That's the any documentary film's notion, as always. You might have seen films about autism like 'Rain Man' to 'I Am Sam' to many more and this one is real as most of them are. Definitely worth giving it a try.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"58b3435892514177a800b1d2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b3435892514177a800b1d2","movie_id":376233}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Lost in India, found in Australia!**\r\n\r\nBased on the book 'A Long Way Home' that tells the story of a young Indian boy who lost his brother in a railway station in the night and the next morning he woke up thousands kilometers away from home. Not knowing the language or the address and the names of his family, he struggled from various threats in the society. After that he got adopted from an Australian family and the rest of the film revolved on his true identity. Haunted by his past, how he rediscovered his originality was emotionally told.\r\n\r\nVery impressive film. The families should not miss it. Even though it is a must see by all ages. I am not a big fan of Dev's performances, even in his debut film 'Slumdog Millionaire'. After that success, he had survived in the film industry doing decent roles, for like a decade. But it was 'The Man Who Knew Infinity' that changed his career. For the first time I liked him very much in that, and again he was pretty impressive in this. The second best performance in his career. Though his part comes only after the half way mark. Yet in that one hour, he did great, particularly in the sentiments.\r\n\r\nI was wondering why it was called 'Lion'. And I got answered only just before the end credit. So you should be patient to learn why, if you are yet to see it. It was not until the 90s the India began to see a real change. This story takes place in the mid 80s, only the opening half and those parts were raw and cruel, especially in the eyes of an 8 year old boy. That kid was so good. Just like Jacom Tremblay, a year before who impressed us with his performance from the film 'Room'.\r\n\r\nIt was a feature film debut for the director and he was wonderful in this attempt. The film splits into two, the first half was about lost and the following half is about finding the road back to the home. Less dialogues, but well written in those necessary parts. The music was good. Only negative was the film was out of depth. Yeah, all the events were like fast forward. If they had focused on details, the narration would have reached at least 3 hours. Especially I wanted the Australian mother's perspective on how she went through to raise those kids.\r\n\r\nNow I'm waiting for the 2020. I mean 2008 was SDM, 2012 was LoP and 2016 was this one. The 4 years later, surely there will be another India related western film would come. Despite this film nominated for the 6 Oscars, it had won nothing. That's very sad. Overall, I strongly suggest it. One of the best films of the Year.\r\n\r\n_9\/10_","id":"59519b529251412ac7014299","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59519b529251412ac7014299","movie_id":334543}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Although a simplistic and familiar theme is explored involving sinister forces tormenting a child in distress, Swedish director David F. Sandberg brings something chillingly fresh to his horror\/psychological offering **Lights Out**.  Sandberg, making his feature film debut, delivers an adequate amount of tension and trickery for all things considered ominous in the edginess of darkness. Lights Out is a reasonable chiller that demonstrates a decent measurement of depth without tripping over its cliched feet. The characterizations that go \u201cbump in the night\u201d in **Lights** are not as disposable as one is routinely used to experiencing in produced over-indulgent, generic boofests.\r\n\r\nThe construction of **Lights Out** feels atmospheric and sparse at times but the manufactured thrills somehow add the necessary alarm factor in a psychological thriller that boasts solid performances particularly by actress Maria Bello as the tortured soul at the center of the CGI creepiness. Sandberg\u2019s adventurous direction and screenwriter Eric Heisserer\u2019s spell-binding script works in part because Lights Out never extends itself beyond its lean and claustrophobic confines. The storytelling is taut and the scare tactics create worthy jolts without further monotony.  There are predictable jumpy cuts and the movie never fully deviates from the conventional suspenseful landscape that populates countless fright fables. Still, **Lights Out** manages to shine some shady brightness on this effectively drawn hair-raising spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe premise introduces the long-lasting notion of childhood fear and despair on the jeopardized shoulders of young insomniac Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) who has long since left the haunting homestead where the evil vibes of a dastardly spirit had tortured her relentlessly.  Rebecca is now concerned that the tawdry tradition of this shifty spook is now about to terrify her little 10-year old stepbrother Martin (Gabriel Bateman). In fact, Martin wants to split his hellish household and escape to Rebecca\u2019s place for some guaranteed safety. After all, who can blame the poor kid for wanting to abandon his doomed domicile.\r\n\r\nEnter the problematic Sophie (Bello). As the nervous-wreck mother to both Rebecca and Martin, Sophie has had her share of disappointments, heartaches and breakdowns in the past and present. It was revealed that Sophie had spent some critical time in a mental institution many years ago which explains her current complicated issues with men\/relationships not to mention the strained connection with her disillusioned children. More important, Sophie faces the dilemma of encountering an assortment of deceased figures that randomly pop up from time to time within her expansive, worrisome walls. But nothing is more arousing or concerning than Sophie\u2019s run-ins with the devilish Diana (Alicia Vela-Bailey), her troubled off-the-wall pal and fellow asylum inmate from yesteryear.\r\n\r\nWhat is so jittery about Diana\u2019s presence in the house is that she is so clingy and protective of her precious Sophie. The key to Diana\u2019s horrifying existence is when the lights are turned off, Thus, it allows the deranged feminine entity to roam the house in a blanket of blackness while staking the beleaguered Sophie in the process.\r\n\r\n**Lights Out** (originally Sandberg\u2019s short film competition entry years ago) acts as a symbolic mirror reflecting the echoes of mental illness and inherent self-destruction concerning the fragile psyche. The film percolates convincingly when Bello\u2019s Sophie is scarred constantly by the harried ties that bind. Sandberg demonstrates a wounded woman on the edge of insanity. The suffering of inner conflict and outer self-doubt has consumed Sophie to the point where she has personalized her self-inflicted poison with baggage ranging from a couple of deceased husbands to the harsh reality that her children are weary of her toxic nuttiness. Bello displays the brokenness and confusion of her portrayal with applauded conviction. The sister-brother tandem of Palmer\u2019s Rebecca and Bateman\u2019s Martin is both comforting and intriguing as they are joined at the hip in their fright night delusions. Vela-Bailey\u2019s Diana is deliciously shadowy as the intrusive Diana applying the statically gloom.\r\n\r\nThe nightmarish special effects are challenging and imaginative and cinematographer Marc Spicer\u2019s experimental lighting gives **Lights Out** its gripping sheen. Overall, Sandberg\u2019s menacing mechanism of a movie certainly forces the shaky hand of its skeptical audience to snuggle up to the nearest light switch.\r\n\r\n**Lights Out** (2016)\r\n\r\nRat-Pac Tune Entertainment\r\n\r\n1 hr, 21 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Maria Bello, Teresa Palmer, Gabriel Bateman, Billy Burke, Alicia Vela-Bailey, Alexander DiPersia\r\n\r\nDirected by: David F.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Friendship or business!**\r\n\r\nThis is a pure drama. Like a real life event, though there's no documentary style narration influenced. Thematically very, very simple, and also the characters, but too flat when it comes to entertainment value. Of course, drama-films usually does not entertain its viewers, except for who are ardent fans of that genre. Apart from depicting the real life, sometimes they carry messages with them. But this film has no tick marks on any of those boxes. So it is a boring film if you pick it to watch when you're on the average or in the bad mood. I did not feel that way, just hinting out it could do that for others.\r\n\r\nThe storyline had no focal point. It is neither a children's film, nor about the grownups' issues. But kind of mix of both on a small scale with strong outcome. Pretty much like on the two topics it was developed on. One was the 'death' which initiated everything and followed by the 'shop' that helped to make further progress in the tale. So using these, the film characters bloomed. Even though, these topics come into play occasionally and in the meantime, the scenes were wasted or you can say it followed the character to their daily routine to fill the film runtime.\r\n\r\nSo what's that mean is the screenplay, which was not at its best. It does not follow the traditional film way on the character developments. Like I expected the friendship between two boys like how they find each other as to emerge a strong bond. That did not happen. It was just like I said in the real life, too casual and understandable.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for the adult characters as well. When they decide to handle the shop issue, it was like hesitation like any average concerned family does. So this film will be good if your life is\/was close to the events in the film. Like either it is your friendship that tested or dealing the sensitive issue as a grown-up that affects deeply those concerned ones.\r\n\r\n> \u275dOnce again, our warm, lovable, unwise father has left us a big mess and no instructions.\u275e\r\n\r\nNow you might think what this film is all about. This is the story of the two families connected with a building. Opens with a small Manhattan family arriving in Brooklyn to conduct the last rite to their deceased father. They are received by another family who rented the shop in the ground floor. Both the family has the young boys of the same age and following the ceremony, the two become very close. But when their parents decide to sort out the shop issue, it's all fall hard on them and their friendship. The remaining is to reveal the outcome of whatever happened.\r\n\r\nYou might be familiar with the quote that goes like this, 'a friendship founded on business in better than a business founded on friendship'. Basically, that's where the film inspired from. But it expanded to two sets of the characters, between the youngsters and the adults. These two categories are exactly opposite in mindset. Youngsters usually does not care about money that involves friends, but for adults, money is a serious matter to handle. The 'business' is attached to the parents and the 'friendship' drawn between their children.\r\n\r\nNow that's the complication involves as many people as to solve without affecting anybody. But most of the film was overwhelmed by scenes of other than this issue. They ignored to focus completely on where it had calibre. I felt the casting was the best thing happened in the film, particularly those boys. Alfred Molina, who played one of the main characters in the director's previous film was appeared here in a guest role for like a minute. The rest of them were decent as well, including Greg Kinnear.\r\n\r\nThe film was just under the 90 minutes, yet too slow paced narration. Does not fit for everyone to watch. Imagine if this film was played on the television, with all the commercial breaks, you won't able to finish it off. Not without patience, because it is already dull, and if you will run out that, that's it. A lot like a product for the film festivals and it did fared decently on those platforms, but surely some people would find it good. So now you might think what my stance is. I liked it, also didn't. An average film with a slipped away opportunity. I am not sure, but still feel like I want to suggest it.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"59430ae4c3a3686beb0137a3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59430ae4c3a3686beb0137a3","movie_id":373473}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**When one parent's failing, the kid needs another.**\r\n\r\nThis is the second Finnish film for me in a week. '...Olli Maki' was a sport-biopic, but this one is a simple fictional drama. All woman team, watching it on the occasion around Women's day make it a special. The story was not impressive enough. Lacks the originality, but overall decently made film.\r\n\r\nA coming-of-age theme that tells about Varpu who just turned 12. She lives with her mother, who is a character of underage. There's nothing bad about her, but she feels the world is a very complicated place and complaints a lot like a tween for even small small things.\r\n\r\nSince the Varpu is growing up fast, thinks her mother is failing to handle a girl like her age. So that leads her to look for her dad who she had never seen before. A little adventure on that, followed by issues surrounding it, how she overcomes and put her life back one track are the remaining parts to reveal us.\r\n\r\nAnybody who had seen the handsome of films in their life would think this film is just okay. That's true, yet I won't say it was a bad attempt. In fact, in some of the parts, the story won't advance as you think. The writing was neat, except lags a bit often, but that did not cause any annoyance.\r\n\r\nThe entire story was told from a teenager's perspective, yet very matured from the contents wise. Like the tough decision to venture is to clear the doubts once and for all. What she discovered did not surprise as that's how her life had been so far. She's been with her mother all her life, so it was particularly to learn about her father.\r\n\r\n> \u275dShe was so sweet and wise right from the start. Now she's dying or suffering somewhere, because I'm so retarded.\u275e\r\n\r\nThere's no way the film could have been better than this. Because the message was nicely conveyed. Altering that would have given a different film, which is not the notion, I believe. Especially a girl who discovers what her parents truly are, I mean their capacity. Clearly her life begins onwards to be an adult in early age.\r\n\r\nThe casting was so good. The three looked like an average real family. It was done without much hype. Like, you know, the mystery of dad was solved after some dramatic twist, but everything was kept within the limits. Especially most of the viewers would be looking for the Varpu's driving skill which they think could influence to bring a twist in the tale. But what follows is a twist to our anticipation. By the way the girl was excellent. I think she will be a fine actress.\r\n\r\nThe clich\u00e9s were not overused, instead it was used to shape up the story in its diversions. Whenever the narration reached its dead end, the following events quickly hops on a new path with fresh developments. This happened, particularly on two major occasions in which the first was after finding her dad and the next was after knowing his true identity.\r\n\r\nAt that point, the film was almost done narrating the tale. Only finishing touch with little explanation was given on a few things. It is a good conclusion and quite enjoyable overall film. So I think the film's not for everyone. This is especially for those watches with admiration like with enthusiasm than those who watch it for no reason and interest. In simple words, for film fanatics and family audience. I said lots of positives, so you might think I would recommend it highly, but I won't. Instead, semi-recommended for overall readers.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58d809599251411fd505bdd2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58d809599251411fd505bdd2","movie_id":408203}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**An unplanned crazy ride.**\r\n\r\nFrom the writer, director of 'Human Capital' fame. This is a road adventure that's filled with some fun, thrills and emotions. The story of two women and their unplanned journey to their unfinished businesses. Kind of self-discovery theme, but it gets a little crazy as what the title says. If you know Paolo Virzi and his films, then you know what to expect from it.\r\n\r\nWell, it begins with when a new member Donatella at a mental institution was fooled by Beatrice, who was there for quite a some time. They might have differences, but have some unfinished affairs outside. An unlikely friendship blooms between them and one weekend, the situation favours them to get away. From there where their journey goes and how it all ends comes in the rest of the narration.\r\n\r\nThey both are not ill or the danger as they were institutionalised. Then why is what the film is going to narrate for us. Before that, it was initiated with a simple introduction of them and the situation they are in. It was really a good start, but then between the end of the first act and the beginning of the second was looked decent. Because that part was very familiar. You know, what do the people do when they runaway which were mostly wandering around and enjoying the freedom.\r\n\r\nI thought it was a good film, not as I expected. Then, ever since the second half was on the roll, it got a lot better, in fact I started to love it. From a meaningless ride to something sensible topic, the narration comes to the point, what it was holding back in the earlier. Each woman's life revealed before to when this story had commenced. So the trip comes to an end when they do what's better for them and everybody around them. Kind of sad, though it concludes in a right way.\r\n\r\n> \"A mother's love is all giving, never expecting anything in return.\"\r\n\r\nThe two lead actresses were amazing. Second back to back film for director with Valerina Bruni and she was even better than the previous film. Because the scope of her role was much bigger in this. I don't know I had seen her before, but Micaela Ramazotti was so good, by performance as well as glamorously. There's no way you could part them and say only one of them were good. I loved them both equally. Actually, that's how their characters were developed. The entire film was about them, and they left a mark to remember this film for them.\r\n\r\nIt's a good film, so I don't think it is an Oscar material as the Italian film board had already picked another film for that. But surely it going to win some international awards. If the same film was made in Hollywood, would have considered an average, because this one got the Italian flavour. The film gets crazy, in an Italian style, and in the perspective of the middle aged women. But it can enjoyed by everyone.\r\n\r\nI have been watching a few good Italian films of the year, including this one. So I would definitely recommend it. Nearly two hours long, but the pace gets better while the story developed. Remember this is not the only kind, but one of the best among this theme you had ever seen. Ending the story with high emotional was so good, especially if you like that kind of material. I hope you won't miss it. Meanwhile, I'm so excited for the director who is making his first direct English language film. Looking forward to its release.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"5851a856c3a36827a5018777","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5851a856c3a36827a5018777","movie_id":380225}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Against all odds, the party's on!**\r\n\r\nThe title itself a short and sweet synopsis. What happens in the film is a chaos during partying and with the crazy twist and turns, the story head for the conclusion. There's no any difference comparing it with other Christmas party films you had seen. Just the cast and scenario changed, that's all. While the setback for his company branch, the head of the office decides not to compromise on the Christmas celebration thrown to his employees. At the same time, he has to pursue a big client who could save the office from closedown. So his intention turns to impress him at all the cost.\r\n\r\nSeasonal films like this should be watched when it comes out, which is during the Christmas\/December. Because it will achieve a better result with us since we're set for the mood. I missed it then, but watched off the season and even though, I quite enjoyed it. Yeah, this film is not any good, yet nothing stopped me from having some fun. The comedies are clich\u00e9, but the actors were good. Fast paced narration, over hundred minutes long. Shot most of the film in a building, there's a little outdoor adventure. Overall, worth a watch, even though a below average film.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"5935cf0992514104f300342c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5935cf0992514104f300342c","movie_id":384682}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The good, the Bad and the Ugly sides of the FBI force!**\r\n\r\nThe post Harry Potter series, apart from awesome in 'Horns', Daniel Radcliffe struggled to find his character, where he fits in. I mean he tried many different ones, but I think in this he was so good. Initially I thought 'whaaaat?' Because with his physique, he did not qualify to play an FBI agent. He was like when the Captain America first came to the army recruitment. And then when the story progressed, I realised the character was designed that way. So I found it kind of fun, though the topic it was dealing, especially knowing it was inspired by the real, this is definitely an eye opener.\r\n\r\nThe first 5 minutes reveals the film's whole plot. Though the opening was the end part of some undercover operation taken by the FBI. It does not show us how it all had happened, but with a new mission, another similar kind of event follows which is what this film.\r\n\r\nSome people call it a propaganda, but I think it was a good message film for the common people. For how misused the homeland security force. I mean they were doing their jobs, but for achieving big within the force, they take the risks which unfortunately transforms the barking dogs into the biting ones.\r\n\r\nSo basically the infiltration means, they are the one to encourage those bad guys to act, in order to get them red handed. If it was for a good cause like if they nab the real culprit, then it's okay, but the innocents should not be turned into evil and punished. Like there are no bad guys, but they make one and take into the custody. If you watch it and think about it, you would relaise what I meant.\r\n\r\nIt was a better film than I anticipated, and the performance by Daniel Radcliffe was the highlight of the film. Some newcomer directed it and decently done his job. Not a must see, but surely I force you to watch it to learn the good, the bad and the ugly sides of the FBI force.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5835da359251416a3101a709","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5835da359251416a3101a709","movie_id":374617}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Life. For some people it is worth living for something!**\r\n\r\nBased on the journal of a person who had got killed in the 1999 shooting at a high school in the US. Really inspiring character and the story, till that final horror event. But the real shame was, the filmmakers used it to promote religious. Or maybe they have highlighted too much from the religious aspect. Because, her life and that horrific event connected with her unexpected prediction which are only a coincident, rather any miracle from heaven. I'm not against believers, but I anticipated honest, a reality, not fantasy.\r\n\r\nSo coming to the film, apart from misusing a real person's life, it was a nice film. Nice casting and performances. Masey McLain was so pretty and awesome in her role. Don't expect it to be the film about that 1999 shooting. It was not about that, except it had a connection as everything was built behind it. They have shown very little from that angle towards the end. Some of the real footage attached in those parts. Yeah, the end was emotional as expected. Everyone might not find it a good film for what I had told earlier, nevertheless the true story deserves some respect.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"59ec959a92514119fc00da9e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59ec959a92514119fc00da9e","movie_id":409502}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Multi-layered Mediterranean Sea tale.**\r\n\r\nThis documentary film is not in detail like any normal documentary does, to highlight the rights and wrongs. Actually, it speaks less and reveals more through its pictures. So anybody can make their own narration watching this film. The filmmakers left that part empty for you the viewers to decide. But my advice for you if you want to try this, that don't expect it to be about the 'immigration' alone. This film was multi-layered. There are many angles of focus about different topics, but kind of all are connected which is the Mediterranean Sea.\r\n\r\nSo the common thing in the film is the Sea that divides the two continents, Europe and Africa. This film sets around that region about the people who depended on it for the living, growing up and looking for the fresh life start. But the majority of those who saw it recognise only the refugees who cross the sea. That's wrong to label this film is about the refugees. Around 20-25 per cent of the film concentrated on that issue. Only about their struggle on their journey to the other side, but it reveals nothing on its root cause. If you ask me, I would say only one religion making all this mess in the middle-east, otherwise you won't see the western army in that region.\r\n\r\nSome of the clips, the real ones are really disturbing. I won't blame those people who took such risk to get the other side of the sea. Believe me, I'm not a nationalist, so I won't believe in borders and regions that divided over language and ethnicity base. But I do mind the religious. If that was eradicated from the earth's surface, particularly one that's causing all the trouble immediately, we can co-exist peacefully. That's the major issue here, but we're after temporary solution. The film does not say all this, but you will get the clear picture.\r\n\r\n> \"The ships fired rockets and at sea. It was like there was fire at sea.\"\r\n\r\nFor me this was an average film. I have seen the much better documentaries than this on various issues of the world. The filmmakers don't want to take sides, so they only revealed the truth by just following and making videos of life in and around the Mediterranean Sea. Like I meantioned earlier, some of the angles do not make any sense or difficult to understand its purpose. I don't know the others, but I have got plenty of questions about the film to ask the filmmakers. If you are like me, welcome aboard.\r\n\r\nIt was the Italian entry for the 2017 Oscars and it did not make, but found a slot in the list of Best Documentary Feature. This is the first out of five from that category I have seen, so I don't know whether it wins the award or not, but as per the prediction made by film fanatics and critics, this is the frontrunner.\r\n\r\nWhatever the result would be, I'm not recommending it particularly the common people. Because the film fails to narrate the story which is very essential from the average peoples' perspective to get the message clear and loud. All one can get with this is only the outline on the very important issue at the moment. Remember how the David Attenborough's narration made to reach all the corners of the earth. Confusing over the purpose of the documentary, possibly misleading. Its like watching a news channel on the mute mode. Otherwise, this should have been one of the best of its kind.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"58b09525c3a36823540001c0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b09525c3a36823540001c0","movie_id":377151}

The 27th film to do that so and the 5th animation film. This sequel was made after 13 years, surely a long gab, but 'Finding Nemo' was one of my favourite animations, tell me who does not love it those who love animation. Nevertheless, I liked the idea of having a sequel, but I scared it would go to flop terribly. Now, after watching this, I totally stunned. This is not a greatest animation ever made, but the way the screenplay handled, along with other stuffs, this makes one of the best among its kind.\r\n\r\nFirstly, when I heard the sequel's title, it made me laugh. Like, whaaaat? Once again the story is going to repeat. I did not think it would bring a big change. Actually, it was a different tale, especially I was not expecting it to be emotional. Tell me how many tearjerker-animation you have seen. Once again the Disney-Pixar jointly did it. I think appreciation must go to the director who also made the original film. Great casting too, I mean the voice- over artists.\r\n\r\nWe know that Dory is severely suffering from the short term remembory (memory) loss. Now this tale is going to reveal her backstory. From her childhood to till she meets Marlin and then Nemo, there was a series of forgotten events. She slowly regains some of those memories and begins her quest to find out more. This is where she gets lost, but the title defines that she was lost before and now looking a way to get back where she really belongs.\r\n\r\nFor me, after 'Frozen', this film is what emotionally got me. The value of having family and friends beautifully disclosed. It might be an animation, but still a meaningful story from many perspectives. Lots of new characters were introduced and those were really cool ones. I expect theirs short animations to make its way about their origins, particularly Hank the octopus and his story about how he lost one of his tentacles.\r\n\r\nThe Oscars is the quarter of a year away, but releasing nominees would come weeks ahead. So it's about time to learn where this one fit in. But I'm anticipating close contest between this, 'Zootopia' and 'Red Turtle'. Coming back to the review, this is a good watch, for everybody, so I highly recommend it. I hope there will be a third film, but like I had felt before this, I desire it and then I'm not sure it would extend its legacy to further. So fingers crossed!\r\n\r\n_9\/10_","id":"5835dce5c3a3682fad019c4a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5835dce5c3a3682fad019c4a","movie_id":127380}
{"author":"MrSharkBait911","content":"The recently released Fifty Shades of Black is a comedy spoofing the romantic drama Fifty Shades of Grey which went on to become a super hit worldwide and collected close to $570 million. Principal photography of the movie started in August 2015 in Los Angeles. The film is financed by Octane which is a division of the larger IM Global production house. Stuart Ford, its CEO serves as the movie\u2019s executive producer. Open Road is distributing the movie in the United States. It is interesting to note that Open Road also distributed Wayan\u2019s 2013 parody \u201cA haunted house 1\u201d and its 2014 sequel \u201cA haunted house 2\u201d, both of which belong to the same genre as this movie. \r\n\r\nMarlon Wayans stars as the mysterious Mr. Black in this outrageous comedy movie. He is also one of the producers and is credited as a writer alongside his long-time producing and writing partner Rick Alvarez. Mike Tiddes who directed both the haunted house parodies is the director of this movie. Kali Hawk, Mike Epps, Affion Crockett, Andrew Bachelor, Jane Seymour, Florence Henderson, Fred Willard and Jenny Zigrino appear in this movie along with Marlon Wayans.\r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s soundtrack comprises of a combination of hip-hop and R&B songs. There are 10 songs featured in the album and is released by IM Global Music. The music has been curated by Format entertainment and IM Global Music. The soundtrack goes very well with the movie and is being appreciated by all people who love independent music.\r\n\r\nMarlon Wayans plays a secretive black entrepreneur in this erotic spoof comedy. He starts dating an inexperienced college reporter Hannah played by Kali Hawk. His unusual sexual practices shock Hawk\u2019s character and put a strain on their relationship. What happens when Hannah is taken through the maze of rough, hard and premature encounters inside Mr. Christian Black\u2019s playroom forms the crux of the movie. True to the genre, the movie parodies the original by taking into account the basic story premise, its characters and all the important scenes. Sample this. Hannah is bidding farewell to Black as the elevator doors are closing. Only, the doors are closing several times on Hannah\u2019s head.\r\n\r\nTrue to its tagline, the movie is way shadier than grey in its content and its treatment of the original book and its movie adaptation. It is not easy to spoof a popular movie with a great record at the box office. But Fifty Shades of Black lives up to its expectations and delivers on all counts.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Being oneself. Not to try to satisfy others!**\r\n\r\nCome on! This is an underrated film for sure. There are lots of children's films that are totally unrealistic. Well, there's no excuse for this film as well. But the thing is it was not like those ones. I'm talking about the clich\u00e9s. When a film talks about a kid and his\/her school life, like to be famous, they tend to do anything to accomplish that. So in this, the girl has her own 'to do' list, that's where the story kicks off.\r\n\r\nJessica is a below average girl when it comes to mix with the rest of the school. But she's good at studies and physically fit. Her new attempt to get along with everything like her best friend, Brie, is now a big task of her life. Following the footsteps of her older sister, becoming a cheerleader is the first obstacle. How she fares it and other developments in the tale comes in the latter parts.\r\n\r\nThe film was like 80 minutes long. The storyline was very simple and familiar. But the scenes were slightly fresher. I mean when I thought there will be mean girls in it, it avoided that. Similarly, jealousy, rivalry, the film sidelined them with limits. And ended positively. That's why it was a short and beautiful film. The actors were so good. Emma Ryne looks like a kid version of Blake Lively. I hope they would have a bright future. But I definitely want a sequel. If possible, turn it into a television series. This was based on the novel series, so there are lots tell about Jessica Darling.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"59fe16fc92514146d4023f7b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59fe16fc92514146d4023f7b","movie_id":370765}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**This time the trouble comes finding them.**\r\n\r\nIt was handed over to the two new directors and the result is not so good. This is a most simplest film in the 'Ice Age' series. For the first time, the franchise is in real trouble. Though it managed well at the box office, which is a below par compared to the previous installments. It looks like a short film or it should have been a short film. From the adventures to the locations, everything shrunk in this sequel. Except Scrat, who goes for a lifetime journey into the outer space.\r\n\r\nAs usual the story continued, but this time Manny and his family and friends do not go anywhere, the trouble comes to them. So they have to find a solution to escape from it. At the right rime, Buck returns from the underground and teams up with his old friends to tackle the situation. Besides, Peaches getting married and all the fun adventures from the earth, as well as from the space in the solar system aims at one direction.\r\n\r\nNowadays the space adventure is a big thing in films, and this franchise always extents its boundary for its new sequels, so this time it was something bigger than ever. I think it won't get bigger than this in a concept wise. Particularly Scrat who has been the backbone for this series donned with a spacesuit. Like Minions and Penguins, I too want Scrat's stand alone film. But I think that would not happen, not anytime soon, since those two films did not deliver the expected result.\r\n\r\nIf you are an 'Ice Age' series fan or not, it does not matter, you will be slightly get disappointed for sure. Now it has overtaken the 'Shrek' franchise with this fifth film and they are already thinking about the sixth. This is not that bad, just a watchable average film and you need to be updated if you want to continue the series in the future. So that's the reason I suggest to watch this. Other than that, it is totally ignorable one.\r\n\r\n_5.5\/10_","id":"581cf4bb9251413749001193","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/581cf4bb9251413749001193","movie_id":278154}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"The biggest strength of Idhu Namma Aalu is its leads \u2014 Simbu and Nayanthara. It is canny stunt casting, and this is one of the few things that director Pandiraj has gotten right in this film. The audience know that they share a history, and Pandiraj uses this fact and tries to spin a romance around this. The actors play Siva (Simbu) and Myla (Nayanthara), who have grown up in a small town but have moved to Chennai for work. Siva's father (Jayaprakash) arranges for him to marry Myla, and he, too, falls in love when he sees her. But Myla knows that he was once in a relationship with her friend Priya (Andrea, whose only cue seems to have been: keep smiling). Will this make her reject him? \r\n\r\nThe problem with Idhu Namma Aalu is that Pandiraj seems to have gotten content with his leads that he fails to create an engaging story around them. Every moment feels stretched beyond its welcome, and there are many scenes where we can sense that the director is trying too hard to make them seem cute (Simbu calling his dad 'buddy', the lovers calling each other as kuttima and ammu, which starts to grate after a point) and hep (every time a character dials someone, a dialler screen pops up on the side of the screen!). Scene after scene and dialogue after dialogue keep reminding us that we are seeing Simbu and Nayanthara on screen by referring to their once-upon-a-time relationship, and Simbu's quirks \u2014 his playboy image, his knack towards getting into controversies, and even his worship for Ajith. After a point we stop seeing them as Siva and Myla and so never really care for the characters. \r\n\r\nOf course, this approach works sometimes. Pandiraj can still write catchy dialogues, and his one-liners for Soori keep us cracking up now and then. He is also smart enough to make this much-delayed film seem current by using lines and songs from recent films like Theri and Vedalam in the background. And Simbu, too, gamely lets everyone take a dig at his real-life and tries to liven up things. But is that enough? There is a sudden conflict introduced in the end so that the movie can reach its climax and it is laughably bad even for a film that is this fluffy that we can only cringe at the lack of imagination. From once being considered as a promising new-age director, Pandiraj has turned into a filmmaker who so badly wants the audience to love his film that he has started to readily give them what they want, even if means doing something that is routine. But what is worrying is will he be able to change track or has he gone too far?","id":"57553d49c3a3685f81002861","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57553d49c3a3685f81002861","movie_id":318579}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> In an unfriendly environment they got 13 long hours to survive and resist the attack.\r\n\r\nIt is an action-thriller-war version of the 'Argo'. Based on the true story where the most of the film was the 13 hour long armed battle event took place in Libya, 2012. I remember the middle-east's protest over the western films, this story is set in the same time when the islamic terrorists targeted the American diplomatic compounds in Benghazi, but six brave men stood and fought against the uprising.\r\n\r\nIt is an American patriotic film, but because of the hatred over their own countrymen Michael Bay, they're surely missing a nearly a war masterpiece. The rest of the world saw it as a fine film and appreciated that. If you haven't seen it yet, I say just don't ignore it. It was a well made realistic war film, the actors were amazing and the scenes were suspenseful to spectacular. Definitely one of the best in this theme.\r\n\r\nIt was simply focused on the armed conflict between the two forces, so it won't reasons out us how and where it all began, because that might take another film to tell the tale. That's really a very clever writing. In this 150 minute long film, the first act was full of characters and story development. Then begins the gun fight that commences from the dust hours till the dawn breaks out. With many twists in the narration during confrontation, surely not a film to be missed.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"576d82049251414105002546","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/576d82049251414105002546","movie_id":300671}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"In his previous film, Haridas, GNR Kumaravelan managed to pull off a drama about a disabled kid and his father without reducing it to a treacly affair and with such assuredness, that it made us all look forward to what he does next. But tragically, his Wagah is everything that Haridas was not. It's a badly written, clumsily directed cross-border romance whose approach towards matters of the heart is as naive and laughable as its understanding of international politics, border security and patriotism. \r\n\r\nWhen we first see Vasu (Vikram Prabhu, all at sea), the film's protagonist, we see him as a bloodied mess. Vasu is a BSF soldier who is being held captive by the Pakistani soldiers in an illegal concentration camp of sorts, headed by Razzak Ali Khan (Shaji Choudhary), a villain so cartoonish that he would have been seen as way over the top even in a Captain Vijayakant v\/s Pakistani terrorists film. Vasu was caught by these men while 'dropping off' his Pakistani girlfriend Kanoam (Ranya, who resembles Hansika is some angles, especially because of her vacant expressions and constantly open mouth) safely at her home in Pakistan, by crossing the border without proper permission. \r\n\r\nKanoam (whom, Vasu decides to call Kajal for no reason whatsoever) was on a visit to India to meet her grandfather, where Vasu fell in love with her at first sight (of course!), but her visit was cut short by violence in the Kashmiri valley over Pakistani forces murdering Indian soldiers. Now, Vasu has to escape from his 'prison', rescue his girl and save the lives of the other Indian jawans still trapped in the hellhole. \r\n\r\nThere are instances of directors who won acclaim with a film overreaching and failing in their next one. But, here, Kumaravelan's script is such a muddle that how no one realised its dreadfulness during the making is a mystery. The main reason for this is that Kumaravelan isn't sure whether to treat his story as some epic romance or as a commercial 'patriotic' film. Initially, when Vasu decides to join BSF for no other reason than free booze and relatively little work, we think we are in for a Lakshya-like story of a young man discovering his life's mission. But even after he makes it to Kashmir, Vasu is bored by what he has chosen to do. It is, in fact, refreshing to see a film that displays an irreverence towards being a soldier (especially in these anything-is-an-opportunity-to-outrage times), but the moment the romance, which isn't plausibly built, gets in, things swiftly go downhill. And when this man, who would rather die for his love than for his country, suddenly starts uttering jingoistic lines like 'Enna maadhiri jawan irukkira varaikkum India-la oru adi kooda unnala edukka mudiyadhu', it is a transformation that is hard to believe. \r\n\r\nWhat we get are mainly corny lines like how fences between nations cannot stop the wind from blowing from one side to the other, and how one country's destruction will not result in the development of another. But with no proper set-ups, they end up as being unintentionally funny. The Kumaravelan who gave us Haridas would have latched on to such moments and underscored the bitter irony of how a person, who is from a place 3000km away is accepted in Kashmir, while another, who lives a mere 20km from her grandfather's home, is told that she doesn't belong there.","id":"57ba738c925141753000490f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ba738c925141753000490f","movie_id":353415}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**War is like a business zone, anyone can start-up a business.**\r\n\r\nTen years ago a similar film was made with Nicolas Cage in the lead called 'Lord of War'. This was based on the two youngsters who got into arm dealing, but many events were fictionalised. War is a business and these two made lots of profit out of it. So it all begins when financially struggling David clueless about raising his unborn child. At a right time he meets his old friend Efraim and decides to partner with him to supply arms to the US army abroad in a small scale. But when they saw a big opportunity, they decided to give it a try. From the obstacles, they go the extra mile to achieve it. But not knowing how serious the consequences are, finally they step into a dangerous turf and from there, what follows is revealed in the remaining parts.\r\n\r\nThis is really amazing film. Obviously a slow start, but like after 10-15 minutes later it gets better and better. For these actors, this is something big and they have done it excellently. Jonah Hill was simply unbelievable. Kind of good, as well as negative, totally unpredictable character. Mile Teller was superb, he narrated the story with the opening scene, gun pointed at him, the flashback begins. While the story keeps developing, it only gets crazy and crazier. Nearly two long was never been an issue, because of the good pace, as well as for the off beast storyline.\r\n\r\nLately I have been seeing lots of Ana de Armas, quite a coincident to watch some many films of someone in a short time. Anyway, her role in this was small, but she was decent. From the director of 'Hangover' trilogy, I think one of his best films it is. If you like the American Dream themes like 'Pain & Gain' and 'Wolf of Wall Street' about making dollars in a fast way risking everything, you would enjoy it as well. Like those two, it was also a comedy, despite inspired by the real. One of the film posters imitates the 'Scareface', but there's a strong reason for that, so you should watch it. Definitely worth a watch, so I suggest it!\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"5844638492514166ba00be10","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5844638492514166ba00be10","movie_id":308266}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A man who looked after his family! Literally!**\r\n\r\nIt was like 'Rear Window' meets 'Castaway on the Moon'. A unique film, pretty much pointless, though the world is full of crazy people and everything can be possible. Originally it was based on the short short of the same name. Directed by a writer turned filmmaker. Most of the film was a background narration, despite the story was not a flashback. Because it has less direct dialogues between the characters.\r\n\r\nHoward Wakefield is married with two kids. A hardworking man to provide everything to his family. But seems he's not happy anymore as they are ignoring him lately. A perfect opportunity gives him a chance to know what his family can do with his absence. It might bring an end to all his doubts. Without any pre-plan, the event unfolds, but how long and the consequences, all focused on the later parts.\r\n\r\nBryan Cranston was really good. He's lately making some good films. Though I felt he was a little old for this kind of role. The rest of the cast was okay, mainly Jennifer Garner. The story was simple, but engaging. Maybe a new way to the self-discovery. I was looking forward to how the end would happen. That's a little disappointment, yet a very safe play, regarding how the prior events took place.\r\n\r\nMost of the people would expect a normal cinematic narration, like with all those things, twist and turns. But this was very much like a real life, except that how Howard survived a very long time in the attic and going unnoticed. The flashback really added some interesting flavour. When you are quite clearly rooting for Howard, that old story could change your stance, perhaps to neutral. They had created a great atmosphere, the event, but I felt it all became vain when the end was not clearly says what's the consequence.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**One fights for their new home and the others to defend theirs.**\r\n\r\nI never played Warcraft game in my life, nor read comic book, but I enjoyed this new fantasy universe. Azeroth is the world where this story takes place. When the Orcs planet was destroyed, they use a magic portal to get to Azeroth and make a safe home. But that is where humans and other intelligent species live peacefully. A new race means a new conflict to solve the differences. So the battle commences at no time to gain the power to rule the land. Between the two great powers, who wins is the film to tell us in the rest of the parts.\r\n\r\nIt was something like 'Avatar' and 'The Lost of the Rings' coming together. Despite having alien race, it is very much an action- fantasy film, not a sci-fi. From the games to film, it was awesomely made which is obviously a latest trend in the filmmaking. The graphics were good, but not perfect, and that's fine, because it succeeds to give the game look than the realistic one. I think that's the point, otherwise no disgrace to call it was inspired by the games or comic book.\r\n\r\nI know it is not a masterpiece like 'The Lord of the Rings', but there's a promise like the quality and story and its characters. There's no big names, but these actors who are known mostly for their supporting roles has given their best. Like I said I'm new to this Warcraft universe, so I don't know anything outside this film, but I'm kind of neutral on the war between the humans and orcs. Because one's world was destroyed and they're seeking a new home and the other ones are defending theirs. So everything makes sense from both the perspectives for their actions.\r\n\r\nThis is just a beginning, there's lot more sequels to come. Though, it's a pity that it failed in America, the native product, but internationally proved it is one of best of its kind, I mean games to screen adaptation. The director of 'Source Code' did a great job and all the actors, including those motion-capture artists. I missed Zoe Saldana in this, to be as another blue or green skinned alien specie, instead Paula Patton did well in a similar role. The character name also very similar to the one from 'Guardian of the Galaxy'. I know it's going to get even bigger in the follow-up, so I can't wait for it.

{"author":"shadowartisttxl","content":"Dawei Zhang: \"Recovery of the ordinary.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1981, French philosopher, Jean Baudrillard, published his treatise on signs, symbols and reality: Simulacra and Simulation. In his work, he speaks of a dis-order of the post-modernity situated in societies of late capitalism, wherein the signs and symbols constructing the shared reality of a given society precede and eventually do away with the original objects and people which they seek to represent. This form of society causes the distinction that previously divided reality and its signifiers to vanish, and heightening the absurdity of the individuals relation to the Real, or even, towards ones own works (or even the self,) to a point wherein there is little hope for meaning in any shape or form. Thus, Baudrillard instructs us, following the work of Jorge Luis Borges, that this given society makes such use of the signs and symbols it uses, that the 'maps' of reality themselves replace the Real we sought to navigate by way of these particular details. In this 'reality,' individuals labor is re-oritented towards establishing and securing a place in the representation itself, and as they devote themselves to this representation, the Real itself gets one step further towards complete annihilation.\r\n\r\nIt is with this in mind that one enters Dawei Zhang's directorial debut: Water Margin, which is itself a mournful meditation on this very cultural logic in contemporary China and simultaneously the passion which drives the film is that very refusal to let the hope of undoing this paradigm die. This film is standing on the shoulders of giants, for those films from which it seems influenced, as well as those few films who fit within the same intersection of micro-categories are nothing short of strokes of incredible genius unto themselves. The films which are most strikingly related towards Water Margin are Liu Jiayin's Oxhide and Tsai Ming-Liang's Walker series. In Oxhide for example, we find a portrait of the director's desperate family life confined within a small claustrophobic apartment extrapolated to a universalized stand in for a great majority of Chinese citizens who 'feel' her pain. In Water Margin, Zhang similarly uses his close understanding of those around him and a similar sympathetic perspective to film the absurdity of life inverted within the public arena, while Oxhide neglects access to this anxiety, save represented in the family members returning home, Water Margin picks up the torch and establishes the exteriority only hinted at \u2013 in Zhang's representation there is no familial release, instead it's characters are stuck in this cycle as lonely and isolated figures wandering through the nightmarish landscape ablaze with neon signs and eyes affixed to the floor.\r\n\r\nLike Lio Jiayin, filmmaker Dawei Zhang inserts himself as a character within his own film, and in somewhat of an abstracted visual synecdoche, one finds him seated on the concrete with bag of groceries: among the few wholly striking icons in the film \u2013 an icon that harkens to the Walker series, wherein a Buddhist monk slowly engages in walking meditation amongst the cityscape around him \u2013 the contrast revealing their radical disconnected approach to living, which alienates and exploits the needs and wants of those around him. In the Walker series, the figure of the monk maintains a hopeful parallel to the film itself \u2013 as long as the film persists, and engages an audience who are willing to slow down and engage the world around them in this manner, hope persists as that which is quietly rebellious \u2013 a resistance to become subsumed in the reproduction of a hegemony which maintains no part of the soul of those it governs. In Water Margin however Zhang's character represents a further radicalization of this icon \u2013 no longer is he a man of the cloth, denying the world around him, but a man clothed in the garb of the world that sought to consume him. It is an image of the diasporic within his own nation \u2013 a radical alienation that, while being in the world, is yet at the same time, far from being at home within it. This scene is the visual representation of the portion of the penultimate German Idealist, G. W. F. Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit, which J. M. Bernstein described as \"...the discovery of the disappointment in knowing. Now in knowing, we do not get all the things we hoped we might get,\u201d and that in this type of lived experience, ones own questioning, as represented within the notion of philosophy to Berstein is \u201c....intrinsically disappointment; and to discover that is also so that what philosophy can not do, and what often has been hoped for from philosophy, is that it should offer us a transcendental security: that we are at home in the world. Nothing. Nothing can make us at home in the world. That's what people wanted from philosophy, and that was the mistake that drove philosophy forever to be a series of hyperboles, rather than what philosophy must be: the recovery of the ordinary.\" This is, in part, an intellectualization of the very visual notion which haunts every scene of this film \u2013 there is a desperate longing for 'the ordinary' or 'the practically lived life' which seems in part what Baudrillard suggested to have disappeared with the Real once replaced by its signifiers. Thus, during this very selfsame scene, this notion is expressed effortlessly through a song which begins to play where we find the lyrics \u201cwhen I turn my head to look back, many years have passed by.\u201d By this, we come to understand that this knowing is that which sees China as it has become, and with the knowledge of where this 'becoming' has come from \u2013 we understand at this moment that awful things have occurred, and yet, it seems that no one acknowledges this, perhaps so radically consumed by the fight to be represented within the artificial that they aren't even aware what has slipped through their fingers.\r\n\r\nDespite all of the hope that comes along with having grasped and presented this notion, there is still a helplessness permeating the film, which speaks to the ways in which we as audience members, who find ourselves represented in the critique Zhang is laying out, reduced to inactivity, archetypically represented within his character. This is shown to us once again during a scene in which he finds that his relationship to the natural world is reduced to its occupancy within a plastic bag (the penultimate icon of pointless and wasteful capitalism run amok) to later consume it. His groceries (nature) are found in this scene to be his only companion, as he sits on the concrete amidst the disorienting environment of the artificial. The camera pans from here, and in so doing it turns to Zhang who is singing it at a karaoke bar singing along with a look on his face actualizing in raw emotion what was just intellectually understood in the preceding scene. Directly following this scene, we find the colors of the film inverted as a jazz musician is preforming in the middle of a traditional looking pavilion where he screams out into the void, and is holding onto this hope, and yet this music isn't traditional Chinese music. From this contrast, of nature and the history of China so iconographically packaged, we find that not all hope is of the kind driving this film - there seems indeed to be a hope which is of the wrong sort - this is the hope of art and beauty without a true understanding - this is the hope of beauty torn asunder by the radically divided and absurd nature of the society the artist finds himself in - the artist has lost the drives guiding his hope, and now it remains a hope of desperation alone.\r\n\r\nThe notion of a desperation driving the artists of the world (those who set up concrete determinations which guide our understanding of the map itself) is brought up again when we see the krautrock band, Faust, preforming music on stage into a concrete mixer - it's a direct representation of a tool of labor, a tool used to generate capital advantage for he who owns its worker, eating and mixing the music being preformed into it. The film makes this obvious as we cut from the band to a worker utilizing the tool with its original design in mind. This set of images draws ones mind to the differentiation taking place in each person's approach to the tool as it is in-itself. Following Heidegger, we find that the man working with the concrete mixer is thus in a unified state of being, where his labor is directly linked with the work of the mixer itself \u2013 there is no isolation of the object as being independent from the work with which he approaches it \u2013 his work is not automatic, but is authentically being in-and-for-himself. On the contrary, the performance of Faust is itself drawing one to reflect upon the object, as it has now been removed from the laborer's phenomenal world, and as such it causes us to maintain a conscious recognition of the object, and those interacting with it on stage as situated in the fundamentally broken understanding of themselves as subjects over and against it. We understand then that these figures are themselves one through which the argumentation of the film manifests itself yet again. It's a confused state of being altogether, and thus one which situates those on stage in an absurd condition of lived reality \u2013 their phenomenological situatedness is such that they have been pulled outside of the experience of circumspection, and as such into a conditioned state of being which itself causes a loss of intelligibility, and therefore a state wherein one no longer is at home in the world. Thus, where music previously stood as the spirit of hope and teller of truth, the soul of the music is now consumed and re-produced by the swirling of the mixer, and yet surely this music is now too stripped of what guided it in the first place, and what is generated in its stead is stale, mechanical ambiance of what once was: in this there is just enough to entice those who loved the art of their people before, and yet now simply guides them towards the objects from which their labor may be extracted. Hence, what we find re-presented as aesthetic is the disconnected logic which remains as the spectre of Mao in current Chinese culture: the madness of re-creating a society that has appropriated its own culture to serve solipsistic ends - and when there exist individuals who fit not this solipsism, they are displaced and alienated within the culture of their own people. The ancestral lineage which founded many traditions of spiritual life have now been inverted - the spirits of those whose labor bore the fruit of the culture have been banished, and in their stead only labor may continue to persist as the 'heart' of the Chinese. This self same inversion can be seen and felt again near the end of the film where we find this central thesis repeated. The scene is one where we find people swimming in a pool, which is contrasted to an earlier moment where we learn that the natural bodies of water found within the towns themselves have become toxic to those who live there - we hear a citizen warn against swimming in these natural areas, for we are told \u201cpeople can die while swimming here\u201d - color here shifts from black and white to inverted color \u2013 the atmospheric noise of the real world shift again to an artificial dark ambient noise \u2013 the warmth shown in the image mask the fact that there is still darkness that isn't being addressed; and where there is darkness itself, there should be warmth, yet it cannot be accessed for a variety of reasons that the film just spent the entirety of its duration laying out.\r\n\r\nAs we transition towards the tail end of the film, these are the thoughts on our minds as we see from a first person point of view the image of one driving forward on the moped while a song plays whose lyrics state: \u201cthere's a bridge where people cross and they never return\u201d and thus we understand that we are speaking of the past, and yet thus the image contrasting this song seeks to show the emptiness found in the new society of china which is ever re-producing itself in a never-ending 'progression.' We then abruptly cut. We find ourselves newly situated in an environment unlike anything else found in the film. The tension that the entire film has been forcing upon us suddenly is nowhere to be found. It's as if the entirety of the film has taken place in the actuality of the harsh world, only to find ourselves now in a dream; in heaven; removed from the crushing weight of the film entirely. The imagery is one of seemingly abandoned buildings - time is itself manifest on their walls. We see a wretched looking dog with a chain around its neck, being walked down an alley way, when out of one of the buildings Zhang himself emerges, taking the dogs chain in hand, now adorned with sunglasses, and in communion with his fellow man and with nature symbolized by the dog itself. This newly re-presented Zhang draws the title of the film to reflection in a quick scramble to understand the radical shift in all we had seen prior. Up to this point the title, Water Margin (which is itself the title of one of the Four Classic Chinese Novels,) seemed to be a far cry from what is illustrated throughout the rest of the film; and yet, one of the elements which distinguishes Water Margin from the other Three Classic Chinese Novels is its attention to those not within the ruling class itself, nor mythologizing heroes as outside of the class system altogether. Here in fact Zhang 'wears the uniform' of the working class - the constructed reality around him up to this point is the world which has been re-made to suit the interests of the ruling class, and Zhang, obviously not of this ilk, has instead found himself suffering at the hands of a totalizing corruption, wherein not only does the Real dissipate from the environment available to the working class, but indeed even that which is constructed (think of the pool) is that which exists without access to one another authentically, and instead only maintains a relation by way of the narrative imbued in the constructs themselves. Yet, when we find Zhang in this new environment, we find him no longer alone - it's not a construct of the mind where he has found freedom solely for himself, but instead it is the water to which the entirety of the film seeks to lead others to drink from. This leads one to see that Zhang is perhaps within the brotherhood of the Hao Han (the bandit heroes of Water Margin, who seek to right the wrongs of the ruling class, and set forth a pathway to freedom for those subject to this tyranny;) a fugitive finding solace only within authentic being itself as that which is totally reflected outside of the possibility of life as exists within China at present. Thus, in the final scene we find that not only has the world shifted outside of the phantasmagorical simulation occupying China altogether towards a being as presented in-and-for-itself, but so too has Zhang shifted from a character, to a hybrid presentation of himself as director\/actor\/Hao Han - the film itself and his action therewithin are his fulfillment of not a moral commandment, but the only moral commandment available to a bandit such as himself within late capitalism. Thus, as the camera cuts with Zhang walking out of the set built by broken down windows, which resemble prison bars, we are confronted with the idea of authentic life still surrounded by the prison of the past within the present. We also notice this through the fact that the color itself is different from that which we have seen before - it is a subtle color which paints this metaphysical reality, no longer the wacky colors of the 'metropolitan' life, nor the black and white or inverted colors found previously, but the full and rich color of the Real. We almost feel the cry of one of the quintessential characters of Water Margin, Song Jiang who, harmed by the injustice extracted against him, refuses to respond in kind by exemplifying such misconduct in his life against the ruling class, and the world which betrayed him, but instead took his own life stating: \"The court may wrong me, but I will never wrong the court!\" and instead choosing the legacy within the minds and tales of those he fought for. In this way, Zhang is removed from the world in a symbolic suicide that asks for others to come to the Water so that they too may drink of righteousness and virtue, and as such, Zhang himself may indeed be found situated amongst the other members of the thirty-six heavenly stars and indeed as a true representation of China as it should be, not in a moralizing sense, but instead as a pure \"recovery of the ordinary.\"","id":"5a2c94ed925141032c146076","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a2c94ed925141032c146076","movie_id":491513}

{"author":"tmdb63938527","content":"***CONTAINS SPOILERS***\r\n\r\nDaniel de la Vega is fast making a name for himself and a good name it is too.  Naturally due to this, he is also making a name for Argentinian film also and after now watching two of his features (Necrophobia being the first) I am becoming a real fan of his surreal and utterly bizarre style.  Now admittedly this style may not to be everyones taste but I would urge people to check them out nontheless.\r\n\r\nVirginia (Cardinali) and her daughter are travelling across the country in their car, playing a word game to help pass the time and aleviate the boredom of the journey.  The car suffers a puncture near a deserted and very run down cemetary.  Out of the blue a stranger appears and offers to help with warnings of not staying in the area too long.  A recovery vehicle looms in the distance.  \r\n\r\nOnce on their way Virginia stops to get petrol and lunch.  She instructs her daughter to stay at the table while she makes a quick phone call outside (cliched I know).  When she returns back to the table, her daughter is missing and a deadly and surreal game of cat and mouse starts to send Virginia deep down a rabbit hole she may never emerge from in order to save her daughter.\r\n\r\nMore so than Necrophobia, this is a very messed up, disturbing and brutal film.  The runtime helps here once again (he never seems to out stay his welcome) with its fast pace and frantic style it never lets up either.  It will certainly take you on one unforgettable ride.  Whether you actually understand that ride is entirely another matter altogether.  Strange, confusing, full of 'what the hell' moments, it is certainly an interesting if not flawed production.\r\n\r\nThe production values (as in Necrophobia) are high and the acting all round (especially from the main actors) are reasonable enough.  Certainly better than some much bigger Hollywood efforts recently at least.  Likewise, my biggest bugbear in film, the audio is excellent and you never find yourself struggling to hear what is being said or reaching for the remote.  Being subtitled may help there naturally, but overall this film is excellent in that regard.\r\n\r\nOnce again the cinematography is excellent (this time by Alejandro Giuliani) and this seems to be part of de la Vega's style also.  He has an eye for what he wants the viewer to see and seems to have a way with his photographers that they see his vision equally well.  The score is wonderful and suits the film and setting perfectly without being in your face.  Excellent work by all involved.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a bloody, brutal film, that will also most likely confuse the hell out of you and leave you scratching your head as the credits roll, this very well could be your thing.  Beware though it pulls no punches in some of the imagary regarding harm to children at times so viewer discretion is highly advised there for the more sensitive of you.  Highly recommended if you're looking for something decidedly different.","id":"58fa0b39c3a3687c1e00baed","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58fa0b39c3a3687c1e00baed","movie_id":399615}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Printing biz meets the app biz! Paper versus digital!**\r\n\r\nThis is not the theme something you could see for the first time. I have seen many classics, probably you would have as well. But the difference is it was a different cast and a bit modernised. Modernised means just the story set in the todays technological trend world like almost everything that related to AI we use in our daily life. It's yet to be a lifestyle, I mean new norm. So you can see a few people who had already progressed like we say Silicon\/IT guys. That's the background and with the same old concept that the parents, particularly the father of the girl meets her boyfriend. When they do, those misunderstanding, generation gap and what else, all hell breaks loose.\r\n\r\nThe comedies were okay. In some places it was too much. Instead of a laugh, it only annoyed. Though there were some good jokes, except I hardly had any good laugh in my entire watch. I remind you again that it was an okay film. Some people might find it good, some won't. Still a watchable film for the good performances. It's a face-off between James Franco and Bryan Cranston as expected. Elon Musk was a surprise. It had several opportunities to be better like turnaround its narration, yet they stuck with the same concept for the whole film. So other than mild entertainment, there's nothing in it to laud. I hope it all had ended here. Please, no sequel.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"59bd8cfcc3a3681b58016f7a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59bd8cfcc3a3681b58016f7a","movie_id":356305}

So in the meantime, he takes the stage in Philadelphia and made gathered his fans laugh.\r\n\r\nSome jokes were good, but some were not. Overall, a nice show. It was for Kevin, otherwise, would have been a below average show. The film posters are parodies of 'The Dark Knight', 'World War Z' and 'Skyfall'.

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"The woefully generic **When the Bough Breaks** has the gloss factor going for it to a certain extent. Truthfully, its presentable package of panicky polish includes a stylish suspense piece highlighting an attractive cast involved in familiar dramatic cable-TV inspired shrugs and false jolts. Of course the creepy cradle falls in the mediocre **When the Bough Breaks** when the Jon Cassar-directed, Jack Olsen-written hollow horror showcase commits the real scare of resembling a lightweight Lifetime Movie Channel twitchy televised project. The so-called sinister shenanigans in **When the Bough Breaks** never feel majestic or mischievous enough to fill the realm of the big screen. Basically, Cassar\u2019s transparent tension-filled teaser is atmospheric and arbitrary in the surrogate pregnancy genre. The artificial thrills fail to wring any imaginative or inventive suspense that register with genuine anxiety.\r\n\r\nUltimately, **When the Bough Breaks** yearns to be a provocative pot-boiler with a high-end naughty pulse to its flat-lining frenzy of passion and pain. The real shame is that **Bough** commonly echoes the commonplace conventions of a potent cheesy sexual thriller we have seen countless times to no end. In fact, **When the Bough Breaks** could masquerade as a BET cable channel-based knockoff to filmmaker Adrian Lyne\u2019s 1987 psycho-sexual thrill vehicle _Fatal Attraction_ with an ethnic twist. In fact, **Bough** is in more of the synthetic spirit of the forgettable Beyonce Knowles-Idris Elba-Ari Larter 2009 horror slice-and-dice romancer _Obsession_. The regurgitated theme of a twisted younger spicy vixen looking to get her sensual hooks on the hunky object of desire at the expense of the harried wife on the cynical sidelines has played out in other preferable big screen and cable TV-bound flicks. Here in **Bough** the tired formula comes off as another strained, eye-rolling rip-off pertaining to the otherwise revisited jeopardized love triangle scenario.\r\n\r\nThus, **When the Bough Breaks** loses its credible balance when the movie morphs into another hysterical female psychopath waving a sharp utensil around in the name of cartoonish, toxic outrage. Joining the contemporary delusional divas such as the aforementioned _Fatal Attraction\u2019s_ Alex Forrest and _Obsession\u2019s_ Lisa Sheridan (how about going way back and looking at the doomed love triangle with seasoned actress Jessica Walter\u2019s crazed stalker Evelyn from 1971\u2019s Clint Eastwood-directed \u201cPlay Misty For Me\u201d) is Jaz Sinclair\u2019s (\u201cPaper Towns\u201d) sexy surrogate Anna looking to rock the titillating world of a handsome married man named John Taylor (Morris Chestnut).\r\n\r\nThe premise involves power professional couple John, an attorney, and his gorgeous established chef wife Laura (Regina Hall). They are both blessed with looks, materialistic excess and thriving careers but there is one main thing that alludes them as being completely sound in their lives\u2013the playful addition of a baby to start their growing family. The marital tension has been building between the Taylors and a child seems to be the immediate solution to healing. Unfortunately, Laura has had three miscarriages in the past. The Taylors have experimented with surrogates to carry their baby but to no avail. Time is running out as John and Laura grow restless and want results especially in the wake of a dire marriage needing stimulation.\r\n\r\nSoon, the Taylors will find some glimmer of hope in becoming parents when they get acquainted with the aforementioned 21-year old sexy waitress Jaz Walsh (Sinclair) and her sleazy abusive boyfriend Mike (Theo Rossi from TV\u2019s \u201cSons of Anarchy\u201d). Anna, now impregnated, is at the mercy of Mike\u2019s beatings and decides to call John for help. John brings Anna back to his place to shelter away from the riff raffish Mike. The opportunity for taking in a pregnant and desperate Anna could prove beneficial for the childless married tandem. What the Taylors do not realize is how shifty and deceptive their new housemate is at heart.\r\n\r\n**When the Bough Breaks** follows the run-of-the-mill road map of lame suspense, tepid titillating sequences and by-the-book shocks that have about as much high-wire punch as poking a stale marshmallow. The tawdry scenes between youngish vamp Anna trying to seduce the wealthy yet unsatisfied older John feels mechanically orchestrated. The sex appeal among the main principals is an automatic given so there is bound to be some hormonal happenings in the bedroom or behind closed walls among the periled pretty people. In fact, Anna actually spies on the Taylors\u2019 private love-making session at one point but the payoff in watching this conniving cutie getting \u201cturned on\u201d by the private intimacy feels oddly uneventful and detached. Anna lusting after married stud-muffin John does not generate anything particularly provocative unless you find this curvaceous crackpot printing \u201cbaby\u201d on her puffed out tummy as the selling point of a twisted temptress gone to her loony limits.\r\n\r\nHad the filmmakers done a better job at exploring the damaged diva persona of Sinclair\u2019s Anna Walsh then maybe her tarnished tart routine would be more interesting and intriguing. Sinclair\u2019s Anna is reduced to \u201cbitchy and berzerk\u201d without much consideration in tapping further into her obvious \u201clost little girl\u201d syndrome. The trouble is that we have seen the Anna Walsh-type seductress in cinema numerous times before so the frenzied female in a tame and tedious **When the Bough Breaks** comes off as merely inconsequential. Sinclair certainly has perverse fun playing a \u201cpregnant plaything\u201d for Chestnut\u2019s stoic legal eagle that eventually bites into the alluring poisoned apple of Anna\u2019s tainted charm. It is too bad that the movie\u2019s unevenness and telegraphed toxicity recalls a scattershot flatness that never realizes its inspired potential. Even when John\u2019s unscrupulous plot is revealed the shakeup does not change Bough\u2019s disjointed direction.\r\n\r\n**When the Bough Breaks\u2019** so-called chilly effectiveness is dramatically stiffened despite the glitzy shine of its photogenic cast and pseudo-steamy situations. Furthermore, the inability to seize the moments of the unintentional campiness is somewhat glaring as well. The-bad-girl-with-the-baby-bump thriller feels like a typical wet diaper\u2013relentlessly saggy while carrying an unexpected load it cannot handle.\r\n\r\n**When the Bough Breaks** (2016)\r\n\r\nSony Pictures\r\n\r\n1 hr. 33 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Morris Chestnut, Regina Hall, Jaz Sinclair, Romany Malco, Theo Rossi, Tom Nowicki\r\n\r\nDirected by: Jon Cassar\r\n\r\nMPPA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror\/Drama\/Suspense & Mystery\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016","id":"57d49dfd92514136fa001890","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57d49dfd92514136fa001890","movie_id":335791}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A long married couple in a fresh hurdle.**\r\n\r\nI thought it would be purely a Japanese style comedy, and it was, but also capable to reach out the world audience. Except the Japanese cultural influence, the story and its characters, how it all were designed can be compared to the films from the rest of the world with a similar theme. If you are a film fanatic or even common people are very familiar with this kind of storyline. So when a film talks about the family issues, some of the clich\u00e9s, especially basic ones are unavoidable. But this is first such film from Japan for me, so I enjoyed every bit of it rather getting disturbed by any deja vu moments.\r\n\r\nThe advantages were the film characters and the cast. Everybody was so good, particularly the veteran actor in the lead. I might be wrong, but it does not look like a B film from Japan. If you research about its popularity online which is less known, but received much better. This film was released last summer and I'm definitely a bit late, but on the right path as its sequel is going to hit the screens in a couple of weeks from now. Since I liked this, I am expecting the next part as well.\r\n\r\nIt's about one big family. When a young couple just got into a fight and talking about divorce, they are going to receive an even bigger surprise when their parents announce their separation after 50 years of marriage. Now everybody from the family turn their focus on them. Some would try to fix it and some are concerned about what's behind it. But seems nothing is getting better. So all these years living together in happy and sad stages of life, now how the family is going to cooperate is prioritised in the remaining parts.\r\n\r\n> \u275dWords don't matter. Feelings do.\u275e\r\n\r\nI don't know what the different between this and 'Tokyo Family'. From the cast and crew to the storyline seems alike, except one is a comedy and the other's a drama. The only way to clarify that, I've to watch that film. By the way this is one of the best family films of the year. It stays up to the expectation of its title name. But not entirely a fun film. Preference for comedy was given only in the initial parts. At some stage it turns into a meaningful one with better dialogues.\r\n\r\nIt might be an under-noticed film, but surely worth checking it out. The end might be too predictable, even though a very fitting solution. I did not mind that, but for some people, that would be a turning point on rating the film. I hope they won't take it very serious, rather to analyse what the film accomplish and according to respect it.\r\n\r\nHow the issue concerns the whole family and from their individual perspective, there are some narrations. But it does not go much deeper than that to explain thoroughly which never required. The overall focus always stayed with the main couple and their daily activities. To reveal how far they have come from without noticing how their relationship shaped all these years.\r\n\r\nIt was awesomely written screenplay, particularly at reusing the essential details to give a better new look. Almost all parts of the film maintained with the same level of rhythm, except the mood that transforms towards stretching the conclusion. It is almost a must see, but I stick with a simple recommendation for those who love drama over a comedy.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"591b637892514157230738fd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/591b637892514157230738fd","movie_id":389972}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Journalism in the war zone, but very funny!\r\n\r\nThe first impression was the reaction to the title abbreviation, and then I thought I saw Jody Foster on the poster, but surprised to find Tina Fey in the trailer. It is a great war-drama, filled with lots of fun and hard to believe it is a biography. This should be the best film for these directors till date. Amazing cast, but Tina Fey totally cracked it. This is one of the best films of the 2016.\r\n\r\nI have seen many Afghan war based films, but not quite fun as this one. It gives you a completely different take on the war torn Afghan. It was the story of an American journalist Kim, who was sent to their for the latest coverage. At first she struggles with the new place, then makes a few friends and finds comfortable despite security threat. The rest of the film reveals how her life, as well as career transforms with the experience of working in the dangerous environment.\r\n\r\nApart from starring in it, Tina Fey produced it and this is her best film in the recent years. The first half was wonderful, then during in the middle I felt it lost its track, but it came back strongly to end. This tale focused mainly on the living-style of the reports in the hostile place, besides their tough jobs. The battle scenes were minimised and highlighted the journalism. So don't expect it to be another 'A Thousands Times Good Night', it is refreshing though. It is a well worth, so don't miss it!\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"57951e04c3a36837ae008593","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57951e04c3a36837ae008593","movie_id":279641}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**It's like a falling tree dropping a seed on the ground.**\r\n\r\nI have to agree with the film critics on this one. Felt like I have already seen this film, but it turned out to be a very familiar thriller theme. It had plenty of issues and the first thing was the main plot in which the story built on. The mother-child connection is a very sensitive matter and that's where the film got stumbled. Even though they wanted to do film on that, they did not convince with the portrayed of the surrogate mother. From the entertainment perspective, it lacked the thriller big. The climax was all the sudden and then it ended just like that.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought it might be a remake, but it was inspired or borrowed the theme from elsewhere. This psychological-thriller focused on to tell the tale of a wealthy childless couple. They decide to hire a young and beautiful Anna to be their surrogate mother. When everything was going very well, Anna's crush on the man she's carrying a baby begin to blow the things off. So now what happens to the couple, Anna and the baby revealed in the final segment.\r\n\r\nThankfully, this is not the worst film of the year. I have even worse than this. But this can be easily a skippable one. There's no complaint over the actors, they had given what the characters demanded. Rich in quality, not a bad film from the technical aspect. Those are the area where it got scored a few points from me. If the screenplay had developed well, the film would have been in a different league. Particularly, I did not like the lack of diversity, looked like a black film for the black viewers. There are lots of similar films which are much better than this one that you could try.\r\n\r\n_4\/10_","id":"585ebd01c3a3681a77010d3a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/585ebd01c3a3681a77010d3a","movie_id":335791}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**It's not just about survival...**\r\n\r\nThe title says it all. Then I read its synopsis and right away I knew how much should I expect from it. Because this might be a fresh attempt in the Korean film, at least for the first time I'm seeing in a Korean film, but not from the world cinema. Yeah, I have seen plenty, and I'd liked most of them. But this film was much, much better than it had been rated in the internet. The story, the main event starts without wasting any time. There's no initial developments like intros. When the thriller-adventure parts commences, reveals everything you have to know.\r\n\r\nJust over 2 hours long, the story frequently switches back and forth to where a man got trapped in a collapsed tunnel road and the outside where people and rescue team gathered. Like any other similar themed film, it borrowed a handful of clich\u00e9s, but still you can witness the effort for the avoidance. Like if you see something or someone's crucial part come into play, usually you would predict what might happen to it in the later part of the story. Since those are unavoidable, they simply skipped in the final act as it is understandable and not to waste developing them to some extent.\r\n\r\nSo a man is fighting for his survival after a disaster strikes. But he got a cell phone signal buried under a deep mountain that I could not get. Anyway, he does make know his state of condition to the outside world. Soon they all rally to get him out. This film is not entirely a serious episode, despite the theme was. A little bit of satire. If that's how the film was intended or not, at least I had a couple of good laughs. Kind of reminded me 'Peepli (Live)', about the media circus in such situation. But that is the truth, what todays media have become, because of competition among themselves.\r\n\r\n> \u275dDon't be weak and say you'll die, just live.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe trapped man has to make sure about food and water to survive till the rescue team reaches him down which could take a week or more. Yeah, they kind of mention the recent Chile event which was made into the film, 'The 33'. His portion of the story is like the combination of '127 Hours', 'Buried' and of course that Chilean film. There are lots of things happen, you could say twists and turns. Kind of too much at some point, the way they added more contents to it, but decently it all worked out.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the outside world, not lags behind. It has its own set of characters and its circumstance events. Lots of fun and also highlights wrongs. Particularly like I said, the media and how politicians make use of such incident for publicity. And the final one about the construction firms and their shoddy works for profits. They have dug on these topics, but did not go deeper, because to keep it lighter and entertaining film than all about awareness.\r\n\r\nAll the way an engaging narrative. Means a long film, but very swiftly told story. Visually, it was a well made film, like everything's looked natural and believable. You could not differentiate the CGI\/green screen work and the real objects of those disaster parts. But not the technical details such as drilling or the hollow space where he stays alive. When the narration progresses, it gets even worse, like you would say how could that even possible or just they wanted it that way to end the tale.\r\n\r\nA small part of the end kind of skips, but that's good for the film than dragging it for another half an hour. The casting was good, they all performed well, but my favourite was Oh Dal-su. As usual, I loved his part, one of the finest supporting characters in the world cinema. It's not a great film, but good, and acceptable as what it is. In the end feels like worth it. So I decided to suggest it for those who are interested, but could not decide whether to go for it or not, and for the Korean film fans outside the Korea.\r\n\r\n_7.5\/10_","id":"5935d164c3a3685bac00320d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5935d164c3a3685bac00320d","movie_id":390497}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Horror express.**\r\n\r\nA week ago I saw a zombie film from Japan called 'I Am a Hero' and now this Korean. I have not seen a quality zombie film at the recent time. The second tier films like 'Cooties', 'Freaks of Nature', 'Scouts Guide...', all these were comedies. Probably 'World War Z' was the last decent zombie film I have seen and after that this is the one. So the timing of the film was another advantage. Since there's no competition, this zombie film rules. And not to forget the Korean style, they are among the best thriller film makers today.\r\n\r\nDirected by an Anime filmmaker, this is his first live-action film. When I decided to watch it, I thought it would be another Korean film, which rely on father-daughter sentiments. You know I kind of tired of that Korean clich\u00e9 where at the final stage they let the kid sob and call it a twist. Initially I enjoyed those and later on getting bored of that. With that kind of reasons, I would have missed it. Being a film fanatic, I won't mind to risk a watch, except give up writing a review for it.\r\n\r\nBut in this case, it was completely different. Even the characters, any characters in the film, either in the lead or the supporting ones, all are unpredictable. That's the biggest plus point of the film. At the end you won't be sure, who you were rooting for. You know in those edgy scenes, we blindly back the one we like. You will think you can guess the upcoming scenes, but the writing was very smartly done. Feels like they did not care about a sequel, if this meets a greater success. But who knows, this is a cinema and there were many mysteries kept unsolved, so they can pick up from one of those loops.\r\n\r\n> \"Whatever you do, you must finish what you start. It's worse than not doing it at all.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a divorced, workaholic father and his young daughter. After the progress, many others join them. On her birthday, they decide to visit her mother in Busan. On their train, soon after it took off, they come to know that something is wrong around. With all the chaos unrolling rapidly, a group of survivours gathers in a car since there's no escape as they are trapped in a moving train. How their journey ends, whether they reach a safe place with the fight against the living dead, the narration comes to halt.\r\n\r\nIn the contest of good versus evil, there's no place for sentiments. But at one stage, near the end they cleared the place to attach one. In that final scene you can't resist, even if you are not an emotional person when it comes to the film. As I mentioned earlier that is the part I feared the most would come, but i did not hate it in the context of story development. Because that was a perfect setting to take the story to the next level.\r\n\r\nThere are several twists. Those are from the film characters' perspective than the story wise. They did not bother to tell about the cause of the epidemic. Instead, this film was focused on the train passengers and their fight for survival when the defending options are limited. Just imagine it is a zombie version of another Korean film 'Snowpiercer' or like 'Snakes on a Plane'.\r\n\r\nI have heard there's another film, an animation which is also directed by the same filmmaker and said to be a prequel to this one. If you had liked it, you would be itching to watch that one as well. Hope I would watch it as soon as I get an opportunity. So, my view on it, the film is very good. It was close to two hours long, but once the train journey begins, you won't going to notice the time. I am saying the pace of the film, as well as the events make you dissolve in it completely and forget everything else. This is the best zombie film right now and you should not miss it, especially if you like this theme.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Wanting to change the life course, but it's not happening.**\r\n\r\nThis is a British crime-drama, about a family with the criminal background.

Sooner or later he has to make a decision on behalf of his family, particularly thinking the future of his kids. Yeah, this storyline seems interesting, but not the same as you watch it. Great cast, no doubt on that. Even basic plot, the theme is a confident boosting thing, if anyone watching the film are in one way or another is in the similar position.\r\n\r\nThe film lacked from developing on what the opening had initiated. Nice characters, though. I expected something to remember about the film, like emotionally or the events with twists and turns. This is not a bad film, but a simple one. So not everybody would get disappointing of it. All I think is a fine opportunity was missed out. That means I blame the screenplay, despite the actors and director tried their best to turn it out as much as possible decent to the better. So don't ignore it as it is rated low and for bad reviews.

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"Father relentlessly pursues his enslaved daughter in the gritty Old West\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2016 and directed by Timothy Woodward Jr., \"Traded\" stars Michael Par\u00e9 as a father ruthlessly pursuing his runaway daughter (Brittany Elizabeth Williams) who has fallen prey to slavers in the prostitution trade. Trace Adkins plays an intimidating saloon owner while Kris Kristofferson is on hand as a bartender seeking redemption from the filth he\u2019s forced to live amidst. Tom Sizemore plays a nasty buyer in the slave-whore business.   \r\n\r\nThis is a low-budget Western that has some technical weaknesses, like dubious continuity\/editing, but a compelling story, gritty tone, brutal violence and fine locations, costuming & score. If you don\u2019t appreciate dark, violent modern Grade B Westerns like \u201cHickok\u201d (2017) and \u201c6 Guns\u201d (2010) don\u2019t bother. The plot is obviously a melding of \u201cHardcore\u201d (1979) and \u201cTaken\u201d (2008) in the Old West, but without the blockbuster resources. There are a lot of UN-pleasant elements as we see what those saloon babes REALLY had to go through in the Old West.       \r\n\r\nThere are some unexpected highlights, like Marie Oldenbourg as \u201cGirl\u201d in a meaty subplot, but the way it concludes (the subplot) is a missed opportunity. As dark and brutal as the movie is, there are thankfully brief rays of light, hope, reverence and (hopefully) happiness.  \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 38 minutes and was shot at Paramount Ranch, Agoura, California and areas nearby.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Combination of wrong path and untrustworthy troop.\r\n\r\nThis should have been the Holywood's bad boys film. I mean the big cast names are expected like the earlier films of QT, or especially like 'The Departed'. There were many who dropped out of it for various reasons prior to the production commence, although this cast did a great job. In my finding I blame for the screenplay. It was a good story, but the first half was not very interesting compared to the next half, which was so brilliant, especially towards the end, mind blowing.\r\n\r\nIt was a multi starrer film, only that's much I know, but I kind lazy to count how many were there because I thought it was a modernised and an improvised cop version of the 'Ten Little Indians' theme. There's no evidence to prove that, it is just my theory. But seeing all the deaths and the conclusion, I felt the inspiration to the writer might have been possible.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'Lawless' who aimed for another success, but received backfire from critically and commercially. Mixed response from the audience though. Definitely it will find its own fans in the days and years to come. The ladies had scopeless roles, so they're completely forgettable their existence the narration, except very often just appear to show the faces. But well made crucial parts, in all the action sequences which kind what back the films along with Casey and Harrelson's parts.\r\n\r\nLike there is a saying, 'slow start, but ended strong', this film belongs to the same category. If you hold your patience for nearly 2 hours long, in the end you might feel after all it was not a bad flick. So not recommended to everybody, at a same time not suggested to skip it without properly knowing about it. P.S, the closing credit song, the remix version of 'Pigs' by Cypress Hill was awesome considering the theme of the film, I mean the corrupted cops, but felt the words were strong.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"576d743ac3a36874f50021d1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/576d743ac3a36874f50021d1","movie_id":146198}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The message was about teaching the truth behind falsified believes.**\r\n\r\nThis is a good film than how it was labelled. At least I enjoyed it, despite being an adult, particularly a male and a bachelor. It looks more a little kids' film than for anyone else. Because the film was based on the famous dolls. Usually film comes first and then follows its dolls to the markets. But this film has a reverse concept and a very much acceptable. Yes, it was not great as Disney's or Pixar's animations, but the DreamWorks animation is always there behind these two, considered the third best and according to that limit, you should expect the film.\r\n\r\nIt's a musical like most of the animations are and one of the tracks made into the 2017 Oscars for best film songs list, but the film did not make into best the animated feature. Directed by the director of one of the sequels of 'Shrek' series. Technically, it sounds awesome with cute character models, colours, songs, music and particularly the voice-overs. The story wise, it's not bad, except the concept of eating trolls makes the real young kids go fright.\r\n\r\nGood for families and even better if you choose to watch it in digital 3D format. The runtime was good with a fine pace. In the line of smurfs, gnomes, fairies, and now these trolls to add in the list for children to watch growing up. Don't bother watching it if you are an adult and only like and enjoy adult films, other than seeing it neutral, as well as opinioning. Purely an entertaining film and I strongly suggest it for the little ones.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58a3763fc3a3683f5900105d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58a3763fc3a3683f5900105d","movie_id":136799}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Time to bring down the remaining of Umb Corp.**\r\n\r\nThe series never meant to be story based. Well, at the first it was fine, but then it turned out be more a video game style than the normal commercial films. So if you are going to watch it, your expectation from it should be the action-adventures. Of course, nothing happens without a reason, that's where the story was born. This is the sixth film in the series and they are saying it is the final, but have to wait and see in a couple of years, whether another film will be made or they are going for television as hinted out.\r\n\r\nThe main character is long dead, that's what they say to us every time. And then a new sequel with the same character and their explanation is, clone. That's seems okay, but that being a regular thing is what annoying. This film is enjoyable, like I say, watching a game played by someone sitting next to us. But not the best of the series or the year, nor its kind. Just to enjoy the action sequences. All the top, knowing about Olivia Jackson made me almost to cry. She's the real hero, hats off.\r\n\r\nAs I said, the film was not necessary if you go by the story. It was just another mission, a fight to bring down the last remaining Umbrella Corp and possibly to reveal more secrets about it and everything so far happened. I always wondered how this franchise survived this long. Yeah, every time a decent box office pushed the filmmakers and actors to go for another one. The film's main ingredient, graphics were acceptable, and performances too. So, it is only for the selected audience, but you can ignore it if you are not that interested in it.\r\n\r\n_4\/10_","id":"599768cf92514164140008b8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/599768cf92514164140008b8","movie_id":173897}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I would say that my expectations for this movie was pretty much spot on. I expected a visual action feast with a fair amount of gore in it and that is pretty much what I got. Things like a well developed script and stuff like that, well obviously the producer thought asking for such things would be nitpicking.\r\n\r\nIt currently holds a 5.6 rating at IMDb and 60% user score on TMDb which is fairly well deserved. Of course there are always reviewers giving it single star ratings and saying it is the worst film ever. That is just bullshit. These people have obviously never seen a really bad movie.\r\n\r\nMilla Jovovich is again playing the hot zombie killing chick from the previous movies and although she tragically lost her superior T-virus strength in one of the previous installments her capacity for dealing death and mayhem as well as absorbing hits still borders on being super hero stuff. Unrealistic but fun to watch.\r\n\r\nDespite my comments on the script earlier there is actually one with a paper thin thread intended just to bring the story from point A to B with a maximum of violence and special effects in between. I do think the tanks that they had cooked up looked cool although they were just visual candy a\u2019la Mad Max. I mean come one, a tank with ventilation shafts all over the place so all you had to do was pour some gazoline over it and light a match? Stupid to say the least.\r\n\r\nThere were a few other things was more designed for looks than realism. For instance a certain ventilation fan that were used to drag out some of the events. Who the f\u2026 designs a ventilation fan with a dozen or so rings of blades? It is a ventilation fan for Christ sake, not a jet engine turbine. Oh, yes of course, stupid me, otherwise they would not have to spend so much time crawling through it.\r\n\r\nI did like the various mutated zombies as well by the way. The flying thing at the beginning and the end was quite cool. Some people seems to have had an issue with the fast, sometimes very fast, clipping of scenes. I have to say that it did not disturb me that much. Not that it added much either though.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the end. Well, I guess it was okay. The end itself was not too surprising. It was dragged down by the stupid nonsense with Dr. Isaacs though. The only time an exploding grenade resulted in anything less than a semi-atomic eruption of flames was of course when the director had decided that he needed the bad guy for a few more scenes. Lazy and stupid script writing.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I enjoyed the movie as much as I expected to. It was an okay movie. Good for a evening fix of zombie splattering and Milla Jovovich (okay so what, I am a male of traditional sexual orientation you know). It could have been a lot better but it was not really horrendously bad either.","id":"594a7167925141459b00d707","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/594a7167925141459b00d707","movie_id":173897}

His hope is to recreate a moment he shared with his ex, down to every last precisely staged polaroid. A shaky premise to be sure, but disbelief is quickly suspended in the capable hands of the two lead actors. Played quietly by Tuc Watkins, Jonathan wears his pain in his eyes and in the occasional quiet outburst. Brandon, 25 years his junior, shares a similar depth of spirit, his will toughened by just trying to survive. With these two richly complex characters, Nick Corporon gives us a searingly raw account of two men finding each other amidst the land mines of their own heart break. With gorgeous handheld camera work that is at turns intimate and grandiose, this film takes us deep inside the damaged hearts of two individuals and leaves us believing again in the healing power of human connection.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The Blue's tale, a true free spirit.**\r\n\r\nThe return of the Red Dog. It has been five years since the first film. Who knew it, I never expected a film like that could get a sequel. That was inspired by a true event, but not this one. It was actually a prequel that tells the story of Red's earlier life, where did he come from, his owner et cetera. No one knows the real story, but after the 'Red Dog's success, seems they were desperate for the one more shot, hence this fictional account was born.\r\n\r\nNot as good as the first. In fact, no way anywhere near to that. All they did was to add all the possible ingredients to it to make it appeal everybody. So basically it looks like another 'Free Willy: Escape from Pirate's Cove'. With enough comedies, adventures, one Chinese guy, aboriginal legend, storm and obviously the sentiments that strike at the right time.\r\n\r\nFrom the same director and the writer, but not the dog. The original award winning dog, Koko, for the role Red had died after a year later the film got released. After hearing that, I got emotional as same as the film he had starred in. That was one of the best dog films ever and one of the best tearjerker as well. Then I wanted to see this one too, but I had knew it won't surpass the original. So I had to keep my expectations low for it.\r\n\r\nThis new guy called Phoenix was as good as Koko, but his role had a lesser scope. The effort\/dedication\/performance was the same, which is highly appreciable. Besides, he was very adorable. In fact, I felt hurt whenever he run alongside the motorbike. It might be natural, but I thought it was inhumane. I believe it was the multiple shots, not a single run. Coming to the story, it was told from a boy's perspective, his relation with the Red, but the original name was Blue.\r\n\r\n> \u275dTrue blackness has a power all of its own. It doesn't just swallow light. It's like it swallows your soul.\u275e\r\n\r\nI did not like the opening scene. I thought it was very ordinary. So I guessed it's going to be a terrible film. But it did not take long to get back to the point. Once the flashback had started, it looked a different film. The entire narration was a recall. More a bedtime story. A father reveals to his son about the dog he'd lived with when he was at his age in the rural Australia in his grandfather's place. How he had found the dog and grew together, their friendship, mischiefs and other adventures. Then what happened later between them, all his life events with the Blue was told.\r\n\r\nAs I said, the screenplay was average, but the performances saved the film. The boy, the dog and all the co-stars were very good. The locations were even better. Just like the previous film, it was an ideal setting. The overall film was enjoyable, but the ending was very emotional. Having seen the first, anybody would have an idea what might come at the end, but not knowing how. I thought the same, but was not expecting the sentiments. The film ended with high. It also closed at where the original film had started, to make a perfect flow.\r\n\r\nOne thing I did not get was the unnecessary supernatural events. Yeah, I know the story sets in the Pilbara region, hence borrowed some local legend to stretch the storyline. But with the wildfire scene, it leans too much on that concept, making to slip away from the actual focus of the film. More than that, the film never clearly explained that segment.\r\n\r\nNow the real question is the story of Red\/Blue ends here or can be expected more drag with a prequel and a sequel. First of all, I am not very happy with the fictional account. For that reason alone, it is not a must see. Because it could mislead the original film's die hard fans. So they should have given the statement at the opening that it was not based on the real. Other than that, it is a decent film in the 'Red Dog' series. Finally, I would say, it is a good film, but not the best.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59976d36c3a36852da000e3d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59976d36c3a36852da000e3d","movie_id":403570}
{"author":"Hydro Philic","content":"I was scared by \"previews\" which said the editing was too chaotic.  My experience is mixed.  In the first 1\/3 of the film, there is a ridiculous number of cuts in the action scenes (didn't like it), but afterwards this wasn't a problem.  So yeah, chaotic filming at the start, but much more enjoyable\/conventional for the middle and end.\r\n\r\n(P.S. There is at least one VERY scary scene in the first 1\/3... despite the chaotic cinematography!)\r\n\r\nThis film TRIED to tie up all the loose end of the franchise, but it didn't do very well.  At least we get to see Claire Redfield again... she looks hot as always, but we don't see her much, and she doesn't have anything to say about K-Mart or her brother, Chis Redfield!\r\n\r\nThe biggest disappointment for me was the lame death of the \"big bad\" ... that is, Wesker.  I won't spoil his demise here, but let's just say it was Dues Ex Machina... (for those without a Latin background, it means an ass-pull by the writers!)\r\n\r\nI guess Wesker was too awesome to defeat in a fair fight!  Anyway, the final battle of Alice was against *SPOILIER* Dr. Isaacs!  Actually the final battle was against Dr. Isaacs and his clone!!\r\n\r\nI have mixed opions about this film... it tried, and in some sense succeeded in giving a finality to the movie franchise.  But it also failed in many ways.  The 3D was pretty crappy compared to the last two films ( I just learned they filmed this one in 2D and then up-converted it to 3D in post-production... unlike RE 4 and RE 5 which were REALLY filmed in 3D... so yeah, the human eye [at least my eye] can spot the difference between real art and AFTER-THE-FACT-POST-PRODUCTION cinematography).\r\n\r\nAlso, they completely skipped what happened in Washington DC (the end of the previous film).  There is one line in the movie which referenced this... basically \"Wesker betrayed Alice and didn't REALLY give her back full power of the T-Virus\".  As a fan, I found this lame 1-liner very dissatisfying for the series finale! :(\r\n\r\nSo now you may think I am an RE hater, but that isn't the full truth.  I felt this film was *literally* too dark, and the 3D was merely acceptable (not fantastic like prior films), but it did give a conclusion and explored upon things like clones of Alice...\r\n\r\nI guess the only\/biggest fault is the plot in the final scene... an air-borne virus, which will literally take years to work (according the movie itself!) manages to kill hundreds of thousands of zombies IN AN INSTANT... at the movie's climax... this is too convenient\/stupid to be believed by anyone... even an RE Fan like me.  I'm sorry, but can you say EPIC FAIL?\r\n\r\n== EPILOGUE ==\r\nThis film tries, and in a few cases succeeds, to tie up the Resident Evil franchise.  But the fake-3D *FAILS* compared to the real-3D of the prior two films.  The horror factor REALLY IS much better than the last 3 or 4 films... but is it enough???","id":"58b6862cc3a3680ee2007729","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b6862cc3a3680ee2007729","movie_id":173897}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A dog's lifetime journey with the different owners.**\r\n\r\nI am an animal lover, but there's nothing bad I found on it. It was just a film and they did not even harm the dogs that used for, but those, particularly final scene was a graphic. Anyway, one thing is for sure that this is not for softhearted people. Because some of the contents were unpleasant to watch, but in the real world these things happen everyday, everywhere and nobody doing nothing to stop that. So you can't just blame this film for that to portraying the facts. In a recent film, someone was attacked by a bear and later it was killed, but this is not that kind of bad impression giving film for the animal lovers.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen the 'Welcome to the Dollhouse', but it is a spin-off of that. Written and directed by a same filmmaker. A comedy drama with multiple layers, but all of them follows a single dog, the journey what a dog makes in his lifetime like with the different owners how its fate hangs. So you aren't going to enjoy all the tale, I particularly liked first one and so do the many others. The second half was not up to its counterpart. It started off well and if it had ended the same way, it would have been considered a good one. But it lost the track during the middle, so now it is an average, maybe just below that.\r\n\r\nDon't think it is a dog film like those you loved. The dog is the part of the film, but its contributions were rare. It is just a film and enjoy it as one, other than that it is useless to complain on the depiction. It is R rated, and that tells it might not suitable for families. But it carried a very good message on how the dogs were treated in the different classes, in the different society of people and family. For that alone, it is worth a watch, but still lacks appealness. So I won't suggest it, but it is not bad either like many people claiming. All I would say is choose it carefully, don't believe what some were whining about.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"57ed87459251414c8f0003ce","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ed87459251414c8f0003ce","movie_id":326094}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"A lot of the events in 24 happen mainly on account of accidents and coincidences, but it is to Vikram Kumar's credit that we buy into those scenes so willfully in this novel and entertaining, but definitely over-long, film that constantly charms us or leaves us thrilled with its inventiveness. The film begins with one such accident when an eagle acts a catalyst for Dr Sethuraman's ( Suriya ) invention \u2014 a time machine. He is a famed watchmaker and inventor, living contentedly with his wife Priya (Nithya Menen) and their son. But his look-alike twin brother Athreya is smarting at his success and plans to have the time machine, which is in the form of a watch, for himself. But Sethuraman manages to save both his son and his invention by giving up his own life. \r\n\r\nCut to 26 years later, and the baby has grown up to become Mani (Suriya, again!), a watchmaker, raised by Sathyabama (Saranya Ponvannan in yet another enthu-mom roles). Mani is oblivious to his past, but, by a quirk of fate, he discovers the watch, and over a scene that is a wonderful a piece of movie magic (involving droplets of rain), discovers its power. He uses it to woo Sathya ( Samantha ), a girl who turns up at his store to get her watch repaired \u2014 or rather makes her fall in love with him with help from the device. This is the film's light-hearted stretch and Vikram Kumar keeps throwing at us the possibilities that such a time machine offers. One such possibility, a Quicksilver-like ability to freeze time, even involves affecting the outcome of a cricket match! But the romantic portion in the second half is definitely a drag and the situation is made worse by a visually cliched song that has the leads walking around in picture postcard-esque locations. It effectively acts as a second interval. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Athreya, who has been in coma all these years, regains consciousness (again, this happens by accident and involves an eagle!), and finds himself having aged and paralysed waist down. But with the help of his trusted aide, Mithran tracks down both the watch and Mani and plots to get the device in his hands and go back into the past to rewrite his destiny. \r\n\r\nIt has been a while since we had a film whose twists and double twists were genuinely surprising and in 24, we are kept slightly off-guard as to what might happen when a character does something. Vikram Kumar doesn't sacrifice the internal logic of the story, so the twists always seem plausible and surprising. Like in the climax, when Mani decides to save his parents by time-travelling to the day they were murdered, and how that pans out. He also balances the sci-fi\/fantasy elements with a melodramatic sub-plot, involving Sathyabama, Mani and her estranged family, which invokes the 'amma sentiment' and acts as an unabashed sop for the 'family audiences'. \r\n\r\nTechnically, the film looks fabulous and this is one rare instance in our films when the cinematography (Tirru), production design (Amit Ray and Subrata Chakraborty) and visual effects (supervised by Julien Troussellier) are superbly in sync with one another. Even the makeup (Clover Wootton and Preetisheel G Singh) is subtle; it's a relief that the team did not go overboard with prosthetics to differentiate Suriya's three roles. Only AR Rahman disappoints with a rather serviceable score. \r\n\r\nStill, all the aesthetic triumphs would have been in vain if the film did not have an actor who could keep everything together with his charisma and performance, and this is where Suriya delivers. He turns on his boyish charm, which is needed to make the romantic portions work (with most actors, the character's constant use of the line, 'I am a watch mechanic madam; enakku idhellaam sarva saadhaarnamaana vishayam' would have sounded grating but not here), mellows down during the big emotional scenes (the conversation between Mani and Sathyabama after the former has learned of his lineage) and lets loose his wicked side to make Athreya truly sinister (the shocking interval block). It is not often that we see a big star choosing to take a risk with a script that is not simplistic or formulaic, especially when his last few films have underperformed at the box office, but here Suriya pulls it off admirably.","id":"573816b092514110a3000ee9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/573816b092514110a3000ee9","movie_id":368006}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**It's a matter of birth and death.**\r\n\r\nA simple film and its sensitive theme. German films usually impresses me and this is another under-noticed film, needs some uplift. Not like a must see, but totally worth it. While I was watching it, I thought the film's characters turned a simple thing as a too complicate event. But yes, it's not that simple when it's related to pregnancy. Of course, it's different from faith to faith, between believers and non-believers. Then my mind went to the very ancient age. How all the animals shared the earth equally. But humans, a very unique from all, not the same as of now.\r\n\r\nToday, every day the technologies upgraded to an even better level. So why do we obsessed with that! To make life easier? Yes. Then there's always something that stops us benefiting from them. It lies within us, none other than 'emotions'! Why I'm saying all this! There's a reason that this film's main purpose to highlight how humans act while there's a technology to thwart errors in its initial stage itself. But we're mentally struggling, since life and death or the purpose of the living being was not yet explained by the science.\r\n\r\nI'm not a person of god. I don't believe in souls. I do believe only in consciousness. In my world, it replaces the word soul. But from all, there's a big difference between pain with conscious and pain without consciousness. A baby born with an empty hard disk. Then it adds all the memories to it when he experiences the things using his five senses. That's the complicated one. The opposite to it is the abortion. That's what this film is about.\r\n\r\nI might have went a too far from the film, but happy to add some details. If you watch this film, definitely you would choose a side and back it till the climax. So one of the sections of people would get disappointed with the result of the story. In that case, I was neither. The film was not a thriller, though I felt edgy during the last few minutes. I did not know which way it's heading. Prepared for any unexpected twist. Then it came to an end, and I did not think whether it was any good or bad, except satisfied with the truth, the reality, a slice of life as I've seen through this flick.\r\n\r\n> \u275dGreat. One child's disabled, the other's a fascist.\u275e\r\n\r\nA well designed story and the characters. It revolved around a celebrity. That was a perfect start. Adding a big star, who goes through a difficult time. She's at 24 weeks pregnant with her supportive husband and a young daughter. The life is so smooth, until one day when the couple discovers the baby could be born with a disability. They decide to have it by preparing for it in advance. Then another blow brings a fresh challenge for them as a couple, as a family and with a strong emotions. Now the life's upside down. From there where it all heads are the rest of the story to tell its viewers.\r\n\r\nDefinitely a powerful theme. As I already mentioned, the people split over what the film characters fighting over. Hence it won't receive well in all the quarters. But there's a fact to consider, which this film mostly borrowed from for its ending. I would say a well done film. Filmmakers make films to make money, to make people laugh, to make see the truth and various other reasons. I'm not saying it was an awareness, a message film, but totally a fact based. Like how in the modern world, even compared to a couple of decades ago, they determine things accordingly. But remember this is not the first film to deal with such theme. We've seen similar films, and most of them were a sub-plots.\r\n\r\nOne of the highlights of the story was, it was not about a single person. It is about a small family, and how each one reacted to what they have found was very accurately portrayed. Since it was a present era based, where thing are different from before generation, the story had some flaws. I mean not a bad writings or something, but the relationship between each others. Once again, what I meant was the woman empowerment. Directed by a woman filmmaker, told the story from a woman's perspective, I felt this was what lack in the real society as well, particularly in the developing countries and\/or religiously obsessed ones.\r\n\r\nI liked everyone in the film. The pace was good. Overall an engaging storyline with a fine runtime. You could watch it for many reasons, or maybe none, but not a bad film to ignore. I don't think so they should have improved it a little more. In my eyes, it was a perfect little flick. One of the rare for sure. That does not mean I've rated it out of out. But who knows, what I'm saying could be overwhelming personal opinion, that once watched it you might realise that.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59dbebce925141250506297d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59dbebce925141250506297d","movie_id":378695}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The war of the brothers ended by one of theirs son.\r\n\r\nThe time travel is not new to Indian cinema, but a very less explored concept. Especially technology easily available in todays world, the filmmakers utilising the opportunity at their best. With this kind of theme, Indian films can seek the global market, who is already the number one film producer in the world. But it needs to put a full stop for the traditional narration and characters and character developments. Like the father and son characters are played by the same actor which has not changed since the last 70 years or so. And the film length as well too long to sit for it. Other than these, I enjoyed this film.\r\n\r\nSo the story begins in the 1990 where the twin brothers go for each others throat for a watch, in which the event finally ends in a total disaster. But not until 26 years later when it reaches for one of theirs son's hands, letting us know it is a time travel device. Then the fun parts, as well as the romance undertakes, until the final act where it becomes serious again and concludes with a twist. The sequel is for sure, they already named it 'Decoded' and I'm looking forward for its official launch.\r\n\r\nIt was a well written script, but there are too many naturally occurring intense scenes like the bird scenes et cetera. Those were added just to cover up the loops. Since it's a sci-fi and time travel theme, the errors should be taken care or minimise them as much as possible and that's what the writer did. But still there a few silly stuffs like where the watch ends at the end, and adding years and months to the device without the scientific knowledge to make it work.\r\n\r\nBut still I felt the director of 'Yaavarum Nalam' did a wonderful job. He spent nearly a decade for this script, the hard work finally paid off well. Surya produced it under his 2D entertainment banner and performed so well in the triple roles with the support of other excellent actors. Definitely a great watch for the Indians, for the International audience as well, but a familiar theme makes it a decent entertainer.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"57a377729251416b970062a3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57a377729251416b970062a3","movie_id":368006}
{"author":"in_the_crease","content":"*** This review may contain spoilers ***\r\n\r\nAfter immensely enjoying the turn the X-Men franchise took after the disappointment of X-Men: The Last Stand, I was pretty excited to see this movie. I love comics, but I never got into the X-Men, so I can excuse some of the inaccuracies that seemed to upset hardcore fans. I just enjoyed the movies.\r\n\r\nX-Men Apocalypse is the weakest film since duds like Last Stand and Wolverine Origins. It just didn't have a whole lot going on. One of the biggest critiques of Marvel (yes, I know X-Men films aren't produced by Marvel Studios, but I'm speaking of the publisher of the original medium) is that their villains are lackluster. The big baddie through the whole franchise has been Magneto, easily the most charismatic and entertaining Marvel villain on film. Though we've had brushes with Stryker and Trask and his sentinels, this is the first movie in which the X-Men had taken on a true super villain who wasn't Magneto-- Wolverine vs. The Silver Samurai aside. \r\n\r\nBut it's almost like director Bryan Singer painted himself into a corner with Apocalypse. The villain was too powerful and could have easily achieved his goals without the help of his \"four horsemen.\" He could have ended the world, in mere minutes, all by himself. But, of course, that would make a boring movie, so Singer and Co. had to figure out what to do with the world's most powerful and dangerous mutant for two hours before the final climax was to begin.\r\n\r\nThere were scenes where the villains were literally sitting around the desert talking about how they were going to lay waste to a city on the horizon. There were scenes where the most powerful of the villains went out recruiting much less powerful villains to join him. Really, Singer just didn't know what to do with this character. How do you create conflict and drama when the bad guy is just too powerful? Well, you can't. \r\n\r\nOf course, after two hours of watching the most powerful mutant ever talk about what he is going to do (instead of simply doing it) he finally unleashes his fury. Except that, the X- Men actually have the most powerful mutant in the world on their side in Jean Grey.\r\n\r\nSo, again, why is Jean not simply destroying Apocalypse in the first 10 minutes of the movie? Because, running time needs filler.\r\n\r\nAnd that's basically what this movie is: Filler. They came up with a concept that would make the storytelling aspect problematic. And rather than tweaking the concept or fleshing out the story with subplots, they just assumed explosions and superhero fights would be enough to carry the film.","id":"58d2ad4ac3a368121b000cf4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58d2ad4ac3a368121b000cf4","movie_id":246655}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Ranks with the best in the X-Men franchise***  \r\n\r\nReleased in 2016 and directed\/co-written by Bryan Singer, \"X-Men: Apocalypse\" has the team go up against the first mutant, Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac), whose origins date back to ancient Egypt. After thousands of years in stasis, Apocalypse is immediately disillusioned by the state of the world and so recruits a team of worthy mutants, including a dispirited Magneto (Michael Fassbender), to purge humanity and craft a new world order over which he will reign. Professor X (James McAvoy), with the assistance of Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), leads a team of young X-Men to stop their greatest nemesis and save mankind from complete destruction. Josh Helman is on hand as Col. Stryker.\r\n\r\nThis sixth film in the franchise (not including the several spin off films) easily ranks as one of the best. It includes many of the best elements of the X-Men and everything I would want in a great X-Men flick:\r\n\r\nProfessor X's ongoing goal for an educational sanctuary for interesting mutants from all over the world; his love for Moira (Rose Byrne); Magneto's increasing mastery of his great powers and his struggle to go on the offensive against prejudiced humanity; a greater focus on Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) and his potent power, both of which were neglected in the original trilogy; an outstanding actress to play Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), who is far better than the bland Famke Janssen; Olivia Munn's ultra-hotness as Psylocke; a worthy subplot on Weapon X with the corresponding guest appearance of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman); an excellent collection of young mutants, like Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Quicksilver (Evan Peters), Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), Havok (Lucas Till), Angel (Ben Hardy), etc.; a worthy main villain in the mold of Dr. Doom and Thanatos; an epic, apocalyptic final act (sorry); I could go on and on.\r\n\r\nThis isn't to say the movie doesn't have faults, however; the cartoony overblown prologue in ancient Egypt is Exhibit A.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 144 minutes and was shot in Quebec, Canada (Greenfield Park, Montreal and Oka).\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-","id":"5bf6f151c3a368189f0e0e37","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bf6f151c3a368189f0e0e37","movie_id":246655}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"X-Men Apocalypse is typical of what you would expect from a Marvel X-Men movie. Light on story and depth and heavy on special effects and action. In short it is exactly what I, as a Science Fiction and Fantasy geek, would expect as well as hope for.\r\n\r\nThe X-Men faces a new threat in the form of the worlds first mutant. Naturally said mutant is really a \u00dcbermutant vastly more powerful than any \u201cnormal\u201d mutant. Equally naturally this \u00dcbermutant is set on a path of world destruction and domination. I quite liked this villain. He is a good all evil and powerful bad guy and a worthy adversary. No nonsense about trying to make the villain likable or trying to explain why he turned evil or such like. This guy is evil, he is the bad guy, he needs to be taken down\u2026full stop.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote the story is not the most elaborate one around but it is a good one within the confines of a Marvel super hero movie. It gets the job done without being overly stupid or silly. It is set in the \u201cprequel\u201d universe created by X-Men First Class. The movie adds a few new X-Men to the ranks of Professor Xaviers team. Some of them thanks to the manipulations of Apocalypse although they start out on the bad side at first.\r\n\r\nThe movie moves along at a decent enough pace and, as was mentioned, there are quite a few action sequences and special effects thrown at the viewer throughout the movie. Personally I found the special effects to be quite good. Even stunning at times. I am quite a bit of a special effects nerd so of course this pleased me a lot.\r\n\r\nThe movies ending certainly opens the door to future X-Men movies and I for sure would like to see the franchise continue.

The CGI was often so bad it was confronting, even in the climax of the film. Apocalypse's plan was plot-hole-y and underdeveloped, and not all of the new characters hit it out of the park.\r\n\r\nThere was still a lot to like here though. Some of the newer costumes were neat, and a lot of the side-plots had me very intrigued. Fassbender and McAvoy are excellent as always.

Oscar Isaac is a talented actor, but even he can't make Apocalypse interesting under all that silly blue make up. Characters like Angel and Psylocke, as Apocalypse's horsemen, are very thinly written and barely have a personality. Also, it is absolutely ridiculous that the villain Mystique is transformed into a role model and leader for the X-Men in this movie.

I'm sorry to say that, but that's the truth. The 'X-Men' series never made me sense, particularly to say it from the Marvel comics is a disappointment. When it comes to 'Wolverine', my opinion is different, because I loved those films. Hugh Jackman as Logan is the only 'X-Men' I love, so like usual this is another waste of time from its series to me.\r\n\r\nI even enjoyed the recently rebooted 'Fantastic Four', but not this one. There's nothing new in the story, it's the same plot stolen from the different films. Like an ancient force is awoken who tries to rule the world by destroying everything created so far by the humans. So the mutants join hands to bring him down and we know what happens at the end. Apart from the vfx, this is very boring film and 150 minutes runtime was another lengthy joke that you never laugh.\r\n\r\nNot just me, many people, even 'X-Men' fans showed displeasure over this film. That means, Bryan Singer's stint with the franchise is pretty much over. So they will going to bring a new one and that's another disappointment, because I don't know how long they're going to drag this series. End it already.

{"author":"part-mozi","content":"A young man heeds the call of adventure in Yoshinari Nishikori's Tatara Samurai, leaving his idyllic village to become a soldier. He soon has second thoughts \u2014 but violence is coming his way, like it or not, in a movie that sometimes echoes its hero's ambivalence by toying with viewers' expectations of swordslinger cinema. Genre fans should respect the picture if not embrace it wholeheartedly, but history buffs will find something to appreciate as well in this 16th-century tale.\r\n\r\nGosuke (Sho Aoyagi) comes from a family of men who make steel. Their village, Tatara, is renowned for the quality of that steel, whose strength is prized for swordmaking; its resistance to rust will make the commodity even more valuable as guns become a central part of warfare.\r\n\r\nWith that transition beginning and clans battling each other nearby, Gosuke realizes that peasants are less bound than usual to their roles in feudal society. \"Now is a time when anyone can move up,\" as one man puts it. And joining the ranks of Lord Oda's army is one path to a samurai's wealth and status. He says goodbye to his fiancee, breaks his father's heart and leaves.\r\n\r\nDazed by his first serious encounter with carnage, Gosuke is told that he should return home and \"embrace your destiny\" as a metalworker. The readiness with which he agrees is a little puzzling given how eager he was to become a samurai, but this is a film that often leaves characters' motivations obscure, at least to a Western viewer's eyes.\r\n\r\nThat can be frustrating on occasion, but it works well in the case of Yohei (Masahiko Tsugawa), an aging merchant who wants to convince Tatara's mayor to sell him steel for gunmaking. Soon after Gosuke's return, Yohei arrives with the news that Lord Oda intends to attack the town and take what he needs. He offers the town guns, mercenaries and training to defend themselves; though villagers argue about taking this sort of help, the die is cast as soon as one of them has his first experience firing a musket.\r\n\r\nIf the film's first half didn't hew to the hero's-journey template we expected, neither does this section turn out to be a Seven Samurai-like tale of outsiders helping peasants defend themselves. Sinister things are afoot, and one happy consequence is that the dramatic burden ceases to fall exclusively on Aoyagi, who performs creditably but has a hard time expressing the character's interior conflicts. One of Gosuke's friends, Shinpei (Naoki Kobayashi), has a spark he lacks, but the film doesn't make the best use of the actor when Shinpei gets involved in third-act intrigue.\r\n\r\nAkira Sako's photography makes good use of very beautiful landscapes, lending weight to the script's talk of tradition and pride in craftsmanship. Though hardly a heart-thumping action pic, a few scenes of swordplay make the most of that precious Tatara steel.","id":"5e58e2ce35811d00156165ad","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e58e2ce35811d00156165ad","movie_id":411607}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Admit and face the reality than to get the same treatment by avoiding them!**\r\n\r\nGreat cast, even the concept was nice, but a missed opportunity for sure. Bully, LGBT, there were lots of things the film highlighted, but did not choose the right path to ride on with. Everything was overshadowed by the negatives. When I was watching the film, I was very uncomfortable throughout. Because I have kept anticipating the best things to take over at any time, but that never came. Even the sport part was kind of incomplete. The film was a fiction, but even partially that's how things happen in Canada, then Canada is too far behind from all the western world.\r\n\r\nThe film should have been an inspiring tale, or at least an awareness tale. It was a gay theme, though not a romance film. An eleventh grade Tim is avoiding his sexual identity to escape the embarrassment, particularly from the school bullies. But it's too late now, which cost him a big. As a response, he takes a challenge. And now he needs to prove his sexuality, but not everything goes as he had planned. The remaining story takes a crucial twist where everything comes to halt suddenly.\r\n\r\nYeah, I think that sudden ending is not convincing. Especially after too many turns in the story development, I actually was expecting the best way to conclude. So not everybody would be happy with that part. Though it was not a bad idea, only they did not make it in a better way. The title too was a little diversion, from prediction. So don't expect, everything's going to be fine kind of film. More like I felt it is made for sadist mindset people. Because you can't encourage such film, particularly its contents which makes unease most of the time.\r\n\r\n_4\/10_","id":"59dbea54925141252c062bf3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59dbea54925141252c062bf3","movie_id":415665}

{"author":"Sheldon Nylander","content":"I'm giving this half a star more than I gave the first movie. As a horror film in its own rite, it's competently made, although somewhat predictable as it follows most of the traditional haunted house film tropes. But it is better than the first one in that it's a more cohesive film, with such corrections as how the background \"monster\" actually does play a part in the story, whereas in the first film Annabelle was shoehorned in but had nothing to do with the main story and served only as a distraction.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the reason I can't rate this film higher is because it's about the Warrens, who were a couple of charlatans that took advantage of vulnerable and desperate people. While this is touched on briefly, it's done more in the context of people who don't believe them are all mean and unsympathetic.\r\n\r\nAgain, it's a competently made horror film that's better than its predecessor, if a little predictable, but don't look at it as being based on a true story.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Tharkappu wants to be a battle cry against state-sponsored killings in the form of police encounters and death sentences. And it tries to argue its case through the tale of Sakthivel, an encounter specialist, who kills a criminal who murdered 16 people and tries to pass it off as self-defence (tharkappu). But a human rights official sees through his bluff and catches him red-handed and reforms him by making him see that corrupt politicians and businessmen have a hand in all his operations so far. Sakthi and his fellow cops decide to surrender in court, but their superiors decide to take them out for their political masters. Meanwhile, two couples on the run become entangled in this encounter operation and now, their lives are also in danger.\r\n\r\nThe plot of Tharkappu has scope for a decent action thriller, but the writing is uneven and so, the film isn't able to generate the tension that this tale needs. Also, the characters that RP Ravi comes up with are quite generic. A hard-nosed cop, an idealistic officer, naive youngsters, corrupt officials... While the narrative involving Sakthi (Sakthi Vasu does his best, but this is a performance where we are often being shown that he is acting) is interesting \u2014 the initial scenes keep his identity dubious and we are not sure if he is a good guy or a bad one. But the two romantic tracks are silly and implausible (the actors, too, are not charming), and break the momentum of the film. They are also the reason why the film feels overlong. And once Samuthirakani enters the picture, the film becomes a lecture class as the actor, as he often does, delivers his lines as if he is delivering a sermon in church. Meanwhile, Sakthi keeps monologuing that it becomes hilarious after a point.","id":"568a294192514132db027eea","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/568a294192514132db027eea","movie_id":374117}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**In the land of savages!**\r\n\r\nThe overall concept was good, but I did not like the initiation. I don't like any film of cannibalism. I don't know why such films are made. What's the point! Definitely not entertainment or art. It could only encourage such savage culture. So I thought I made a mistake picking it to watch. Except the opening, the rest of the film was different.

{"author":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","content":"A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com\r\n\r\nLOUISA SAYS:\r\n\r\nWhat\u2026did I\u2026.just watch?\r\n\r\nNot for the uninitiated or those with weak stomachs, everyone\u2019s favorite polarizing surrealist director Nicolas Winding Refn is back with the lurid, gory, sadistic, and horrifyingly beautiful \u201cThe Neon Demon.\u201d This film makes a bold statement about the shallowness of Hollywood and the fashion industry in the most violent, brutal, bloody and disturbing way possible.\r\n\r\nThe film\u2019s strength is in its breathtaking visuals. Refn once again establishes himself as a true auteur at the top of the visionary food chain. Even if you are one of the many who see him as pompous and pretentious, there\u2019s no denying that few have quite the mastery of the craft of the visual arts as he does. This film belongs in a modern art museum.\r\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that there\u2019s not much of a plot: teenage ing\u00e9nue Jesse (Elle Fanning) moves to Los Angeles to chase her dreams of becoming a model. She soon finds herself living in a sketchy motel with lecherous landlord Hank (Keanu Reeves) and surrounded by the seductive Ruby (Jena Malone), Gigi (Bella Heathcote) and Sarah (Abbey Lee), a pack of shallow, jealous, beauty-obsessed women. It\u2019s hard to evaluate the performances since most consist of nothing more than striking and holding a pose or staring longingly into a mirror, but I do think that Reeves has one of the greatest (if small) roles of his career.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s no escaping the true debate this movie presents: is this a shrewd feminist manifesto or is it grossly misogynistic? It\u2019s taken me three days to reflect on this and I\u2019ve decided that it sways towards the former rather than the latter.\r\n\r\nFirst, the film celebrates the female form; the women in the film are beautiful set dressings, designed to be admired (and not treated solely as sexual objects). Yes, the women are one-dimensional but at the same time, that works as a harsh criticism of the narcissism that\u2019s so prevalent in the fashion industry. Refn also artfully expresses the malice that is sometimes deeply hidden in the female psyche. The film is insightful too: women have a dark side and sometimes we do feel like we are in a girl-eat-girl world (a phrase that the film takes a bit too literally).\r\n\r\nRefn\u2019s hypnotic signature is all over this stylish, elegantly violent film. Cinematographer Natasha Braier adds a disturbing hallucinatory effect while Cliff Martinez lends a thumping, ear-splitting, ominous score that reflects the overall atmosphere of insanity.\r\n\r\nAs with the director\u2019s other films (\u201cDrive,\u201d \u201cOnly God Forgives\u201c), there are plenty of scenarios that seem to be present with the sole intent to shock, offend or disgust. (Do we really need an extended scene of lesbian necrophilia? I guess you can argue the point, but the scene goes on a bit too long to make it seem relevant to the plot or characters). The extreme last act feels more like a pointless gross-out than a thoughtful commentary think piece. I think this is a good place to mention that this film is a very, very hard \u2018R\u2019 rating; I am surprised it\u2019s not NC-17.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Neon Demon\u201d isn\u2019t your run-of-the-mill art house film; it\u2019s so far beyond the art house that it\u2019s in another dimension.\r\n\r\nMATT SAYS:\r\n\r\nA teenage runaway from Sandusky, Ohio steps off a bus into the glittering lights of Hollywood. All of her friends back home tell her that she\u2019s destined to be a star, and she believes them. But Hollywood does not bestow fame and fortune without a price. First it will take her innocence, then it will take all that remains.\r\n\r\nSo is the story of \u201cThe Neon Demon,\u201d the new film by auteur Nicolas Winding Refn (\u201cDrive,\u201d \u201cOnly God Forgives\u201d). Elle Fanning is Jesse, the underage runaway that has been lured to Los Angeles by the whispered promises of becoming a famous model. She meets up with another innocent who was been lured to the city: photographer Dean (Karl Glusman), whose attempts at emulating the art he sees in Hollywood through pictures are met with sneering ridicule as \u201camateurish.\u201d Dean hasn\u2019t sold his soul, and those who have have nothing but contempt for him.\r\n\r\nJesse, on the other hand, makes the bargain readily: after being paraded before harshly appraising eyes and being judged a piece of meat worthy of notice, she willingly trades her virtue for empty glamour and attention. After having reborn on the runway, Jesse quickly learns that she has still not given enough: people continue to want more from her, and what they want she isn\u2019t willing to give.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Neon Demon\u201d is not for everyone. It\u2019s not even for most. Even if you enjoyed \u201cDrive,\u201d you may find yourself frustrated and your patience tried by this movie. There is much to appreciate, but you will be challenged in doing so. In this film, Winding Refn has made an art piece that must be assessed, considered, and deconstructed. Those who are literal-minded will likely find their patience tried: the story isn\u2019t about what\u2019s happening on the surface, it\u2019s about what\u2019s happening underneath. You must watch, listen, and observe carefully.\r\n\r\nOne additional word of warning: \u201cThe Neon Demon\u201d is highly disturbing and will upset many casual viewers. Apart from its gore and physical violence, the film pushes boundaries HARD. Terrible things are either shown or implied. I can\u2019t for the life of me understand why the studio and theater chains thought that this was an appropriate film to release in nearly 800 theaters nationwide. One can imagine that of the few audience members who didn\u2019t walk out during the first 20 minutes ran for the exits at its offscreen implication of child abuse.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re still reading this review and haven\u2019t been dissuaded yet, I recommend that you see this movie. It\u2019s one of the most interesting discussion pieces in recent memory and it\u2019s not one that I will soon forget.\r\n\r\n**A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com**","id":"579cfb439251411b3600833b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/579cfb439251411b3600833b","movie_id":301365}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"With the right material, Vijay can elevate even an ordinary scene with his amazing screen presence. And he can effortlessly play to the gallery. It is these aspects that Atlee repeatedly calls upon from the actor in Theri, a cop story that is entertaining despite being predictable. And the actor, too, responds in style \u2014 he appears in different looks, bashes up the goons, swoons over the heroine, plays along with kids, lectures on raising a child, using a helmet and quitting smoking, and even gamely turns into a dwarf for a brief moment!\r\n\r\nAs he did with Raja Rani, Atlee borrows tropes from earlier films (the elderly villain from Chatriyan, the metal rod being used as a murder weapon from Ghajini, the gigantic henchman who has to be vanquished before the hero can lay his hands on the villain from various masala movies of the 80s and 90s, the mother as the best friend from the post 2000 movies, the cop who quits the force for his offspring from Yennai Arindhaal) and with help from his cinematographer George C Williams, presents them in a riot of colours that almost makes us believe that we are seeing something new. But this is a formulaic film and can be best described only with another cliche \u2014 old wine in a fancy, extra-large bottle.\r\n\r\nThe film begins with scenes between Joseph Kuruvilla (Vijay) and his little daughter Nivi (Nainika), who behaves in the way most movie kids behave \u2014 talk like an adult, behave like a brat and still have us go 'Oh so cute!' Her teacher Annie (Amy Jackson, as a Malayali, no less!) becomes close to the two, but following an incident, realises that Joseph is hiding something. And like her, we, too, are told of his past, when he was the intrepid deputy commissioner Vijay Kumar. By investigating a rape and murder case, Vijay earns the enmity of minister Vanamamalai (Mahendran, making a solid debut). And the minister kills Vijay's mother (a jovial Radikaa) and wife, Mithra (Samantha), and leaves the cop for dead. And when Joseph realises that Vanamamalai knows his secret identity, he decides to end their enmity once and for all.\r\n\r\nUnlike Chimbu Deven, who got carried away with making his star a darling of the kids in Puli and ignored the actor's core fan base (the youth), Atlee comes up with moments that satisfy all segments of the audience \u2014 the scenes between Joseph and Nivi for the kids, the portions involving Vijay's mother and Mithra for the family crowd and most importantly, the episodes between Vijay and the various bad guys for the cheering youngsters. And he uses these moments cleverly. So, every time the film seems to be sinking into banality, a whistle-worthy moment or a comic line or a sentimental scene comes along and saves it.\r\n\r\nBut Atlee takes too long to narrate this familiar story. We get two fights to establish the machismo and goodhearted nature of the hero and two songs to liven up his romance when one could have done these jobs. Like his guru Shankar, he also crams in too many societal issues \u2014 rape, rowdyism, child beggars \u2014 to manipulate his audience and earn their sympathies. The major fault, however, is that he turns the villain into a sitting duck after building him up for most parts of the film. This is why the final portions lack the punch they deserve.","id":"57381752c3a368241e000248","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57381752c3a368241e000248","movie_id":370076}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A father's struggle to see his daughter to get well.**\r\n\r\nA new film from the writer, director of 'The Chaser' and 'The Yellow Sea'. This time its a horror-thriller that focused on a rural police officer who witnesses a series of strange events escalating fears among its people. The original title was 'Goksung', which means the name of the village where this story takes place. This film is specially for those who like Korean films. But I'm sure that everyone would enjoy it equally. Very typical Korean film yet an engaging theme and thrilling, particularly towards the final quarter.\r\n\r\nThe opening, and almost the first act were like a black comedy. That does remain same after sometime. Because they wanted to give an impression what kind of person is this story's lead man. He's a cop, but feared of supernatural stuffs. So one day, he gets an early morning call to head where a family was slaughtered by one of its members. In his small village, with a small population, events like this are very rare, but when another similar incident was reported, ruled out what it was considered, but something else beyond humans.\r\n\r\nAfter the strange dreams, he comes to know his family too got affected by it, particularly his young daughter. Followed by when it gets serious issue, the family decides to bring in a shaman and so the ceremony begins to free her from whatever possessed. This is where the film turns more aggressive in revealing following event with twists and turns. The rest of the film should be watched to know how it all ends.\r\n\r\nThe first thing was the film length. It was too long, nearly 150 minutes, but the screenplay filled with many enthralling scenes and dialogues. So I don't think sitting for that long would be an issue for most of the people. Surely you will be on your seat edge most of the time on your watch. Good story, but very confusing. I mean not puzzling way, but the events and its characters, especially the conclusion which is not exactly a perfect one with proper detail. So you might look for some clarifications after watching the film.\r\n\r\n> \"If you go fishing, do you know what you'll catch? He's just fishing. Not even he knows what he'll catch.\"\r\n\r\nThe concept was a little confusing like what kind of horror is this. At one stage there comes a zombie, but it follows right after an exorcism on a girl possessed by a ghost. The writer used the time as long as he wants to develop them. So the narration was slow, but very steady on its direction going deep. If you are good at Korean films, the style they make, you might predict some of the scenes correctly. Like I said the final few minutes might confuse you, but really well done part if you understand that clearly.\r\n\r\nThe film characters wise, I liked how it all connected at the end. But as a story, the solution did not seem right. I think not the fitting one or more convincing. I know who would you root, I mean most of you back what character, so from that perspective, feels it compromised a bit after put up a stern fight with what they had believed. I liked how culturally this story was narrated. I mean as its set in a small village, the ceremonies to fight the evil spirit was conducted traditional way, not the western style, except it opened with a quote from the bible.\r\n\r\nThe actors were perfect, particularly I liked where it was shot. A fine location to mix horror and cop themes. The suspense keeps the film alive, but you won't always looking at that, because the theme expands quite bigger than you expect. There are some unexpected turns, you might find yourself scratching your head for how deep it could go.\r\n\r\nDon't worry, in the end, it all comes together, or maybe watching it twice could help you with that. As I said the runtime might not favour you for the second viewing. Besides, pay a good attention while watching it for the first time, then you will get everything. Particularly if you are an animal lover, that's a biggest clue you could get in this film.\r\n\r\nI think it will be one of the best horror you would find around the world this year. It might get remade elsewhere, but the chances are less and it could remain as one of the Korean classics in the line of many others like 'Memories of Murder'. You don't have to be a Korean film fan or this director's, but if you do, surely you will have an advantage in understanding it clearly and like it more than the others. Definitely it is one of the best Korean films, but I don't think so a must see, not according to me. Though I won't conclude my review without recommending it to you. So I say watch it.\r\n\r\n_7.5\/10_","id":"5851a7319251411a4601986c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5851a7319251411a4601986c","movie_id":293670}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**When the house of peace was disturbed!**\r\n\r\nFrom the director Anne Fontaine. Like any of her works, this is another top class women oriented film. But it was partially based on the incredible true story. Partial means, no one knows what was the actual event. The director and her writers inspired by the diary the French doctor who worked for Red Cross in Poland at the end of the World War II, who wrote down her experience on it. So, with the small-small facts the story was built on for the film. Well done job by the cast and crew.\r\n\r\nWhenever you hear the word\/abbreviation 'WWII', it always bound with nazi Germans. Since this tale takes place just after the war, when the Soviet took over the Poland from them, it is set to reveal one of the extremely hidden secrets. Just imagine how secret it is, like you have read many books and have seen many films regarding the WWII, but you have never heard about this, until now. It is a heart rending tale, but the thing is everything's about the aftermath, how they handled their state of condition.\r\n\r\nMathilde, the French doctor is fetched by a nun from the nearby convent is shocked when she reached there to see most of them are in the final stage of their pregnancy. They were sexually abused by the Soviet soldiers, but now she as to keep it quiet as requested by the mother superior. She's being an atheist and to whom she's treating, the believers, is exactly the opposite kind. But not just her, the nuns as well put aside their differences to overcome their situation.\r\n\r\n> \u275dFor us nuns, the end of the war does not mean the end of fear.\u275e\r\n\r\nIt's right on the coldest winter, does not tell about the original violence, but there's still a few incidents about the army atrocities, how they treated innocent nuns, even the Red Cross members. But remember nothing was the actual depiction. It would have been even better if it was a documentary film. Doing some research and telling us the tale, reading exactly as what was written in the diary. But the film was not bad, except the scene to scene, event to event it was very slow to move, except right on the point.\r\n\r\nThe story has a twist, but it was not like very powerful. It depends on how you would consider it. Because for me, I felt it was too cruel, hard to take on. The story about church people means, you would expect a gentle kind. Or even in such situation, as in this film, to react as much as possibly generously as what they're known for. But in the first place, it was no ones fault. They all fighting for the same reason, especially keeping the outside world in mind, each one reacted differently. So it is understandable, but not all the acts were respectable.\r\n\r\nAs the director said in her interview, this is a period film, but pretty much the same in the contemporary world where war is on. The violence against the innocent women. So it is a debatable topic. And if it was directed by some male filmmaker, he might have risked with the violences in the flashback scenes to bring more depth in the narration. The present film is kind of compromises on that, but still not easy to watch everything it shows. Particularly for the families. Great performances by all. One of the best films on this theme and of the year. The film is not to be ignored. Despite not about the war, but just like 'Under Sandet', about the following event.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"597e09ef9251415daa019f33","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/597e09ef9251415daa019f33","movie_id":364051}

But when he has used it as just a plot device to bring his story to an end, the result has been unconvincing, as we saw in Avan Ivan, where the villain enters the lives of the protagonists to change its course.\r\n\r\nThaarai Thappattai, too, has a villain, Karuppaiah (RK Suresh, who is a superb addition to Bala's roster of menacing movie villains), a character which seems to be part of this tale just because Bala cannot help but have a blood-soaked ending. The film deals with the lives of Sannasai (Sasikumar, who is just about OK) and Sooravali (Varalaxmi). The son of Saami Pulavar (GM Kumar, who repeats what he did in Avan Ivan), a musician who will not compromise on his art, Sannasi has no problems in being a bit commercial. Sooravali is the main dancer in his folk music troupe, which performs at festivals, and she is madly in love with him. Life is challenging enough with most organisers booking them mostly in the hope that they will be able to sleep with the female dancers. So, when Sooravali's mother asks Sannasi to let his mother marry Karuppaiah, a seemingly docile man, he agrees, even though he is in love with her. But it is only later that Sannasi realises that he has sent Sooravali into hell and decides to take revenge.\r\n\r\nBala has never been a visual stylist but here, his style of filmmaking is shockingly crude in Thaarai Thappattai that you might mistake it for a B-movie. The moment when Karuppaiah makes an appearance with folded hands and ash on his forehead, we know that he is going to turn out into an evil creature. So, when we later get a scene where he rolls up a joint and inhales it, we are hit by the unsubtlety with which the reveal is made. Then there are the narrative jumps. One moment we see Sannasi hearing for the first of Sooravali's fate and the next scene, we see him break into the house where she is kept, even though she could not be traced by her mother for months. Even in the climax, we see him left beaten and bruised one moment and the next, he turns up where Karuppaiah is. The violence feels voyeuristic and sadistic, and you can't help but wonder if Bala is unable to think beyond such situations. And much like her character in the film, Sooravali, who kept the plot moving until the first half, is ignored for the most part of the second half. Instead, we get a sub-plot involving the plight of traditional performers.\r\n\r\nIf the film works to an extent, it is largely due to Ilaiyaraaja's fantastic score (the climax feels rousing only because the music is electrifying), Varalaxmi's uninhibited performance (she is over-the-top in a good way) and Bala's knack for bringing out humour amidst pathos (the bawdy versions of film songs taking a dig at all top film stars is something only Bala can do). But we are talking about a filmmaker whose films reinvigorated the current generation of filmmakers and sadly, he seems to be succumbing to formula.","id":"56af1f9cc3a3681c3100c109","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56af1f9cc3a3681c3100c109","movie_id":280163}

{"author":"skyezero","content":"I thought to myself, finally someone out there is making a movie on something which is an incredibly common phobia, this is going to be AMAZING! How wrong was I.\r\nAfter watching this movie I asked my partner what would she do in the females position of having to look after the porcelain Momma\u2019s boy, she replied \u201cshave him and put lipstick on him\u201d - I found this response better than watching the entire movie. I don\u2019t recall one part of this film which I sat an thoroughly enjoyed. So if he had been shaved and made up, maybe then I would have had that slight bit of entertainment.\r\n\r\nSo we start off and the obviously attractive babysitter girl rocks up at obviously isolated house and an obviously good looking guy is there to greet here, what a fucking groundbreaking start! She walks into the strangers house even though they haven\u2019t even came down to greet her which in my opinion is just damned bad manners so I\u2019m already sat hoping potfingers fucks her up a bit for being so stereotypical. \r\n\r\nThe couple she\u2019s working for come downstairs and lo and behold as if the title didn\u2019t give it away, it\u2019s not a child\u2026\u2026\u2026.it\u2019s a fucking doll. I have to say as well the creepy doll bears resemblance to an 8 year old peadophile. She gets a set of rules which you can see her already disregarding inside her head as she\u2019s taught how to put a doll in PJs and tuck it up for the night, at this point I would have been ordering Dominos and a truck tonne of movies on the sly for the easy time ahead. \r\nThere\u2019s an attic. As if this movie couldn\u2019t be anymore fucking original - we now have a mysterious attic where the audience is supposed to wonder what happens beyond the ladder! I did not, I wondered when is this going to end as I can feel my mind thinking about going back to the Indian takeaway I\u2019ve left downstairs for morning.  I mean she ends up going to explore the attic NAKED, as if I couldn\u2019t be more frustrated at how unoriginal this is, like a lot of other current horrors it has quickly gone down the road to try and make you focus on the potential tits rather than how fucking bored you are by the plot.\r\nI\u2019d wrote a decent amount of things to comment on for after the film but truth be told - all I can say to truly summarise it would be Hollywood horror. The jumps are cheap, the twists are obvious and Brahms (child) just turns into more of a pervert as the movie progresses. If the girl was feeling that fucked up by what was happening surely you\u2019d just get a heavy object and smash his porcelain face in? Well, being quicker about doing this anyways. (OOPS spoiler alert, but if you hadn\u2019t seen that coming then I\u2019m going to guess you\u2019re someone who watched this and thought it was pure golden). \r\n\r\nIf you ask me, all Brahms wanted was a bit of action judging by him acting like a randy teenager during the movie, even encased in a pot shell there was no stopping the lad from trying to scope her in the shower. Gotta give it to him for that I guess.\r\n\r\nTerrible. Avoid. Stay clear.\r\n2\/10","id":"5942ad7b9251417f5700e955","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5942ad7b9251417f5700e955","movie_id":321258}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Very close to the shore, yet too far and dangerous to attempt.**\r\n\r\nI'm sure you have seen shark attack films like 'Jaws', 'Deep Blue Sea' et cetera, and yep this another one to add to that collection. But this was something very neatly done, I mean for the most of the parts. Looked so real, so I thought it might end up top among its similar theme. In the end, I was little disappointed, because of the shark. The portrayal of shark was very natural, until the last half an hour. Then it becomes the common film gimmick when the animal was obsessed to kill its target at any cost.\r\n\r\nI am a huge animal fan, but I have never seen a live shark in my life and that does not mean I don't know anything about them. Thanks to the nature television networks and what I saw in this film was very disappointing if you love wild animals. I am not supporting the shark here, I'm just talking about its behaviour. It was not right, other than that, I definitely enjoyed the film. In fact, except the final few minutes, since the shark got pumped up, I had no issue and the best shark attack film. But the final battle ruined overall favour I'm going to give to it, what I thought this film deserved.\r\n\r\nGreat location, and Blake Lively was unbelievably awesome. In the initial part, she was very sexy, but once the narration shifted its focus on surfing and later shark attack, everything changed. The entire film was edgy, I think very nicely written screenplay. It was a limited cast film and nearly the whole film takes place very close to the shore. A good start, neatly maintained mid part, but a below par conclusion, that's what I think about the film. Slightly missed to be a great film in the line of '127 Hours'. In fact, this looks like a sea version of that film. But I still recommend it, because it's worth.\r\n\r\n_6.5\/10_","id":"580e47bdc3a368599e001882","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/580e47bdc3a368599e001882","movie_id":332567}

It's understandable, within the confines of a movie like this, but it still has a negative impact on the tale overall. Like when a machine gun is firing but has no recoil.

{"author":"skyezero","content":"I would rather peel a raw onion and squeeze the juices into my eyes than watch recent horror movies coming out of Hollywood at the moment. WHY DO YOU STILL HAVE NO IMAGINATION AND JUST RELY ON CHEAP SHITTY JUMP SCENES WITH WANK PLOTS?!\r\n\r\nOkay. GRR.\r\n\r\nRandom lady gets a casual phone call advising her sister has gone into the suicide forest and it\u2019s been 48 hours so she\u2019s presumed as a suicide and they\u2019re not going to look for her. Absolutely fuck all background into any character at this point so I don\u2019t know them from Adam. \r\nThe twin sister goes out to find her sister in Japan and instead of heading right to the mission, goes for some sushi and is that arsed about her quest is more bothered that the fish she\u2019s been given is raw. Fuck off. In her dreams she sees a ghoul child in her tent which is cheap jump #1 and to me, fuck all relevance to the audience as we still have no background which to me, is vital when you want someone to be truly on the edge wondering what\u2019s happening. \r\n\r\nObviously the main as a blonde, her twin who\u2019s gone to apparently kill herself is dark haired and gothic looking as we clearly don\u2019t want to be too stereotypical do we. Flashbacks contain her sister giving her a vase and saying \u201cGrandpa\u2019s in there\u201d so blondie opens it, revealing he is not and laughs heartily. What a laugh. She finally starts having a deek for her sister at a local place (no idea what it was as I had sort of switched off by this point) and the woman indicates her sister is downstairs. Blondie walks down to the basement of corpses and in true fashion to what we see so far is more offended by the smell than the fact her sister could be one of the rotting deceased found in the forest. Surprised she\u2019s not taking a fucking selfie at this point.\r\n\r\nShe meets a guy in a bar and after telling him her life story ignites a \u201ccheers\u201d over a beverage, cheers to what love? The fact your twin is probably hanging off a tree? He ends up taking her into the forest with an experienced ranger, after a painful journey (for me not them) they find sisters tent and she wants to stay, fair enough. She\u2019s happy to find the tent\u2026. alarm bells. An empty tent in the suicide forest, are you thick? \r\nWhen she sees her first shit ghoul, she tells the guy who she was warned off (cassanova from the bar) in a dead dramatic way, \u201cI saw this girl last night\u2026\u201d as she clicked cassanova was who she was warned off the best she could come up with when he said \u201cwhat did she say?\u201d was \u201cshe said something in japanese.\u201d Seriously. SERIOUSLY. You could have made up something like, she wanted to knife me and fuck the remains.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the movie is probably too pitch black to see anything as they\u2019ve gone for the angle of it\u2019s really dark so lets just have random people who look like Chucky pop up occasionally. \r\n\r\nEnding makes no sense, the plot is incredibly weak and I am angered yet again by the sheer shit that\u2019s being released onto cinema at the moment.\r\nAokigahara is interesting, it\u2019s real and in reality; fucking terrifying. How can you mess up this movie so badly? \r\n\r\nNo.\r\n2\/10","id":"5942acd59251417f7700e740","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5942acd59251417f7700e740","movie_id":329440}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Street pets versus the house pets! A day adventure in a big city!**\r\n\r\nAnimation films always fascinate me, because of its varieties. Even animals can be the heroes and villains. So this kind of new story perspective, including technology, what makes adults too can enjoy them like the kids does. This is now in the list of top 50 highest grossing films of all time and top 10 of the year 2016. Moreover, it is the highest grossing non Disney and non Pixar animation film. This is a very enjoyable family flick that directed by the 'Despicable Me' famed filmmaker.\r\n\r\nKind of similar to 'Bolt', but totally a different experience. This story happens in just one day. It follows a young dog named Max, one day when his owner brings another pet dog, he thinks she does not love him anymore. So to keep his position safe in the house, he strikes a deal by blackmailing his new housemate, Duke. As a revenge act, when Duke tries to get him back, something goes wrong and they get stranded on the street. So getting back to home is their biggest challenge and it should be done before the sun sets. The rest is the Max and Duke's a day adventure in the New York City.\r\n\r\nI was not expecting a masterpiece, just the last week I saw one, 'Finding Dory'. This is a good entertainer, that has some great names in the voice-over cast. Particularly you will love Kevin Hart like I did. But watch out for his impolite dialogues, if you are watching with your kids. Though there's nothing seriously affecting, just a typical Kevin Hart, but awesome. A simple story, a simple adventure, but very likable characters and screen presentation.\r\n\r\nFrom the pets' perspective about during the daytime when their owners and the kids left for the work and school, respectively, how they make their day is what's revealed in this. So the 'Secret Life' means, theirs secret get together and do whatever they want to. But an unexpected clash takes place between the two gangs, the house pets and the street pets. In so many ways, it was better than I anticipated. There are lots of untold stuffs, especially the Duke's past which might be covered in the sequel which is officially announced now. So I'm waiting for the 2018 summer. Meanwhile, watch it if you haven't yet, particularly if you like animation.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5835e13d9251416d2201ac61","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5835e13d9251416d2201ac61","movie_id":328111}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The never-ending struggle for women in the male dominated world!**\r\n\r\nThis is a surprise film. Almost my favourite. Because I don't know when the last time I wetted my eyes. I'm not ashamed to say that I love sentimental films. This was not like a thorough tearjerker, but it gets there at some point. It was like I have been waiting for such film a very long time, so that I ended up liking it more than I was anticipating.\r\n\r\nAn Irish-English language film with a wonderful cast. Because of those actors I have watched it, despite it was not promoted big like the Hollywood films. It's not in the mainstream films list. That's why not many people do not know about this film. Rooney Mara's one of the best performances. The remaining cast too had big roles, but was not powerful as hers.\r\n\r\nFilms has genres, books has genres, but not all of those works converted to each other form works out. This is such a rare genre where both formats triumphs. Watching this film is almost as experience of reading the book. You know those literatures explaining the events, character deeply, emotionally, that's quite matching in this film with beautiful locations and nice background score.\r\n\r\nThe suspense kept me expecting every moment of my watch. The end twist was not that difficult, but not all the viewers can predict it easily. It is a tale from the first half of the 20th century. But most of it was split into early and the later events. Overwhelmed by the flashback, the film reveals an old and a last woman in a mental asylum to evacuate the building to a new location. So those last moments of her stay in there, she explains why she's refusing to leave.\r\n\r\n> -xX] There's a sickness in people that stops them seeing the truth. [Xx-\r\n\r\nA doctor from another place is now reviewing her case, has to go through her story to understand the situation and act accordingly, that's accompanied by a nurse. So she reveals her secret romance when she was young, when the whole town turned against her. Particularly a young priest. How she had ended up in the mental hospital, and after 40 years, now denying to leave the building. The story ends emotionally.\r\n\r\nThe film was like the mix of 'The Little Prince' and 'Neverwas'. Because the reality and the other way around were nicely put together. Only it all were told from the grown up's perspective. They are showing something means does not you have to believe it. So it all comes to the final twist, how it ends by revealing what. No doubt if it resembles someone's real life, perhaps in the past, because in the earlier centuries, such fate, particularly for women is so common. That's where it's heart-wrenching.\r\n\r\nA perfect title for what it narrated. The older version of the lead role was too well performed. The romance part was short, but mystery extended till the final scene. Overall, the focus given to what to narrate and what not were nicely done. A very satisfying film, glad that I saw it.\r\n\r\nI don't know everybody would like it as much I did, but surely worth a try. Since the story was told from a woman's point of view about her struggle in the men dominated world, they might like it better than others. Because, as I know in the recent, the women's empowerment rising to equal men than never before. All I say is, just watch it!\r\n\r\n_8.5\/10_","id":"5a7720f1925141059a046c96","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a7720f1925141059a046c96","movie_id":283591}

There's maybe 7 I would label a masterpiece with full usage and definition of the word.\r\n\r\nThe Wailing is the eighth film of one thousand and forty films I very willingly, gladly and without hesitation give the title of Masterpiece to.\r\n\r\nI'm not too big of a fan of Asian supernatural horror. Whilst I very much enjoy it and give most films a pretty decent average rating, I find a lot of them bleed into one another with similar plots and a very safe view on the supernatural. In Japan it tends to be curses that have people die in mysterious ways, South Korea, a cursed object that has people murder each other are the most common ones I come across.\r\n\r\nWhen I clicked The Wailing was supernatural, I prepared myself for a 6 or maybe 7 out of 10 movie that was good but wouldn't hold its own too well in the vast expanse of horror.\r\n\r\nThe Wailing gave me some stunning frames. The cinematography in this is beautiful. The gore frames are gruesome, unadulterated and unapologetic. The ritualism and belief of South Korea are shown in their full glory without fear. Na Hong Jin doesn't shy away from racial tension between the Japanese and South Koreans with a slightly historical take with a beautiful twisting story that left me with my mouth gaping open but still feeling just slightly uncomfortable - something I believe Hong Jin did on purpose. I was shown acting that was so well done, no matter what I watch these actors in from now on, I will always know them from The Wailing. The varying supernatural aspects were unique, something that stunned me, unafraid to step out of genre restrictions and lead the way with something new. With a story line that is intriguing, stunning and just raw, this two and a half hour journey was worth watching.\r\n\r\nThis is a film deserving of the hype that numerous other Asian horrors got but turned out to be predictable messed. THIS is the Korean horror of 2016, the one that should have lead the forefront of South Korean, or even Asian, horror into 2017. This is a film that shows prowess, promise and skill. Hong Jin treats us to such wonderful skills from not just himself but his script writer, his cast, his editing team, his make up team, etc, everyone involved. You can feel the passion and love and pure dedication that went into this movie.\r\n\r\nA full 10\/10 is just not enough for this film.\r\n\r\nA twisting, numbing, horrifying masterpiece.","id":"5dfe4971d236e600128ca76a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dfe4971d236e600128ca76a","movie_id":293670}

Booby traps, man eating ants, ancient alien ship et cetera? Well, I agree it was slow and boring in parts, but most importantly, it was only revealed the true story. Not all the biopics are delightful entertainer. Originally this tale took place for three decades, but what you saw on the screen was merely a highlight. All about the adventures. The personal life was less focused. Especially the final act was honest. Because it is a mystery. So people should appreciate for the effort from the filmmakers.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed it. A film like this hard to come by. I mean when a film based on a real person was made a film, people expect the only heroic act, instead of truth. That kind of mindset need to be changed in order to enjoy it. Or else pick the those similar commercial films instead of it. Charlie Hunnam was impressive, probably his film best I've seen so far. He always reminds me Tom Hardy for having a similar facial. There were others in the film, but only he had piloted it.\r\n\r\nIt's weird that it should have been a British film, but Hollywood made it. Above all, the funny thing was they correctly pronounced the Z as Zed. Anyway, that's how the real story was. The jungle scenes were awesome. In many parts it was very suspense like when they had contact with the Amazonia tribes. I was very curious about what would happen. Because all I remember was 'The Green Inferno'. Those who are interested in the history and archaeological expedition, this film would be the right choice, but anticipate reality, not something out of the world.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59cade039251412b8b0053f0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59cade039251412b8b0053f0","movie_id":314095}
{"author":"tmdb63938527","content":"The tagline for this film is 'Does for the moors what \"Jaws\" did for beaches', and well, it doesn't exactly do that (American Werewolf in London holds that title) but this curious little Brit comedy-horror does just about work, just, though it does fall fairly flat in a few places.\r\n\r\nIn late 2013, early 2014 production on this title was supposedly pretty much wrapped up.  For whatever reason it did not release until almost 3 years later.  Directed by first time feature director Michael Anderson who before this, had only directed a couple of shorts.  Interestingly, he he had worked on American Werewolf as a clapper loader along with a few other films in the eighties, as well as being a cinematographer  on a couple of things in the nineties.\r\n\r\nAdd in (with the aforementioned Anderson) a TV series regular in Potts (Primeval), Aikman (Freight) who is perhaps more known for her video game voice artist work than her on-screen credits and Turgoose (This Is England, Eden Lake) who is not exactly shall we say prolific, this all adds up to a curious film that could have been a major disaster.  The script from Squire adds just enough wit to keep this rolling along, naturally helped by the recent successes of other similar films such as Shaun of the Dead which really helped revive this sub-genre.\r\n\r\nAnyway, as to the actual story-line, Tim Webber (an adequate Potts) sneak out of boarding school one night on a dare to steal some crocodile eggs from the local zoo.  As you do one might say.  Naturally, as any idiot could envisage, it all goes horribly wrong with Tim taking all the responsibility.  Fifteen or so years later, Tim returns home after the death of his father and this is where the film begins in earnest.\r\n\r\nOnly our intrepid hero finds something a sinister lurking in the local moors and canals which is quietly and unassumingly dispatching with the local Somerset villagers.  Nothing to worry about then I hear you say.  Can Tim make amends for his actions fifteen years earlier?  will Tim become just another statistic along with residents of this sleepy village?  Do we even care?  Well, given the raft of rubbish that is released yearly, especially VOD and straight to cable, this one is probably worth finding out, specially when you add in the rather off-beat serial killer sub-plot.\r\n\r\nIs this a sensible film?  For sure it is not.  Monster feature, serial killer, comedy with a little horror mixed in, it is certainly all of those and more.  A simple film made all the weirder by the plot and characters, and there are many weird characters.  But it is all this and more that makes the film the curious little treasure it is.  Am I biased with it being a British film?  I'd like to think not, but certainly the humour is what I have grown up with and maybe that resonates a little more with myself than perhaps it would with others.\r\n\r\nAs has been mentioned, the script is fairly good and keeps the comedy elements nicely mingling with the more serious sections of the film, though some more character development would have been nice, or at least some of their motivations aside from our protagonist.  Is the actual story-line a little silly?  Hell yes it is, but that adds to it's charms.  And tell me, when has any creature-feature ever had an Oscar worthy plot?  Does it steal elements from Lake Placed and such films like Alligator?  Yes it does but this just keeps things refreshing and original enough to keep you entertained.\r\n\r\nAs for the bad, well the acting bar a couple of the main actors is nothing to get excited about, the special effects are not the greatest by any stretch of the imagination (neither is the creature either) and the film does suffer from some meandering moments.  Perhaps it's biggest failing is the actual lack of creature action.  But thinking on this for a moment, if you were to add up the screen time of a creature in a flick like this I really don't think it is low comparing to other films.  \r\n\r\nWe all love a good dodgy B-movie creature feature, but why?  The creature itself is hardly on screen.  Now given the budget for this film was a rumoured one million, then I personally think they did fairly well with using that money.  To sum up, there are far worse films for you to spend ninety minutes of your life watching and if you are a fan of either the creature-feature or Brit horror-comedy than you can certainly do worse.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more reviews follow the links below:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/thecelluloidsage.com\/\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thecelluloidsage\/","id":"5b774e8d0e0a26473c00118e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b774e8d0e0a26473c00118e","movie_id":391402}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is kind of a prequel and a sequel to Snow White and The Huntsman. It is not as impressive as the first movie but quite good anyway. I would call it a nice family movie although probably not for the youngest members of the family.\r\n\r\nThe story is partly before and partly after the events in Snow White and The Huntsman. It is a good adventure with plenty of magic and special effects and a fair bit of action. It is a fairly straightforward story without much in terms of surprises.\r\n\r\nThere is a bit of comical relief in particular by the dwarfs, especially when the two dwarfs following the huntsman encounters the grumpy female one and her friend.\r\n\r\nApart from the classical Snow White setting, quite good special effects and quite decent action this is a fairly normal fantasy adventure movie.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Little Sophie's giant adventure.**\r\n\r\nI did not dislike it, but I thought it was not creative enough. I had seen the British animation and this one retained the same story. Of course, which was originally from the book, but nothing new other than a decent computer graphics. I liked the performance of the little girl who had played the Sophie. She was the only live character until the final stage where more joins her. So she was wonderful along with Mark Rylance's CGI role.\r\n\r\nStraight to the point, the adventure begins right away. Sophie, the ten year old orphan girl was snatched by a giant named BFG after she witnessed him wandering on the street through her dorm room window on one midnight. Fearing she might expose the giant's existence, so he had to take her with him to his country. Then there they become very close, but a new threat arises when the other giants suspect of a human's existence in their enclosure. So fighting them, followed by a permanent solution to menace caused by them is what narrated in the rest.\r\n\r\nIt was like Peter Jackson's 'The Lovely Bones' for Steven Spielberg, I mean the films that did not work for them. I anticipated a major surge in this by the family film specialist Spielber. Because I usually love his film, tell me who won't. From children to adults, his films targets all ages. But if you had seen the old version, then you will lose half the interest. That's definitely won't be the same for the kids, they will love it. There's no harm for watching it once, so go for it.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"584469fd92514169d900c966","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/584469fd92514169d900c966","movie_id":267935}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"I seek righteousness. But I'll take revenge.\r\n\r\nDirected by Antoine Fuqua and written by Nic Pizzolatto and Richard Wenk. Starring Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, Byung-hun Lee, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Martin Sensmeier, Haley Bennett and Peter Sarsgard. Music is by Simon Franglen (also working from a James Horner template) and cinematography by Mauro Fiore.\r\n\r\nSeven gunmen band together to aid the town of Rose Creek whose inhabitants are being driven out by ruthless capitalist Bartholomew Bogue.\r\n\r\nWe are now in an age of film making where \"tagged classics\" are no longer sacrosanct. Any number of these \"tagged classics\" have been and will become viable for remake - reboot - reimaging for newer audiences. It's here, it happens and really there's nothing we can do about it but moan amongst ourselves. John Sturges' 1960 The Magnificent Seven (itself a remake of Kurosawa pic Yojimbo) is a much loved film, and not just in Western lovers circles, it's a film that non Western fans are known to enjoy - and rightly so, it deserves its place as a \"tagged classic\" and still enthrals over 50 years since its release. So the big studio big wigs and Antoine Fuqua were taking a major gamble remaking a classic remake with their own remake!\r\n\r\nUndeniably the shadows loom large over the 2016 version, so much weight of expectation, in fact to some it was a stinker of a film even before it was released! Well, as those who have seen it will attest, both the fans and the dissenters, it hasn't raised the bar for the \"Seven\" formula, but, and this is very key here, the makers wasn't setting out to make a film that down the line would be perceived as a \"tagged classic\", and this is evident in the ream of extras available on the Blu-ray releases. They achieved what they set out to do, to make a blunderbuss Oater for the modern era to sample, and they have done it with much love, much cool and lashings of technical greatness. Add in a cast clearly enjoying themselves and not letting anyone down, and it's a tasty plate of beans.\r\n\r\nFuqua updates things by having his seven as a row of differing ethnicities, which works a treat, and crucially he and his writers are respectful of those characterisations, even if a bit more fleshing out wouldn't have gone amiss. Yet nothing is at a cost to honouring the great Westerns of old. Beautiful landscapes envelope the players, the musical score bouncing around man and nature with homaged sweetness. There's closeups, silhouetted slices of panache, superb stunt work (man and beast), glorious set design, and then there's the action. The fight sequences are excellently constructed, a feast for the eyes and ears, death and slaughter unfurled in brutal but hunger appeasing strokes. There's comic relief about the place, and while much of the dialogue wouldn't have the great poets of yore troubled, there is deepness to be found. Intelligence, too, the addition of PTSD to one of the main players is a notable piece of worth, while how wonderful to find a Western lady character of great substance (Bennett excellent), so good in fact she could have been one of the seven!\r\n\r\nIt's a bare bones story, with a pointless motive revelation tagged on for the finale, while some anachronisms will irritate those bothered by such. But if you are able to judge it on its own terms, as a Western entertainment for this era, and to accept it isn't trying to outdo the source of its inspiration, then a good time can readily be had. 8\/10","id":"58972859c3a368627c014267","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58972859c3a368627c014267","movie_id":333484}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The curious deathtraps of Louis Drax.**\r\n\r\nThis is not what the director is famous for. But still the suspense keeps us hoping for the turnaround at any time. The film was based on the book of the same name. With a decent cast and production, the film somewhat achieved its goal. The screenplay was not that bad, but the contents lacked. Even though it is a mystery theme, you would predict a few things. Not everybody does that, but I did, I figured it out the puzzle at a certain stage of the narration, before it disclosed at the crucial part.\r\n\r\nIt's about a boy in the title name. He has survived many times from the death since he was in foetus. But it seems for the 9th time he was out of the luck. It was not yet game over for him, because he's now in the coma fighting between the life and death. Meanwhile, his recent past was revealed and her mother starts to get close to the doctor who treating him. From all, the biggest suspense is what made him to end in this condition and when the film reaches the final stage, everything comes out with a twist.\r\n\r\nIt's certainly a watchable film, but the quality of preserving the secret was not up to the par what a normal viewer expects from this kind of storyline. The suitable atmosphere was created, and so the characters. With a decent runtime and its pace, pretty much an okay film, but somewhat, something is not quite well in it. From the direction to the actors, they all very dedicated for to their parts. Thematically, I loved it, yet it should have been more eventful, I mean more story and more developments. Overall, not a must see film, but once.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"595199b69251412a05013213","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/595199b69251412a05013213","movie_id":294795}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The story of how a hitman became hitgirl!**\r\n\r\nActually, it was a much better film than what I've heard of it. What could you expect from a B movie? This was a much better film for its small budget with a decent cast. The storyline seems okay, but Michelle Rodriguez is the one who made it possible. Yeah, it was like created for her to play the main role and she excelled. The filmmaking was quite compromised when the initial part of her character was played by herself. Because of particularly her height, but decently convinces us with all the rest of the makeovers.\r\n\r\nThe film was about an assassin, who after encountering some wrong men, discovers later that he'd went through gender reassignment surgery. Now raged with anger, he begins his hunt whoever behind it, especially finding the reason for. With a small romance and action sequences, the film comes to an end. Before giving it a try, you must understand that it is not the film you should expect to be a masterpiece. It tried its best to narrate a decent story, as well as you get your entertainment along.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This was the most underwhelming Tarzan movie that I have ever seen. A typical product of some Hollywood producer trying to make a \"modern\" take of Tarzan not really knowing or caring for the Tarzan that Edgar Rice Burroughs created.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn particular it was the palest and most underwhelming Tarzan character yet. He never radiated the strength nor the intelligence that Edgar Rice Burroughs attributed to his character. He spent most of the movie going around with a bland look on his face.\r\n\r\nThe story itself is pretty much an out of the box standard Hollywood story about slavery and abuse of the black African population. Not truly bad but nothing to write home about either.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of CGI in the movie and although quite a few reviewers seem to consider it bad I personally though it was pretty okay. One of the few decent bits of the movie.\r\n\r\nI truly do not understand that they had the nerve to call this movie The Legend of Tarzan since it really is pretty far from the legend of Tarzan that Edgar Rice Burroughs created.

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"So here we go again\u2026another derivative suburban haunted house horror showcase featuring a harried heroine\u2019s beleaguered state of mind from the wicked walls within her household\u2019s creepy confines. The aptly entitled **The Disappointments Room** is the latest flaccid floorboard frightfest that tries to turn its predictable creaks into gloomy gold. Instead, **The Disappointments Room** is yet another redundant devious domicile drama that clumsily blends stagy supernatural suspense with victimized mental illness overtones.\r\n\r\nUnlike the recent hair-raising, house haunting gem such as David F. Sandberg\u2019s well-received horror home thriller _Lights Out_ co-writer\/director D.J. Caruso (\u201cEagle Eye\u201d, \u201cDisturbia\u201d) never solidly establishes a workman-like psychology that gives his lop-sided eerie narrative an imaginative sense of insinuation and trauma or flowing raw nervousness. Instead, **The Disappointments Room** merely consists of tepid teasing that only a semi-riveting psychological-horror can provide.\r\n\r\nIt is a known fact that **The Disappointments Room** sat on shelves with no release date in sight in the wake of its film distributor\u2019s (Relatively Media) financial woes back in 2015. Well, some may suggest that this toothless horror house sideshow should have continued to remain shelved since it brings absolutely no distinctive scares or challenging home-bound havoc to the proverbial terrorizing table.\r\n\r\nKate Beckinsale, last seen in the critically acclaimed Jane Austen-inspired _Love & Friendship_, is totally out of her element in this banal bump-in-the-night offering. Beckinsale plays Dana, a grieving wife and mother that decides to pack up from Brooklyn and move to the country in North Carolina to ease the emotional pain in the aftermath of her deceased baby daughter\u2019s passing. Joining Dana is her husband David (Mel Raido) and young son Lucas (Duncan Joiner) hoping to escape their brand of psychological sadness as well. Thus, architect Dana and her family are heading to a sprawling yet deteriorating rural estate that they purchased as their idyllic getaway from urban life. Naturally, Dana is able to apply her professional know-how flourishes to the dilapidated property she now calls home.\r\n\r\nPredictably, the new homestead has some unique mystery that Dana eventually uncovers in the form of a hidden attic room for which is opened by the missing key. Consequently, all hell breaks loose as the nightmarish result of Dana\u2019s forbidden curiosity. Now the country manor has become a hallucinating hellhole for the imperiled Dana. Specifically, the raucous room in question is the center of disturbing disillusionment experienced by the disoriented Dana. Soon, Dana is surrounded by freakish apparitions that pop up randomly. Even the ominous ghostly sighting of the house\u2019s former owner Judge Blacker (Gerald McRaney) and his satanic black dog plagues poor Dana\u2019s psyche. When Dana is not being twitchy over the demonic spirits she has to tolerate the local handyman Ben\u2019s (Lucas Till) irksome flirtatious come-on while making repairs on her home.\r\n\r\nDana is understandably distraught as the Disappointments Room has effectively bombarded her tortured soul. She tries desperately to convey to her family the torment of the household threatening spirits but they dismiss her claims as nothing more than a major leftover residual breakdown regarding the baby daughter they lost so tragically. Can Dana overcome her personal crisis for releasing these retaliatory shadowy images that are causing her mental instability? Will she be able to ease her suffering of a loved one\u2019s loss while tackling the sinister forces that persist in her menacing manor? How can she protect her precious boy Lucas when as a mother she failed to prevent the passing of her aforementioned baby girl?\r\n\r\n**The Disappointments Room** co-scripting duties are shared by Caruso and former Fox-TV Prison Break actor Wentworth Miller. They aimlessly tack on the unexplained spooky nemesis and attempt to foster Beckinsale\u2019s Dana with escalated psychological burdens. The problem is that the toothless creepy haunted house cliches and Beckinsale\u2019s motherly vulnerabilities are sluggishly presented on a prolonged whim. There does not seem to be enough structured and genuine thrills and chills to elevate **The Disappointments Room** beyond it being deemed as another perfunctory, repetitive housebound hell-raiser joining the genre. Although Beckinsale tries to give credible heft to her character Dana\u2019s frazzled misery she simply comes off as a thinly veiled worrywart.\r\n\r\nOne cannot fault Caruso\u2019s directorial diligence in trying to ambitiously solidify **The Disappointments Room** as a percolating psychological-horror project by incorporating all the moving parts of Dana\u2019s fragile mindset of love and loss, her property\u2019s problematic infestation of intimidating ghouls and unwanted advances from bothersome cretins such as Till\u2019s insufferable handyman Ben. However, these revolving subplots never seem to effortless blend together on the same level therefore causing a chaotic choppiness to the film\u2019s edgy rhythm. For American boob tube fanatics it is a nostalgic kick to see supporting veteran television personalities participate such as McRaney (\u201cSimon & Simon\u201d, \u201cMajor Dad\u201d, \u201cDesigning Women\u201d), Celia Weston (\u201cAlice\u201d) and Joely Fisher (\u201cEllen\u201d, \u201cTil Death\u201d) but they and other performers are inexplicably wasted in this hackneyed horror dud.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to predict that the sub-par **The Disappointments Room** will not make anybody forget celebrated cinematic housing aberrations such as _The Amityville Horror_ or even _Panic Room_ anytime soon.\r\n\r\n**The Disappointments Room** (2016)\r\n\r\nRelativity Studios\r\n\r\n1 hr. 40 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Kate Beckinsale, Mel Raido, Gerald McRaney, Lucas Till, Duncan Joiner, Joely Fisher, Celia Weston, Michael Landes\r\n\r\nDirected and Co-Written by: D.J.

Justin Theroux plays her ex-husband, Rebecca Ferguson his new wife, Haley Bennett the missing woman, Luke Evans the missing woman\u2019s husband and Edgar Ram\u00edrez her therapist.   \r\n\r\n\u201cThe Girl on the Train\u201d (2016) is a melancholy adult-oriented crime drama\/mystery in the mold of \u201cDerailed\u201d (2005), \u201cThe Clearing\u201d (2004), \"Snow Angels\" (2007), \u201cThe River King\u201d (2005) and even \u201cMystic River\u201d (2003). But it\u2019s by far the least of these. As far as technical filmmaking and cast go, there\u2019s no issue.

Their both lives are about to turn around, but how is what told just before the end.\r\n\r\nThe film was not bad, but not good enough to praise. Worth a watch if you are not anticipating and just want an entertainment. Obviously the film is for the adults, but you won't be happy if you are looking for according to the title. Because the title name is only where the film plot was initiated and the remaining story was all about the character surrounding it. So it is not an erotic drama or romance or a thriller. The film was short and well maintained pace, but not the film of the year.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"597e06f09251415d9801afa4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/597e06f09251415d9801afa4","movie_id":351964}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Use on opportunity, build an empire and be the boss!\r\n\r\nI always liked Melissa McCarthy films when others said they were very bad, but this time it is totally different. I won't blame her, she always gives her one hundred per cent and so for this film. But it was the terrible script that let her down. Actually, it is a watchable film, because of her, but without her completely unimaginable. The trailer looked much better than the film. It is a comedy, but the laughs are too far, not even a little smile in your face easy to obtain.\r\n\r\nSo it seems there are plenty of negatives about it than the good. I watched it to prove the people are wrong about it, but in the end I was wrong. This is the second time the director and McCarthy together for a film who are the real life couple. But I liked 'Tammy' better, not this one and there will be one more film that I hope they would come up with much more interesting than these two.\r\n\r\nShe is not a solo type star, her films are always the multistarrer. So whenever I hear about her new films, I get curious about her new partner. Kristen Bell was not bad, even Peter Dinklage have given a nice performance. So The casting was good, but they all did not get the good script or the role. I did not enjoy it means not that I won't recommend it. It did not work for me, but it might to you, so I advise be carefully while choosing it.\r\n\r\n3\/10","id":"579518fa925141136a0080c5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/579518fa925141136a0080c5","movie_id":323676}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"No doubt that actress Melissa McCarthy has become a pop cultural phenomenon within the last few years. She has hit the jackpot in a career gone on a whirlwind upswing. McCarthy has just ended a six-year run from her Emmy-winning turn on the popular CBS sitcom **Mike and Molly**. She was Oscar-nominated for her performance in **Bridesmaids**. She has made a slew of hit-and-miss comedies. Her hosting stints on the legendary **Saturday Night Live** are riotous. McCarthy is part of the much-talked about upcoming female version of the wildly treasured 80's cult classic comedy **Ghostbusters**. Additionally, ardent fanatics of the 2000-2007 WB network TV series **Gilmore Girls** recently rejoiced when McCarthy agreed to join the Netflix revival show that previously endeared her to television audience years before. So yes...to say that Melissa McCarthy is on a continued roll with her ubiquitous presence in TV and movies is an understatement.\r\n\r\nIn McCarthy's latest broad comedy **The Boss** she and her husband Ben Falcone (\"Bridesmaids\") collaborate as they--along with Steve Mallory--co-wrote the script with Falcone taking over the directorial duties. In fact, both McCarthy and Falcone co-wrote the 2014 vehicle **Tammy** starring McCarthy with Falcone in the director's chair as well. So it is a relief to see how this Hollywood couple bond creatively over their film projects. However, it is not all that encouraging that the Falcones have subsided over generic laughfests. \r\n\r\nOn the surface **The Boss** could be perceived as a wacky female empowerment romp but dig deeper and this lackluster comedy has all the one-note comical deepness of a frizzled Phyllis Diller wig. McCarthy plays the brash and blistery Michelle Darnell, a Martha Stewart-esque CEO financial wizard with a convincing pretty penny that makes up her unbelievable fortune. In fact, Michelle happens to be the 47th wealthiest woman in America. Unfortunately, the law caught up with Michelle so now she is behind bars for inside trading.\r\n\r\nAfter months of doing \"hard time\" (in reality \"soft time\" for the jailed demanding diva), Michelle is released where she learns of her frozen assets and diminutive ex-lover and rival entrepreneur Renault (Peter Dinklage) who has taken over her multi-million dollar companies. With nowhere to turn for support Michelle decides to intrude on her long-suffering former personal assistant Claire (Kristen Bell). The tolerant Claire is a single mother to 10-year old Rachel (Ella Anderson). As one can imagine the insufferable Michelle is a terror in poor Claire's household with her bossy demeanor. Apparently Claire's nastiness is just not reserved for Claire as she has plenty of scorn to go around for the ones who dare to step in her way.\r\n\r\nSoon, Michelle discovers a way to get back into the capitalism game and recapture her status as a wealth-driven Wonder Woman. The agenda involves Rachel's Dandelion troop as inspiration for Michelle scheming to recruit the outcast girls from the Dandelions (dubbed \"Darnell's Darlings) to sell the exceptional brownies based upon Claire's crafty recipe. Naturally, Michelle is hard on the little gals to push her need for reaching success but in her own caring way she wants to educate the Darlings to become strong, independent future businesswomen armed with potential power and poise. With Michelle's sad-sack backstory as a rejected little girl raised in a Catholic orphanage where many foster homes denied her existence it is clear that the seemingly cold and calculating Michelle does not want her hardship to be repeated in the group of girls she is grooming for the kill of conquering the business world.   \r\n\r\n**The Boss** has some slapstick moments that are passable and the always game McCarthy is willing to do what it takes to sell the zany goods to ensure the hefty chuckles. Playing hard-nose harlots such as the coarse Michelle Darnell is McCarthy's specialty and she is effective when the material supports her tyrannical pushiness. However, **The Boss** feels lackluster because McCarthy's sketchy bits are slight and the movie's basic follow-the-dots lunacy is never on par with McCarthy's bombastic business-minded bulldog. The movie feels cheaply lifted from the hybrid boundaries of 1989's **Troop Beverly Hills** paired with 1988's **Big Business.**\r\n\r\nThankfully, **The Boss** is not as tepid or forgettable as McCarthy's other outings such as the aforementioned **Tammy** or **Identity Theft**. On the flip side, this toothless romp will never rub shoulders with the more acceptable McCarthy staples in **Bridesmaids**, **The Heat** or **Spy** either. In short, this particular **Boss** ought to be demoted to the unemployment line.\r\n\r\n**The Boss** (2016)\r\n\r\nUniversal Pictures\r\n\r\n99 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Bell, Peter Dinklage, Ella Anderson, Kathy Bates, Tyler Labine\r\n\r\nDirected by: Ben Falcone\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng","id":"570c44359251416ce60004b0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/570c44359251416ce60004b0","movie_id":323676}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**When the ancient spirits set loose.**\r\n\r\nUsually horror films are the most clich\u00e9d genre, especially when it comes to those scaring parts, all the films use the same sudden sound effects and disfigured human images with the strong makeup or the graphics. This film is nothing less than any of those, but a bit too much in the first three quarters. Like they are keeping some suspense, but it was just dragging to extend the film length and what comes in the final quarter is actually the story with a twist. So when that revelation happens, you would probably lose complete interest on this. Because that's not the demons you're expecting after all the hype was created in the earlier segment.\r\n\r\nThe story was just okay, but it was well known to us in different forms from the different films. In this, it is set in a different location with different cast, so that makes the film is fresh, but it wasn't. Some ancient spirits were set loose when a family was picnicking and it follows them to their house. Now they suffer from some unexplainable events and they decide to get rid bringing the people who can. That leads to the final act where the story comes to end.\r\n\r\nThey say it was inspired by the real event involving a family. So that might interest some viewers to check it out. But if you're an atheist, this is just a joke. From the director of 'Wolf Creek' with the decent performances by Kevin Bacon and Radha Mictchell, the film did not become best among its theme. Just a watchable film, after that you won't going to remember it a week or a month later. Very few might like it, but it's impossible to say who they're, so I'm not going to suggest or reject it.\r\n\r\n_4\/10_","id":"57f411959251413963000460","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57f411959251413963000460","movie_id":257345}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**One wrong move made a small time thief a target.**\r\n\r\nThe first thing is this film came at the worst time in the history of France. If it was set in elsewhere in the world would have had less issue, but the Paris terror attack and this theme had lots of similarity. I mean it was nothing to do with the incident, but the contents are very impactful. Which also might be the reason for the film not doing well. I did not enjoy much this film, for me it was the story that turned me off. It was sympathetic to terrorists in the first half, so I completely hated that part, and then the last 30 or so minutes it got better. I mean not awesome or like that, but just good.\r\n\r\nDirected by 'Eden Lake' famed director. Another very familiar story, but altered like it was for the first time in a film. So most of the parts are predictable, but one twist during the beginning of the third act made it look good. Amazing pace, it just keeps getting bigger and bigger going forward. But as we know, those developments were so clich\u00e9d. All the actors were okay, and it has some decent stunts as well. I think it is a good timepass film and nothing else..\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"581cf67ac3a3681ed100117e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/581cf67ac3a3681ed100117e","movie_id":333669}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"The backbone of _The Forest\u2019s_ conception is probably more fascinating than the horror film in which the narrative is based upon. Some may be familiar with the backstory of the \u201creal\u201d _Forest_ and its disturbing legendary reputation. Of course the reference is reserved for Japan\u2019s Aokigahara Forest (a.k.a. \u201cSuicide Forest\u201d) at the geographical base of Mount Fuji where historically this has been the morbid albeit visually stimulating resting place for that country\u2019s despair-ridden segmented population to gravitate in hopes of ending their lives among the smothering trees and twisty hiking paths. Although the Aokigahara Forest (also nicknamed \u201cThe Sea of Tress\u201d) acts as the last tranquil location for those desperate souls that want to meet their spiritual Maker it also doubles as a scenic and sumptuous tourist attraction for outsiders that embrace the essence of such a colorfully green, wooded paradise. So given the compelling inspiration for such an intriguing and real-life model of a Japanese posh and plentiful tree trunk haven of exceptional beauty and mystery then why does The Forest not resonate with the convincing chills and thrills of a harried horror showcase meant to capture the true scary decadence of the Aokigahara Forest\u2019s mystique?\r\n\r\nThe motivating myth behind the genuine hysterics of an Asian region that distinctively boasts the world\u2019s second largest destination for suicidal tendencies should have been the selling point for this plodding, predictable doom-and-gloom chiller. Instead, The Forest cannot seem to distinguish the light from its treacherous trees while delivering a hollow. horror-made shell of ghostly paranoia that never really musters up any majestic titillation beyond its basic boo-link manufacturing. _The Forest\u2019s_ winning formula, as it seems, is to rely on flashbacks in its step-by-step storytelling, exhaustive close-up shots on the film\u2019s photogenic lead Natalie Dormer from TV\u2019s \u201cGames of Thrones\u201d (playing put-upon Sara and her twin sister simultaneously) and needling through the conventional creepy impulses that the movie routinely trots out in suggestive suspense mode.\r\n\r\nFirst-time director Jason Zada has an interesting premise in which to work his grim-inducing hocus-pocus as his nightmarish narrative had the potential to raise the stakes of psychological warfare between weak-minded human psyche fragility and the deceptive mask of nature\u2019s beautification. Zada and screenwriters Sarah Cornwell, Nick Antosca and Ben Katai never fluidly marry the concept of despair and detachment with the ominous histrionics of the ghoulish Aokigahara Forest folklore. The saddened study of loss and hopelessness in an exquisite and mystifying woodland of wonderment is sacrificed for a serviceable chiller that sputters in its generic sense of dread and devastation.\r\n\r\nDormer\u2019s Sara Price is on a menacing mission to find her missing identical twin sibling Jess in the Far East. Jess had decided to take a trip to Japan. The word got out that poor Jess was last seen frequenting the notorious Aokigahara Forest\u2013certainly not an encouraging sign for both the country\u2019s natives and visiting outsiders deeply intrigued by the Timberland of Terror. In addition to Sara wandering about to locate the absent Jess she must reconcile her personal demons  and confront the ghosts\u2013both the ones in her worried mindset and the evil-minded forest\u2019s creation\u2013as she seeks out her disappearing twin. Sara is against all odds to find her missing sibling in a wooded wasteland of hopelessness. Importantly, Sara must overcome her inner fears of depression, disillusionment and disorientation and poking around in the infamous Aokigahara is not helping matters in the least.\r\n\r\nThere is much that can be said about the lackluster presentation of _The Forest_. For starters, Dormer\u2019s startled siren Sara is supposed to be the fearing female presence with a decent lifestyle back in the States although still tackling her traumatic baggage from a questionable upbringing. The audience does get the uncanny bond that Dormer\u2019s twin sibs share in both triumph and tragedy. No doubt that Zada tries to position the emotional and mental bridge of his look-a-like pretty protagonists and tailor a sordid background of frightening forethought that especially consumes the erratic Sara. Yet with all the set-up in place (Aokigahara\u2019s spooky backstory, imperiled sisterhood, etc.) Zada seems to struggle in incorporating any convincing sizzle that can propel The Forest into a cultural creepfest that really tantalizes.\r\n\r\nDormer\u2019s Sara is reduced to frantically running into the shadowy woods and giving off jittery vibes to the spontaneous apparitions that pop in and out. Surprisingly, _The Forest_ never seizes the moment to embrace the inherent value of the Aokigahara\u2019s deadly hypnotism for life-ending finality. Perhaps even if basing this horror film on the real-life suicidal indignation of \u201cSuicide Forest\u201d there probably would be major criticism about exploiting a Japanese tourist territory and its reprehensible reputation attached just to give a Hollywood horror showcase entertaining credibility. Still, this potential controversy might have given The Forest an upgrade in its otherwise mechanical and sluggish execution.\r\n\r\n_The Forest_ tosses around a few supporting characters to surround Dormer\u2019s damsel-in-distress Sara but to no real effect. Japanese tourist guide Michi (Yukiyoshi Ozawa) and journalist Aiden (Taylor Kinney) join Sara in her quest to track down Jess. Michi, using common sense, abandons the remaining twosome after learning that Sara insists on sticking around the forbidden forest as the darkness of night approaches. Thus, this gives Aiden a fighting chance to intimately cozy up to the determined Sara while covering an expose on the tedious travels through the scenic but sinister woods. Of course, the introduction of the Yurei (the harrowing woods-based spirits that supposedly influence the suicidal urges of its doomed visitors) is in full force to badger the beleaguered Sara as they reinforce her embedded delusions.\r\n\r\nSome bright spots do redeem _The Forest\u2019s_ presentation such as Mattias Troelstrup\u2019s crisp camerawork and the haunting and surreal visuals of strung-up stiff corpses hanging from the trees that accentuate the eeriness of lifeless souls lost in hidden pain. Otherwise, Zada\u2019s thin and jittery payoff is nothing more than a toothless trek through the pseudo petrified _Forest_.\r\n\r\nThe Forest (2016)\r\n\r\n1 hr. 35 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Natalie Dormer, Taylor Kinney and Yukiyoshi Ozawa\r\n\r\nDirected by: Jason Zada\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror\/Psychological Thriller\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng  2016","id":"56ac6b209251417e1100562a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56ac6b209251417e1100562a","movie_id":329440}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**There comes a time for everyone that changes the life forever.**\r\n\r\nThis is a very charming title if you are a fantasy film fan. Good looking film posters too from different languages for different regions. In a way, that was my reason to watch this, but anyway I would have seen it sooner or later being a cinephile. It was not a popular production, though the cast and storyline interested me more. They have categorised it as a modern day fairy-tale. But it was missing something. Something cinematically convince to its viewers. My best guess is 'stylish presentation'. Yep, it was a similar kind to 'Am\u00e9lie', ' Citizen Dog' et cetera. It was not based on any book, but would have been a better format for such tale.\r\n\r\nIt was like those titles I mentioned in the previous paragraph which meets 'The Secret Garden'. Sadly, not well explored in its topics. For instance, the romance part was half-boiled. Funnily, I never knew the film trying to achieve that part. Of course it had a boy and a girl. In fact, three boys against one girl. But which path the narration is taking was well preserved till certain length of the film. Surely somewhat it was a fairy-tale, but most probably not like the one you would be anticipating. Especially in the initial stage, it bettered. Only later on it had started to fall back as a casual film.\r\n\r\nThe tale of a children's novelist. She is an orphan. Now being an adult, living independently in London, while working in a library. The story of her prior to land in the orphanage was a mystery. So basically she aspires to be a children's writer. Yet to write her first book. It was her normal lonely mechanical life, but one stormy day a trouble comes her way. The next door grumpy old man picking her for a verbal fight for several reasons and one of it were the neglected backyard. Now she has got a countdown to fix the issue. So the remaining the narrative focused on her undertaking, while the other side of her life, she's trying to get a close to an inventor.\r\n\r\n> \u275dLife and nature, it's just waiting to burst out anywhere it can, seeking light, getting on with it.\u275e\r\n\r\nDefinitely it should have been better. Not for just the cinephiles, but even normal people would feel that way. I don't know this filmmaker, but his direction was good, definitely not the writing skill. I think that's where it had failed mostly. It is still an above average, though if the screenplay, including dialogues was done better, then it would have been another level. Particularly, I did not like the transition between the scenes, events and the characters. One of the lines said at the final stage, after the story had taken a twist was poorly penned. That was the godfather of all the clich\u00e9s, should have avoided at any cost.\r\n\r\nBy the way the actors were good. From Jessica Brown to Tom Wilkinson and other two did their respective roles finely. The synopsis says it is about an author, but the film explored different way. The entire film given preference to gardening. It took phases and were decent too. But at final stage it takes a twist by giving a convincing reason. But if that's what the whole story was relied on to surprise its viewer, then that's did not do its job as expected. Overall, the writing should have been improved to give the film a better chance to do well with the film goers.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, it is a watchable film. Especially I think women, family audience could enjoy it better. I would say the character Bella carried it all the way, despite Alfie jumped into the main storyline strongly in a mid way. The basic story was good enough. Bella is being a loner all her life, how suddenly everything has changed around her was the purpose of the film. Jessica Brown was a perfect choice for the role. She looked more beautiful than ever. Watch it for her, for the cast. Only a few people would feel they had seen a great film. It's just a good British film.\r\n\r\n**6.5\/10**","id":"5a1ecbaec3a3680b9a0818fc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a1ecbaec3a3680b9a0818fc","movie_id":352490}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The 19th century murder mysteries!**\r\n\r\nBased on the book of the same name.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**All for Norway.**\r\n\r\nIt is from the director of 'A Thousand Times Good Night'. This movie is like the Norwegian version of the Academy Awards winner 'The King's Speech'. Likewise, it was based on the real, that happened around the same timeline of the history, id est, the World War II. Except matching title, it was totally a different narrative. When the Germany was expecting a response to their demand, the Norway cabinet made most of the decisions and turned it down to remain independent country. But from all, a decision that made by the king is what this film was based on and how it changed the Norway's fate was depicted.\r\n\r\nThis film was sent to the 2017 Oscars, unfortunately it did not advance to the main event. They might have expected recognition similar to the British film. But I think both the films were good in their own way with the kind of story they told us that took place in the backdrop of the most terrible time of the recent human history. So having a similar title name justifies. It is a biopic, but the story was covered from different angles to reveal us what happened on the other side, including one of the young soldiers who fought in that war.\r\n\r\nThe story begins with the April 1940, while the Nazi army sailing towards Norway and after losing most of the cities to them, the people fled to safer places. That did not spare the Norwegian cabinet members, as well as the king Haakon VII and his family. In those hard times, he kept the nation united by respecting to how the government decided to deal with the situation.\r\n\r\nBut on one occasion, through a German diplomat with a one-time offer directly from Adolf Hitler leave the king to make the crucial decision for his nation and its people. That's the part of the film to define its title. So everything leads to that moment, how he reacts and what follows decides the Norway's fate to stand on what side of the ongoing war.\r\n\r\n> \"If I am the last card in the deck, so be it.\"\r\n\r\nIt's a well made film. Neither too violent nor avoided the war depictions to turn it more drama type. Everything had its share, including those war atmosphere for such budget was impressive. More like it was a running and chasing theme. But in the initial parts, there were too many timelines mentioned about what happened on when. Details like that are really good, though I felt it was too much to take on, especially for a foreign film.\r\n\r\nOnce the tale enters the mid section, looked all were in order and also got very interesting than before. In a cold country like Norway, in those situations you are like in a multifold trouble. I mean from the common man's perspective. An army is chasing you and harsh winter, surviving that is very challenging.\r\n\r\nAll the actors were great, but the king steals the show. If this was an American film that had taken place in America, then he would have won the Oscars. The fresh undertaking films on the World War II themes would never go fade away. So this is one of the best in that kind in the recent time. Except the opening, I did not have any trouble following it. Even the 130 minutes looked shortened. But I won't think everybody would feel the same way as I did. Like any WWII films, it is a must see, particularly to learn from the Norway's perspective of the war.\r\n\r\nBut this was depicted from the early stage of the war. And since it was majorly focused from the king's perspective, being a first king elected by his people, how he had faced it, following his crucial decision leads the way to the film's conclusion. If you are as war film fan, particularly the WWII, the actual best part begins henceforth which I'm hoping for a sequel to focus on. If you are not anticipating like the top WWII films you have seen, it can be picked for a watch. But anyway, I would recommend it.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58f15a169251415556005900","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58f15a169251415556005900","movie_id":396616}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is a movie that made me soooo happy that I decided to jump and fork out some money (way too much actually, I\u2019m on a bread and water diet now) for a nice OLED screen. This movie is a stunning visual adventure.\r\n\r\nThe two main characters are described as mercenary warriors but the terms thieves and rascals are probably better suited. They do know how to fight though and they get plenty of opportunity to prove it in the menu.\r\n\r\nThis is another one of those movies that live and die by the visuals. The plot is a basic enough adventure story with some additional twists, like mysterious meteorites and really really nasty monsters, thrown in. It is not bad but not exactly groundbreaking either. The same with the characters. They are perhaps not exactly flat but not really fantastic either. What makes the movie great is the action and the visuals. The story and the characters are just there to prop the visuals up and they are doing a perfectly adequate job of it.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts off in a rather dry and deserted landscape. The first scenes are actually rather dark and somewhat blurry. Luckily we rather quickly arrive at The Great Wall and the colors explode onto the screen. The Chinese army in their shining colored armor is really visually impressive.\r\n\r\nIt does not take very long for the action to start and apart from the usual arrow flinging, acrobatic stabbing and slashing the Chinese army starts to deploy their various contraptions for fighting the oncoming swarm of nasty creatures. I found all the things that they had cooked up quite fascinating and contributing nicely to the visuals and the fun.\r\n\r\nFor example, bungee jumping into a hord of jumping and snapping monsters wanting to take a (huge) bit of you armed with a spear. Is that cool or what? Heck, I want to do that. Well, without the monsters of course \u2026 and the bungee part. Okay, I confess, I was just watching the girls. Did I mention that all the bungee jumpers where hot chicks? And if any of you go all feminist and gender crap on me for those remarks you can shove it somewhere. If you think the bungee jumping stuff sounds like I was watching a silly comedy then trust me, it makes sense \u2026 kind of \u2026 in the context of this movie at least.\r\n\r\nThen there are rotating knifes sticking out of slits in the wall, fireball throwing catapults, various applications of gunpowder (that was after all why the two scoundrels where there in the first place) etc. etc. All accompanied by various acrobatics by the different combattants. Each scene was both cool action and a great symphony of elegance and colors.\r\n\r\nThe one part of the movie that I thought was a bit of a letdown was the parts where the emperor of China appeared. Why portray him as an arrogant, lazy thundering idiot? It is really not funny. The chain of events that he caused could really had been started in a more intelligent way without going down that overused and boring route.\r\n\r\nThe movie works itself forward to a nice final, desperate, fight to defeat the monster queen and her hord of baddies. It is a nice fight, as visually stunning as the rest of the movie, filled with lots of stunts of all kinds. The huge hords of beasts climbing, jumping and moving in big patterns on command from the queen was really cool.\r\n\r\nFor me this was one hour and forty minutes of much enjoyment.","id":"592eacbbc3a36860b900c10f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/592eacbbc3a36860b900c10f","movie_id":311324}
{"author":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","content":"A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com\r\n\r\nAnyone who is fortunate enough to share their life with a companion animal will undoubtedly get a kick out of the latest Illumination animated effort, \u201cThe Secret Life of Pets.\u201d The film soars when it focuses on animals interacting with their human guardians, with the canine and feline characters acting like real pets do (if my cats could talk, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d converse in  similar dialogue as portrayed onscreen). The first part of the movie is incredibly perceptive and clever, as is the last 10 minutes because it zeroes in on these very relationships (the opening and closing scenes of the movie are touching and have lots of heart). The problem comes in the middle when the story stops being about \u2018pets being pets.\u2019 Sadly, the majority of the film lags when it ventures into the dreaded animated movie territory of sheer stupidity.\r\n\r\nLoveable human Katie (Ellie Kemper) and her pup Max (Louis C.K.) are the best of friends. Max has several animal buddies that live in the same New York City high rise, including dogs, cats, birds and guinea pigs that stop by for daily visits. When Katie brings home Duke (Eric Stonestreet) from the animal shelter, Max devises a plan to get rid of him. Problem is, the two dogs find themselves lost in the big city and Max\u2019s would-be girlfriend Gidget (Jenny Slate) takes it upon herself to recruit other pets \u2014 including the elderly paralyzed basset hound Pops (Dana Carvey) and lonely falcon Tiberius (Albert Brooks) \u2014 to bring Max home. Along the way they find themselves at odds with the anarchist gang of \u201cflushed pets,\u201d a group of outspoken, anti-human animals led by former magician\u2019s bunny Snowball (Kevin Hart).\r\n\r\nThe voice acting runs the gamut from phenomenally good (Slate) to wince inducing (Hart). Slate is perfectly cast as Gidget, a poufy white spoiled little dog who eventually saves the day. She proves herself tenfold as a legitimate voiceover actor, and I hope to see her get more work in animation in the future. There\u2019s no denying that Hart is a super likeable actor, but his portrayal of Snowball the bunny is nothing more than repeated, strained yelling. His overall performance felt so labored and unnatural that listening to him onscreen actually made me uncomfortable. I will not hesitate to nominate Hart for a Razzie award for worst actor of the year because his voice work is that bad.\r\n\r\nIn the \u2018oh no, not again\u2019 category, there\u2019s plenty of dopey, brainless scenarios crammed in with a feeling that their sole existence is to appease young kids. We get yet another ridiculous animal driving a car stunt that we had to endure in this summer\u2019s nearly insufferable \u201cFinding Dory.\u201d In fact, in \u201cThe Secret Life of Pets\u201d we get not only a rabbit driving a van but also a lizard driving a bus and a pig driving a taxi.\r\n\r\nThe absurdity isn\u2019t the only problem: it\u2019s the repetition. The filmmakers must\u2019ve run out of good ideas and instead of moving the story forward, the audience gets the same monotony over and over and over again. I don\u2019t require my animated films to be completely based in reality (there\u2019s a particularly amusing Busby Berkeley inspired musical sequence in a sausage factory), but I do expect more originality than is delivered in this movie. The story at times takes a cynical approach in several places and some of the themes may be too much for sensitive kids (but the film provides a great starting point for a learning opportunity about pets and how animals shouldn\u2019t be viewed as disposable).\r\n\r\nAt least the animation is commendable, nice and colorful with lively, fully realized backgrounds. It\u2019s visually interesting enough for adults and fans of the genre but it\u2019s also vibrant and bustling enough to keep the kids interested. There\u2019s a lovely original score with a lighthearted, almost vintage sound. For me, the original music in this film is one of the standout elements.\r\n\r\nOverall I feel like this film takes a great idea and almost completely wastes the opportunity. This dull, unremarkable action caper is mostly moronic, but the imaginative peek behind the door at an animal\u2019s life when the humans are away is what\u2019s pure gold. I really wish the film had focused on that component. \u201cThe Secret Life of Pets\u201d is fine, but isn\u2019t destined for greatness.  \r\n\r\n**A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com**","id":"579cfaac9251411b36008316","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/579cfaac9251411b36008316","movie_id":328111}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The animal slavery.**\r\n\r\nI remember when this film was considered for the Oscars race. But some people were saying everything from the film was staged, instead of reality. I was like, had no idea what to say for such accusation since I haven't seen it yet. That's when I just had watched 'Brothers of the Wind', an Austrian documentary style feature film on the almost similar theme. So I had lots of expectation on this one, but now, after watching, in fact, while watching itself got frustrated by it and also very happy it did not make into the Oscars.\r\n\r\nI expected a Mongolian tale and yes, it was, but about a Kazakh family. Except the subtitle for the language spoken in the film, there was an English narration that voiced by Daisy Ridley in the background to explain the events properly. Because this is not an interview kind of documentary, but follows a couple of characters to their adventures. Yep, almost entire film did not look like a natural event, but pre-planned. It's a directional debut for the filmmaker. Definitely he has the capacity, but did not pick the right theme.\r\n\r\nIt's about a nomad family living in the nowhere of Mongolian grassland. The film opened with by saying the eagle training art is older than many historic events and its people the region has seen. So this little family has no son since the art is only passed on to them for generations. But the 13-year-old Aisholpan is interested to follow her father's footstep. That's where it all begins when she begins her training, following to have her own bird before competing in the biggest annual event in the nation.\r\n\r\nI don't know when the last time I rated a film this low, especially for a documentary film, probably this one is the first. I hated everything about the film since I'm a big animal fan. Lots of people who saw it appreciating without the brain. I wonder, would they all appreciated as well the abduction films like 'Taken from Me: The Tiffany Rubin Story', 'Abducted: The Carlina White Story' et cetera for not revealing the truth, but the crime committed in it, just like an eaglet was abducted in this.\r\n\r\nFor me it looked like about an animal abuse and animal slavery. Everything they did in the film were for pleasure, for the record, for honour and of course for the film-making. Since humans are civilised and at present in the modern world, we had ended many inhumane practices and this is one of them should be abolished as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIf a farmer uses a cattle (domestic animal) in his field means he's intended to feed the millions. So do you think snatching an eaglet (wild animal) and training it would do the same or any worth. In fact, it is to kill other animals, like the fox. If an eagle hunts a fox in the natural world, that's very natural, but doing it for human is a big imbalance. DON'T SUPPORT SUCH FILM GUYS. Hats off to the Academy Awards for snubbing it. The competition that showed in the film was good, but I really heart broken when they went on to prove even more than that in the third act.\r\n\r\nIt is not an inspiring film, but disgusting. If people\/animal fans go after on a fiction feature film like 'Wiener-Dog' for depicting animal(s) badly, why not this documentary film based on the live- real. Please don't show it to the little kids. This film joins the list of those a very few I hate badly such as 'Man vs. Wild'. I regret watching it, but I would have not known such bad practice is still exists in the 21st century. If you are an animal lover like me, stay away from it. Instead, I highly, strongly recommend a beautiful, inspiring, message film 'Brothers of the Wind'. So totally ignorable film.\r\n\r\n_01\/10_","id":"5935cca2c3a3685bf900328c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5935cca2c3a3685bf900328c","movie_id":376530}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Even if Thirunaal, which has been lying in the cans for some time, been released on time, it would have felt like a film that is 10 years too late. In fact, much of the film references that we find in this film is from 2005 or earlier. There is the hero, Blade, who calls himself an MR Radha fan, and has the great villain actor's name tattooed on his arm. The heroine's grandmother is a fan of SJ Suryah. She is introduced singing Sakkara Inikkira Sakkara, and repeatedly shown watching songs from the actor-director's films. Even the film's designated comedian, Ramadas is shown singing Shakalaka Baby. But these are all superficial, unlike the film's script, which is so old-fashioned and in obeisance to a movie-making formula (a kuthu song for the hero, a yearning song for the heroine, an item song and so on) that has now become stale. \r\n\r\nThe story revolves around Blade (Jiiva) who is a devoted underling to Naga (Sharath Lohitashwa), a gangster in Kumbakonam. Naga uses Sekaran (Joe Malloori), who runs a mill, as a front to add legitimacy to himself. Blade is in love with Sekaran's daughter Vidya (Nayanthara), a pre-KG teacher, who is also attracted towards him. When their affair comes to light, Sekaran has a fallout with Naga, who refuses to share his rightful share of money. Blade decides to help Sekaran and gets into the bad books of Naga. Meanwhile, the new cop in town ASP Pugazhendi (Gopinath) is waiting for a chance to take out Naga. \r\n\r\nDespite the formulaic plot, Thirunaal could have been an undemanding action entertainer, but the predictable scenes and leisurely narration keep letting it down. Ramnath also slips in the characterisation of Naga. He is introduced as someone to be feared (he had murdered a judge in the court premises), but after that he is mostly shown drinking or sleeping with women. Not since Jackie Shroff in Aaranya Kaandam have we seen a gangster driven mainly by his libido and alcohol. But there are some enjoyable bits \u2014 like the scenes featuring Ramadas, which, though silly, are amusing, the sub-plot involving Karunaas, who once again shows that he can be a good character artiste as well, and Mahesh Muthuswami's cinematography. \r\n\r\nThere are times when the director tries to nudge the film from becoming routine, especially in the second half once Blade reforms, and see signs of a darker story about violence begets violence but these efforts end up as half-hearted attempts because they are done only to deliver a message (the end card has the director preachifying about the need to love one another) than to narrate a story.","id":"57ba6bf3c3a36845d5005464","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ba6bf3c3a36845d5005464","movie_id":367756}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**In the circle of romance, deceive and defraud.**\r\n\r\nThose who are into the world cinema, particularly the Korean, knows Park Chan-wook very well. But if you don't, then you must. His films are definitely for the grown ups. Like everybody else, my admiration for his work has started a decade ago with the film 'Oldboy'. He had tried his luck in Hollywood with 'Stoker'. Despite a good entertainer, it was criticised. I love Park Chan-wook doing hundred masterpieces like this in Korea than trying to do one in Hollywood. His ability to turn the good book into a great flick was phenomenal. Here it goes another one. This was based on the British novel 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters. The story of an orphan woman who assigned to be a maid for a young rich woman who is living under the shadow of her uncle since she has no parents.\r\n\r\nYeah, I was expecting it, but I did not think it would be another masterpiece from the director. I even thought the ratings could be exaggerated, and the reviews from his die hard fans like Nolan's or QT's fans does. The timeline of the story was prior to Second World War Korea under the Japan rule. A perfect setting for such theme. The film opened like it is an average film. That's where all I got wrong. Or probably I judged it too soon. The storytelling was split into three parts and the first part was a bit mix of fun and like any film, introduction, the platform for the rest of the narration filled with surprises.\r\n\r\nThe young orphan Sook-hee was recruited by a thief who is planning to trick a young woman named Lady Hideko with all the wealth left behind by her parents. The only obstacle for him is her uncle, a guardian. So Sook-hee becomes close to her. More than she had expected, but their plan is working. Now they have to wait for the perfect moment for a perfect strike. When it arrives, an unexpected twist takes the tale to go back to where the film originally had started. But even further earlier and this time, the perspective of the story was from the Lady Hdeko.\r\n\r\n> \u275dSo even if my love for you leads me to ruin, don't pity me.\u275e\r\n\r\nSo, with that flashback, the second part begins. But literally it was a series of twist, that keep explaining us in another angle of the whole scenario I had witnessed in the previous part. Believe me, I have never seen such a long twist before. I was like unmoved for that entire segment. One of the best things I have ever in a film. The praise must go to the author, but the director and his actors as well did a fine job. There's a twist in every scene. So, for that one must pay close attention to the first part, despite slow moving story.\r\n\r\nBut above all, what I'm surprised was I did not know it was a lesbian film. Moreover, I did not think it could have bold scenes for such theme. Everything seemed perfect. I mean the erotic parts are sensual, but very artistic than unnecessary disturbance. Mainly because of stronger hold of the story narration than anything else. Even the pace picks up, like a crazy speed. Everything about the film you would learn in this section. All the secrets of the past revealed and what might comes are still kept under mysterious for the third and final part.\r\n\r\nThe most awaited, the conclusion part begins forth. For everything we saw so far, what might come after makes this film at its best. Just like the mid part, this is also full of twists. Because it will going to tell who ends where and what they get. Over two hours long film, and every frame are worth. The casting was best and so the setting of the 1930s Korea. Especially I must applaud the filmmaker's effort to turn the original setting from Europe to East Asia. It was great, but still now and then you can see the influence of the original source. I mean western culture, names, architect references which might have come from the book.\r\n\r\nNot just the lesbian or a love triangle story, but something like a circle of love with deceive and defraud. You can notice that in the film poster with four main characters. So when it has a multiple strings attached, you could expect surprises\/twists from each angle and it gives that more the convincingly. Put this into your must see list. This is not the first screen adaptation, but surely the best so far. Now we can expect a European or a Hollywood project in a big scale soon. Believe me the Oscars would pour in, because it's that kind of story. Highly recommended!\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"598cab2d9251411050000f5d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/598cab2d9251411050000f5d","movie_id":290098}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Another teen film trilogy, alien invasion theme on a roll.\r\n\r\nThe 80s teen films were different, (like the recent one 'Turbo Kid') especially those I watched when I was growing up in the late 90s and early 2000s. But now most of them are dystopian action-adventure-fantasy\/sci-fi themes, and obviously trilogies with high end graphics. I won't blame for that, the time has come for a change, the movies have technical qualities and they know how to render them, but the stories are terrible.\r\n\r\nTo me this was just an okay film. Felt like the action-adventure versions of 'The Host', but I loved that one, not this. I know it's a trilogy, so, more stories to come with more explanations, but the first film in a series is always important and it failed to impress me. This installment is all about a teen girl and her younger brother. After getting separated during the chaos of alien invasion, she goes to look for him and that's the film.\r\n\r\nThis might be the finer contents for a book, but for a movie, it is not that any special. I did not like the ending as well, felt like it was so stupid. Even some B films got better conclusion and stunt sequences. I feel bad for Chloe Moretz for taking up this project. She should do more action films like 'Kick-Ass'. I thought she would be the one who's going to replace Angelina Jolie. I can only hope for this series to get better in the follow up and end as a decent trilogy.\r\n\r\n5\/10","id":"571cd1bf925141342b000ac8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/571cd1bf925141342b000ac8","movie_id":299687}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Let\u2019s face facts\u2026it is inevitable that bad horror films and the new beginning of a movie season go together as systematically as skeleton bones to an unmarked grave. In either case, both scenarios are routinely realized and does not look to change at any time in the immediate future. Director William Brent Bell\u2019s (\u2018The Devil Inside\u2019) latest banal boofest **\u2018The Boy\u2019** is basically business as usual in terms of registering as a flaccid fright fable pitted in the dumping ground of released duds in the relatively new year. In essence, \u2018The Boy\u2019 is one stillborn terrorizing tyke born out of artificial and tired creepy conventions.\r\n\r\nSure, **The Boy** has its share of atmospheric chills and, as a production, it exudes a tension-filled anxiousness courtesy of the polished Gothic-induced vibes in gives off in its sinister-looking set designs. Nevertheless, **The Boy** fails to hold our attention where it truly counts in structured, solid storytelling and viable psychological thrills. Instead, Bell\u2019s pat knee-shaking narrative spends its time focusing on the familiar and flawed cliches involving meager melodramatic plot developments, recycled unnatural occurrences, the movie\u2019s harried heroine and her beleaguered backstory and annoying jolts and tiresome false jump starts in manufactured suspense. Of course, \u2018The Boy\u2019s panic playground for its horrific happenings takes place in a spacious and darkened manor populated by eccentric occupants and their devoted, demonic doll (hence, \u2018the boy\u2019 in question).\r\n\r\nAmerican Greta Evans (Lauren Cohan, \u2018The Walking Dead\u2019) travels across the pond to start over in the quaint English countryside as she leaves behind the fragments of a bad relationship back the States. Greta looks to pursue a job opportunity as a nanny for the Heelshire couple (Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle) at their expansive estate. The Heelshires need Greta for tending to their son Brahms\u2019s personal affairs. The unusual discovery from the newly hired nanny, however, is that Greta\u2019s task is to watch Brahms, a porcelain doll and NOT a human little boy. The Heelshires, out of touch with reality, treats the inanimate tot as a real son. Nevertheless, a job is a job so Greta minds the toy tyke when his \u2018parents\u2019 decide to go away for the holiday.\r\n\r\nThankfully, Greta learns about the histrionics pertaining to the Heelshires and Brahms through their deliveryman Malcolm (Rupert Evans). The Heelshires\u2019 disillusionment originated nearly two decades ago when the original and real-life Brahms died in a tragic fire. This, of course, reveals the questionable quirks about the boy\u2019s maturing parents\u2019 behavior and denial mode in substituting the doll conveniently for their belated and beloved son Brahms. Greta is determined to do right by the Heelshires and treat Brahms with the compassion they imaged her duties would entail. Importantly, Greta must make a good impression on the unassuming boy doll as the Heelshires warned that Brahms has had his troubles with past nannies.\r\n\r\nAt first Greta is pensive to react to Brahms and leaves him sitting idle in the corner. The Heelshires had given specific instructions on how to handle their precious \u201cboy\u201d as they have naturally spoiled him with amounts of attention.  Greta eventually finds the nerve to cater to Brahms\u2019s every caretaking whims and soon expresses a fondness for him in the process. So far, so good, right?\r\n\r\n**The Boy** certainly has its moments of shock value but the sluggish story feels lukewarm for the most part. Bell and screenwriter Stacey Manear cobble together a mysterious and moody horror thriller that is somewhat old-fashioned as it relies on tension-building tactics involving shadowy hallways, dim-light rooms and innuendo scares that suggest more meat to the bone when spotlighting everything from Brahms\u2019s aura of the present to the deceased Brahms\u2019s existence of the past. Both Bell and Manear arm **The Boy\u2019s** leading lady Cohan\/Greta with personal issues meant to carry over to the English landscape but the malaise she possesses comes off as matter-of-factly. And who really did not telegraph Greta\u2019s ex-main squeeze Cole showing up in England to claim his woman\u2019s heart only to meet some static concerning the clingy Brahms?\r\n\r\nIt is such a shame that The Boy could not capitalize any further on its strange and hypnotic inclinations. After all, this off-kilter narrative had the makings for a psychological masking of paranoia and possessiveness but never quite taps into the underscored hedonistic hold that exists between Greta and toyish tot Brahms or Brahms and the salacious spells of the manor where his dubious presence exists. Sadly, the slow burn effectiveness of The Boy stutters especially when revisiting the titillating genre of disturbing dolls and the mayhem they spin towards their hapless human counterparts (yeah, at least **Chucky** and **Magic\u2019s** dummy Fats had some genuine gory gumption to bring to the terrifying table).\r\n\r\nWhat is maddening about **The Boy** is the wasted potential of what perhaps could have been a whacked-out gem that exploited the surreal circumstances of mental and emotional loss and elusive reality. Instead, the intended suspense is as solitary and stiff as the bratty Brahms\u2019s compact body.\r\n\r\n**The Boy** (2016)\r\n\r\n1 hr. 37 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Lauren Cohan, Rupert Evans, Diana Hardcastle, James Russell, Jim Norton\r\n\r\nDirected by: William Brent Bell\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror\/Thriller\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng 2016","id":"56b839edc3a36806fc00e37a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56b839edc3a36806fc00e37a","movie_id":321258}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Who is this Sio Bohan!**\r\n\r\nThis is why I keep my eye on the Aussie films. It came a couple of years ago, but till now I did not get a chance to watch it. One of the best B movies I have seen. Totally under-noticed. A simple story, that's a 24 hour event, roaming around the city in a taxi. I mean tailing a girl as the title says. A perfect situation for a perfect comedy, thoroughly enjoyable film.\r\n\r\nI was this close to ignore it. Seeing its poster, anybody would make such decision. But I often take chances on such small films, and with a right time I just finished watching it. Then surprised by how wonderful it was. I just thought if it was a Hollywood film with stars like Kevin Hart in it, the fate of the film would have been different. So if you are reading this, simply put it into your watch list. I'm not expecting you all to love it, but surely most of you end up liking it.\r\n\r\nThe film opened with some gangsters business, a killing business. Soon the narration turned to a man who decided to tail his fiancee thinking she might be having an affair. Fortunately, he teams up with a taxi driver who is willing to help him, but of course it costs lots of money. Once their tailing job went wrong, everything changes, leading to them to no go zone and also chased by a psycho driver.\r\n\r\n> -xX] Do you have any idea of the shit storm you've just brought to your front door? [Xx-\r\n\r\nThe worst night of their lives, the two with a never give up attitude, they go certain length to accomplish the mission they have taken. Among all, I felt sorry for the character Stacey. All along I knew what would be the result of this story, but possibly a twist could have changed it, but did not. So Stacey was a good addition to spice up the story. Like her, many small roles had some nice impact on the narration. Started off well and ended on a high.\r\n\r\nIt all revolved around the name Sio Bohan. You might think it is a made up name with a misunderstanding, but the film defined differently as the story progressing. It was like the short animation 'The Chubbchubbs', too much hyped and then lived up to that par. Of course it all seems intentionally done, but a well done job by the writers to create those perfect circumstances, particularly being funny.\r\n\r\nSo much fun. Of course, cinematically it all possible, but the thing is the film opened by telling us it was inspired by a real event. I think what they meant is it was based on every suspicious boyfriends, grooms, husbands. Most of the events improvised for the film to get a better outcome. Yes, the filmmaker has done an awesome job. The production was very good also the performances, particularly all the main cast.\r\n\r\nDon't judge the film by it's poster as I almost did. Also, it is a much better film than the average rating you see on the internet. These two lead actors were awesome. It was a great combo, one of the best I've seen in the cinematic world. I hope they would return, possible a sequel to this one. A must watch film, especially by the people in their 20s and 30s.\r\n\r\n_8.5\/10_","id":"5a770f87c3a36859d3042cfb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a770f87c3a36859d3042cfb","movie_id":380681}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Waltons, Poronography, Tricky Dicky, Hitler, Equanimity, Bumble Bees ... And Stuff!\r\n\r\nThe Nice Guys is directed by Shane Black and Black co-writes the screenplay with Anthony Bagarozzi. It stars Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling and Angourie Rice. Music is by John Ottman and David Buckley and cinematography by Philippe Rousselot.\r\n\r\n1977 Los Angeles and a private detective and a muscle for hire enforcer wind up on the same case looking for a missing girl. Can opposites really attract? More importantly, can they survive not just the perils of a case that gets murkier the longer it goes on? But also each other?\r\n\r\nI don't care if Colonel Mustard did it in the study with a candlestick. I just wanna know who he did it with and get the pictures.\r\n\r\nHow wonderful to have had Shane Black back in his comfort zone and producing such a joyful buddy buddy neo-noir of considerable substance. It was eleven years since the superb Kiss Kiss Bang Bang had reminded us that Black had few peers when it came to blending high action macho twosomes who are also armed with sharp tongues to match, this was after all the guy who also penned Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout. The idea for The Nice Guys had sat in gestation for a number of years, finally it was unleashed to reward fans of his work and for those in sync with the style of film making he homages.\r\n\r\nMuch like his other buddy scriptings, we are in the company of two mismatched guys. Gosling's ex-cop Holland March is a bit goofy, afraid of the sight of blood and morally bankrupt. Crowe's muscle for hire Jackson Healy beats people up for money, but he's a stand-up guy, likes his pet fish, even has a hero streak. What binds them together is troubled family baggage, that they are both men in search of a better world, to be better men themselves, and thus Black - to give them a chance of life improvement - pitches them into the seamy underbelly of the L.A. pornography industry - with some corruption elsewhere thrown into the equation.\r\n\r\nAs a coupling March and Healy prove to be a riot. Crowe is menacing and funny with it, Gosling is affably flaky but charm personified, and thankfully both men have a knack for visual comedy (see Gosling's Lou Costello homage and Crowe's reaction to a henchman's act of fish murder). Crucially both actors can deliver killer lines, which is an absolute must for a Shane Black inspired production, for here there is never any let up, zingers are unbound. Then there is Rice (superb and actually the third lead in the play) as March's 13 year old daughter, she's got youthful zest and a killer matter of fact skill in reacting smartly to the two men currently dominating her life.\r\n\r\nThe L.A. of the 70s is expertly designed, all blink blink blinkity blink neon lighting, side-burns and disco music, dubious fashions and protest groups protesting about the most mundane of things. Then you got the pornography angle, the 70s a hot-bed (no pun intended) for the sex sells profiteers, the perfect setting for Black to trawl through it all in noir clobber. As a noir piece it has it all, femme fatales, thugs, conspiracies, voice overs and an array of colourfully odd characters (excitable and troubling henchmen, a porno Pinocchio, a young lad willing to flash the contents of his underpants for cash!). And of course there's mysteries to be solved and rocks to be upturned, all of which is played out in a whirl of stylish violence, situational comedy and fluid camera work.\r\n\r\nBlack kind of wants it all, to stay cool whilst having wry observations on the Americana of the era, and he enjoys going close to the knuckle when he can, which to some (not me) will come off as a shock value humour tactic just to ruffle feathers. It's also a minor itch that he sort of snatches from his previous works in search of reassurance - note for instance the similarities between the opening to Lethal Weapon and here with The Nice Guys. But itches be damned, so much fun and hidden dramatic depth on show here, a real treasure that makes you wish Black would stroll down neo-noir lane a bit more often. Don't believe me? Then may Richard Nixon come after you the next time you go for a swim in the pool! 9\/10","id":"5c3b5df9c3a3680866486fca","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c3b5df9c3a3680866486fca","movie_id":290250}
{"author":"in_the_crease","content":"As a shark fanatic (thanks, Jaws), I was excited to see The Shallows. When I first saw the trailer, I thought the concept--more 127 Hours than Jaws--was interesting: A single person, alone on a rock, trapped a mere 100 or so yards offshore, in shark-infested waters.\r\n\r\nMost shark movies follow the Jaws formula to a T: Shark attacks a bather, someone in position of authority decides something must be done and the beaches should be closed, someone of higher authority thwarts that attempt, more people die, our hero finally has to confront the monster. \r\n\r\nBut The Shallows produced a new and fresh take on the same old fish tale. The first half of the movie is similar to Open Water, relying on tension and little fanfare. Then, the shark explodes onto the screen for a few moments, and the movie suddenly becomes a high octane thriller. Basically, though the shark is the main antagonist of this story, all the scenes with the shark in them are much less interesting. I was more engaged with Blake Lively and that damn seagull. She was likable, and I bought into the survival story and was really rooting for her.\r\n\r\nThere were moments, when The Shallows relied on suspense, that the film become Hitchcockian in tone. We know the shark is out there, but we can't see him. The second we do, the suspense dies instantly. Parts of the movie were small and intimate, much like an independent film. And those were the strengths.\r\n\r\nBut it almost feels as if the director wanted to do a mash up of a simple suspenseful stalking movie, combined with elements of a survival movie. And again, all that worked for me.\r\n\r\nBut the sensationalism of the shark stuff was over the top in my opinion. It gave the movie an uneven feel. It was, at times, both a suspenseful stalker type movie with survivalism thrown in, and, then, seemingly out of nowhere, it became an over-the-top summer blockbuster type movie. \r\n\r\nIt gives it the look of a movie where director and producer didn't see eye to eye. It really seems like the shark action sequences were forced into the movie. They just didn't fit the overall tone. That's this movie's biggest downfall. Yes, the shark has to be there, yes he has to be dangerous. But the way it is presented through the film needs to fit the overall tone of the movie. At one point, the shark eats three people in the course of-- what?--an hour or so? So what was set up, was a small movie. An intimate movie. Something closer to The Blair Witch Project or Open Water, but what we got in the end, was something closer to Friday the 13th.\r\n\r\nThis movie could have been so much more, by being so much less. Excess is not always best. \r\n\r\nIn all fairness, The Shallows could have been much worse too. The things that did work, worked well--well enough that with some inventive direction, could have carried the film by themselves. But alas, the over the top violence and sensationalism trumped suspense and creative storytelling, which downgrades The Shallows from something special and unique, to just a \"good\" movie.\r\n\r\nThe locations were beautiful, and seeing them in 4K HD on a huge screen was quite impressive.","id":"58d2ad229251411fc5000d46","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58d2ad229251411fc5000d46","movie_id":332567}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**...Or the whole lie!**\r\n\r\nIt's a courtroom drama, about a murder mystery of a wealthy lawyer. It opened with a defense attorney voicing his 17 year old boy client suspected of murder of his own father. The boy had not spoken ever since the incident, so his lawyer does not know how to build the case and defend him. Seems no one know what happened except the boy, so proving he's an innocent becomes their tough nut to crack. How the trial ends and revealing truth comes in the later part.\r\n\r\nBoring. That's right, but not fully. The main reason was it is slow like a soulless. There's no one's performance to highlight. Only Gugu looked so good in her small part when everybody else was so dull. The Keanu Reeve's background narration was sometimes annoying. Totally unbelievable that Renee Zellweger was unrecognisable 6 years after returning to the cinema. I had to check online to confirm that she was it.\r\n\r\nThe idea for the story to develop was not that bad, but had some issues. The screenplay was flawed, though the initial part looked okay. Probably in the midway, you will figure it out all like I did, so the remaining is to know how it all happened. The detail at the end was too much. After letting us know the truth, they did not had to detail that part in the pictures which in my perspective ruined this film. That makes it a not so smart.\r\n\r\nAnd also about the parenting, particularly about the mother, the writers missed the point like any mother would defend her child for any cost. It's their nature, I mean most of them, so not this mother to blame for that, but the writers who only thought of the twist and to keep the suspense for as long as it goes. So this is an average film for intelligent people and even for the average people. Now you know who might love this flick than anybody else. Yet not bad for watching it once.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"5851a1a09251416f6301b0d3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5851a1a09251416f6301b0d3","movie_id":331583}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The Irish entry to the modern warfare.**\r\n\r\nThe Irish war film based on the book of the same name, which was originally inspired by the real battle of the Irish army during the UN's peacekeeping mission in the central Africa. Directed by a first timer and a well done job. I have seen lots of Irish film, but this was like I have never seen one before. Obviously, for being a war themed film about their first battle ever in the modern world. Between the start and the end, everything happened so quickly. You will love it if you like fast paced narration. Particularly if you are a war film fan, this is not to be missed.\r\n\r\nFirst of all it was not a World War II film. It was about the cold war, and its consequences, that's too far from the land those who are involved. It sets in the Congo basin in the early 60s, when the Irish army arrived representing the UN, the Katangese forces charged them from all the corner. With the limited resources, how these inexperienced men fought against the outnumbered opponents is what this film revealed. Truly a thrilling film is it.\r\n\r\nThe Non-Aligned Nations' forces like from India and Sweden for UN peacekeeping mission who were present around at the time, could not assist the Irish troop either from crossing an important bridge or through the air. These nearly 160 soldiers fought bravely, especially being away from home for the first time, which makes them in an unfavourable condition. This film covered everything from the Irish perspective, but the other way around like how the UN officials failed in their part was also focused on the side.\r\n\r\n> \"No plan survives contact with the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nIt was all about the natural resources found in this African region. So basically no one wants to back off, that means those from the cold war nations sent their mercenaries to fight out any obstacles. The five day battle that the Ireland never forgets, but initially it was not recognised by its own nation, until the recent time. Especially the UN who thought they had lost their reputation with this warfare which is really a shameful behavious for such organisation.\r\n\r\nIt was an English language film, despite an Irish film. That's not new to me, because most of the Irish film I have seen were direct English films. The actors were good, but no one was particularly focused, except the commandant. It opened with him preparing to leave country and ends with him returning. It was a non-stop war film. A series of attacks for the five days with a little gap between the assault to prepare for another. In reality, the Ireland's entry to the warfare was in an unfortunate circumstance, but their opponents underestimated them to use full force.\r\n\r\nIts a less story, more action film. The war sequences were awesomely made. Though it reminded me the recent Hollywood film '13 Hours'. Mark Strong was in a small part, though he looked different with a wig. I think it was one of the best war films in the recent time. It's not about the heroism, but inspires how they responded to the situation. They did everything they could and they would have achieved even bigger, only if they had everything they wanted. That makes it one of the rare film about the rare warfare where the world failed to acknowledge their effort. So a big thanks to the filmmakers for bringing it to the big screen. Now you should try it if you haven't seen it yet.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"585edc21c3a3681a620137ab","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/585edc21c3a3681a620137ab","movie_id":334517}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**When we talk about revenge, anybody is capable.**\r\n\r\nIt won four Goya Awards, the Spanish Academy Awards, including for the best film of the year. This is the directional debut for the actor of another same award winning film 'Marshland'. It is a revenge flick, but not your typical one. Probably one of the best I have seen, because of the uniqueness. There's nothing special in the film making, its just the screenplay how everything was developed keeping viewers and their guessing game in mind. So that means it does not have breathtaking twists and turns, but being simple and delivering the crucial parts with effectively makes it a perfect on its kind.\r\n\r\nAn interesting title, all the way the film stand for it. Looks knowing synopsis before the watch is a spoiler, but it's fine, because of similarity of the basic plot with other films. The presentation and the actors made all the difference here. The pre hype did not hold back the mid or the final acts, particularly for having such kind of characters in the lead. In fact, you will be surprised for how things going to turn out with merciless. And still you might feel it to carry on.\r\n\r\nThe film opened with a failed jewellery shop robbery. Not entirely a failed attempt, only in the later parts much detail about it revealed. One of the members who went to prison returns after serving 7 years. But his girlfriend is in confusion over another man in her life. Now these two men come face to face and while the truth comes out for their real confrontation. Following, the men hunt begins with us giving out all the necessary explanation. Then it concludes by revealing who ends where and what are the tasks accomplished.\r\n\r\n> \"I've got nothing to lose now. And I'll do what it takes get you to tell me.\"\r\n\r\nEven the 90 minutes looks very long due to the slow narration. But its not a boring film, well, not for me. Mainly because of not wasting time proceeding in the unrequired direction. The initial developments looked like a bit drag, only because you won't get the film plot straight away. So the film takes its time, as well as give time you to hop in. Once the purpose of the story commence, the entire scenario changes. Especially in those crucial scenes where bloods are shed, and the film peaks. Because of those parts created with perfect atmosphere the film shines. Might not be morally, but entertainment wise, what the audience wants.\r\n\r\nI was not expecting much from the film. I went for it without any interest, not even know how it faired in the domestic market and the awards it got, but in the end, I found it a better film in its kind from the recent time. What it lacked was the emotional appeal. Of course the whole focus was on the dark side of the film characters, except a little romance in the beginning. If the due was given to the sentiments, I think it would have been even better and attracted many more viewers.\r\n\r\nThe story was from one perspective. Not disclosing from the other side, except a brief visual to connect the events, is to avoid clich\u00e9. That was finely done job. Regarding the main characters, particularly the two men, you will see the changes like a flipped coin comparing them in the opening and the end. Overall a great first attempt for the director, paid off well after waiting for all these years to make it. The actors as well very impressive, I mean everybody, even the small roles. I think it better suits viewing for adults and matured teenagers. I don't know it is a remakeable product, but you should not miss this original. From runtime to performances, screen presentation and pace, it's in favour of those who are less patient in slow narration.

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"The western genre has gradually been making its way back into the cinematic fold. Recent dusty trail ditties such as David McKenzie's modern-day _Hell or High Water_ or Quentin Tarantino's _The Hateful Eight_ have proven to be recent saddle-tested gems that enthusiastically put cowpoke enthusiasts in movie theater seats. Furthermore, what would Hollywood do if it did not predictably invite yet another remake of a classic film into the moviegoers' mindset? Hence, director Antoine Fuqua takes a challenging stab at generating interest in his latest workman-like western shoot 'em up in the millennium-made version of **The Magnificent Seven**. \r\n\r\nNaturally, Fuqua's chaotic and calculating gun-toting actioner is an updated remake of director John Sturges's 1960 film that starred late iconic box office big stars such as Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and Eli Wallach. Of course in return Sturges's borrowed his artistic gun-for-hire gumption from legendary Japanese auteur Akiro Kurosawa's vintage and influential _Seven Samurai_. Fuqua, whose gritty urban police drama _Training Day_ secured a Best Actor Oscar for his **The Magnificent Seven** leading man in two-time Academy Award winner Denzel Washington, takes on the retelling of his particular _Seven_ with feisty fury. One would not necessary anoint Fuqua's outlaw tale as a superior successor to Sturges's borrowed blueprint from Kurosawa. However, Fuqua's array of blazing bullets from his bunch of rag tag bad boys has its own distinctive sense of decorative dare and destruction that feels authentic.\r\n\r\nScreenwriters Nic Pizzolatto (\"True Detective\")and Richard Wenk deliver an unapologetic script that calls for high body counts, old-fashioned showdowns and a wild west waywardness that swaggers courtesy of Fuqua's corrosive crew. The popcorn entertainment in **The Magnificent Seven** is strictly in guilty pleasure territory so there is no need to tighten up your holsters for all you little buckaroos that are eager to wallow in Fuqua's cutthroat corral of gunslingers.   \r\n\r\nMustached bounty hunter Sam Chisolm (Washington) is the all-dressed-in-black avenger whose mission is to provide protection for the town of Rose Creek, New Mexico. In his ambitious bid to save the jeopardized Rose Creek he must assembled a group of skilled gunmen able to stand up to the diabolical powers-that-be that look to foster the on-going havoc that prevails. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, Rose Creek is under the dastardly control of the diabolical Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard) that rules the town with an iron fist. The opening scene demonstrates how nefarious Bogue is at heart because he has no qualms about seizing land from its vulnerable owners or quieting down his critics with intimidating force. Basically, Bogue and his hideous henchmen are not to be reckoned with at all--unless you are willing to match wicked-minded wits with the raw and rough Chisolm and his gun-wielding renegades.\r\n\r\nRose Creek resident Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett, \"Music in Lyrics\", \"The Girl on the Train\") steps up to the plate in her effort to confront the nasty Bogue the only best way she knows how--hiring the capable and crafty collection of the Seven to contain this intimidating menace.\r\n\r\nJoining Chisolm in his bloody quest to rescue Rose Creek from Bogue's disturbing clutches are explosives expert gambler Josh Farraday (Chris Pratt), and conflicted sharpshooter Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke reuniting with his \"Training Day\" director and co-star Fuqua and Washington). The rest of the tag-a-longs include the outlandishly bearded Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio from TV's \"Law & Order: Criminal Intent\"), Billy Rocks (Byung-hun Lee), Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) and Red Harvest (Martin Seinsmeier). Together, the anti-heroes known as the Magnificent Seven hope to meet the expectations of Emma's (and the town's) cause and eradicate the villainous Bogue by any means necessary.    \r\n\r\n**The Magnificent Seven** certainly does not have any pretensions about posing as a conscious-minded, revisionist western as it definitely does not have the prolific pedigree such as Clint Eastwood's _Unforgiven_ for instance. Nevertheless, the film does have a devilish impishness as its main function is to echo an exaggerated rustic feel to its throwback acknowledgement when westerns of yesteryear were just plain frivolous and furious without any particular rhyme or reason.\r\n\r\nSure, the characters have really no inside depth beyond their taste for roughshod recklessness and wild tumbleweed theatrics. This is not necessarily a bad thing to consider in Fuqua's **The Magnificent Seven** because the name of the game is serving up an escapist need for its giddy-up rush for the senses. Indeed, Washington and company will not make anybody forget the aforementioned Brynner and his squad from nearly six decades ago. Still, this particular _Seven_ has its own kind of favorable punch to savor. \r\n\r\nThe notable names in _Seven_ do rise to the occasion within the context of this otherwise basic story of the wannabe borderline good guys versus the bombastic bad guys. Washington's Chisolm is solidly smooth as charismatic as the leader of the pack. Pratt's Farraday is a charming hoot as the roguish gambling cad. Hawke's Goodnight does a decent job portraying the talented gun handler simply trying to get his groove back due to his shaken confidence from a prior incident (yes, the catchy movie moniker of Goodnight Robicheaux is a keeper to say the least). And D'Onofrio's amusing Horne is deliciously irreverent. The always adventurous Sarsgaard comes to life as the vile wonder whose presence inspires the Seven to tap into vengeance mode. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the roundup it is quite clear that **The Magnificent Seven** wants to lasso its penchant for resembling a showy Hollywood western even if it is at the expense of lifting its rowdy roots from the likes of its highly regarded predecessors from golden cinema's treasured past.    \r\n\r\n**The Magnificent Seven** (2016)\r\n\r\nSony Pictures\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 12 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Peter Sarsgaard, Haley Bennett, Vincent D'Onofrio, Byung-hun Lee, Maunel Garcia Rulfo, Martin Sensmeier\r\n\r\nDirected by: Antoine Fuqua\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Western\/Drama\/Action and Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: ** 1\/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016","id":"57e8d5e9c3a3687c180059c9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57e8d5e9c3a3687c180059c9","movie_id":333484}

I mean no sweet, but very effective theme. There are lots of things you won't understand, even the film does not explain them for us. But if you sit back and think about them after you have watched it, you would get many perspectives, like about the corpse, and what happened at the end. I could have revealed mine in here, but it would only spoil your watch if you are yet to see it. Overall, there's nothing serious you are going to miss any details.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Man always needs a purpose.**\r\n\r\nSince the Hollywood upgraded to the 3D animation, the rest of the world took over and given some incredible films in the last one and half decades. The Japanese animes are undoubtedly the best, but the European animation, particularly the 2D animation started to boom in the recent times with special mention goes to Tomm Moore. So basically I might miss some Hollywood animations, right now, but I'm very watchful over this kind of films. That's how I watched it, but anyway I would have seen it.\r\n\r\nThis is the director's first feature animation film, but he was known for his awesome short animations which one of them won him an Oscar. It was jointly produced by three countries, including Japan's Studio Ghibli. It's their first non-Japanese production and a great beginning and timing to expand the production in other continents. Especially after their legend, Hayao Miyazaki retired from the filmmaking.\r\n\r\nThe film was short like the 80 minute stretch without a single word spoken in its entire narration. There's no even sign language used, everything's actions and reactions. So you would find empty in the film's cast section which is kind of weird. I mean there are characters in the film, but all were imaginations without names and what year it takes place, where with so many questions like that. Basically to say, a film without the cast, but the crew members managed to give the best to the viewers to get it without any struggle.\r\n\r\nOne thing is for sure, that the film is very enjoyable. It is a fantasy film, so whatever you see, you have to accept it. Because that's how things happen in a theme like this, all fictional. Though, the first thing you have to keep in your mind is not the entire film was an hallucination event. There are some dreamy events and that's fine since the film character is coping with loneliness.\r\n\r\nA man who had lost at sea, wakes up in a small island. It's a life supporting land mass with fresh water and fruits, but he also has to put some effort for fishing. His notion is to leave the island as soon as possible to go back to where he had come from, the civilised world. In his every attempt to sail with a raft he had made using bamboos, fails to cross after a certain stretch of the island coast. He later comes to know what stopped him and with an anger reaction he commits a mistake. So now he has to come out of the guilt and to do that he chooses what seems the right.\r\n\r\nIt was like a simple story without any meaning about everything that's shown in it. So in my entire watch I thought the same and said it was an okay film with great animation. But the ending changed my stance. That twist, I don't think everybody would understand. But one thing I want to make sure if you yet to see it, that it was about the purpose. The man always looks for a reason to do things and even to live or die. That's where the red turtle comes in.\r\n\r\nAlthough my biggest question is, is this film a follow-up or in any way connected to the director's previous short animation 'Father and Daughter'? Because it seems the man who got lost in the sea is from that short film. But it never revealed the reason why he was stopped by whomever from return home. Also, both the conclusions syncs. It's just a my theory, so only the director can explain that.\r\n\r\nI'm very sure this film is in the Oscars race. If it fails to make, then its not my prediction was wrong, but the Academy Awards people got it all wrong. I'm also sure it won't win as 3D animation dominated world, particularly 'Zootopia' 'Finding Dory' and 'Moana' are taking the first three frontrunner spots. Except the technical differences, only the grown ups can say this one has a better and meaningful story. It is very similar to 'Ponyo', but a grown-up's version. Anyway, it is a must see film, especially the adults and in particular those who always think animation is for children. If they see it, they might change their mind. Highly recommended!\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"585edc98c3a3681a62013810","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/585edc98c3a3681a62013810","movie_id":337703}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The Huntsman and his romance caught between the two evil sisters.**\r\n\r\nThis is a sequel as well as a prequel to the 2012 film 'Snow White and Huntsman'. It opened with the earlier story where and how the Huntsman grew up, especially the journey of his innocent childhood to a great fighter that covers in the first half an hour. And then it skips for about 7 years where the original film takes place, but immediately begins where it had ended in the first half, as well as the first film. Actually, not a bad film as I have heard of it, but same as the previous film that stands just above the average and slightly loses some decibel rating.\r\n\r\nThe actors were good though. Emily Blunt, Jessica Chastain and Charlize Theron, wow, super hot women, but sadly they are in fairytale costume. Their performances were great, but the characters, particularly the two sisters resemble the 'Frozen's Anna and Elsa. You can feel how desperate was the filmmakers to avoid such comparisons by viewers, so they developed the story very far from any string attached to that famous animation. In the end these things are unavoidable, since the story is not fresh enough to claim its independent status.\r\n\r\nChris Hemsworth was okay, I hope he won't return for the third film. It is a decent watch, and I think it will remain as an duology, for right now it seems a good idea. The problem is it was being made a dark-fantasy to appeal the grown ups, particularly men. But it should have been a children's film where adults too can enjoy like the Disney's 'Maleficent'. Except the opening the rest of the story seemed very ordinary. Though the action sequences were enjoyable and so the film with a low expectation, or the purpose of the watch is the timepass.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"57ed838fc3a3686cfa0002a3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ed838fc3a3686cfa0002a3","movie_id":290595}

{"author":"Key-Si","content":"Watching \"The Wailing\" is quite an undertaking. With a runtime of almost 3 hours this Korean Horror-Triller is a shear beast. Unfortunately I feel like pretty much more than half the runtime should have been cut. \"The Wailing\" circles around in a seemingly endless \"who done it\" or, to be more precise, \"who is it\" and even though the acting of our lead Do-won Kwak was not too bad, the dialogues bothered me constantly. I find myself repeating this for about every Asian movie and I assume it must be a cultural thing. I mostly find the talk so generic and pointless, that you could reduce some movies to 5-10 important lines and let them be quiet for the entire rest of the runtime. And this movie is no different. The best acting performance was delivered by Jun Kunimura, who not only presented a great play with mimic, but also refused to talk much (I bet he knew I would appreciate that). The cinematography was pretty good and I liked the realistic appearing gore effects. Not so much on the \"possessed zombies\" but therefore on the crime scenes and such. With that many pro's and con's \"The Wailing\" ends up somewhere in the middle and can therefore be labeled average.","id":"5b2727dc9251410d4c018660","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b2727dc9251410d4c018660","movie_id":293670}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> What makes the birds to get so angry?\r\n\r\nVideo games to films is an old topic to discuss it now, but the fans from the original source are always in the high hope when they hear news like this. Because 'Angry Birds' game is one of the mainstream games which is originally from Finland. Despite the mixed reviews, it is a box office success and definitely a sequel on the card. After lots of animal themed films, now in the line of underrated animation 'Free Birds', another the bird's quest begins with this.\r\n\r\nI'm not much into this game, but I was looking forward to the film since it was first announced. Now I'm here after the watch and I think is a good film, but better suitable for children than the adults. That did not stop me from enjoying it. The target audience might be the kids with those cute film characters, as well as the story, but there are some dialogues that are written keeping in mind the grownups. Anyway, most of the adults won't feel they are in a wrong cinema hall if they regularly watch animation films, especially in the present world animations are accepted as for all ages.\r\n\r\nSo this is the story about the Red, an orphan bird lives in a small house on the sea shore. The kids from the island loves him, but the adults stay away from him for his bad anger attitude. One day a ship of pigs arrives on the bird's island offering friendship, but their intention was later known once the valuables things were stolen from them. So the revenge and rescue operation begins which stretched with full of action-adventure in the remaining parts.\r\n\r\nFilled with lots of fun moments, it was much better than I expected. Sometimes it looked cute, but you know our angry bird, Red with his companions makes it not to stay that way. Peter Dinklage as Might Eagle was one of the highlights of the film and the rest of the cast did well too. It is definitely a great directional debute for the two experienced animators. Makes a bit sad how the film was received, but after seeing it myself I think its fine. Different people have different opinion. In my perspective, it was a good watch so I surely suggest it, especially for animation fans and obviously children.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"57b501cc9251410a71002850","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57b501cc9251410a71002850","movie_id":153518}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Somewhat it was everything. Inspiring, emotional, fun, though not for everyone!**\r\n\r\nIf Vijay Sethupathy is what makes me to watch the Kollywood films, then Joseph Vijay stands on the other side. No offense to his fans, I was watching his films opening day, opening show (not first show), but I got tired of his same old tricks in his every new film. Anyway, this film is not any good for the international audience, but it's a different scenario for people in domestic market. This is a very good masala film. A fine mix of action, comedy, romance, sentiments and of course musical beats.\r\n\r\nI think it had potential if it was made like a normal film to the international standards, but you can't expect something like that particularly in Vijay's film. The film story had a good intention like delivering a series of messages to the society, but the execution was completely fake with too much shouting and loud noise. Irrelevant to the reality and there's no politeness while revealing what it wanted to tell the viewers. Like fighting crime and criminals are good, but it was shown in a bad way, such as public disturbances, including damaging roadside stalls and vehicles who are mostly poor people. This is why littering is a very serious concern in India. Films like this should stop promoting that.\r\n\r\nI liked the part of the story that depicted the Delhi rape incident, but I totally got annoyed when it was overshadowed by heroism. The majority of the comedies were in Tamil slang and was targeted for those with the knowledge of its films. The English subtitle translation was not very good at all. Even the overall film plot was drafted with the same old formula which is an honest cop versus a corrupt politician and involving a revenge act with a flashback.\r\n\r\nLike always, I hated the music videos. The story takes place on one side and it was frequently interrupted by unsynchronised video albums. It was completely out of proportion. If you skip them, the film is actually 3 minutes short which is a good thing. The casting was good, particularly the film will be remembered for Nainika's big screen debut as a child artist, as well as Vijay's own daughter at the end. So many people are eager for a sequel where he can work with his own daughter.\r\n\r\nIf you are an Indian, then it would be a good watch. If you are from the south, you might love it. But for the international viewers, I must warn that if you know the actor and the director very well, then you would know what to expect, other than than choose it carefully. Only in India this thing happens, that it is rated U which is equivalent to PG, but it is actually an NC17 for violence.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"5835de8d9251416a3101ab23","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5835de8d9251416a3101ab23","movie_id":370076}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> About trusting a prankster for a risky job.\r\n\r\nIt was so much better than I anticipated, but the end ruined my party. It was the right time I saw it, because I haven't seen any heist films recently. It was not like any genuine heist theme, but still I kind of enjoyed it for being a slightly different, especially the first two acts. It is about the two cops, actually they're part of the police department, but from a different division. When they discover a huge illegal money belonging to a cartel gang after going through the police file, they plan to hit it and disappear forever. But as the title indicates, the trust is what lacks between them. In the third act, the pace picks up rapidly and brings a twist in the tale before the credits begin to roll.\r\n\r\nTwo wonderful main characters with a decent story, but I don't know about the cast. I kind of felt there was a vast age gap between them, like an old man teaming up with a teenager. Obviously worst chemistry, but that's the point, if you understand the title very well. Both the characters were completely opposite, like one was a very confident person, but a prankster and the other guy were a hopeless, but serious about everything. Just like a wolf and a sheep together planning to rob a farmer. When it was going good, like I said the conclusion spoilt the overall product.

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Well, the young adult movie adaptation genre continues to percolate despite the farewell sentiments as demonstrated by hugely popular products meant to entice the teen scene such as the Twilight, Divergent, Maze Runner and The Hunger Games film series. Sure, why not tamper with a proven formula that guarantees all the right ingredients to tap into the angst-ridden world of young feminine empowerment set against a background of apocalyptic strife and undefined self-discovery? In director J Blakeson\u2019s drippy and derivative dystopian drama The 5th Wave we are introduced to another similar sci-fi serving of a disillusioned heroine out to reflect some consciousness in a boundary of uncertainly and destructive despair. Sadly, The 5th Wave is nothing more than a stillborn alien invasion soap opera that wants to spout off its Hunger Games-esque copycat coating but fails to delve into anything remotely original or bitingly daring.\r\n\r\nThe 5th Wave is the literary brainchild of novelist Rick Yancey\u2019s printed pages as he brings to life the trials and tribulations of tenacious teen tart Cassie Sullivan (Chloe Grace Moretz from \u201cKick-Ass\u201d), a timid tyke-turned-guerilla warfare gal whose guts and gumption to find and protect her little brother during a full-scale alien invasion of the planet is put forth in flimsy animated fashion. Actually the young actress Moretz, a veteran of a few films already lodged under her belt, has quite a feisty presence on screen and more than holds her own as the \u201cprincess of panic\u201d in the generic doomsday drama that really brings nothing to the tension-filled table.\r\n\r\nThe material that Moretz is obligated to bring to life feels rather strained and stilted because the YA creative cloud hovers over the proceedings in a predictable, syrupy manner. The 5th Wave lacks the intensity and philosophical fiber that The Hunger Games effortlessly put forth in imaginable conception. Plus, the energy and bombastic buzz of Hunger Games imitator Divergent does not seem to be part of The 5th Wave\u2019s anemic pulse. Incredibly, Blakeson\u2019s lean and lacking futuristic feminine fable incorporates a cinematic stew of film flavors that heavily echoes such solid blueprints as everything from Red Dawn and Independence Day to the WOW-factor of blockbusters in Jurassic Park and Starship Troopers. The sad part is that even with the borrowing of these cinematic ideas The 5th Wave still registers as a limp alien invasion actioner without much punch or promise. The film is well-intentioned in its YA-oriented gravitas but will soon be dismissed as another Hunger Games wannabe going through the motions.\r\n\r\nAs with the inspired makeup that is at the root of these conventional YA melodramas, The 5th Wave offers its share of youth-minded dire and doom, romantic exploration and the element of military-style redemption and rebellion. As Moretz\u2019s Callie is called into action among the devastating ruins she is determined to reunite with her last surviving  relative Sam (Zackary Arthur). Soon, this mild-mannered schoolgirl has to whip into shape and protect the interests of her deteriorating community as the hard-nosed alien invaders look to wreak havoc and take over the world\u2013or at least Callie\u2019s part of the world that has her fellow citizens shocked and stunned.\r\n\r\nPoor Cassie\u2026in addition to her mind focusing on locating her sibling, revving up for her showdown with the alien intruders and shaking of her vulnerabilities she is caught in a love triangle that tests her limits. Should Cassie fall for the dashing and daring Ben (Nick Robinson, \u201cJurassic World\u201d), a fellow classmate about to enroll into the junior start-up army looking to combat the unwelcomed visitors or should her confused heart throb for backwoods bad boy Evan Walker (Alex Roe)? Also, how would Cassie feel if she discovers that her hunk-in-training may have a thing for the ravaging rough-around-the-edges recruit Ringer (Maika Monroe). Ah, love among the languishing landscape!\r\n\r\nIt is definitely the consensus that The 5th Wave may not be included in the Mount Rushmore of youth-friendly dystopias merely because it is nothing more than a shadowy reminiscence of the more defining, developed and decisive babes-in-the-woods boisterous actions. Even when not just comparing The 5th Wave to its better conceived contemporaries it dos not feel comfortable in its own mediocrity when standing on its own two feet. It is compelling only for its goal in pushing the conveyor belt of sci-fi YA duds to uphold Hollywood\u2019s attempt to kidnap the psyche of young moviegoers looking for the next big screen teen scene sensation to boost box office receipts.\r\n\r\nSorry but there is no need to take out the sci-fi surfing board for the tepid trappings of The 5th Wave. \r\n\r\nThe 5th Wave (2016)\r\n\r\nSony Pictures Entertainment\/Columbia Pictures\r\n\r\n1 hr 53 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Chloe Grace Moretz, Nick Robinson, Alex Roe, Liev Schreiber, Maria Bello, Ron Livingston, Maika Monroe, Maggie Siff, and Zackary Arthur\r\n\r\nDirected by: J Blakeson\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction\/Teen Fantasy\/Drama\/Alien Invasion Thriller\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng 2016","id":"56a6cb0392514129fe001383","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56a6cb0392514129fe001383","movie_id":299687}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The longest 10 minutes of the princess' life!**\r\n\r\nThe story that sets in the 1961, but most of the film was a flashback narration that takes us to the 30 years earlier, in the 30s. This is a biographical film of the last Korean princess to be crowned. Though the film clearly briefs her power struggle over the foreign power. The entire tale was told from her perspective as she saw everything. So, it was real, but historical facts were compromised in places with additional characters or events that more cinematised. That's what the film declared at the opening. To be honest, any biopic would be the same. You can't expect a perfect, a flawless portrayal of a person or the event. Since films are just a recreation to spread the truth, whether they are good, bad or nothing important.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of Japanese dialogue as the story required it. I have seen other Korean historical films, especially about freedom fight. In this too, you could see that phase of the history, but in a different angle. The 2 hour long film, most of it was drama, but there are some action sequences too. A little love story, but overwhelmed by the princess' own struggle throughout her adult life. Probably one of most misunderstood person for her actions by her own people. Because they have seen only from their own eyes, not the truth, what their princess had gone through. Sooner or later, the truth always comes out, and that's where the narration draws its curtain.\r\n\r\nWhile the Korean is being under the rule of Japan, the 13 year old princess, Deokhye witnesses her father's assassination for his objection over some matter brought by the Japanese officials. Now the grownup princess was forced to go to Japan for her higher studies. But she pledges to return home to her mother and people. That's not what happens, she sees many Koreans trapped in there as the slave workers. Her fight for their freedom becomes her next target, though things take twists and turns, leaving her in the tight spot. The remaining story is to reveal her rest of the life after a long struggle.\r\n\r\n> \u275dNever give up until the end. Spring will come again to fields stolen from us.\u275e\r\n\r\nUsually a good Korean film will be recognised well in the international stage. Especially for like this, having a wonderful cast and crew, I did not expect the under-notice. As I have seen it, definitely the film deserves more appreciation. Well, I did not like the film either in the beginning. I thought it was too slow, too long and the events were uninteresting. But the real value of the film came in the later part. Yes, the narration picked up the speed with all the sudden developments. Basically what we would call such film is: a slow start, but concluded strongly. So you have to wait till the end to come to any judgement.\r\n\r\nOne thing I did not mention so far was the emotions. If I'm saying I liked it, that's mainly because of the sentiments. I did not anticipate that, it was like came from nowhere. As I always say, emotions are a big part of Korean films. In that, sometimes I hated for overusing it, though not in this case. Usually a film inspired by real do have such things strongly. The film did not cover any war events, except orally declaring the details for the viewers to get everything happening around.\r\n\r\nSon Ye-jin is the most familiar face from the Korean films and as usual her execution was amazing in this. She was the right choice to play the title role, along with the director that seems he's back in the action with this like his earlier films. Its nothing lesser than any kings and queens films you had seen from the west. Since it was about a princess, her movements were strictly restricted within the walls. Which was one the reason she had nothing big to accomplish than being a puppet, except when she stepped into the Japan. Her Japan visit changed her approach, despite it was done against her will. So there are many things about the princess that you could learn through this film. Definitely a must see if you like biopics and history.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59b1ecb0c3a3682c2208b69d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59b1ecb0c3a3682c2208b69d","movie_id":408360}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> When the balance was broken between the two worlds!\r\n\r\nConsidering this filmmaker from the B movies, this is not a bad one, probably it may remain as his best work for sometime. Definitely not a great horror film either, yet the rating it has received is a very low. The title says everything, but there are other things in the narration to get engaged with. Obviously a bit slow, and patches between the scenes should have been developed better. But overall film was slightly above average if you welcome a blend between two different cultures and themes.\r\n\r\nIt was the tale of a western couple who settled in Mumbai, but the film opens with their plan to start a family and later it moves to six years forward. Now they're grieving with their son's death, especially the mother with a guilty feeling. Then she comes to know a place to make a contact her dead son and to say proper goodbye. But what follows is the supernatural chaos in the house and finding a way to fix everything is the remaining film to reveal.\r\n\r\nThe concept was really wonderful, but the film was designed to be not scary or maybe those parts were just a clich\u00e9. You know those dead guys in the make-ups try to scare you stuffs. The story wise, it is refreshing, but should have been added more to it to make further interesting. It was just a 90 minute film, yet feel somewhat lengthy. Actors were decent, the locations were okay, the production was much better and the overall film was acceptable kind.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A tale of imbalance between love and grief.**\r\n\r\nThe film was based on the Australian novel of the same name. It was a recent book, but a period drama about a World War I veteran who just returned home. So I feel this film was made too soon. Because it seems so classic, only if we had given some time to pick up its popularity. I mean the literature version which at least needed a decade of freedom before heading to the big screen. You know, this same kind of tales from the past is what now we consider epic, which looks even better in the cinema. Anyway, this film was good, but the future adaptations will be much more effective for its viewers.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'The Place Beyond the Pines' who also wrote for the screen. The title gives a brief insight of what kind of a tale it is. But the film was even deeper and darker with emotionally strong. The island where it takes place reminded me 'Song of the Sea', though it is not a fantasy film. If you love views, nature, particularly seaside, this film will suit you.\r\n\r\nBesides, the story was much stronger, so the backgrounds will fade away when all your focus fall on its narration. For me the location was the first in the film, the hundred year old setting, away from normal society was the most impressive. It helped to narrate this wonderful drama which contained the message of moral imbalance.\r\n\r\nTom Sherbourne, a World War I hero who relieved from the duty returns home and becomes a lighthouse keeper in an isolated island on the west coast of Australia. He marries a woman whom he has instantly fallen in love. Now they are living far from the human world. A couple of tragedy strikes in their life following one another.\r\n\r\nBefore coming out of that trauma, they find a baby on a lifeboat that washed up on their island and decides to adopt her. But after some times when they return to the mainland, they come to realise what they're doing is not legally nor morally correct. From onwards how it affects their each others trust, how far it all goes and how the story ends was told in the remaining parts.\r\n\r\n> \u275dYou only have to forgive once. To resent, you have to do it all day, every day.\u275e\r\n\r\nDespite the book was modern, the storytelling was so vintage. I'm talking about the way the plot and characters developed, including how it concludes. For the present generation, if you are familiar with a few similar works from the past, then you would predict this film. I mean not the entire film, but some scenes are at its initial stage can be foreseen. Because sometimes, some developments are called coincidence, but when you have plenty of them, that is called very intentional. That was the only negative of this film. By avoiding them the tale would not be possible. In other way, it could have had stretched even further which are unnecessary details.\r\n\r\nI did not care the clich\u00e9s. For me it was a fine drama. The performances were magnificent. It looked to me an Oscar worthy, from both Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander. Even Rachel Weisz was for the supporting role. So tick marks for cast and locations, also the screenplay and score. But the sad part is the film was not received very well, especially by the jackass film critics.\r\n\r\nIt's not the same case with regular movie goers, particular I think the older and matured people would like it better. But it's not another 'Pride and Prejudice' from the family audience perspective. The events of the film and the outcome can be wrongly judged. Most importantly, it sets in the same world as ours, so everything is the near fact based. So the right and wrongs are inside the film, but not applicable for the filmmaking which I think a well done job.\r\n\r\nThe post climax scene, the one that comes before the end credit was very good. For this kind of tale, that kind of outro sets a final tone. Despite not an inspiring storyline, all the portrayal in the film was so poetic. Mainly because of slow narration with high influence of sentiments and most of the occasions being dialogueless. The length was not an issue if you like period dramas. Anyway, it was engaging theme, there's always something keeps happening. So I think this is one of the under-rated films of the year. It deserves much better recognition. If you haven't watched it yet, I recommend it and highly if you are 30+.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"58d809b89251411fdc05e1c6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58d809b89251411fdc05e1c6","movie_id":283552}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Decent visuals, but has no fresh vision.**\r\n\r\nI always thought what they call the great wall of China is the symbol of the Chinese scary-ism against the mighty Mongolians in the ancient time. So when I first saw this trailer, I shocked and then I said: what the heck. You can't just hide the truth and recreate whatever new thing you want. But That's how the China and Chinese evolved for thousands of years. Like it could be martial arts, rice, noodles or the dragon, all of them came from outside. Then when I saw the film, the first scene itself cleared my doubt. It states the film was based on the legend. I thought it was a good start after the misleading promos.\r\n\r\nSo this is China's effort to make a product at home par with Hollywood. They had hired top technicians from the west, that's including Matt Damon. With this kind of attempt, they should have triumphed. Yeah, the graphics were good and then if you check it out the end credits, it was actually not a pure Chinese made product as what we see on the screen, which was 99 per cent Chinese cast. 'Kung Fu Yoga' is a fine example, what the made in China looks like.\r\n\r\nThe director is known for traditional films, like mixing art, martial arts and culture, particularly the middle age. I like his films of the 00s, but this one was utterly commercial crap. When it comes to the ideas for the scenes, every segment and every frame reminded me some Hollywood's greatest graphic film from the recent decade. Particularly the monsters as the zombies from 'World War Z' and the Chinese soldiers totally replicates the Elves of Woodland Realm. That proves, the Chinese are masters of copying\/duplicating. IT HAS A DECENT VISUAL, BUT NOT FRESH VISION. They should have handed it over entirely, except producing it for the better outcome.\r\n\r\nIt is the early 11th century, at one of the sections of northern China wall, where a couple of white men caught by the Chinese army after they were chased by a group of bandits. They have come with an agenda, but there's something big is going on. First, they have to win the Chinese trust and so they succeed on that, but things changes as the weather of the place has changed. Besides, they have no choice than to cooperate with them, but then the differences divide the two men. Who takes what path and their fates are decided at the film's climax.\r\n\r\n> \u275dThey have trained all their lives for this war.\u275e\r\n\r\nMany western actors, filmmakers had tried their luck in Chinese filmdom, but not all were succeeded. Tapping Chinese market is not that simple. There are too many complications like restriction in thematic and using content in the story. If that complies, then they must use Chinese cast and crew for some percentage. From all, the greatest surprise was, like Jimmy Kimmel said, why would Damon had given up the Oscar award winning role from his own production for this cheap flick from the east.\r\n\r\nI always appreciate the good films, no matter where it had come from. It all depends on the quality and the contents, but sometimes there is exemption if the production was under a limited, small cost. There's no such excuse for this film. Besides my issue was not the graphics, except borrowing the ideas from others, but it was the poor screenplay. You can clearly say that I'm not happy with this one. This is just another film that looks like a computer game as similar to the 'Resident Evil' film series.\r\n\r\nThe west had given up on digital 3D, but China has a special obsession with that, and so am I. That is the reason those failed films, bet against the Dollars, which were strongly influenced by that technology, such as 'Age of Extinction', 'Warcraft' et cetera survived by earning Yuan. Like I mentioned, the director is not this kind of cheap filmmaker. But it clearly understandable that he wanted to give what the domestic audience wanted, a good digital 3D film. For that, it has to be full scale action-adventure, not filled with drama kind he's famous for.\r\n\r\nThis film lacks character developments, as well as the story. You might enjoy it if you like actions. Even though, many of them are silly like acrobat women jumping down to just kill one-two monsters. On the other hand, they are the baits without followup strategic offense. Hence well planned suicide. Like that, they just wanted to give some actions without any logic behind. The common man like Chinese people (Common means Communism; definition) might be fooled, not the rest of the world. So this film is not everybody's suitable. It is a watchable film, but why? No worth at all.\r\n\r\n_3\/10_","id":"599767679251414073001e53","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/599767679251414073001e53","movie_id":311324}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**When revenge's not an agenda, but an opportunity knocks!**\r\n\r\nLately I have been watching lots of blacklisted screenplay films. Some of them were really good, but most of them were not. This is one of those, and I'm not convinced. The story wise, it was decent, until the secret was revealed. After that part, it's become completely uninterested. Because that twist was not par with any decent western film. In fact, it was same as what we had seen in those that sets in the modern day themes, but here it was in the second half of the 1800s.\r\n\r\nSo the story was the bad thing for this, but the actors were good. I liked the Liam Hemsworth. Woody Harrelson was not bad either, but his negative kind of role pushes us away from liking him and so the Alice Braga. It opened well, but did not develop and end well. If you are looking for a good western with the story, this is not for you. You should not try this just for the performances, because I don't think it is worth that much. Definitely, I won't recommend it on that ground, but there's always people for all kinds of films, so I won't surprise if you say it is a better film than what I said.\r\n\r\n_4\/10_","id":"57f4114bc3a3683b67001752","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57f4114bc3a3683b67001752","movie_id":333386}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**An unusual friendship and rare benefit out of it.**\r\n\r\nI did not dig for detail to decide to watch this film. Just by reading the title I have come to know I should see this. But later I learnt that it was from the director of 'Brothers of the Wind' I review a year ago. They say it was the third film in the 'man and wild animal relationship' trilogy, but I've seen only this and the one I mentioned in the previous line. The other one, the first one is 'Among Wolves' that's surely I going to check it out as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe story revolves around a park ranger, Beto, from the remote place in the south of the Argentina. He has a special relationship with the Orcas that strays on the edge of the coast nearby a lighthouse. People come to pay to see them, but on one occasion a mother and her autistic son from Spain visit him. Initially he refused to help her, but later he changes his mind with a purpose in his mind. So the days go on and what follows after that are some unexpected development which leads to the film's conclusion.\r\n\r\nAdapted to the screen from the novel by Roberto 'Beto' Bubas that he inspired to write by his real life event. Though initially I mean in the very first scene I thought it was so cruel. Not anybody wants to see that kind of opening. Especially not the kids or the families. If you are an animal lover, you would feel like that way as well. But very soon you will come to understand it is the way of nature and we're just a witness. Just like you watch Nat Geo and Animal Planet. Apart from that hurtful fact, the film was really good. \r\n\r\n> \u275dThey (orcas) are my family in the sea. And I'm their friend on the coast.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe characters were awesome. It was a limited cast, that's because most of the film takes place in the isolated location with three main characters. Very slow narration, particularly you won't get much progression in the first half. Kind of feels like a documentary film, that focused on a national park ranger's life. But in the last half an hour everything changes. An unpredictable event comes into play to steer the narration swiftly towards the tale's climax.\r\n\r\nAt some point I thought it was another film in the 'Free Willy' series. If you had seen that trilogy + one (tetralogy) and when you see this, you would think only that way. Not just because of the man and orca relationship, but the way they presented on the screen was like directly borrowed from there. But most importantly, it was based on the real which surely erase that kind of thinking from the viewers.\r\n\r\nIt was just like any other film that portrays an autistic character. But at the beginning, it did not pay any attention to that role. The perspective of the tale was from the Beto, so he led to shaping the entire narrative, until the last moment. That's when the boy took over to bring most required reorder in the story you had seen so far to something new. They all well acted, with the beautiful locations in the front and the background. It was not a masterpiece, but definitely it is among its kind.\r\n\r\nThe direction must be praised. I really like him. He is like a travel filmmaker. Yesterday he made a European film, today a South American and tomorrow it could be an African or Asian. What I most impressed was, his films are not aimed at commercial benefits. But very artistic, and mostly factual like a documentary film with a light stroke of fantasy to add a better storyline to attract little folks. His target audience are children and the families, and obviously the animal lovers. So if you know him, his works, then you must not miss this flick. One of the satisfying films, despite not a flawless film.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"597e10a79251415db101aea6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/597e10a79251415db101aea6","movie_id":430161}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Coming-of-age: A boy's real world encounter.**\r\n\r\nFor the first time direction, it is not a bad film. The 'Nebraska' writer did his best and I'm totally surprised how this little Canadian gem was not recognised extensively. In fact, it is one of the best films of the year among the PG13 ratings. A drama about a divorced freelance carpenter who babysits his son on a weekend, adventuring the city while preparing for his work on the Monday. When someone stole his tools, they both go after to look who took it and that takes the whole film to cover with some other small events on the side.\r\n\r\nTruly a heartwarming drama. You can compare it to films like 'The Pursuit of Happiness', but it had its own way dealing with the story contents. This is not a comedy, but slightly it is fun, as well as inspiring. It narrates the world is full of good and bad, and how we react to them accordingly. Particularly the main character who was desperate to come out of the bad day and to have some quality time with his son. It actually stayed neutral on the topics like theism and atheism, which has some influence in the narration, but revolved carefully around the social and other issues. So that makes there are more things to care about than fighting for nonsenses. That was really a good thing to focus on, maybe that's why I loved it.\r\n\r\nThe opening and the end take place in the same location, but the difference was the 24 hours and its events. During that time, a boy who was struggling between what his mother believes and his doubts over those beliefs were somewhat influenced to clear his mind. I mean it was not intentional, the film to explain us through the boy, but they were described in the way of someone's daily life base, except it was not an ordinary day for him\/them. It was a quite interesting take, and in the current world scenario, this is a wonderful theme for a film which also has high entertainment value.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know what kind of trouble he can get in in a day.\"\r\n\r\nI don't know the Christian commandment (or any religious's equivalent) that referred in it, especially the meaning of the title, but according to the writer, he wanted to tell what happens if a good behaving young boy breaks all the rule in just one day. Besides, a bit of his own life experience, as well as the outline was inspired by 'Bicycle Thieves'. I don't know how the religious people take it, but I enjoyed it, kind of it is an awareness theme about the reality of the human world. So my disappointment is not the film, but how it was received. Once again an English film from the other region was turned down by the Americans. I hope the rest of the world won't react same way.\r\n\r\nIt revolved between a father and son characters, so the side contributions were good, but does not require any praise. The Clive Owen, who I consider an ordinary actor was brilliant in this. He is not in any film franchise, especially the current trends superheroes and\/or sci-fi, though happy to see him in such a beautiful one-off film. The boy was equally good, especially after the good show from 'St. Vincent', this is his another great character display. Looks like he's going to be a big name in the future.\r\n\r\nYou can't believe it is just a 2 million dollar film. Great production quality with good performances, a better outcome than usual film with the same production value. From my perspective, it is an underrated film and also an undernoticed film. A fine film for everyone, particularly for the family audience. These are reasons why children as well should watch it, like there are no sexual or drug related material in it. Though the real reason is there are some contents that might help them to understand about such as financially struggling and sober parents, the reality of the society and as a coming-of-age film, it always kept its priorities on the top while narrating the tale, especially from the children's viewpoint.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"57d30edec3a3681ff2000a86","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57d30edec3a3681ff2000a86","movie_id":347881}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is indeed a very good remake of an old classic. As always I am a bit worried when they make a remake of old classics that I liked. This remake is well worth watching though. Despite having a few minor gripes I went for 5 out of 5 stars on this one.\r\n\r\nMost of you are probably familiar with the story of The Magnificent Seven. Gunslinger gets hired to protect a village from the evil industrialist, he picks 6 buddies to help him, trains the villagers, digs in and sits down and waits for the bad guys to arrive. A simple and well suited story for a bit of Western entertainment. I guess I should mention as well that the original Western is actually not the \u201creal\u201d original. That honor befalls Shichinin no samurai, or Seven Samurai in English, which is a Samurai movie by Akira Kurosawa and with Toshir\u00f4 Mifune in the lead role. That is the movie from which the plot originates.\r\n\r\nAnyway, history lesson is over, back to this movie. The movie starts of by introducing the main characters. The bad industrialist is a nasty piece of thug and quickly demonstrates that, although by no means being a blood splatter movie, it is definitely more cruel than what I remember from the original. Next in line is the movies hero played by Denzel Washington and I have to say that he plays the role very well. I liked him as the calm, fairly silent, but oh so deadly gunslinger from the first frame to the last.\r\n\r\nThe other characters fit quite well into their roles as well. I cannot make up my mind about Jack Horne though. I did like the character but at the same time I felt that he was a wee bit to comical at times. I also liked Goodnight Robicheaux quite a lot but the writer really went a bit over the top as far as I am concerned when he actually left.\r\n\r\nOf course the entire movie plays out as a build up to the final big fight and it is a big fight, that has to be said. However there are plenty of things happening during this build up. Both things involving chemically propelled slugs flying around and things slightly less noisy.\r\n\r\nSam Chisolm has to pick up his buddies of course, each one being an opportunity for some cool movie story telling. Then we have the training of the villagers which, as expected, becomes a wee bit comical at times. Oh, and I almost forget that there is a nice little shootout when Chisolm and his buddies introduces themselves to Bogue\u2019s thugs in the village. Said thugs includes the local Sheriff. To no ones surprise I believe. So much for law and order. Time for a new management.\r\n\r\nSo, fast forward to the end and the big fight. It is big, it is well done and it involves plenty of things that go boom. It is plenty of action but it is also the part of the movie where I have the biggest gripe. Okay folks there are going to be a mild spoiler now. With that out of the way, let\u2019s go to the Gatling gun. It is always cool to see a Gatling gun let loose. However can we keep it a bit more realistic please? They fire thousands of bullets without reloading (they make a fuss about reloading later in the movie). Also they position the gun out in the open where it would have been relatively easy to shoot the men operating it. An idea that they finally get much later and manage to goof up. The final solution to taking out the gun is dramatic but quite convoluted. This is the part of the movie that made me go a bit what the fuck!\r\n\r\nApart from that I really enjoyed this movie. A good remake of an old classic.","id":"58dced44c3a368223e009dba","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58dced44c3a368223e009dba","movie_id":333484}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**This time a London family struggle in their haunted house.**\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I am not a big fan of the first film, but I liked that. Now this sequel was not bad either. This time it takes us to the London. But the film reminded me the 80s film 'Poltergeist', particularly the second part. So don't assume it is exactly the same, only the scenes involving house seems similar, but the story was different. It is another true story based film, that's what they said in the opening statement. You're not forced to believe that, if you're here for an entertainment, you will get that if you put your logics away for the two hours.\r\n\r\nA family of four young children and their mother living in a house in the London witness some serious paranormal activities lately. Particularly the eleven year old girl affected the most with the spirit the house possessed. So the American couple from the first film are brought in to do their best to help the family. When they try to contact the spirit, they won't get what they were looking for. Instead, an unexpected blame goes for the girl and soon the family loses confidence in them. The overcoming those misunderstanding, particularly realising the truth brings a twist before concluding the tale.\r\n\r\nThe one twenty minute never looked too long. Because there's always something keeps happening, so the audience to keep engaged with. Probably this is won't be your best horror film of the years, but being a horror themed film, it had good form of those contents. Not too scary, at a time those clich\u00e9s were used in a good way to bring freshness in the scenes. I will credit the writers for that. Besides, the actors were undoubtedly good, including those little ones. For me this is a better horror film and I definitely look for another sequel. I hope this one would stand up to your expectations.\r\n\r\n_7.5\/10_","id":"57f40e9792514138f0000304","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57f40e9792514138f0000304","movie_id":259693}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Yep, this is a different Tarzan, an updated one.**\r\n\r\nRecently the Indian jungle boy, the live-action Mowgli film was made and so its time for Africa's. This is not a Disney film and that's one of the disappointments for the Tarzan fans. Because this film is for the grown-ups only. It is rated PG13, but still I don't think the children would enjoy it like they did for the recent 'The Jungle Book' film. So it is like a DC film, I mean, DC makes superhero films for the grown-ups, unlike Marvel's. The bottom line is, don't expect it to be like a Disney film. Like the director said before the release, this is not the Tarzan from your father, grandfather's era, but an updated one with strong graphic violence.\r\n\r\nSo the story skips all the Tarzan's earlier life like from his childhood to adulthood parts. The film commences with Tarzan being settled in the UK. It's the second half of the 19th century, where the European colonies in the Africa are expanding for its rich natural resources. So in the Congo savanna, the natives welcome Tarzan for his short visit, but the things get ugly when his wife, Jane was kidnapped. Now he must fight back for her safe return and also avert other threats in the region from the foreign power.\r\n\r\nThere are many CGI character films were made at the recent time, it is a trend, but not all of them are impressive. This film looked average when it comes to vfx. The story was acceptable, the performances were decent, the casting too not bad, but Samuel L. Jackson was completely useless. He's one of the greatest sidekick Hollywood ever produced, but I don't know why he's in this project, his role was very silly.\r\n\r\nIn other hand, Alexander Skarsgard was good in the lead character and so Margot Robbie as Jane. The action sequences were not good as I expected. The film had a good runtime, but in some parts, it was slow or maybe you can say nothing interesting thing happens. I liked the idea, to update the theme, but they should have given more focus on the story. I hope if they plan another film, it should be a prequel. Because I feel there's lots to learn about the past than going forward. This is a one time watchable film, there's no surprises, just plain and partially entertaining.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"580e47439251416e0d001ad3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/580e47439251416e0d001ad3","movie_id":258489}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is without a doubt a very good family movie. Many people seem to compare it unfavorably with the \u201coriginal\u201d animated movie from Walt Disney. To me these are quite different movies and should not really be compared. I have not read the book but I have a feeling that this movie follows the book more closely. It is a wee bit darker, more serious and incredibly beautiful to watch.\r\n\r\nI quite liked the original jungle book movie. It was one of my favorites when I was a kid. I am therefore quite happy that this was not just a \u201cdumb\u201d remake with modern CGI and that I quite liked this take of the classic story. This movie is, as I wrote, much more serious and a wee bit darker. It is less of a children\u2019s movie than the original.\r\n\r\nThe wolves are getting much more time in this movie which is good. Mowgli\u2019s opponents are also much less comical and much more sinister. Kaa is a beastly snake with no remorse, King Louie is a huge, scheming, and tyrannical ape King and finally Shere Khan is a ruthless, human hating,\u00a0tiger that kills anyone or anything that stands in his way.\r\n\r\nThe CGI is top notch as far as I am concerned. The jungle scenery is absolutely stunning and it is really worth watching the movie just for the scenery. Combined with a classic adventure story that is not half bad makes\u00a0for a\u00a0really a good movie.\r\nI was definitely positively surprised by this movie. For me it is a big success.","id":"58b03fcf9251411a6000e8e2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b03fcf9251411a6000e8e2","movie_id":278927}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A modern Chinese fairytale.\r\n\r\nThis is from one of the renowned filmmaker from China, Stephen Chow. The film holds the numerous records, including the highest grossing Chinese film of all time. So anybody would be curious enough to check it out. This is highly inspired by the western fairytale 'The Little Mermaid', but totally a Chinese. It carries a strong message about the marine life and pollution, especially that coming from China is obviously not usual. A great theme for a Mandarin film to get exposed to the International stage. An appreciable effort with the decent graphics, but it's filled with lots of negatives than leaving a good impression on the viewers.\r\n\r\nThe story is very important for a film and this is a very simple and short, but the remaining is packed with the comedies and stunt sequences. The film opens with the introduction of a multi- billionaire Xuan, who unveils his new sonar project on the coast Green Gulf where marine creatures consider it as a paradise. On the other side the shrunken to a very few, the merpeople plot to kill him. So they send their finest young mermaid, Shan to seduce him, but instead it creates a chaos when she falls in love with him. The final standoff between the man and merfolks set to reveal who will be the victorious at the end and the fate of Green Gulf.\r\n\r\nIf you are a die-hard fan of Stephen Chow, be prepared for a big disappointment. He's out of his comfort zone here. Thankfully, he did not star in this crap. His strength are comedy and martial arts, but this film was none of them. I mean it is categorised as a comedy, but those parts were too sensitive to call them jokes. You won't be laughing much because of the killing, hurting, tortures, kind of upsetting events draws us away from enjoying it. So if you think it is a cute mermaid love story aimed for children just like CJ7 and if you allow them to watch it, you might regret it later.\r\n\r\n> \"Love has no law. It is beyond any rules and boundaries.\"\r\n\r\nI don't know what is the rating for the domestic release, but this is definitely an R. It is certainly for adults and not everybody going like it. Looks like a film made for the local market only despite the influence of the western fairytale. It might have done well in Chinese box office, but the rest of the world does not consider it Mr. Chow's one of the best works. I think he should stay away from such project in the future, instead make a sequel for CJ7 or for the 'Kung Fu Hustle' where his fans are very eager for the official announcement.\r\n\r\nIf you had seen all his film, especially the directed ones, then you might enjoy some of the jokes from this which is his trademark. The romance was underdeveloped and then the event followed by it that brings the grand finale was too violence. That is when this fantasy-comedy turns an action-thriller without a forewarning. I was shocked for such kind of transformation in the story. I wanted to like it, but could not because I expected something like a Disney film, but it was more like a semi Tarantino film.\r\n\r\nThe addition of a cecaelian character was good from the comedy perspective. But just one from its kind makes him the last survivor and have sympathy than as he's the centre of the comedy in the narration. The overall story as well as all the main characters were never established to its full potential. I'm disappointed with the writing, the director is known for genuine screenplay, but he terribly failed to please his international fans. Of all, I only hope there won't be a follow up to it because we want the old Stephen Chow. He's better than this and I'm sure he will come strong. I can't recommend this film for children or the families, the youngster who are not very sensitive might be the right audience.\r\n\r\n4\/10","id":"57b502979251413cf300007b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57b502979251413cf300007b","movie_id":381890}
{"author":"bswanick@gmail.com","content":"I watched this without any pretense. My main desire was to watch a sfi-fi movie that didn't require too much investment while I wrapped up a little work and this was actually a good choice. \r\n\r\nI thought some of the acting was good. The lead guy in particular I thought did a great job. The story itself is pretty straight-forward and that was a nice change of pace. I feel like sometimes movies hide behind a complicated plot, time travel, and some gotcha camera work and it distracts from the film. This was not like that. Straight to the point and ready to go. No lulls. Just a movie.\r\n\r\nAfter I got it going, I took a peek to try and find the budget and there wasn't any information out there. Pretty good photography and CGI for a modern B-movie. (I hope that's not insulting to the team that made it!)\r\n\r\nI wouldn't watch it again but I enjoyed it.","id":"5cfb38400e0a26168ec9e1f9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cfb38400e0a26168ec9e1f9","movie_id":354282}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Trees, the pen the earth's holding to write its fate.**\r\n\r\nCheck about this film on the internet, it is definitely an under- noticed film. But decently rated, which deserve even better than that. Once you watched it, you would be surprised to know how such a beautiful tale went unnoticed. If I had a chance, I would have selected it for the Oscars to represent Spain, instead of 'Julieta'. Written by an Irish writer in English, but made into a Spanish film. A simple storyline, though an inspiring film. This is why one should watch non-Hollywood films as well very often.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it was not the first film to deal on such thematic. But nicely created an atmosphere where the characters flourished under. Particularly the character Alma, the backbone of the narration. Proves why the actress who played the role deserved the Goya Award. The remaining cast too was good. It was not a pure drama, though a bit of adventure, fun and a tiny bit of suspense like what might happen next make you get glued to it.\r\n\r\nThe story of the granddaughter-grandfather relationship through their family tree that's two millennia old. But the rest of the family members are not happy as they are financially struggling to work on the farm. To them the tree is the answer which could replace a restaurant they are planning for. Now the grownup granddaughter, unable to console her grandpa who has been heartbroken for years, is set to retrieve the tree at any cost. She teams up with her uncle and a friend, and their cross-border adventure begins.\r\n\r\nIt was not exactly a pre-planned road trip. But somewhat everything comes along for them. You would expect so many things to happen, but the writer has a different opinion. Especially with that Statue of Liberty, I really expected what most of the viewers would do in a situation. Even the conclusion was not something twisty as it should have been. Only if it was a regular film, but it was not. Still, I liked it being realistic than having a cinematic or a fairy-tale ending. Though most of the people think the message was not right.\r\n\r\n> \u275dSometimes you just have to dive in. Head first.\u275e\r\n\r\nI have heard a small beautiful story somewhere. I think in Quora. It was about Giant Sequoia, centuries ago when the forest was destroyed due to wildfire, someone asked that how long does it take to grow a new tree this big! The answer was thousands of years. So his reply was: then we should not waste a minute, let's start seeding. This film clearly depicts with quite similar moral. A kind of mindset we all need the most right now.\r\n\r\nI loved the concept about saving a tree. Because that's similar to my believe. Once I had a FB profile picture with a quote, saying 'save plants, eat meat'. I have a soft corner to plants than animals (but still I love animals equally). At least animals could have a chance, but plants does not. They can't move, they're fixed. Hence, I eat only fruits and vegetables (which are plant's excreta as they love animals in exchange as that's how the cycle works in the nature), not leaves and branches like cows and sheep. This is one of the reasons why I loved this film very much.\r\n\r\nThe film did not focus on the farmer's struggle. Or the corporate's evil deeds. While the lifestyle in the world becoming so rich and modern, the farmers still remaining the same. On the other hand, the corporations becoming very fancy every day. So that's where this story comes in. Because money buys anything in the world. Striking emotions at the right time, the tale took a small twist, but course changing for the narration. Reminds us that the film has reached its other end\r\n\r\nIf you are not interested in all those things, but just an entertainment, then fine it has that too. The film was made with criteria to meet the expectation from all the quarters. The farmers, corporate, tourism, corrupt politician, all these were the platform. Most of them were not deep enough that you could notice. Everything's understandable. But wherever it goes, comes back to the tree. The tree remains the centre throughout the narration.\r\n\r\nThis is not like those films to say worth a watch. It should be watched in my opinion. Because what we teach our kids and what we do in reality, all has consequences. In this era where global warming is a thing, trees are precious, even one. Because everything starts from one. So just don't expect like a fight to save Amazonia.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"59ec9b2b925141274d00375d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59ec9b2b925141274d00375d","movie_id":366505}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**When he got a rare second change to start over the life!**\r\n\r\nThe intention was good, but the film was not made right way to enjoy. Of course the story, the setting were not cheerful kind, but too slow, silent, dragged scenes, all made it even worse. Watching it from the beginning to the beginning of the final segment was challenging. Only at the final few minutes it all made sense. I thought at least it ended better.\r\n\r\nA blind man happily married with a kid, one day wakes up in the morning with a miracle. He regained his vision, following that, all the sudden his life getting changed. That also leads him over taking some tough decisions. With his new lease of life, he has shaped his life as he wanted. Now a fresh trouble surfaces and its consequences are hard hitting. What his choices and how the story ends are the remaining parts.\r\n\r\nDan Stevens was good. You could say it was a one man show. But as I said, the screenplay lacked pace, as well as guessable overall storyline. Which makes it not for everybody. The rest of the cast was good, and so the direction. I don't dislike it, I just did not enjoy it, I got bored of it in parts. One time watchable film for the selected ones, but being not dozed off while watching it is what they have to look out for.\r\n\r\n_4\/10_","id":"59fe1f36c3a368687e02048d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59fe1f36c3a368687e02048d","movie_id":334535}

Nice characters and the setting where all the story takes place. This is about two teenagers secretly trying to video document one of their neighbours after judging his character through several events of his life. So they place hidden cams in his house, expecting something twist to happen. As the story goes on, they face various troubles and what result they get in the end was a shocker.\r\n\r\nI think nicely written film. Not much fuzz about the characters or any events. Though there were some scene that puts the views on the edge of their seats. Overall a nicely made film, either quality or the quantity, totally acceptable. The actors too were good.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**He's not the same man inside out!**\r\n\r\nThe film was powerful, one of the best of the year I have seen. From the director of 'Warrior'. The story of a freelance accountant who was hired by a company to find the financial frauds. But when he's on the verge to uncover the names, the company rolls back over one of its member's death in the following day. It does not stop there, the life threat tails him and all who were involved with him. Now the film reveals his real identity going back to disclose his childhood days, like how he grew up. In the meantime, he has to find those people who are after him before they do and so with a twist the film comes to an end.\r\n\r\nComing from a DC film, now Ben Affleck proved he can be like any other top actors from the industry. His physique was great for the role he played. Thanks to Batman role. This is like his version of 'John Wick' or 'Jack Reacher'. Definitely we can expect a sequel here. Anna Kedrick was great in the recent time with all her films, particularly the box office wise. In this she did not get bigger role, but one of the main and in the follow-up, she might get more opportunity. The film was almost perfect for a crime-thriller. Especially the characters make the finest film of its kind. An outstanding film, so recommended for those who seek entertainment fullest.\r\n\r\n_9\/10_","id":"58b099279251417513000c35","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b099279251417513000c35","movie_id":302946}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**When the family needs you the most...**\r\n\r\nI'm not saying this is the best film of the year, because there are plenty of better films than this, but in some way this film wins our heart. First of all I did not know John Krasinski directs films. In fact, this is his second feature film, the only one I have seen and I loved it. The main reason to I enjoy it was, it is sentimental. Not just some foolish melodrama, but an uplifting film filled with lots of fun.\r\n\r\nThe cast was at its best. I liked everyone and their unique display. At some point it feels like a realistic drama, but those comedies make us realise that it's only a film. Margo Martindale was really awesome. I have never seen her in such a wonderful role. Most importantly in an important role like this one. If I remember this film in the future, that's only for her. The only negative about the film was the twist. It was like they aimed for it to bring change in pace and atmosphere, when the situation in the story was not in its favour. Even though I did not care it, and thoroughly enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of the Hollar family who reunite when they needed for each other. When John comes to know his mother got ill, he immediately flies back home. His brother is already there and the father is financially struggling. With many struggles, they all prepare for the medical procedure. In the meantime, there are some outside adventures. Like meeting their old friends, places, ex-wife et cetera. The remaining of the film is to reveal how it all goes and where they will stand.\r\n\r\nThe target audience is mainly the families. If you like a tearjerker, you would enjoy watching it as well. So in my opinion, this film is under-rated and under-noticed. Mainly because of the cast is not so popular and so the lack of promotion. Even the film poster is not that impressive. Kind of looks like a B movie and of course it is, but an awesome B movie. Worth a watch for many reasons and you will know it when you give it a try. So, recommended.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"587a82f8c3a36847e8006a65","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/587a82f8c3a36847e8006a65","movie_id":325346}

In fact, I'd even consider watching a spin-off it it focused on them and left Max and Duke out.\r\n\r\nBTW, the funny and adorable intro is pretty much all shown in the trailer and didn't give much of an indication into exactly what the film would be.","id":"5873b9619251410e6200cecb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5873b9619251410e6200cecb","movie_id":328111}

In the 80s when the drug trafficking was so high in the United States that came from the Latin America through the southern border, the US customs service sent its members to infiltrate among them to bust red handed.

There are many scenes that would pull you to the edge of your seat. After the wonderful performance in 'Trumbo' that got him an Academy Awards nominee last year, now he's back with another great character display. I'm talking about Bryan Cranson. Another Oscar's nod is quite possible in a second year row, but lets wait and see. This story mainly focused on him, but John Leguizamd was also impressive in an important supporting role and so the Diane Kruger.\r\n\r\nI think it was a most realistic undercover film among others I have seen. The drugs were not shown much and so the sex and nudes, despite the plot revolved around that. Even the stunts were minimised, but those rare action sequences were so good.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A look at the German Royal family during the WWII.**\r\n\r\nA book based film, partially inspired by the real, but I really loved. In the backdrop of the world war two, it focused on the German royal family, Kaiser. An officer sent to protect him during the nazi Germany's invasion of Europe, possibly from the spies. So during his stint, all events that unfolded were revealed to us with a twist at the end. The twist was predictable, so they did not hide it for the perfect moment and to make the film entirely rely on it. What's important is it was more a straightforward narration. Though there were some tense moments.\r\n\r\nOverall a great drama. I did not know what to expect, whether a thriller or romance, but it mixed them all together nicely. Of course, Jai was good, and so Lily James, but I was very impressed by Christopher Plummer. This film was awesome because of this 88 year old Canadian actor. Directed by a newcomer, and he did his part nicely. One of the fine addition to the world war two related dramas. It has a strong sex scene, otherwise would have been fit for all.

That's why I did not bother to check it out its teaser and trailer, but now I feel terrible for my crappy judgement.

Where two private investigators unlikely come together to probe a mysteriously reappeared porn star from the dead as what her aunt says. But later that connects with another high profile missing girl case and so with all the leads, these two goes the length risking their lives to solve it. The remaining story reveals whether they succeed or end up as the losers.\r\n\r\nIt was from the director of 'Iron Man 3' who wrote it keeping in mind as a television series, but later turned into this beautiful comedy. The first thing is I loved the Ryan and Russell's performances. They totally nailed it, especially Ryan Gosling in many comedy scenes. I think I laughed a lot and better after a long time. That's a surprise, you know, I did not think they can do comedies, but they're beyond all the praising words.\r\n\r\nIt's not just two of them, there is a mini 'Nancy Drew Reporter' kind of character. A teen girl joins them in the investigation and her part as well had a great impact on the narration. You would think you can predict the story, but it is a well written screenplay with many twists. Everybody did their job so well, even the two hours did not look too long, but went very quick. The cast, crew, production, all must return for a sequel and I hope it will happen very soon. A must see film, but for the grown ups only.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"57c8b5f0c3a3685bfc000b1c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c8b5f0c3a3685bfc000b1c","movie_id":290250}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"The generically-titled **The Perfect Match** boasts a few good aspects to its otherwise conventional rom-com boundaries: a polished and attractive cast, an occasional impish serving of whimsy and the go-for-broke enthusiasm for its off-kilter sense of bouncy romanticism. Still, this is not quite enough to uplift the breezily bland **The Perfect Match** from its rudimentary roots of elusive true love and laughs. Convincingly formulaic and transparent, this disjointed romantic comedy screams of late night viewings on the BET Channel sandwiched between hair product info commercials.\r\n\r\n**The Perfect Match** has its share of hipness and style but it never rises above the standards antics of other urban rom-com romps from the past such as 1997's **Love Jones** or 1999's **The Best Man**. Director Bille Woodruff and screenwriters Brandon Broussard, Dana Verde and Gary Hardwick want to pour on the spicy exploits of a good-looking, bed-hopping playboy impervious to long-term relationships but they never seem to elevate **The Perfect Match** beyond its common manufactured made-for-TV mode. This is familiar territory that has been covered countless times but **The Perfect Match**adds nothing fresh or frothy to this relentlessly tiring premise. \r\n\r\nHandsome hotshot photographer Charlie (Terrence Jenkins) is all aces with the numerous ladies that he attracts to the bedroom but he is the \"love 'em then leave 'em\" lothario that is chronically allergic to committing to one special woman. Soon, one vivacious woman in Eva (Cassie Ventura) would gradually change the womanizing Charlie's roaming eye outlook.\r\n\r\nCharlie is surrounded by a group of friends that unfortunately have their own problematic relationships. Married couple Rick and Pressie (Donald Faison and Dascha Polanco) are struggling to start a family while engaged couple Victor and Ginger (Robert Christopher Riley and Lauren London) are clashing over excessive wedding costs. Whatever the conflicts are that overwhelm the group they are at least committed to one another unlike poor Charlie that cannot just pull the trigger and give a single woman his undivided attention. \r\n\r\nActually, Charlie's family and friends have all been supportive in trying to settle him down by recommending a parade of women for him to consider seriously but it is always a disappointment in the end result. When the free-spirited Eva comes along and exemplifies the same kind of philosophy in keeping the opposite sex at an arm's length distance in terms of genuine relations he becomes intrigued by his female counterpart's similar convictions. However, Charlie develops steady feelings for Eva as she may be the very one companion that can convince him to concentrate on one woman and invest some quality time. The question remains: will Eva be receptive to abandoning her \"friends with benefits\" lifestyle for Charlie's experimental foray into stable relationships? \r\n \r\nIn selective sequences **The Perfect Match** can be refreshingly charming especially when the trio of buddies in Charlie, Rick and Victor get together and reminisce about how their lives have changed and been impacted by the women they have encountered both currently and in the past. Nevertheless, Woodruff sheepishly patches together the predictable subplots of Charlie and his close knit associates with a series of random scenes showcasing the push-and-shove issues with their unresolved bickering and stagnation but the dilemmas never really seem to be flushed out coherently. \r\n\r\nThere is a lackluster sense of urgency with all the arguing among the supporting couple as Charlie's realization to change his affectionate ways with the stimulating Eva is telegraphed from miles away.   \r\n\r\nIn a clumsy effort to personalize Charlie's trepidation with solid one-woman bonding we are introduced to his therapist sister Sherry (Paula Patton) in a round-about way for which we can bridge some psychological understanding and connection to our main protagonist's commitment phobia. Unfortunately, the shoddy material is too paper-thinned conceptually to delve into our affable loverboy's chronic female fraternizing. \r\n\r\nSure, **The Perfect Match** can be witty and free-wheeling at times but for the most part it follows a lazy-minded path of sketchy chuckles and easy-minded romantic resolutions.   \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n**The Perfect Match** (2016)\r\n\r\nJorva Entertainment Productions\r\n\r\n1 hr. 36 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Terrence Jenkins, Cassie Ventura, Donald Faison, Paula Patton, Robert Christopher Riley, Dascha Polanco, Lauren London, Kali Hawk\r\n\r\nDirected by: Bille Woodruff\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Romantic Comedy\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n","id":"56e5ea5bc3a3685aa0008309","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56e5ea5bc3a3685aa0008309","movie_id":378200}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**When the realistic right and an emotional wrong collides.**\r\n\r\nThis is one of the last films I watched as I cleared almost all the titles of this year's Oscars. It is a French-Iranian co-production, but selected and won the Academy Awards for Iran. From the well know filmmaker of that region whose film had already won the same award in the not so past. I'm not just addicted to Hollywood. I'm a film fanatic because I give equal preference to films of the whole world. So I have seen as many as this year's submission for the Oscars in the category of the Foreign Language Films. And there are lots better films than this, that even did not make into the final five. From my perspective, this is an okay film, even comparing with the rest of the fellow nominees, including that I thought that would win, 'Under Sandet'. The mess is all because of Trump effect, as same reason 'Moonlight' to win the main trophy.\r\n\r\nAt least it was not an average film like 'A Separation', though not a masterpiece like 'The Past' that did not even nominated for the Oscars. It stands between them. The title name is not exactly relevant to the story. But it helped to extend the plot for an extra 20-30 minutes. An unnecessary subplot, which really were the boring parts. Or you can say, just to attract the western audience with their ingredient and that worked out as planned for the filmmakers. Except those theatre portions, the rest of the film and its storyline looked like I was watching a French thriller.\r\n\r\nIt is about a young couple who are forced to relocate to another house after their apartment building was declared not safe anymore for some kind of construction taking place in the nieghbourhood which is affecting it. The man is managing his job at a school as a teacher and the remaining time as a theatre artist along with his wife. The life was as usual, till one day something bad happens to his wife at home in his absence. Now he's raged to find the culprit, but once if he did what happens and how the story ends was the another twist.\r\n\r\n> \u275dIt's obvious you're not the one who found your wife the other day, otherwise you wouldn't say that.\u275e\r\n\r\nIt was a very slow start. I mean the opening scene was like racy. And then following, it slowed to build the momentum. That does not mean the characters were developed so well. It only moves forward with constructing what are all needed for later parts. Once it enters the third act, the scenario changes. It looked like another film, another genre. Too tense moment and tight plot for the grand finale. Yep, that is the part makes this film to forget everything you saw in the earlier.\r\n\r\nWhatever happened in that part, I felt it was right, though I think culturally it differs the outcome. I mean, that's not philosophically the Iran we know or the religion they worship. You can say the western films badly portrayed them in their films, but if you look at their history, the film ending was shocking. So I thought, the end chaos was for among themselves. If the outsiders (westerners) were involved, it would have been a differently dealt.\r\n\r\nVery good performances. But not perfectly written screenplay as I pointed out a few things in the earlier paragraphs. And another thing was, the character, particularly the mysterious one, I was not satisfied how it had been developed. He enters the frame only at the last moment. The narration was very suspense and a bit thriller, but then all the sudden everything comes crumbling down since the end was very near to cease the procession. My point is, how that X man was netted does not make sense in reality. Being a film, it has no problem at all.\r\n\r\nSo, it was a good film, but not as good as it was praised or won the Oscars. Yeah, definitely worth a watch. The setting was very good, except the ending, as the opinion differs from people to people and the amount of damage on how to deal with such situation. Overall, a little good message at the end, but not exactly a moral message as it brings more destruction towards the GOOD over the BAD which always win with a strong sentimental grip, no matter whoever involved in it.\r\n\r\n_6.5\/10_","id":"59519c1992514129c4013ab6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59519c1992514129c4013ab6","movie_id":375315}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The first step towards the new order after a great disaster.**\r\n\r\nA dystopian British film. Zombie theme based on the book of the same name. The story of a few survivours, but all the focus was on the little girl. Thematically a very familiar film, but the storyline from the characters' perspective makes it unique. Nice cast, but it was not about Gemma Arterton. Her part was small, despite she can be seen in the film's entire stretch.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning, I did not know what's happening. Only after the second stage of the story commence, most of the doubts were cleared. But again, till the final scene, the film holds us with the strong progression. In some parts, it looks silly, but makes sense on the basis of its all the developments.\r\n\r\nAfter their enclosure was broke, a group of survivours roams around the London looking for the food and the safe place. They manage to get away in some of the close encounters with the running deads. But how long it goes like that becomes the question. Besides, they divide when the girl comes into their topic. How the story ends was with a small twist.\r\n\r\nThere were some good zombie films in the last two years. This is one of those. If you like zombie theme, you might find it a refreshing. Not the storywise, but the characters. The little kid was so good. They have picked the right one for that role. Looks like it could be a cult film. Ends high, but I don't think there will be any sequel or prequel in the future.

It stars Sarah Wayne Callies, Jeremy Sisto, Sofia Rosinsky and Suchitra Pillai.\r\n\r\nStill struggling to come to terms with the death of her young son, Maria (Callies) is told of an Indian ritual where she can say goodbye to her son one last time, under one condition. The condition is that the conversation will be on the other side of a door - a door which simply must not be opened...\r\n\r\nThere were far worse horror films than this released in 2016, that's not to say this should be a selling point for The Other Side of the Door, but it at least is effective in what it does. The problems really are that it's all very clich\u00e9 ridden, but how many horror films do not have clich\u00e9s anyway? This is one for those who are just after a few genuine scares, some creeping dread like atmosphere, and a nifty ending. It doesn't tread any new ground, and it comes off like the bastard child of Ringu and Pet Sematary, but sometimes a safe horror with clich\u00e9s is all you need for a decent night in with the lights off. 6.5\/10","id":"588e2a07c3a3681e11008b13","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/588e2a07c3a3681e11008b13","movie_id":364116}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**When a thin line drawn between the two concepts.**\r\n\r\nIt is hard to describe this film. A challenging film to make as well. Not like an expensive film with huge cast and graphics. It's a simple drama, a drama that draws a line between two different theories the humans have adapted and followed in the present world. So when a film drags religious as its prime topic, most of those kind of films never received well in the past, says the history. I don't know this film met with any kind of controversy, but all I know is it brought in a wrong religion to tell the story.\r\n\r\nI'm not against such kind of concept. But this film was one of those annoying one. It's neither preaching religious nor against. That does not mean a well balanced narration. No, it's not. If you are a believer, you might think it is making some false claims. If you are a nonbeliever, that's a test for your temper. There are many scenes where it could have taken a turn like a normal clich\u00e9d film does, but it did not go those ways. Just headed randomly, dragged the runtime of the film to nearly two hours.\r\n\r\nThe story follows the high school boy Venya, who recently have started to read the Bible. Living with his mother, they have never into the religious stuff. Now he thinks he found his belief, but that does not it, he begins to impact everyone, everything around him. Because of him the school loses its privileges in many sectors. Suddenly he becomes a villain to many eyes, but there's one big backing for him all the way. Then the rivalry between him and the biology teacher heats up. How far it goes and how it all ends told in the remaining parts.\r\n\r\n> \u275dI wish he collected stamps or jerked off all the time.\u275e\r\n\r\nVenya's belief in the 2000 year old book reminded me a real person in my life. He almost trusts everything he reads from the books, which were printed decades ago. The science is updated every day. When a book got printed and in the meantime to reach the people, a new theories have already been proved. That's what I argue with him all the time that he's late and learnt old ones. Two millenniums ago, there was no democracy. This religious book made people to follow uniform rules around the world. Now the time is different, where these old texts do not make logic, excluding the moral values it teaches us. So, like saying, don't believe in everything you read is perfectly aplpies here.\r\n\r\nThe film was adapted from a German play. The entire film shot in a month of time. Most of the cast were first time in front of the camera. There's no complaint about the filmmaking. From cinematography to acting, dialogues, direction, music, all were top class. But you know, the story had not compromised in any one particular path among the two topics it dealt with. Like it keeps poking in the viewer's eyes by not giving what they want. That makes it a one time watchable film. Because, for such storyline and its such ending, who would go back for a second view.\r\n\r\nI have waited till the final for some real twist in the tale! It did come, but totally disappointed the way it went on to conclude. But there were a few sub-topics like gay, (school) politics et cetera. Remember, it is a Russian film where the filmmakers have so many restrictions to use the contents. So I understand the way the film had been made. Even though, just an above average film in my opinion. Definitely it is not a bad film. You could like it better than me, but I'm not sure of that. At least it was unique, and what most of the modern Russian films dared to expose the social issues the nation is facing. I won't favour it, but you should not ignore it too. Do some research on it and decide yourself to try it.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"59fe1ce0c3a3686893025a8c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59fe1ce0c3a3686893025a8c","movie_id":392817}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**It's a mad mad mad mad family.**\r\n\r\nThis is really something. I could not believe I saw it. It was challenging, but I did it. When a biopic was made, surely there will be a solid reason behind it. That could be a positive message or highlighting the negatives or the important historic events. But it's always about how much you know about that person the film portrayed. If he is someone famous, but not in your nation, yeah, you would be desperate to learn about him through the given film. That's the case for me in here, but that's not what exactly happened.\r\n\r\nThis was a life drama of one of the renowned Polish painters of the last century. Mainly focused on him, his family and overall their lifestyle. It was not stylish, but craziest. Yep, I could not understand the entire film and thought why someone has to make a film like this. Then it was not until the final scene, I thought worth a watch. Moreover, I was shocked how it ended, after two hours of nothing, but a family madness. Yeah, the end was like another genre. You could consider it a black comedy, which is not actually, but somehow for the reasons it feels like that way, until the final scene.\r\n\r\nIt was the last three decades of life story of Zdzislaw Besinski. Started off in the 70s, where his son moved to a new apartment close by. But he's a trouble who attempting to self-killing. Then his ageing mother has to be taken care. So, basically there's always an issue in the family. All this insanity keeps happening for the next couple of decades. As the years pass by, as the technology changing, so do this family, but shrinking from the strength. Until the mid 2000s, where the narration comes to halt with an unexpected twist.\r\n\r\n> \u275dWherever I go, I've to act like other people, do what everyone else does. I've got to play a role to get the things I want or to be liked. I've to keep acting. I can't get out of this.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe more I recollect everything I saw, the more I started to like it. You will agree with me that the film was uninteresting in the beginning. Not just the beginning, but almost entirely. Though the value of the film will be realised once you finish watching it and as I said while analysing the scenes in your head makes to change your stance. The opening scene and the end scene are totally opposite. That's the highlight of the film, and the meaning of the title. Anyway, the final scene was sudden and brutal. Not good for little fellows.\r\n\r\nA feature film debut for the director. He was good though. While watching it, I thought the writing was bad. One thing I have learnt in my life was that no judging a film by its poster, its synopsis or its cast and crew, and also not after watching just a few minutes of its opening. On a few occasions, the budgets as well. So, the key for this film is the patience. Sitting for it quietly over a hundred minutes will make the difference as it did for me. But that does not mean everyone would love it at the end.\r\n\r\nIt somewhat looks like a documentary film, that's because of the film having plenty of found footage kind of narration in parts. The actors were amazing. Like the whole film was shot in a couple of flats with a few shots elsewhere. That means, the story firmly decoding the family and nothing else. The end was sad, I could not take it. But the film was just telling the truth. Not a kind of film to recommend, but surely worth a watch if you are not looking to have a good time, I meant to enjoy watching it.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"59aca0dec3a3682c0a038b21","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59aca0dec3a3682c0a038b21","movie_id":408292}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Veni, vidi, vici!**\r\n\r\nI anticipated another inspiring biopic about a man who built an empire. That's partially true, because this was inspired by the right kind of wrong thing. I mean it was not actually about the McDonalds' story, the McDonald brothers, but the fast food chain McDonald, how the franchise got rapidly spread across the globe and the person behind it. With the film having both good and bad side, it stayed mostly neutral. But due to the main character, you would see too much lean on what seems the reason behind the McDonald's today's popularity.\r\n\r\nSo it's like another typical American founders' story like Apple, Facebook. I mean not the one who found the company with all the hard works, but the one who dived in and took all the credit. Ray Kroc was a traveling salesman and he's not doing any good. But one day he meets the brothers who had started a modernised kitchen and its fast food service. He shows lots of interest in it and so he joins hands with them. With his new ideas, how he makes a fortune out of it and the future of the company, all revealed in the later part.\r\n\r\nAn enjoyable film. Particularly for Michael Keaton. Well directed film as well. Film wise it was a good one, but the story wise not morally right. It was about the flaws in our society, our system. Some men can do anything like pulling others leg to climb the success ladder. It's not them to blame completely, because they had struggled enough to understand their future path. So definitely for some people, this film would inspire. If you are a regular McDonalds' customer, you should watch it. Otherwise, just to learn the truth, it is worth a watch.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59dbeaa8c3a3686200066925","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59dbeaa8c3a3686200066925","movie_id":310307}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> These brothers joining hands mean the world is in trouble.\r\n\r\nI thought it might be a spin off to 'The Man from UNCLE', but it wasn't. From the action-thriller director known for 'Transporter' films and this is his first comedy, yet it has some great stunts. It is about the two brothers who meets after a lot time separation. Now they're two opposite kinds, professionally and socially. So coming together means trouble is inevitable wherever they go in the world. Against all the odds how they accomplish their task that forced them to do it is the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nIf you like Sacha's trademark comedies, you might like it as well. Like always his part was excellent in this, especially jokes were very hilarious. Though the story was weak, but the rest of the film was not bad. The overall film leaned on its comedies and that's how the narration somewhat successfully carried out till the end. An enjoyable film, but you might hesitate to rate higher, because this is not the best film of the year, definitely not for me, I've seen a lot better ones.\r\n\r\nBesides, Mark Strong was amazing. He was always been a co-star, but here he's equal to Sacha and he did some good stunts as well. I think the film is passable, because it is one of the recent decent comedy. I can suggest it for those who're seeking some laughs. It might won't bring the loud ones, but surely will raise your cheeks. The film is for adults for the R rated jokes, there are some unexpected scenes that I was surprised for them. I enjoyed it and I'm sure I won't remember it for very long, that kind of film it is.\r\n\r\n6.5\/10","id":"57b50047c3a3686a11002655","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57b50047c3a3686a11002655","movie_id":267193}

The second in the series, \u201cThe Purge: Anarchy\u201d was a marked improvement, and \u201cThe Purge: Election Year\u201d is clearly the best one yet.\r\n\r\nIn case you\u2019ve been hiding under a rock, the concept behind these movies is simple: the government of America fell after mass unrest and crime eventually led to revolution, and out of the rubble a new party rose. They call themselves \u201cThe New Founding Fathers\u201d party and they have discovered a way to dramatically decrease crime and placate the populace: for one 12 hour time span each year, all crime \u2014 including murder \u2014 is legal. This annual bloodbath is known as (wait for it) \u201cthe Purge.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn this newest installment, the annual Purge has been in place for two decades. When she was younger, Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) was forced to watch as her entire family was murdered in front of her during the Purge. Having survived the horrors of the Purge, the Senator is running for President on an anti-Purge platform that is gaining popularity. Threatened by Senator Mitchell, the New Founding Fathers use the Purge as an opportunity to wipe out their competition by sending a squad of assassins to hunt her down. Protected only by her head of security, Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo, reprising his role from \u201cThe Purge: Anarchy\u201d), the Senator must go on the run to survive the night.\r\n\r\nIn \u201cThe Purge: Election Year,\u201d the annual bloodbath is used as a platform to talk about the growing tension between the haves and the have-nots. Because they lack the financial means to protect themselves, the poor are disproportionately victimized during the Purge. In this world, legalized murder is a way for the wealthy and political elite to ensure a placated populace and control the poor. When the victimized start to realize that they are pawns in a game played by the privileged, they start to fight back\u2026 by any means necessary.\r\n\r\nThe elite in this world are typified by ultra-conservative hypocrites who are quick to subvert religion and re-shape their displayed and false piety to advance their own agenda. Murder tourism is encouraged, and the powerful are quick to espouse the wisdom of permissive gun laws. Sound familiar at all?\r\n\r\nMy chief criticism of the movie is that it got perhaps a little too heavy-handed in its messaging at times, and the horror aspects of the story suffered as a result. At times, the film more closely resembles an action movie than a horror flick, which is a little disappointing for a franchise that excels in displaying inventive \u2014 if horrific \u2014 kills. Those kills are the moments that stay with you the longest and the ones that keep you up at night. The imagery that we do get is powerful, but it becomes increasingly scarce as the movie progresses.\r\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s not a perfect movie, \u201cThe Purge: Election Year\u201d is that rare horror movie that is both entertaining and has something interesting to say. Whether or not you agree with its politics, it\u2019s an interesting vehicle to use for a message that has resonance in our current culture. I just fear that the message will be lost on most.\r\n\r\n**A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com**","id":"579d03ea9251411b360085fd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/579d03ea9251411b360085fd","movie_id":316727}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Reborn to face even bigger troubles.**\r\n\r\nIt's true that Sandler had lost his Midas touch, but last few films suggest he's back. Still, he's not the same old what he used to be. The time has changed, so he has to adapt to it and I think he's doing okay. Only haters\/film critics keep hating him. This is a Netflix production and Sandler in a mysterious role. He teams up with his old school friend and they fake their deaths to begin a new life. But the identities they have borrowed ones are even in the bigger troubles which begins to haunt them as well. So coming out of it is the remaining film to tell.\r\n\r\nThe storyline seems just okay. Since it is not fresh enough, they did not even overuse the concept to build plot with clich\u00e9s. Kind of guessable twists, but it will work for most of the people. Better stunt sequences for such a comedy flick. Good performances and it was a smooth sail according to the film's pace. The director and Sandler had given a few good comedies back then, and this fresh collaboration was decent. So don't believe the film critics (Rotten Tomatoes & Metacritic), elsewhere it is rated much better, but still somewhat underrated. If you are seeking a decent action-comedy, this is worth a try.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58cafc83c3a3682899002ac5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58cafc83c3a3682899002ac5","movie_id":389053}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Book and non-violence versus weapon and upraising.**\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this film is the script that based on the real. Such films are really worth a watch, before that, worth to be made. But did it depicted accurately is what we don't know. So here the effort should be appreciated and everyone who involved in it. It was about the African-Americans during the early 19th century. The film focused on a boy who learnt to read and write became a preacher. He taught his community about all the good and bad. But it all comes into question when he realises that what he reads in the book is not the same in the real world. He has been in the path of non-violence all his life and now at the crossroad, he forced to take a weapon and fight back for the freedom.\r\n\r\nAn inspiring film. If it was well written and made, would have been an Oscar material. Though the actors were good and well shot in locations. Nate Parker was brilliant in the lead, as well his direction was not bad, particularly in his first attempt. Previously, he had done some fine roles, but this is his best appearance. Perfect length and pace to sit for it patiently looking for the next events in the narration. Had some too much violence in a few scenes, but those were very much needed. Despite the film telling a true story, it did not appeal enough due to the lack of proper improvement in narration. Which I blame for not availability of proper information and records. Surely one of the best among in the year, not one of the top films of the year. So it is a must see then.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58cafcfcc3a368287d003100","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58cafcfcc3a368287d003100","movie_id":339408}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Muscular Western headed by Denzel Washington is superior to the hokey original***\r\n\r\nA woman (Haley Bennett) seeking justice after the murder of her husband enlists a bounty hunter (Denzel Washington), who gathers six others, to defend the woman\u2019s southwestern town against a ruthless army hired by a destructive industrialist (Peter Sarsgaard). Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, Byung-Hun Lee, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo and Martin Sensmeier play the other six gunfighters.\r\n\r\n\"The Magnificent Seven\" (2016) is a reimagining of the 1960 Western, which itself was based on Kurosawa's \"Seven Samurai\" (1954). While the plot is contrived the original version had a stellar cast, a magnificent score and great locations, but it was ruined by hokey script flaws. For instance, the teen Chico (Buchholz) was able to effortlessly infiltrate Calvera's bandits, utterly fooling them, even though there were only 32 of them by this point (rolling my eyes). Even if Calvera & his brigands failed to make out Chico's face, which is a big IF, his dialogue & accent would've given him away. Keep in mind that Chico was just an unseasoned teen.\r\n\r\nAnother example is the villagers' sudden cowardly turnaround (betrayal), which totally contradicted their earlier resolve. Yes, I realize they learned that the bandits weren't run-off and that they were going to return to the village out of desperation, but there were only like 30-32 bandits left at this juncture and the combined forces of the seven gunmen and the fighting villagers now had the opportunity to annihilate the thugs for good.\r\n\r\nThis version of course eliminates such idiotic writing and ups the ante with the action. The movie's bloody, but no more so than recent Westerns like \"3:10 to Yuma\" (2007) and \"Django Unchained\" (2012). If you like those ones, as well as oldies like \u201cDuel at Diablo\u201d (1966) and \u201cThe Outlaw Josey Wales\u201d (1976), you\u2019ll like this one. Washington stands tall in the main role while Jennifer Lawrence lookalike Haley Bennett is stunning and superior to Lawrence. \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 2 hours, 12 minutes and was shot in Arizona, New Mexico and one shot in Colorado (Miller Mesa, Ridgway) with the main set being in Jackson, Louisiana.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B","id":"5cc0a2c7c3a368694c8baf2d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cc0a2c7c3a368694c8baf2d","movie_id":333484}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**All he wanted was to be with his mother.**\r\n\r\nThis can be easily the Swedish version of 'The Elephant Man'. It ain't a biography nor a documentary, yet has a simple and heartwarming story. It is also a sport themed flick. The sport not widely known, excluding the Europe. The first feature film for the director and a good film to debut with. He had waited for a decade to make this film and he should be proud and happy for accomplishing that. On the outside the film looks like ordinary, but not for making. Especially not for a small cost film like this. Everybody had put a great effort, particularly the lead actor.\r\n\r\nThe story of an autistic and severely deformed man, the 30 year old Rikard is not an average guy you would see in your daily life. That is one of the reasons why he struggles in the society. Not because he's different looking, but not all the people are kind to him. All of his life he is known was the game, Petanque. And all in life he wanted was to be with his mother. So he took the game very seriously and decided to win the championship, just to win his mother's love as well. How far he would go and how far it would take him to his mother are the remaining parts to reveal.\r\n\r\nThis is not a popular Swedish film, though I wonder why is that. Of course it did not have any specialty like a powerful twist or turn. All it had was a strong lead character, and with that, it got forward with a clich\u00e9d storyline. The scenes were predictable, particularly the end. But I liked the mix of fantasy\/illusion and reality. Rikard from the inside, was living in his own world. He had his own version of guardian angel, and a close friend who stood for him all the difficulties. In his both the world, together, they had set to accomplish the things. One of his prime objective was to get back to his mother.\r\n\r\n> \u275dMove the centre of the universe. It's the hardest thing to do, but also the most beautiful.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe screenplay should have been more engaging. Otherwise, should have been emotionalised. Or both. Because such theme needs a strong sentiment base. Definitely that would have drawn-in the family audience. Yet it is still a family film, and the end still be emotional for some people. But for me, it looked more a fairy-tale than touching. Even though everybody must agree that it was an apt ending. The focus was very clear, what the film wanted to show us and what the characters wanted to reveal to us. The characters had less depth, like in case of the mother's role, but ultimately how all of them linked together and brought together at the end was nicely done.\r\n\r\nRegarding the sport from the film, it looks like the marble (goli) game that's played in our local. Except it was the small orbs and instead of the whole arm, just fingers used to play while thumb firmly on the ground. I wish they had explained the game properly for the viewers from other continents like me. It looked fun and simple game, I think I almost understood, except the rules. But I can understand the story was not designed to start the game from the scratch, I mean intro. Besides, it was a part of the story, not the whole story. Nicely utilised a small sport in a film.\r\n\r\nJust below 90 minute film, one of the special film, yet there's nothing too much to praise heavily. Sometimes a simple script like this is better to end decently than too much of establishment to aim greater, which most of the times fails terribly. Especially from the beginner's perspective. So now the director can try something big in his next and can demand big budget as well from his production house. All I wanted to say is if you want to try this, don't anticipate, just watch it with an empty mind. You might have seen many similar films, so as I said it is not hiding that fact, just trying to be a simple, meaningful drama than useless nonsense we see all the time. It is not a must see, though it won't make you any harm for watching at once.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59bd9209925141354a018a9d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59bd9209925141354a018a9d","movie_id":407204}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**It's not anymore a competitive world, but jealousy!**\r\n\r\nIt started off very well and in the half mark, it completely lost. In the initial part, it looked like a normal film and then I think even the writer does not know what could happen, they just improvised with whatever they had. Writing was totally messed up. When they had the great characters, it becomes nothing in the end. I'm not a fan of this director, and all his films are average, but this one is the worst among them.\r\n\r\nI'm not an art film hater, though I hate wasting scenes without any developments and this one had many like them. If you trim them all out, the overall film is around 45 minutes. The rest of the film was just music, colourful lights, and sometimes totally idle, which definitely drag the viewers to the boredom.\r\n\r\nWhenever there was a scene with the story, like dialogues and developments, I thought it was going well. But then those useless, dialogueless segments turned me off. Especially the conclusion was absolutely crap. Elle was good, like a character made for her. Keanu Reeve was useless, his addition was just a marketing strategy that did not click.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a teen girl aspiring to be a model, but surrounded by the jealousy people because of her fast growth. How it all goes between them and in the fashion world is what the film talks. The film is watchable, but mostly the second half onwards it gets boring. In the end, I don't think anyone would be satisfied completely with their watch, maybe very, very few, but if you consider the majority, this does not deserve to be suggested.\r\n\r\n_3\/10_","id":"581cf8379251413749001431","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/581cf8379251413749001431","movie_id":301365}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Falling in love and rising in boxing!**\r\n\r\nThis is a Finnish sport-biopic that was an official submission for the 2017 Oscars, but did not make it. Despite inspired by a real person, the film only focused on one event, a big event of his life. Sets in the early 60s, the country's one of the biggest sporting event is about to take place. So the pre-event incidents, including the preparation and all those related affairs were detailed in this film.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to say that everybody would end up liking it. Especially the sport segment. That's a major drawback of the film, but the other way around this is still very good. Only if you are okay with the facts over entertainment. So as I'm who already saw the film want to give a piece of advice for those who are yet to see it that watch it as a romance film. Yep, it is a better romance film than a boxing film. That's not how the pre developments swings, but it gets there a little late and then ends with an unexpected twist.\r\n\r\nAn amateur boxer Olli Maki got a shot at pro boxing, so he's heading Helsinki and making preparation to face the strongest opponent coming from the United States. Not just for him, but for the whole country, it is a historical event. So the pressure is on Olli's team to make the right progress, especially to please their sponsors. Seems it was a smooth ride, until Olli find himself in an unwanted distraction, particularly at that time which is a turning point in his professional life. This is the flavour of romance and the boxing, can those two go along? Is what the remaining film carefully revealed.\r\n\r\n> \u275dThis is the shittiest moment to fall in love.\u275e\r\n\r\nLike any sports films we had seen, this film as well all about pre event hype and the final act is given to the grand finale on the ring. Looks 'Cutie and the Boxer' should have been a perfect title, but this is nothing like that documentary film. It was not Olli's whole life, it was his falling and rising. Falling in love and rising to be a great boxer in Finland. But the problem is, both the things happening on the same time. More like romance versus profession. It's off the ring battle for Olli and can he win it, followed by a real battle.\r\n\r\nNow you would remember other awesome boxing films where love story and boxing had met like 'Rocky', 'Cinderella Man' and many more. This film is not comparable with them, that's the saddest part of it. It's a black and white film, and the filmmakers say that's because to take us 60 years back to Finland. They used film rolls like the old way of filmmaking. Indeed, it worked, it was the backbone of the film along the great cast. There are many characters, but revolved around only 3-4. The dialogues were minimised and let the pictures talk.\r\n\r\nThe good news it was a 90 minute film with a decent pace. The one who played Olli was really good, but even in little lesser than that role, Raija enchants us. I can't forget that smile, it still appears front my eyes. Not just Olli, you might as well fall for her (at least for the actress who player that character). I also come to know the real couple's cameo for a brief was in the final scene. This is not the finest Finnish film I've seen, but I respect biopics as they tell the truth. It seems a better film for the older and matured guys, like above 30-35. But stay away if you are looking for a pleasure.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58cafdf1c3a368287d0031c0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58cafdf1c3a368287d0031c0","movie_id":392807}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A very much acceptable film that inspired by a real event except long pauses and too much ineffective sentiment.\r\n\r\nA disaster drama-thriller based on the true account of the 1952. So much better film than I anticipated. But there are a few things I did not like; like the frequent pauses in the narration where nothing really happens other that space given for the emotional background score to pull the viewers in. In a result, it did not work, definitely not for me. Yeah, in the many important scenes, it froze like it happens in the chess games before anybody move their pawn.\r\n\r\nIn the crucial part of the narration, when the boat was overcrowded, there was an unnecessary pause which annoyed me. It was surely a remarkable segment of the story, but sentimentally failed to appeal or maybe you can call it a too much of the sentiment. Honestly, I liked the story, but the film exceeded its runtime to slow down the portrayal of the event which is surely a drawback than any kind of benefit.\r\n\r\nI loved the performances, everybody was good and so the CGI, which was not a top notch yet acceptable. Especially as it takes place in the dark time, they had the advantage to depict the atmosphere as much as close to how it would have looked 65 years ago and as well to avoid the errors.\r\n\r\nI never saw its trailer or the teaser, but I knew about this project and after seeing its posters I though it would be about the offshore oil rig. When I saw the film, I realised I was wrong and surprise do such thing happen in real.\r\n\r\nThe film was also did not let my interest fall. Thanks to the director who always try different genre yet he's not a mega budget filmmaker. A good film, but like I said should have been even better. Especially should have out classed in the sentimental segments. I don't know how good was the digital 3D version of it, but still this regular version is worth to give it a shot.\r\n\r\n7\u00bd\/10","id":"5752f1ab9251414c5d002e58","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5752f1ab9251414c5d002e58","movie_id":300673}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The war and the cinema!**\r\n\r\nThe film was based on the book and about filmmaking, particularly screen writing. Fictional comedy-drama that is set in London in 1940. While the war tearing apart the nation, some people are not disturbed by it. They are going ahead with their film projects, especially war themed to boost the people's confidence. That's when the new arrival, Mrs. Cole, begins her career as a writer. So her experience working with the scripts, meeting the real people whose story are getting adapted and her gloomy romance, everything lets us know.\r\n\r\nA nice film and a little different than the majority of the film that came this year. The focus was good. I mean while bombs falling from the sky, all this tale concentrated was film business. Something like 'Argo', but given less preference to the war, except its consequences which diverted their plan in some scenario. So there were many small-small twist and turns. It also gets emotional at one stage. A well written and directed film similar to what the film characters did their best in the story.\r\n\r\nGemma was good, but Claflin was totally different, in a good way. As much as I enjoyed, I also thought it should have been even better. Because thematically it was not for everyone. I mean the world war was a good idea, but the filmmaking was not like you are usually familiar with. Besides, it was not a laughing out loud comedy. Between the seriousness of war and fun around making films, the combination was rare and well worked out. Those who love pre 50s, 40s settings in a film would enjoy it for sure. Especially if they like films about films.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"59cadd27c3a3687797005590","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59cadd27c3a3687797005590","movie_id":340101}

So we see a dark horror film with so much emptiness everywhere across the film. But personally, what I never forgive, is when characters act absurdly.

So that means this girl was born without empathy, kindness and all those basic human attributes.\r\nFrom this point, I am convinced both the father, the mother never behaved like normal human beings.\r\nAnd I don't want to think about what goes on in this film, how this little girl maintains a daily life.\r\nIn the end, even we saw police cars straight heading to the insane psychopath's house. I was thinking, a woman, lived years in such prison, who we found in a scene she has become speech impaired, somehow able to tell the exact place under couple of hours of being rescued.\r\nAnother unusual yet terrible thing is when the insane psychopath, who I absolutely have no sympathy for, when was performing rough surgery, the victims didn't even scream. I really cannot imagine what was in the director's mind before making such a story or scene.\r\nWe see full shots, sometimes narrow shots through windows, or typically entrance of doorways. I appreciate the cinematography and the way it is directed but there is nothing new about it that we haven't seen before and nothing good about it that we haven't felt before.","id":"5aacf6970e0a26783000f624","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5aacf6970e0a26783000f624","movie_id":371560}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**When a veterinarian meets a doctor.**\r\n\r\nNot for the current generation, the film was at least 20 years late. On the other hand, I think the direction is not good. Even the casting looks so bad. There are lots of big names for the women characters. Even for the tiny roles, Maggie Grace and Alexandra Daddario appeared. And I could not find one good male actor, apart from Tom Wilkinson. Sorry to say, but the lead actor was not the perfect choice. Besides, I find Teresa Palmer was over-performed her parts. If you have seen many romance flicks, you will find it clich\u00e9 in the many segments.\r\n\r\nIt was based on the book of the same name written by the 'The Notbeook' author. It is his another signature romance tale, but somewhat different from all his books those made into the films. I did not come here to write bad about it, but I could not find any good stuffs about it to give some credits. Maybe the location was great and music. The fun part is, I did not know anything about it, so when I decided to watch, I saw the poster and assumed it was a lesbian theme. Funny, but disappointed after realising the mistake.\r\n\r\nStill, some of the dialogues were below par, not romantic when those were delivered and then there're some silly scenes like the dog finding the lost object, including its following event. Those things make it more a supernatural film than actual world romance. The film is for a selected audience, I'm sure the film will find its audience today, tomorrow or even decades to come. But there will be people like me on the corner who say the film is not good, so ignore them if you really want to try it and decide yourself.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"57ed84a0c3a3686d05000292","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ed84a0c3a3686d05000292","movie_id":330483}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**About two cops who caught in a messed up illegal arms deal.**\r\n\r\nIt is a cop film that's set in in a small US town along the Mexican Border.

So one of their men was sent to eliminate those involved in it and that's where these two cops are caught in a crossfire. They have left no choice but to fight for the peace in the town.\r\n\r\nThe Idea for the film was inspired from real, but I kind of felt it was unrealistic. Mainly because I'm not from that part of the world, so it was more an entertaining film than learning anything about all the illegal activities or the heroism from the cops. The actors were decent, including Patrick Wilson, but Ian McShane looked much better than anybody in the film for his daring role.\r\n\r\nIt was a simple story that takes place like within 2-3 days. Some parts of the film were unexpected, but those scenes did not save the film. Because it was entirely 'a series of event' based film than properly developed storyline.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> When a nanny meets a boy who is a weird toy.\r\n\r\nSo this is the other 'The Boy'. The last year film was a thriller-drama, but this is a horror-mystery. It feels like watching a classic horror film, especially because of the English atmosphere and the house where it was shot. A young American woman named Greta, takes up a nanny job in England to escape from the troubled relationship with her boyfriend. She discovers the boy she has to look out is a doll and later she observes a series of strange events that leads her to find out the truth. The dark secret comes out and that's the film.\r\n\r\nA limited cast film. The suspense was the key to the story narrating successfully. So I expected a big twist at the end, but it was a decent one and the overall film was just above average. The atmosphere was creepy, and then it weakened as the development was decelerated going to the second and the final act. Until the twist, it was good and after that a bit disappointing. Not because of the bad conclusion, but comparing it with the rest, especially after the anticipation it created in us, that end part looked so small and simple. Good film to watch for once, but like the most of the horror films, it's fallen short to get my thumbs up.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"5737586792514115a1000acc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5737586792514115a1000acc","movie_id":321258}

Well I just watched _The Jungle Book_, and I found all three of those compliments to be patently untrue. That might sound like three issues, but in reality they all boil down to the same one thing, suspension of disbelief. Or more accurately, the lack of it. From the word go, there wasn't s moment that I found myself being continuously drawn out of the story because of one of those reasons (usually the look of the creatures). I was not once able to fully engage, and though I recognise that from a plot point of view, this version was even better than the 1967 one, I still found myself constantly aggravated by the harsh meshing of Mowgli against the world around him.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Not quite for me, but I definitely get the appeal._","id":"57c9773d9251415e9f0005e1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c9773d9251415e9f0005e1","movie_id":278927}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Incomplete lessons and unexpected events of a girl's life!**\r\n\r\nThe film story has a deeper thought than just what you see it as a psychological drama. Everything is simply like what the title says. A young woman grew up in an isolated farmhouse with her father without many visitors. But her interest in the eyes came from her mother who was a surgeon killed by an intruder. So her character was built on those circumstances and where her future head is to come in the later parts.\r\n\r\nThe concept looked much better, but the film was too slow, even though it was a little shorter than the average film runtime. It is also a black and white film, and looked fine for such theme. Even though there were not strong gore. Limited cast and shot most of the parts is a single location and its surroundings. So it is a small budget film with good casting. But I'm having a mixed feeling for it. I think some would like it, and some wouldn't, but the majority would be like me stand in the middle.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> The red flower adventure!\r\n\r\nThe Rudyard Kipling's famous children's book was adapted numerous times for stage shows, television series, live-shot and animation films, and now here's the modern version and also the first digital 3D version. The Disney done it again bring all the classics to a new life, but it is a great team work, especially the post-production was terrific.\r\n\r\nIt is one of those stories never gets boring for repeat reading\/listening\/viewing. Of course, there were plenty of changes to the original source, but I would say it was upgraded so well. Jon Favreau did an awesome job as the director, definitely it is his one of the best films and will be remembered for very long. All the above he got the best screenplay with supportive production and crew.\r\n\r\nNeel Sethi was obviously a perfect choice for the man-cub, he had given his best and no one could doubt it was his first film. The entire film was shot in the studio settings and the whole time he had to act alone, because the remaining characters in the film are CGI. So in that viewpoint he actually did a breathtaking job being a very young.\r\n\r\nThe CGI characters were really excellent, but the non-fur animals like elephant looked a bit fake. I mean anatomically and character performances were perfect, only visually the 3D models were out of the blend in the screen with others. These are very small things to notice, but for the todays technology, it was not bad, especially thinking the film is primarily targeted children.\r\n\r\nThe story was simple, like half of the film was an introduction and almost all the important characters from the book were launched at a high profile. It was actually the story with a backdrop of red flower. So the narration moves different part of the jungle, lot like the levels in a game. Various adventures take place and well composed stunt sequences.\r\n\r\nI mentioned stunts right, but there were no violences, I mean nothing seriously to concern about as expected for a Disney film. Yet because of those actions, the film is very much suitable for adult viewing. So apart from the children and families, it can be watched by anyone. One of the top Disney films to do best at the box office worldwide by grabbing almost $1b.\r\n\r\nSo aggressive, furious Shere Khan ever to portray. I think the little children may get scared for his unpleasant face look and the strong roar. By the way all the songs were amazing and the end credit was very interesting. Finally, I saw it after a long wait and anticipation, most importantly, I'm very happy how beautifully it was made.\r\n\r\nThe film was not shot in India, but the locations were so resembling and gives the perfect Indian feel. Climbing a cliff by Baloo and fighting the monkeys, like that there were numerous jokes. Surely one of the grandly made children's film at the recent time. I've heard the sequel is already on the progress, so bring it on, at least a trilogy before Neel turn to a big boy.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"57c8b6e1c3a3685be9000cf5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c8b6e1c3a3685be9000cf5","movie_id":278927}

The director doesn\u2019t fail to highlight her beauty (not talkin\u2019 \u2019bout nudity; he uses another actress for that). Despite a couple cavils (like the idiotic masturbation scene and how Pete wanders through the woods to the exact abode where James is delivering mail), it\u2019s very good for the first two acts, but then it devolves into a dull and gross bloody ritual with the requisite tedious gobbledygook. Then there\u2019s the \u201cshocking\u201d final scene that\u2019s too absurd to be taken seriously (think the eye-rolling ending of \u201cSharknado\u201d).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the writer\/director is clearly talented and will go on to great things if he perseveres.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**About the first such incident in the US history.**\r\n\r\nIt was like another documentary film that I saw one last week. But this time it was an even bigger scale. This, the original event took place exactly 50 years ago and first of its kind. Since then hundreds of similar events have been recorded. Many of them were made into films, but I don't remember this one was ever turned into one. This is about a raged gunman on the college campus, where many people got killed and injured. A shocking incident, even cops did not know how to handle it at first.\r\n\r\nSo, the film reveals one of the most horrific episodes ever happened in the American soil. Like everything has a first time, this is where it all began for this kind of event. The filmmakers used some of the original archive footage to tell the story, but the majority of the film was the animation. Since it was a documentary film and was made under a tight budget, the visuals were not that pleasant, but the notion was well achieved.\r\n\r\nDocumentary films and interviews are like thunder and lightening. So there are interviews in it, but most of them were made-up of. I mean they were real, though not with the real people, except their recorded voice interviews in most of the cases. It was challenging to bring back the original event on the screen since it is not a feature film to recreate whatever way they want, especially that occurred half a century ago. But very appreciable for even giving us this much of detail to feel the vibe.\r\n\r\n> \u275dOne of the truths I have learnt is that there are monsters that walk among us.\u275e\r\n\r\nIt was like any other normal day on the campus of the University of Texas in Austin. But the scenario has suddenly changed when two student couple fell on the ground not aware of what just happened, and so the people around. After some time, it became clear that a gunman open fired on them and many others from a nearby tower, but the real issue is nobody could see him. Soon it reached the radio and television, and alert has been circulated. Then the cops got involved to solve the matter and how it all ends covered in the rest of the films.\r\n\r\nThis is a good film, revealed most of the parts as much as in details, but I'm not fully convinced. Because the concept of narration was quite similar to feature film style where they want to keep the mystery. It all begins with one perspective and multiplies as it progresses. Except not focusing enough on the negative character. I understood the situation of the event, but I did not get enough detail about the gunman. It was like one side of the story. So mysterious and it stayed that way.\r\n\r\nShorter and well paced. This is definitely worth checking out, though not a must see. To learn the history, the bad one. I had no idea about it prior to watch, but at the end, I felt it accomplished everything on its capacity to give out the truth. No matter it is a documentary film, along with the suspense, the tension was well balanced. So, more or less it is same as like watching a regular crime film. That's especially for those who are not into documentary films. I hope someone would make a feature film out of it.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"592889ccc3a36877bc0436db","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/592889ccc3a36877bc0436db","movie_id":381028}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**What do you think is worth living for?**\r\n\r\nI had tough time to figure it out what was the thing on the poster. Seeing it upside down, with mirror, name it, I used all the tricks I know, but nothing had worked. On the other hand, I thought it might be a fantasy film with a King Kong like creature. That's the curiosity it created, people to a have different opinions and forget to expect from the film. But it was a simple comedy-drama and only way to solve the mystery is to watch the film. That's what I finally did.\r\n\r\nThe opening scene was good. But I did not think the whole film would be like that. It was about a prankster and his attempts to reach his workaholic daughter, which was the entire narration. A lifetime trip for them, that's not about the challenges in the world or the nature, but their self-discovery, the meaning of life and purpose. This is one of the beautiful films to open up about a father and daughter relationship. In the grown-up world, the people forget to live the actual life, when they give all the focus to their professional life.\r\n\r\nI have to agree, this is a competitive world and you will be replaced by millions of other waiting behind you for such opportunity. But does it all worth doing is the real question. Doubts like that won't arise without those who love us pointing it out. It needs to be asked properly, politely. But some people take an alternate route like in this film. Sometimes it ends in an unexpected adventure to just realise what they are into. And this film was honest, to reveal as much as it can in many angles.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of Winfried. An aged and divorced music teacher who makes practical jokes to people around him. After his dog died, he decides to reconnect with his only daughter Ines, who is now working in Romania. She is on the cusp to get her desired position in the office. On her one final push for that, is now getting distracted by her father. She who never understood her father's way of life, tries to get an answer out of him about the life. So that's where their journey begins. Some of the bold steps taken by them, the film accomplishes what it wanted to tell us in a unique way.\r\n\r\n> \"The problem is it's so often about getting things done. You do this, You do that. And in the meantime, life just passes by.\"\r\n\r\nThe film was actually loosely based by the director's own father. The writing was brilliant. It reminded me 'Infinitely Polar Bear', because these women directors inspired by their fathers to show the world how their childhood was like. The actors were amazing, particularly those two in the main roles. I liked them both equally. From the different angle, they have given different performances. There's no surprise if you liked the film only because of them.\r\n\r\nThe film had won many prestigious awards around the globe and now its biggest stand off is at the 2017 Oscars which is a few weeks away. Another Scandinavian film, which is also nominated for the Oscar, is also about an old man like this one. But I think 'Under Sandet' is the frontrunner for the golden statue. Because we all know that America's and Academy's sentimental towards the WWII.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to rating, the film is strictly for adults. It was good in the initial parts, but there are some surprise nude and sex scenes. At that time I thought it lost its path, but actually that was the turning point where you are going to witness a different half of the film. Surely many people going love the second half more than the first.\r\n\r\nAt first, it looked like it is a German version of 'The Family Fang', but only more realistic with dark humour. It's difficult to understand every scene, especially in the first watch. Because without knowing the film characters, the events involving them look casual. Capable to get the sense of humour is the key here. So if you decide for the second time viewing, you will learn more about it. It is one of those films that second time watch necessary for some people.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I did not think it was a great film, just after finish my watch. But thinking back about all those film events, made sense. By the time I decided to write this review, I was in its favour. That's the reason I won't write about the films right away. This is a great film, but you have to focus closely and understand everything, then you will have a great time. But remember, it is one of the longest film in the recent time, particularly for a comedy-drama, yet enjoyable.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"If he gave a race-against-time thriller with his debut film, Tamizhukku En 1-Ai Azhuthavum, with Pokkiri Raja, Ramprakash Rayappa gives us a masala movie that blends together comedy, history, and Stephen Chow-ish fantasy.\r\n\r\nThe plot revolves around Sanjeevi (a somewhat jaded Jiiva) and his yawns, which are super contagious (they make an entire office sleepy). This often results in him being removed from his job. When he lends a helping hand to his colleague and girlfriend Sunita (Hansika, who gets close-up shots despite her bad lip-sync) in stopping men from urinating in public, he shames Cooling Glass Guna (Sibiraj, commendable as the comic villain), a gangster, and later, his yawn, which has become so forceful that it can shatter glass and throw people off the ground, also leads to Guna losing his eyesight. Sanjeevi comes to know of the history behind the power of his yawn, but Guna, who has regained sight, wants revenge.\r\n\r\nPokkiri Raja is frustrating in quite a few stretches as instead of focussing on his main plot, Rayappa wastes time with unnecessary songs, a comedy track that is as cliched as casting Mano Bala as an office boss, and a romantic track that is lazily written. The hero set his eyes on the white-skinned heroine and starts to take an interest in her; and when he sees her doing social work (something that most Tamil film heroines seem to do), he instantly falls in love with her.\r\n\r\nBut the film starts to find its feet. Sanjeevi's yawning problem gets an explanation (though it is also contradictory to what we are initially led to believe \u2014 that it could be fatal), and Rayappa uses this problem entirely for comic effect even into the climax, so the tone of the film remains light-hearted. And some of the set-ups of the previous scenes also have their payoff here \u2014 like Guna's henchmen believing that it is the ghost of the possessed woman he had murdered earlier being responsible for his loss of eyesight. Even the extended scene which involves Guna, who has got back his eyesight, discovering his sidekicks' attitude towards him is funny and Ramdas aces this scene. Ultimately, it is such constant stream of laughs in the second half make up for a first half full of yawns.","id":"56ebee29c3a368225100247c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56ebee29c3a368225100247c","movie_id":369939}

Just like another 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story'. If you like the combination of music and comedy, this is for you. I think the writing was the best thing, even the lyrics of the songs. The directors did their part very well, but in the end it was the actors who saved the film. Andy Samberg was splendid.\r\n\r\nThe film was narrated in a documentary style like a series of interviews which also includes behind scenes, I mean unedited clips like the live recording. It is the story of three members of a famous band in America. When everything was going well for them, the split happens unexpectedly. So the main singer decides to go solo and sees some success. But he struggles through his girlfriend and their marriage plans, and also he finds some issue with his manager. You know the makeover begins, how he comes back to his normal life was the remaining film.\r\n\r\nIt is not anybody's biography, but you should still watch it. The storytelling is not preoccupied with the drugs and sexes, though there are some amounts, which makes it is good viewing for the adults. Don't think it is some silly comedy, lots of things from it makes sense. You can enjoy the music and at a time you would have some laughs. Well balanced contents and overall it is a rare comedy.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"57f40e16c3a36805ac0002c4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57f40e16c3a36805ac0002c4","movie_id":341012}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**He who became a people's hero by betraying his own nation!**\r\n\r\nI had like to begin by saying I'm not an American and I haven't seen the Oscar winning documentary 'Citizenfour'. But I'm very much aware of everything about it through the all kinds of coverages. So my perspective about the film will be true and about the content will be neutral. I have known about what this film dealt since the day it all began. I did not care much, but there are things to concern about it. Like if it is necessary to tap to prevent the serious threats, there's nothing wrong it that. Because, even if they have our private contents, they are not going to publish it or make money out of it. So that makes what Ed did was unethical and betrayal for his own country.\r\n\r\nIn another angle, NSA's illegal surveillance questionable in many ways, but wrong is only a tiny thing. Because eyeing every single one of us seems wrong, though without examining all, nothing confirms, differentiate between right and wrong. So coming to the film, it was decently made one. The main reason is it was too long and many parts were boring. The theme was powerful like it was a one liner, but the film contents were very weak. Except Snowden passing the security, the rest of the story like why he did, including his personal life, particularly his romance was not good enough to make a film. This is very much suitable for a documentary than a feature film.\r\n\r\nBut I liked the actors. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was good, but not great. If he gets the Oscars nod, that's only because of the issue which the film inspired by, not because his phenomenal character display. The direction was decent, but not the screenplay. The film is not for everyone, but I recommend it to all as a must see. The main reason why you should watch it is to educate yourself. To learn what they are doing and how. Particularly, you will definitely come to know how to avoid being eyed by the government in a simple way. So that's a good thing than whining over what homeland security does to protect the nation. It is not an inspiring biopic, or a masterpiece, but don't miss it for any cost.\r\n\r\nP.S. Whatever the form of the governments, the nations won't stop doing what in this film they said was wrong. Because there's no Edward Snowden in every nation to expose it. In that perspective, the US was really embarrassed for their own man letting them down. The China is the number one in this kind of activity. The point is, these things happening right now or not, but should never come to public notice like that happened in here, never should leave the compound. Suppose if we come to know, we will protect, at least in the democratic countries that's what we do. But not to forget it also safeguards us. That means it is like the stars and planets on the sky that we watch and take notes, but they are untouchable. We only monitor them for threats like asteroids and fractionally thinking about the alien invasion.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"585eda00c3a3681a770125a0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/585eda00c3a3681a770125a0","movie_id":302401}
{"author":"CRCulver","content":"Jim Jarmusch's 2016 film PATERSON is a study of everyday life in a small American city. Its title refers on one hand to its setting of Paterson, New Jersey, much less known abroad than other towns in the state but a surprising number of prominent Americans hailed from there and it was eulogized in an epic-length work by the poet William Carlos Williams. On the other hand, Paterson is coincidentally the last name of our protagonist, a thirty-something bus driver played by Adam Driver.\r\n\r\nThe film is a day-by-day account of one week in Paterson's life and in fact each day is rather the same: Paterson wakes up, kisses his wife (played by Golshifteh Farahani), goes to work driving the bus, comes home, eats dinner with his wife, takes the dog for a walk, and has a beer at the local bar. Yet Paterson also has an unusual hobby: for some time he has written poetry during each day's lunch break, and he has filled a small notebook with poems that his wife calls wonderful, but which he has never shown to anyone else.\r\n\r\nThere is a plot to Paterson, that is, an increasing of tension and a sudden and jarring climax, but overall Jarmusch is not aiming for any grand and intricate storytelling here. Instead, he is intentionally trying to capture the quiet music of one ordinary person's existence. Or should I say, two ordinary people's existence, for the film sympathetically captures this couple's marriage. Their relationship is a simple, uncomplicated one of trust and mutual understanding. Paterson is extremely fortunate to have this, as events around him show. (The script is by Sara Driver, Jarmusch's partner of decades, and one might see the film as a hymn to their own special relationship.) Many viewers are likely to find this heartwarming, while other viewers in more fraught marriages might burn with jealousy at Paterson and his wife's incredible harmony.\r\n\r\nThose familiar with Jarmusch's earlier work know that he has always liked to show a great deal of urban blight before the camera, such as vacant lots overgrown with weeds and graffitied walls. For Jarmusch, these backdrops supposedly served as a counterweight to the typical Hollywood depictions of the USA as all glitz, and it helped to underscore the bohemian qualities of his characters. Yet this blight surprisingly absent here. Paterson, New Jersey is instead shown as a clean and fairly prosperous town. Its residents, regardless of socioeconomic status or race, are depicted as rather content people.\r\n\r\nIn fact, at regular points in the film Jarmusch depicts interactions between whites and African-Americans or between gays and straights as if celebrating our new modern era when all those old divisions don't matter any more. This is definitely the most optimistic film that Jarmusch has ever shot, but this utopian vision does come across as a little heavy-handed and one feels that Jarmusch is overlooking pressing social issues that continue to hold many people back. Watching this film, I couldn't help but protest that this gentrified setting is not all of America, just a privileged few. \r\n\r\nStill, in spite of the film's flaws, the depiction of married life and the way that poetry is worked into the story is very moving, and I do feel this is worth watching, at least for established Jarmusch fans or those comfortable with indie cinema.","id":"5b53a0789251411f84018ab9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b53a0789251411f84018ab9","movie_id":370755}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Crusoe and Girl Friday.\r\n\r\nPretty much reviled by professional critics, Passengers has overcome that to hold affection with a good portion of the sci-fi loving public. More safe sci-fi footings than anything remotely ground breaking, it ends up a a tidy romantic piece that's laced with pertinent questions involving man and his\/her reactions to extraordinary scenario's.\r\n\r\nAlthough the viewer is for the most part hankering for action to explode off the screen, it's only when - in the film's last quarter - you realise that it was actually working fine as a character study without the fireworks.\r\n\r\nChris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence have bunches of charisma, in fact more than enough to carry the story through its more shaky elements. They in turn are aided by Michael Sheen who is perfectly cast as the Android (not Robot!) bartender Arthur.\r\n\r\nThe effects work is impressive and director Morten Tyldum stitches the set pieces together admirably, the highlight being a rather superb gravity loss sequence. While the sound mix is also to be applauded.\r\n\r\nNewcomers should expect a Robinson Crusoe love story in space as opposed to a sci-fi actioner, though one with more cerebral strains than at first hinted, because then the pic delivers a good time and adds to what is turning out to be a rather great decade for sci-fi fans. 7\/10","id":"59b534679251410f92000a8f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59b534679251410f92000a8f","movie_id":274870}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Terrorism has a religion and we all know which one!**\r\n\r\nOne of the best films recently I have seen. It was based on the real. About the 2013 Boston marathon bombing. This film was an eye opener for me. I mean all I knew was the marathon bombing, but I came to know that was only half, the other half was even more serious events that stretched for like a week after the original event.\r\n\r\nThe best part of the film was, there were no solo heroes in this story. Everybody contributed in some way to fight against the evil. The screenplay was shared by all the great actors, even small role ones equally. I loved how it all went on, as a team from different forces, but tackled the situation by joining the hands. I don't know it was only the film, but very impressive. That's patriotism!\r\n\r\nIn the opening, you could see different people from different places of Boston preparing for the big event. And then they all end up in the same place where a series of explosion goes up. Quickly the security agencies come together and investigate it. With a small clue, kicks starts the manhunt. This is the part I loved it. Hunting pisslam pigs are always so pleasure to watch.\r\n\r\nSuspense, thriller, the story was well paced and took forward with a wonderful ending. Awesome direction. Another hit in a single year alongside 'Deepwater Horizon'. Interesting, Wahlberg involved in both these films. I've also heard that the two screenplays was merged to make a single film. One was a drama and the other one was an action packed story. That's why it was well balanced between everything. From individual's story to together in the events. A must see film.\r\n\r\n_8.5\/10_","id":"59fe19ba92514146bd0246ba","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59fe19ba92514146bd0246ba","movie_id":388399}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A space-travel tale!**\r\n\r\nI was going to watch it, but not expecting it to be a masterpiece. It was not, yet surprised to be a lot better film when it comes to todays film overcrowded with space themes. The entire story takes place on a spaceship. It's a space journey tale, when the mankind with 5,000 on-board heading for a new home planet, but one of them unexpectedly wakes up from his hibernation pod. It's supposed to wake him and everybody a few months before their destination, so now he's up nearly a century early, and what he plans to do is what the adventures covered in the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nThere's no connection to the 2008 film of the same name. Initially I thought it was like a live-action version of 'Wall-E'. Not entirely, only a few scenes and the main two characters remind Wall-E and Eva. It is also a limited cast film and I loved the simple screenplay, but strong enough to be one of the best in its kind. The actors were very good. The visuals were beautiful, a perfect film for the late night to watch alone peacefully.\r\n\r\nFrom the Norwegian director of 'Headhunters' fame. This is not his Hollywood debut, but previously he had got an Oscar nomination for the film 'The Imitation Game'. The concept was like 'The Blue Lagoon' or kind of the space version of the Eden Garden tale. I had predicted a few scenes, those were too simple to do that. The real big thing came in the later part, especially when all the focus shifts to more than the initial narration. Scientifically, not everything believable, but cinematically, anything can be possible. So with a such concept, the film headed to the conclusion where a twist came into play. Entertainment is guaranteed. One of the year's best that should not be missed.

The basic plot involves a time traveler who goes one hour into the future and finds most of his colleagues dead. He then travels back in time to prevent that outcome from ever occurring.\r\n\r\nThe movie is not particularly well acted and has a definite low budget feel. There is quite a bit of cursing that almost seems forced to make it seem edgy. If you like time travel movies, you will still enjoy Paradox.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A week with a bus driver, a part time poet.**\r\n\r\nThe time Jim Jarmusch has struck back. He does not make films often, but those he makes are not easily forgettable. I don't think people hate his films, especially the grown ups. They know how hard the real life is and contents this filmmaker use for his flicks are not much different. But the thing is, in his style, adding a slight fun, romantic, poetic, all together works so well. I still remember how I become his fan after watching 'Stranger Than Paradise'.\r\n\r\nAs usual, he wrote the story for this film. Even if he had to borrow from another source, the screenplay is generally his. For this film, it was original and that's what worked out awesomely. But he had to borrow some poems from his favourite poet, Ron Padgett. A great team work, because when their work came together, the film became a masterpiece. It was nothing less than any literature, for sure. Definitely this film should turn into a book. The readers deserve their own imagination of this tale.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a man's life in a week's time. Starts from Monday and ends on next Monday. So, his name's Paterson, a bus driver from the city of Paterson. A happily married man, and love his profession. In the meantime, he's a poet. He has kept a book where he writes his poems, especially during his lunch time, even in the small breaks when he gets. His mind's always filled with thoughts. Chanting words, verses.\r\n\r\nHis inspirations are the places he goes through his bus and the strangers who ride in his bus. Their each others conversation about their lives and experiences is his motivation. His wife is an interesting character too. Sadly, she was not focused as much as he was. Though there are enough scenes to enjoy the role. But I think she deserves her solo film, from another angle, about her life, her hobby which her husband backs.\r\n\r\nIt's a simple, normal life. Without much trouble, a peaceful life the most people would ask for. The film is not everything about him. But he's the centre of the story. When other, one time characters enter the screen. It's because of his presence around them. Hence some interesting facts revealed. Just like our life when we ride a public transport where we come in to contact with many passengers coming and going in different stops. But all the above, what they talk, which we, everybody in the bus listen without hesitation. Paterson is a person who learns every day out of that.\r\n\r\n> \u275dPoetry in translation is like taking a shower with a raincoat on.\u275e\r\n\r\nHis other activity is walking his dog out at every night. It's an opportunity for him to mix with some friends at the pub he had made with frequent visits. The place which has its own story as the film progresses. So all these stuffs keeps repeating every day like what we call a mechanical life. But Paterson is neither enjoying it nor depressed over. He usually does best out of the given time and place. The difference is, not every day are same. Even a slight change in order of activity brings a new thing in. His wife insists him to publish his works. But the narration strikes with an unexpected twist before the end.\r\n\r\nI have said many times when I liked the films I have watched that they are so poetic. But it's very rare to find a film from top to bottom being very poetic. Recently I saw one, in fact, two from Japan known as 'Little Forest' duology. And now this one. Particularly if you love poetry or if you are yourself a poet, then this is a must see. Surely you would love it. As well as a good film to gift to any such person you know in your life. Believe me, this film is like a wine bottle. As it gets older, it will turn the best. I have already changed my stance twice and rated better every time. I consider it is a bit low rated right now. But only time will answer to that.\r\n\r\nFor me, it is the director's top 3 films. I have seen Adam Driver in many films, he's not considered a solo lead actor, because of marketing purpose. But he's really good which proved in this flick. So it is his best performance I have seen so far. He really took the driving classes to learn drive the bus to perfect his character. That's the dedication the creator of the film expects from his cast. How much I loved it means, I'm eager for a sequel, despite knowing this kind of films are one-off. Otherwise, I'll be happy if the director and him join the hands once more time for a new project.\r\n\r\nVery slow moving tale. But not a boring film. If I had watched it when I was a teenager, I don't think I would have felt similarly. From middle aged people to the older ones, they are the target audience. In order to see and feel what this film reveals, one must have experience in real life. Hence, not all the youngsters, particularly the teenagers would thumb up. In my world, this kind of films is the Oscar worthy. I would have surely nominated the film, as well as the director and the lead actor. So by now you would have learnt what my final word could be.

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"If you appreciate the delicacies of a quiet, slice-of-life dramedy that hinges on the edginess of minimal observations of routine life as an artistic examination then you are in for a delectable treat with the skillful and witty inflections of writer\/director Jim Jarmusch\u2019s whimsical and wry offering **Paterson**. Jarmusch, known for his quirky and sedated dramas that include the highly underrated 2005 Bill Murray vehicle _Broken Flowers_ and 2009\u2019s _The Limits of Control_, is back to add to his familiar repertoire of solemn filmmaking with an admirable character study of an Everyday man named Paterson (Adam Driver, \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d) trying to balance a structured, day-by-day existence with poetic leanings as his measurement of escapism. Remember, this is Jim Jarmusch\u2019s isolated cinematic world where experiencing one of his big screen creations is much like living in an insulated bubble with meditation whale sounds to ease your tension\u2026you just need to go with the slow pacing and appreciate the nuances of its resonance. In fact, the only recent radical submission from Jarmusch is this year\u2019s documentary _Gimmie Danger_ and that is even riddled with mild-like rawness.\r\n\r\nConsequently, **Paterson** is the type of off-kilter, contemplative and quaint motion picture that begs one to check their excitement at the door. The flashiness of Jarmusch\u2019s creative overtones is ironically the low-key blueprint of the film\u2019s leading protagonist Paterson (the man) and urban setting (Paterson, New Jersey\u2013the city that shares the same name with Driver\u2019s blue-collar characterization). Dutifully, the film allows the audience to ride the waves of the repetitive conformity of a man seemingly going through the motions in life from the perspective of a married working stiff whose occasional stimulation besides his lovely wife Laura (Iranian-born actress Golshifteh Farahani) and four-legged adorable bulldog Marvin is his need to write poetry in his trusted notebook of eloquent thoughts. It certainly helps that the hometown bearing his moniker that surrounds him as he regularly drives the bus each day carrying the familiar and not-so-familiar faces as they are carted off to their various destinations acts as a steady stream for inspiration.\r\n\r\nSome will relate to Paterson\u2019s stillborn existence of repeating his daily agenda for work and leisurely downtime while others may dread the tedious notion of being so predictable and practical as this disciplined city bus driver has mastered so effortlessly. The scheduled outline never deviates for Paterson as he gets up early at the same time, goes to work while cruising the same bus routes, returns home to his fetching spouse Laura for dinnertime then walks Marvin to the local bar for his taste of a mug of beer to ease the tensions of the work day. It does need repeating that Paterson must engage in his passages of poetry\u2013something that he does not miss a beat on for sure.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, Laura is also an odd duck whose own sense of head-scratching regimen actually rivals that of her husband\u2019s day-by-day customs. Laura has dreams and does not hesitate in throwing herself into random activities that give her a sense of anticipated rush and reason to follow with faithful conviction. With the obsessive black-and-white coloring schemes in clothing, food and furniture that perversely pleases her Laura longs for the personal satisfaction that feels as therapeutic for her as the reliable quirks does for Paterson as well. Together, they march to the bizarre beat of their own drums. However, the dichotomy in their philosophical lives clash as Paterson is a creature that does not cozy of to change whereas Laura embraces her urges for different challenges whenever they come into fruition.\r\n\r\nOne may find it quite difficult to celebrate **Paterson** because it is an intimate film with a small-scale mentality that dares to look at the lives of ordinary, married people as they shift through their livelihood tainted with tiny triumphs and trying times. Nevertheless, at the box office office where superheroes, zombies and continuous _Star Wars_ installments reign supreme there can be something said for cheeky melodramas such as **Paterson** that draws its imaginative scope on solid storytelling with the concentration on hard-working, flawed people just trying to take on the day for the moment.\r\n\r\nIn a sentimental and subtly sharp performance, Driver is effectively potent as Paterson, a poetic pariah that translates the rhythms of his beloved city and people into a notebook that speaks his lyrical language. He is who he is and is unapologetic about his mission to adhere to anything different than what he is already used to that persists. Also, the beautiful Farahani is a revelation in her own right as the free-spirit with various whims that entail baking cupcakes one minute or arranging drapes the very next minute. The supporting characters are refreshingly realized especially when the spotlight settles in on the small tavern where Paterson systematically nurses his one beer all week long. And even the gruff but treasured Marvin (as played by the late canine actor Nellie) fits so handsomely into the saga of these ordinary folks relaxing in their own arbitrary skin. As simplistic as the poet Paterson is at heart and soul Jarmusch is shrewd to suggest that perhaps the hidden complexities of his expressive leading man is more explosive than what is let on throughout the narrative. Indeed, the mysterious nature of Driver\u2019s devoted transit worker is a curiosity worth speculating over.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there is nothing wrong with worshiping car chases, alien attacks or enjoying the occasion teen sex farce. Still, whenever there is warranted shelf room for a sublime, insightful look at under-the-radar celebrations of casual lives, love and checkered eccentricities than the Jim Jarmusches and Terrence Malicks of the cinema world are welcomed to the table of film fodder that moves and grooves on its old-fashioned, unique purpose more relatable than your doomsday delight of resident space invaders.\r\n\r\n**Paterson** (2016)\r\n\r\nAmazon Studios\/Animal Kingdom\/Bleecher Street Media\/Inkjet Productions\r\n\r\n1 hr. 55 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Adam Driver, Goldshifteh Farahani, Method Man\r\n\r\nDirected and Written by: Jim Jarmusch\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy\/Drama\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nCritic's Rating: **** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016","id":"58623b6fc3a3681a72042bcf","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58623b6fc3a3681a72042bcf","movie_id":370755}

I knew it was too early to judge it, so I was not expecting anything extraordinary and then it struck me with its progress, I was clean bowled by its style and cuteness. I don't what others think, but this is John Carney's masterpiece according to me. I liked his other films, but this is something I think a perfect dose of contents. In two words to say it is a Golden Touch. I rarely like music and musical films, and it had been long since one I had enjoyed very much like this. Definitely this should be one of the top ten films of the years.\r\n\r\nThis is an Irish-British film that is set in the Dublin, 1985. It is about a high school boy named Conor, who just got transferred from a private school to a free state-run boy's school after his parents imposed a plan on the budget cut. New school and problems are ahead where he has to come out of it on his own. During getting used to it, he meets a girl who lives nearby the school and to impress her, he lies that he has a band and looking for a female singer. So then he forms one with the amateur musicians and the journey begins for these teenagers that reveals in the remaining film how long they are willing to go.\r\n\r\n> \"Your problem is that you're not happy being sad. But that's what love is, Cosmo. Happy-sad.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the final scene, there is a note that says 'For brothers everywhere'. I was impressed by that, because I did not pay attention on that while watching the film. What I meant was, this is not some teenage love story, actually it was about the brothers, but overshadowed by romance theme. I recalled my memories on those parts and quickly realised the centre of the story that how it was developed. The one who played the older brother of Conor simply looked alike Seth Rogan and that is the character you have to watch out for. He's only a supporting character, but the impact was indirectly larger on the story.\r\n\r\nOf course, falling in love might make you do crazy things, even you can become a rockstar overnight. But there's a first step for everything and it is not assured that you will be succeed by those attempts. That is where comes the experienced hand, the brother, a close friend who stood by us since our birth. It is easy to fall in love, but it is not easy to have a brother who guides us in every move on that.\r\n\r\nIn this film the sreenspace between them was very little, but that did not stop to disclose how one's inspiration that got from love to mold accurate shape and to lead the right path. I don't have any brother, but I felt how it would be to have one. So all the brothers in the world must see it, this is dedicated to them.\r\n\r\n> \"It's like when you don't know someone, they are more interesting. They can be anything you want them to be. But when you know them, there's limits to them.\"\r\n\r\nI did not grow up in the 80s, but was very close to it and I know how it would feel to be born in that generation. Jeans, thick hair and curls, everybody was so thin, weird make-ups with strong eyeliner, big eyeglasses, cassettes, you would love this film if you remember those stuffs from your fading memories.\r\n\r\nA very stylish music-comedy and on the romance side, this film was very cute. All the actors were brilliant, especially the lead boy whose first film was this and the girl amazing with her totally electrifying look. They both going have a great future in filmdom. Not to miss out the supporting cast who did their part so well, especially the brother I talked about in the other paragraph.\r\n\r\nAll the sound tracks were awesome. I should start adding them to my 'film songs' collection, especially 'The Riddle of the Model' which defines this title and the film's climax song 'Go Now'. So from the cast to crew, equal credits must given to the music composers and lyricists from the real 80s bands. The film had a perfect runtime, I would have had no issue if it was extended for another half an hour.\r\n\r\nThe pace of the narration always kept in a same position, but towards the final quarter it has gone up. Yes, I loved the ending, it was touching, but I don't know how to describe it, only one can experience it by himself. A film I watched without any anticipation, now it is one of my favourite films. Todays generation might take it as another rock and roll inspired theme, but only the middle aged guys and some old ones would know how to enjoy it. So don't miss it out if you are one of them.\r\n\r\n8.5\/10","id":"57b503249251413d44000085","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57b503249251413d44000085","movie_id":369557}
{"author":"TopKek","content":"QUALITY\r\n\r\nFeaturing appealing covers of hit songs and an all-star cast, this cute animated comedy capitalizes on the craze for both talking-animal adventures and talent competitions. The movie may not have the substance of Inside Out or the overt messages of Zootopia, but, like Trolls, it's simple, with catchy pop music and jokes that are likely to make kids laugh. (Unlike Trolls, its take-aways aren't quite as thoroughly positive -- see below.) The musical numbers are by far the best part of the movie, including Jennifer Hudson-voiced renditions of \"Golden Slumbers\/Carry That Weight\" to the piggy duet of \"Shake It Off\" (by Witherspoon and comedian Nick Kroll as a German boar called Gunter) to Kelly's show-stopping version of \"Hallelujah.\"\r\n\r\nThe music is what makes Sing worth the price of admission, because, story- and theme-wise, there are a few missteps that keep it from greatness. Like, say, the depiction of Rosita's home life. She does everything for her 25 piglets, and her burnt-out husband (Nick Offerman) barely registers her. He's so checked out that he doesn't notice when she sets up a Rube-Goldberg contraption to keep the household working when she can't secure a babysitter to participate in the contest. And then there's poor Johnny, who desperately wants his criminal father's approval. A child wanting a parent to see them shine is wonderful, but did they have to make the father in question a bank robber? But if what you want is a bubbly diversion you''l find yourself singing along to after the credits roll, then Sing hits the spot. Just don't think about it too hard.","id":"585cd37b92514123bb006c6a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/585cd37b92514123bb006c6a","movie_id":335797}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Music is the key!**\r\n\r\nIt was one of the most watched trailer by me. Yeah, I liked the trailer and teaser, those beautiful songs and characters made me watch this film. Maybe because of that, I thought the trailers looked much better. I enjoyed the film, it had depth in characters than what I saw in the promotional videos. Though it is a simple story, and that worked so well.\r\n\r\nIts neither Disney or Pixer, but awesome. The good thing is the others as well getting there with par. It got nominated for the Golden Globe, but missed out the Oscars. A film for all ages. The musical is very common in animation, especially from Disney. This was a little different, a music genre. And the characters are the very special to this film to clinch the success.\r\n\r\nIt could have been easily added to 'Zootopia' universe, since the two films are from different productions, that idea was ruled out. The selection of voice-over cast was excellent, particularly in the singing perspective. Recently Dwayne Johnson sang one for 'Moana'. I know the real life actors brought in for the marketing purpose, but anyway they all were so good.\r\n\r\nI liked a couple of tracks, but most of them are not original. Even the theme song from 'Zootopia' by Shakira had a small part in it. So this film is surely suggestible for anyone to try at any time in any mood. It only cheers, definitely worth spending time for it. Now bring it on a sequel. As per the latest news, they have announced which is going to hit the screen in 2020. That looks too long, I need it even before that. Meanwhile, you guys enjoy it if you'ven't watched it yet.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"5901259ac3a36810c6002ec0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5901259ac3a36810c6002ec0","movie_id":335797}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**They are not superheroes, they are supervillains.**\r\n\r\nIt's nothing against DC, but overall I'm starting to think the todays cinema is getting crowded with the lots of superheroes. Just like any pollution or the over population on the earth's surface. It needs stability, but nobody cares about it other than money making agenda. I also think it's going to last for only a few more years, when this trend going to end like that happened in the 70s, 80s and the 90s. And the space travel era to begin which is already kick- started. So DC or Marvel and others, they should be careful, for far they could take their products.\r\n\r\nLike the title say, it's not just about the film characters, the film itself a suicidal. I'm not saying the film was unnecessary, but the plot was dragged too much. There are too many pauses, or you can call time wasting moments. I could not take another blowing up city concept. And that swirling thing in the sky, I don't know how long they are going to use it in the superhero films. I did not like the supernatural concept which is supposed to be a pure science fiction action adventure. At least Thor was from another planet, more like he's an alien, but the witch in this film, ruined my appetite.\r\n\r\nThe actors were not bad and so the graphics, including the stunt sequences. The story was very familiar. It was more or less, same as the animated flick 'Monsters vs Aliens'. It can be watched for entertainment purpose, the majority won't say it's their favourite or one of the best of the year. But surely there are people who would love it. It was a massive box office hit and I don't see any hurdle for its sequel, but all I hope is it to get better in the follow-up. So finally, it's not a bad film or boring, but it just did not have the midas touch that all the superhero films had. That means a watchable film, only for once.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"5851b75e92514146c9009316","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5851b75e92514146c9009316","movie_id":297761}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**When a real human bravery wasn't appreciated till the computers confirmed it.**\r\n\r\nAnother excellent biographical drama for Tom Hanks in the title role. He has transformed from captain Phillips to captain Sully. Another great addition to Clint Eastwood's filmography as well, he never disappoints us. This film was based on the real event of the January 15, 2009. When a US passenger plane got hit by birds just after the take off, losing both the engines, landed on the New York's Hudson river. So the film reveals the heroic event, as well as followed by the investigation of the crash landing.\r\n\r\nAs it is a Hollywood film what should I expect, another American bravery? Yep, but still a good film, very engaging plot. It's not all about the plane event, because I thought one of the film poster is a spoiler. So the film covers more story, about the drama surrounding the main event. Especially saving the lives, that inspires even for the outside Americans. The entire narration is about two-three day affair, but most of the film was about the crash landing. From the actors to the visuals, all were top class. One of the best biopic that's not based on one's whole life, but one heroic attempt which will be remembered him and this film for forever.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"585ea0dec3a3681a6201055d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/585ea0dec3a3681a6201055d","movie_id":363676}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Summertime 2016 has not been very kind to DC Comics-based personalities looking to shine consistently like their big screen Marvel Comics counterparts. Following the super-sized dud that was _Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice_ released a few months ago must really put some major pressure on Warner Bros. to gamble on ensuring that the presence of **Suicide Squad** does not meet the same kind of indifferent reception. Well, it turns out that although the anticipation was high for writer-director David Ayer's supervillain saga involving high-powered imprisoned rogues recruited as U.S. governmental operatives out to stop other skillful baddies (as it was for Zack Ryder's aforementioned \"Dawn of Justice\") the concoction of **Suicide Squad** feels like a colorful mishmash of collective misfits laboriously taking up space in a disjointed eye candy-coated spectacle that never manages to match its intended sizzle.\r\n\r\nOne would think that the premise for **Suicide Squad** would tap into the intriguing naughtiness with more robust gumption given the collection of super-powered oddballs asked to be immediate anti-heroes in this toothless jamboree of renegade rejects. Strangely, the grim and brooding presentation of **Suicide Squad** is more of an erratic downer than a hyperactive high-wire act as intended at the creative hands of Ayer. There is no reason why this lively group of adventurous agitators should appear so flat and inconsequential in a boisterous blockbuster that sporadically limps.\r\n\r\nGiven the twisted members that comprise this elite team of terrorizing tools it is very disappointing to see how **Suicide Squad** struggles with its so-called subversive themes. Sadly, this splattered mess never firmly grasps its bid for distinctive irreverence or off-balance exploitation. Instead, **Squad** feels strained in its execution and we are never really invested in entirely watching these treasured troublemakers find redemption because the story is soggy and uninspired. Furthermore, not all of the **Squad** participants are fleshed out satisfyingly for us to get behind with thirsty cynicism. The headlining leads in Will Smith's Floyd Lawton\/Deadshot, Oscar-winner Jared Leto's green-haired Joker and Australian beauty Margot Robbie's Harleen Quinzel\/Harley Quinn get the meaty standout parts while the lesser known supporting cast get stuck with chewing on the thankless remaining bone while seemingly acting as background furniture to the bigger names.\r\n\r\nNaturally, desperation has set in for the U.S. government as they need to safeguard national security against advanced sinister forces that threaten the fiber of American self-interests everywhere. What better way to hire gifted protection than to consider employing the world's most incarcerated corruptible, cutthroat cretins to perform the dirty work in unforgivable mission ops that require death-defying determination. Enter U.S. Intelligence agent Amanda Waller (Oscar nominee Viola Davis). Waller's duties are to assemble the ragtag team known as the Suicide Squad--ominous (yet talented) jailbirds tapped to step in and assume superhero status (especially when the real superheroes are tied up in other crime-stopping affairs) while helping out for the greater good of our vulnerable society. In exchange for the Suicide Squad's sacrifice in turning from hell-bent heels to reluctant heralded heroes they are promised commuted prison sentences should they effectively defend and destroy the deadly foes out to promote heavy-handed havoc across the board.\r\n\r\nConveniently, bureaucratic bigwig Waller (through voiceover) introduces the Suicide Squad and describes what beneficial assets they bring to the turbulent table. Among the naughty notables include the well-known ace sniper Floyd Lawton\/Deadshot as well as legendary lethal joy-boy Joker and his better (or perhaps worst half) in girlfriend Harley Quinn. The other toxic tag-a-longs along for the thrill ride of becoming rebellious rescuers include George Harkness\/Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Chato Santana\/El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Waylon Jones\/Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje),  Tatsu Yamashiro\/Katana, Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) and Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman).\r\n\r\nOverall, **Suicide Squad** is surprisingly depressing and goes through the proverbial motions without so much as taking advantage of its surrealistic makeup. The movie never realizes its excitable potential and drifts into yet another superhero yarn that is more patchy than pronounced. Smith's Deadshot is out in the forefront but for the most part feels restrained and not as spry and savvy as one would imagine. Leto's Joker obviously pales in comparison to the brilliant and mesmerizing psychotic take on the role that earned the late Heath Ledger his posthumous Oscar statuette. In all fairness, nobody could inhabit the Clown Prince of Crime as Ledger uncannily did with committed concentration. Still, Leto's Joker--although viciously off-balance--felt recycled and furiously empty at times. Robbie's turn as Joker's misguided main squeeze merely comes off as a bratty Barbie Doll with synthetic edginess. The other **Squad** participants settle for the back burner more or less which is a crying shame because they should have been more engaged than the tepid material allowed them to be initially.\r\n\r\nWoefully sketchy and missing the fueled opulence that one would expect emerging from this cockeyed costume caper **Suicide Squad** is a detonating dud for the missing explosive DC Comics movie brand that needs to step up the pace if they expect to make a consistent and challenging impression on the devoted fanboys at the box office looking to move beyond the sardonic fantasy-based realm of another redundant serving of a _Batman\/Superman_ entry.\r\n\r\n**Suicide Squad** (2016)\r\n\r\nWarner Bros.\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 3 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Will Smith, Jared Leto,  Margo Robbie, Viola Davis, Joel Kinnaman, Jay Hernandez, Jai Courtney, Scott Eastwood, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Ike Barinholtz, Common, Cara Delevinge, Karen Fukuhara, Adam Beach\r\n\r\nDirected and Written by: David Ayer\r\n\r\nMPPA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Superheroes Saga\/Action & Adventure\/Comic Book Fantasy\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** (2016)","id":"57a814dc9251415cfb00309a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57a814dc9251415cfb00309a","movie_id":297761}

{"author":"in_the_crease","content":"*** This review may contain spoilers ***\r\n\r\nSuicide Squad has a horrible script. First, there was the story--such as it was--itself: A super villain with the power to end the world goes to work in a universe that has established Batman and Wonder Woman. So what do the authorities do? Call up Batman and Wonder Woman? Of course not! Hire a bunch of criminals to save the world.\r\n\r\nIt would be like if the U.S. was invaded by China, and we went and got the Taliban to protect us.\r\n\r\nSo, from the very bones of the story, the movie fails. Add in a tell-and-don't-show approach to characterization, and horrendous dialogue, and this film was doomed before it got off the printed page. I really wanted to like this film, but I just couldn't.\r\n\r\nSo, let's go back to the tell-and-don't-show approach to the characters. Instead of seeing and experiencing anything, we're told what such-and-such is all about. It's an incredibly boring and lazy style of writing. Look at he scene where the principal characters all sit around and tell stories while they have a drink. But that's the thing: They shouldn't be telling us anything. Everything that is told to us as if we're a classroom of elementary school students instead of adults who can put two and two together, should be revealed through each character's dialogue and actions. But that would require some actual writing. This movie seems like it simply filmed the first draft of the screenplay. And then there's the dialogue itself. \"I've already killed one family; I won't kill another.\" Who wrote this? A high school kid who thought he was being deep? Flagg refers to the love of his life as the girl he \"was sleeping with.\" Serious? You're risking your life to save some broad you're banging? And then after two hours of watching Harley pine for Joker and reject the rest of the members of her \"squad\", she's finally given the chance to be with the Joker and live happily ever after. Well, despite everything we've seen for the past two hours alluding to the fact that that is exactly what she wants, she rejects that for \"her friends.\" She's never shown any sort of friendship so far in this movie. But, dialogue. \r\n\r\nIt's typical fill-in-the-blank writing. So, Harley didn't show any love for her \"friends\" but did for Joker. And then chose her \"friends\" over the Joker. So, I guess it's up to the audience to \"fill in the blank\" and decide what Harley's change of heart was all about? It shouldn't be the audience's responsibility to do the writer's job.\r\n\r\nThe characters themselves were boring and uninteresting. Despite wasting the first 20 or so minutes on the film trying to make us love the psychotic Harley Quinn and mass murdering Deadshot, I didn't care. I just couldn't care for anyone or anything happening. It was like there was an invisible barrier between me and the screen. I just couldn't get into the movie. And since no one other than Harley, Deadshot, and Flagg got a pointless backstory introduction, the audience feels, subconsciously, that these are the characters that will carry the story. They don't. The only character that was even remotely interesting was Katana. And despite a few flashes here and there of decent martial arts and kenjutsu action, the character is wasted.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of wasted characters, let's talk Joker. Jared Leto was upset how much of the Joker was cut from the film. If you can cut such a big name and charismatic character down to the point where the actor playing him complains, and still get away with a finished film, the problems with the script become apparent. Joker was wasted in this film. You cut him out entirely, the overall story doesn't change. So, why include him in the first place? Because shared universe...maybe? Or something? I don't know. And neither do the filmmakers.\r\n\r\nAnd while I know almost everyone on the planet--including those who despise the movie--praise Margot Robbie's Harley, I found her shtick getting old rather quickly. And then to top that off, she reneges on her established motive, thus making her a totally pointless character.\r\n\r\nAnd, before we move on from the topic of bad characterization, what was with Amanda Waller (a good guy...I guess?) executing FBI agents? I feel like I missed the most important scene in the movie--the one that shows something that makes the entire movie make sense. But then again, Amanda Waller doesn't make good choices. She has a folder, inside of which is a list of the upcoming DCEU characters: Aquaman, Flash, Cyborg, etc. She actually has dinner with Batman. But she puts the world's fate in the hands of Diablo, Boomerang, Harley Quinn and Deadshot. It's like calling the police because of a problem, and then scouring death row for the people who will actually solve this problem. Yeah, I'm confused too.\r\n\r\nBut let's go to the ending. Because the ending shows us one thing: That the Suicide Squad's involvement in all of this was totally pointless. Simple bombs end up saving the day. Bombs. Man made, average, everyday bombs. Satchel charges. Any idiot in a uniform can detonate a bomb. So, why let out a bunch of mass murderers to save the world, if saving the world only involves setting off satchel charges? I mean, why not call the Air Force in, have them drop a couple of bombs, and send a guaranteed-to-be-disappointed-audience-anyway home early? One phone call to the Pentagon, and the ENTIRE MOVIE is UNNECESSARY. But, DC.\r\n\r\nIn the end, this movie was a total disaster.","id":"58d2acc0c3a368124f000e06","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58d2acc0c3a368124f000e06","movie_id":297761}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Filmmaker Clint Eastwood is certainly no stranger to overseeing exploratory biopics and his latest effort in **Sully** definitely supports his cinematic vision for spotlighting an unknown everyday aviation professional into an overnight national hero. Thus, airline pilot Captain Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger became an inspirational savior courtesy of the potentially fateful day on January 15, 2009 when US Airways Flight 1749 morphed into the celebrated newsworthy incident dubbed \"Miracle on the Hudson\" \r\n\r\nIn **Sully** Eastwood and screenwriter Todd Kormarinski presents Captain Sullenberger as an understated hero in the unconventional sense. Indeed, Sullenberger had his personal demons and doubts about that critical day years ago when his quick decision to land the doomed aircraft in the icy waters of the Hudson River in the aftermath of a freakish occurrence when a flock of birds managed to disable the engine's operation shortly after takeover from LaGuardia Airport. The label of \"hero\" may have been somewhat flattering for the veteran pilot in light of his accomplishment in saving the lives of his 155 passengers and crew courtesy of a risky landing that could have been their hellish watery graves. However, the burdensome christening of \"hero\" weighed heavily on Sullenberger especially when insulting suspicions arose questioning the pilot's actions. Sure, Sullenberger basked in instant adulation but his private torment was almost as haunting as the near tragedy he prevented when ensuring the airborne safety of those jeopardized on board.  \r\n\r\nThe challenging task in **Sully** was to create the tension and psychological strife behind an infamous 6-minute flight headed for disaster. Thankfully, Eastwood's steady direction and Komarnicki's adventurous script captures the tense and anxiety-driven moments that fuels **Sully's** soulful foundation. More important, two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks diligently fits the bill as the beleaguered Captain Sullenberger whose personalized battles with heroism caused pressured ambivalence and self-inflicted guilt. It has been an awful long time since Hanks was tapped for an Oscar nomination so let's hope that his solid work in **Sully** warrants Academy Award consideration. \r\n\r\nSome may be rather cynical about Eastwood's daring narrative as the self-explanatory story has been interpreted in so many news accounts, documentaries, the personal accounts from the Flight 1749 survivors and to a certain extent Captain Sullenberger himself. Still, **Sully** sets out to examine a conflicted and confused man second guessing his aviation skills and instincts as an individual thrust into the national spotlight with a combination of hope and hesitation. \r\n\r\nNot only had the quick-thinking Sully and co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart in a welcomed, absorbing supporting role) dodged a major catastrophe when accidentally flying into the cluttered Canadian geese that caused the ice-cold water landing in the Hudson but they were actually scrutinized by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) regarding Sully's decision not to return the malfunctioning plane to LaGuardia Airport or toward a nearby airport therefore opting to gamble using the Hudson River as the immediate surface available to land.  \r\n\r\nNaturally, the sudden media attention anointing the heralded pilot as a heroic soul coupled with the mixed reception of the buzz-killers in the NTSB speculating that foul play may have been involved for the piloting tandem of Flight 1549 understandably heightened the self-doubts and generated Sully's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. In the meantime, Sullenberger's wife Lorrie (Academy Award nominee Laura Linney) as well as other close family and associates are constantly being hounded by intrusive reporters in their attempt to get an exclusive piece of the cherished \"man of the moment\" in Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger.\r\n\r\nGranted that **Sully** will not go down as one of the flashiest biopics to cross our paths on the big screen in recent years. But Eastwood does deserve credit for showcasing the somber and beleaguered Sullenberger as a low-key, loyal isolationist dealing with the newfound fame and appreciation he is awkwardly at odds with facing as the Hudson River landing\/rescue still chomps at his tainted psyche. Hanks's portrayal of the extremely likable but reluctant hero with lingering reservations is a stark contrast to contemporary cinematic heroes that routinely defeat monsters and aliens, parade around as slick and resilient super spies, wear superhero masks and capes, solemnly walk the mean streets with ready-made badges and firearms or are war-torn warriors from ancient historical times. Quite frankly, Chesley \"Sully\" Sullemberger is a flawed yet conscientious man urged to question his own courageousness and professional conviction.  \r\n\r\nEckhart's Stiles is effectively drawn as Sully's ardent supporter whose disbelief is tested when the NTSB has the nervy gumption to place his capable colleague under the dubious microscope after his amazing endeavor in protecting the sacred lives all on board the panicky plane destined for its doomsday fate. Conveniently, Eastwood inserts Anna Gunn (from TV's \"Breaking Bad\") as one of the perceived NTSB interrogating \"baddies\" trying to pin the wrap on Sully's numb shoulders in reference to his troubling flight methods. Linney, always the talented and involving actress, is merely reduced to displaying the commonplace hysterics of Sully's concerned spouse. \r\n\r\nPerhaps **Sully** is not the most thoroughly in-depth biopic one would have imagined because we are working with the perplexing man whose heroic actions made us aware of this seasoned phenomenal flyboy glorified in our living rooms nearly two decades ago. There is not much to ponder about Eastwood's fictitious Sullenberger from his past that gives insight to his current-day characterization as the media-praised hero-in-healing. In all fairness, Captain Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger's claim to fame was his hasty option to spare the endangered existences of his passengers and crew so Eastwood allows his problematic protagonist's questionable heroics to paint the picture as the incredible individual whose January 2009 resourcefulness spoke more truthfully than any miscellaneous flashbacks could do to justify Sully's angst-ridden tendencies.  \r\n\r\nOverall, **Sully** establishes a different kind of turbulence for an introspective yet gently intense wounded wonder tip toeing on the borderline of deserved and deceptive worship.  \r\n\r\n**Sully** (2016)\r\n\r\nWarner Bros.\r\n\r\n1 hr. 36 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart, Laura Linney, Jeffrey Nordling, Jamey Sheridan, Michael Rappaport, Anna Gunn, Valarie Mahaffey\r\n\r\nDirected by: Clint Eastwood\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Drama\/Biopic\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016","id":"57e21174c3a36808c3007274","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57e21174c3a36808c3007274","movie_id":363676}

{"author":"Asadullah Khan","content":"Suicide Squad is the third and latest entry into the DCEU, and is about a bunch of bad guys that are rounded up to fight for someone else. And just like this year's BvS, this movie received overwhelmingly negative reviews by the critics and was divided among the fans. I was super curious to watch it because unlike many, I actually enjoyed the DCEU till this point. Enjoyed both Man of Steel and BvS. But unfortunately, this one's a mess.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the movie just feels choppy, editing was all over the place. Like they had a final product but because of disagreements, they took out a lot of scenes, shorten the runtime, and added others, making a giant choppy mess in the end. Scenes don't properly flow, including the flashbacks. Some scenes feel like they were added later (Probably the re-shoots) and they definitely didn't fit, particularly the elevator scene with Harley. The songs were all over the place as well. Some worked with their respective scenes, but most of them didn't, and again it felt like something added later, to give the movie a more jolly feel. And difference between development given to each member of the squad is astounding. Some were completely left in the dust, while some got a bit of line here and there, while some got a lot more development. Basically, to me it felt like that the movie reeked of studio involvement.\r\n\r\nAlso, the focus was just off. Movie is called Suicide Squad yet there is a whole lot of other stuff that gets way too much screentime. The whole end of the world plot was totally generic, uninteresting and unnecessary. The villain wasn't good, and the movements were weird, and not in a good way. Joker-Harley romance was also something padded on, and could have been removed in exchange for more screentime with the squad. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Joker, he and his whole weird mafia\/gangster lord type vibe didn't work for me. Jared Leto felt like he was trying too hard at times. There were moments where I saw the Joker I wanted in him, but those moments were swiftly followed by over the top feel that he gave most of the time. And that laugh....Yeah NOPE!!  \r\n\r\nEven the action was mostly OK, apart from a couple of good scenes. There was no proper thrill, no proper buildup. Too many cuts. Say what you want about Snyder, but you have to admit that the dude can atleast direct amazing action sequences. \r\n\r\nAnd all of that sucks because there is stuff in the movie that works, like the main squad. Will Smith as Deadshot was great. He played his usual cool self and it worked. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was sexy and mostly good, because there were few instances where her dialogues gave me cringe. These two had a good chemistry together too. Also liked other members like El Diablo, Killer Croc, and captain Boomerang, all of whom were likable, had some fun moments etc. \r\n\r\nPlus, among all the mediocrity, there were glimpses of what the movie could have been like. Fun moments between the squad, some touchy moments, rare cool action sequences, full group scenes or rather a scene, the bar scene and such. \r\n\r\nUltimately, The movie is like a mediocre cake covered with a thin layer of good frosting. The overall taste isn't bad, but it isn't good either. You enjoy the good frosting for a short while, and then have to deal with a whole lot of mediocre tasting body of the cake. I was disappointed. I really REALLY wanted to like this film. Pushed back all the negative or positive criticism and went in with an open mind. I'm not too hopeful what the extended cut will improve as 13 mins of footage isn't much, and I'm guessing it is Joker footage mostly.\r\n\r\nIt's funny that after watching this, I respect MCU more now considering what they were able to do with the more risky project: Guardians of the Galaxy. \r\n\r\n6\/10\r\n\r\nBlog Post Link: http:\/\/reviewsreactor.blogspot.com\/2016\/10\/suicide-squad-2016-movie-review.html","id":"5807ddab9251415f3b003a08","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5807ddab9251415f3b003a08","movie_id":297761}

Colourful. Really cute animals.\r\n\r\nIt is a great parable about tolerance and racism which could be seen as a mirror to the xenophobia in society today. The story is of a rabbit called Judy Hopps who overcomes diversity to become a police officer in the city of Zootropolis (Zootopia). This is a very tough city full of crime and only strong predators take charge. Judy must help to solve the case of predators disappearing around the city but needs to fight her colleagues' prejudices at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe jokes are funny and the story is intriguing. The film contains lots of references to other films which will keep viewers of all ages happy (including a very funny Breaking Bad spoof).\r\nThe voice acting is very good and each actor perfectly adds to their character.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605","id":"58c16f5c925141732f00b2c6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c16f5c925141732f00b2c6","movie_id":269149}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Miruthan is the kind of film that induces the kind of hand-wringing that is reserved for something you cannot wholly appreciate but also cannot dismiss altogether. For every positive aspect that you try to talk about, there will a negative aspect that demands mention. Like, you want to praise the makers for trying something different \u2014 the first zombie film in Tamil cinema, in this case \u2014 but immediately, you are best with another thought: 'Did the first zombie film in Tamil have to be this clumsy and unexciting?'\r\n\r\nThe film is directed by Shakti Soundar Rajan, who seems to get his inspirations from the genre films in Hollywood and localises them so that they don't feel like blatant lifts. His first film, Naanayam was inspired from the heist films in Hollywood, while Naaigal Jaakirathai had its roots in the pet films. Here, he takes up the zombie genre, and uses it to spin a plot that also has local elements (thangachi sentiment, one-sided romance, and forced comedy).\r\n\r\nThe plot revolves around Karthik, a traffic cop whose life revolves around his kid sister, Vidya. Meanwhile, a chemical waste spill results in the infected people turning into zombies, who go after the live ones. When Renuka, the doctor he is in love with, requests Karthik to help get a team of doctors from Ooty to Coimbatore, where they hope to find a cure, he accepts it. But when they arrive in the city, it is already teeming with zombies...\r\n\r\nThe problem with Miruthan is that the execution doesn't match its ambition. The zombie scenes are unimaginatively staged (we mostly get video game-ish shootouts) the behaviour and body language of these creatures is inconsistent. In the scene that immediately follows the interval, we can even spot quite a few actors playing these zombies running as if they are going to get election freebies. As for those bitten, some turn into zombies within seconds while some are able to stay sane even for hours! And, strangely, most zombies keep a safe distance from the hero; even the ones that attack him come one by one (most of the time), just like our villains' henchmen. The shots in these scenes are mostly ramped up to make them seem thrilling, but they end up as amusing as watching a video at 2X speed.\r\n\r\nYou keep wishing Shakti Soundar Rajan had spent time laying out his set-up. All we get is one scene where a doctor explains to the cops about the contagion. Unfortunately, the director spends more time setting up the uninvolving and uninspiring romantic track \u2014 Karthik sees Renuka helping someone on the road and instantly falls in 'love' with her, and hopes to win her over even though she is about to marry another doctor. These initial scenes, along with the ones involving the sister as so routine, that we wish there was a forward option to move on to the zombie scenes.\r\n\r\nThen, there are the stabs at humour that make the comedy tracks in the Kanchana films seem subtle. Sriman, a staple in those films, appears as a security guard who wets his pants on seeing the zombies, while the usually reliable Kaali Venkat is given the character of traffic cop who cannot shoot straight. We even get the mandatory 'Ennama Ippadi Pannreengalema' line.\r\n\r\nBut you have to hand it to Jayam Ravi, who acts his heart out that you can't help but root for his character. A few of the zombie portions work \u2014 the initial one involving a dog, the interval block when a hoard of zombies take over the van carrying the protagonists, and the climax, which has a superb set-up, at least on paper. Even though the execution is off, the haunting song that Imman provides for this moment, Mirutha Mirutha, hits us hard, and makes us care for the lead pair.","id":"56ebec9cc3a36822560022e0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56ebec9cc3a36822560022e0","movie_id":368230}

Seriously? Anyway, she puts on the hard work and makes it to the land where anything is possible.\r\n\r\nZootopia makes some good real life comparisons: Zootopia itself seems to look like New York, even including a hustle by a sly fox.  Racism seems to be ever present in both color and speech. But the best thing about Zootopia is Judy\u2019s positive attitude and relentless determination to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe animation is as good as a Pixar animation \u2013 perfectly made  \u2013 and the story is well told, full of action scenes and funny moments. Kids will definitely love this one and grown up kids will enjoy the deep thought provoking tones set in this movie. \r\n\r\nThe best performance in this movie arguably comes from Police Chief Bogo whose voice is played by Idris Elba.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The Indian style masala zombie flick!!!**\r\n\r\nThis is why I don't watch mainstream Tamil films anymore. You know there's a concept that Kollywood never exploited. So that mean basically they have all the options in the world to make it a right product. Yet still they fail. This is a big example. It was too Indianised. I mean too much masala which a zombie film has never seen before.\r\n\r\nThe trivias makes the film very interesting to watch, but it was not that good film. The only best thing had happened was the runtime. It was shorter, and then the storyline was very simple, which is okay, but not impressive enough. There are lots of errors, like if you turn your focus other than where and whom the camera aiming, like behind, sides of the screens to have a look at what's going on, you will be disappointed. Because those zombies performances were worst. They just raise their hands and growls, but not making the progress to attack. That shows the inexperience of handling such theme, particularly technical aspect.\r\n\r\nI've watched it just after watching Japan's 'I Am a Hero' and Korea's 'Train to Busan'. So India is lagging way far behind to give an international quality zombie film. They target only locals, which is really bad when recently the Indian films are considered a fastest growing film industry in the world.\r\n\r\nIf you know the language, then you can have some fun with its comedies. Then the ending was terrible, which is not even match to B movies of Eurpean or Holywood. Definitely a skippbale film or watch it on your own risk.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Try everything (but differently). So Disney has done it again.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful animation came to exist because of coming together of the directors of 'Tangled' and 'Wreck-it-Ralp'. It is Disney who had once again done it, since their rival Pixer is going down in a rapid speed. As a Disney fan since my childhood, I'm very happy for their success in live-shot films and animations, especially for this one.\r\n\r\nOkay, since the revolution of 3D animation over 20 years ago after overthrowing the 2D animation, most of the big productions like Disney, Pixer and Dreamworks with few others never failed to deliver. Believe me, I was not interested in this film when I first saw the teaser and trailer. But they have done great promotions and so the film did awesomely at screens worldwide. I was totally blown away after seeing it, Disney's another unique universal charactered story. From the little children to the grown ups, everybody definitely going to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of animals coming together happens only in cinemas, and that too mostly in animations. But todays kids are very sharp who ask lots of questions, so they had a fine explanation for the doubts regarding putting animals in a same society. It was like the United States, where everyone came from different continents and represents different race. And so in this film every animal came from different land to live together peacefully in a city called Zootopia.\r\n\r\nSo the story begins when Judy the rabbit follows her dream to become a police officer in Zootopia. There she meets Nick the fox, who are actually arch-rival species in the wild, but it was thousands of years ago before adapting the civilisation. So trust is what not promised between them, but they're forced to work together after a small missing person case becomes their prime agenda. Solving the mystery is what brings the end to this wonderful tale.\r\n\r\nThese days animations are not just concentrated on comedies, trying to get us emotionally as well. Maybe that's how they're grabbing the adult audience, especially the families. Shakira's cameo was the highlight, and her song 'Try Everything' helped the get attention from all the corners.\r\n\r\nThe Oscars was concluded just a couple of months ago, but it already feels like the fever is gripping again for the next edition and looks like this film is leading the way for the animation category. I know it's too early, but I hope it wins it. And finally a request for the Disney, bring it on a sequel as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"5752fa5d925141187e0021a6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5752fa5d925141187e0021a6","movie_id":269149}
{"author":"ahmedaiman99","content":"Why I find Zootopia revolutionary\r\n==============================\r\n\r\n1. The creative design of the titular city, and the astonishing world building.\r\n\r\n2. Using colors and deliberately simple animation not just to make the movie appeal to children, but also to indicate the so-called ideal city of Zootopia where every animal is pure and innocent.\r\n\r\n3. Blending more than one genre into a single animated film while keeping the plot spotless and not messy.\r\n\r\n4. Delivering many contemporary messages and tackling some quite touchy timely themes that have never been explored in an animated film before. And by giving the priority to the center message, that of prejudice, nothing felt muddled and all over the place, since no message overshadowed the other.\r\n\r\n5. Using the on-the-surface message (achieve one's ambition) as a characteristic of the main character (Judy Hopps), not as the actual main message. That makes this message works as a motive not as a major theme in the movie as in, for instance, Wreck-It Ralph (I LOVE it, though \u2665).\r\n\r\n6. Avoiding being over-sentimental, although Nick's character could have been easily used to manipulate our feelings.\r\n\r\nThis movie is an absolute masterpiece. Not only because its wonderful way that gives its many messages in, but also because the importance of its messages in themselves, and how smart and relevant they are. Today, children really need to be taught these morals.\r\n\r\nThe talented cast's voices fit their characters perfectly. It has a plenty of funny scenes littered with extremely hilarious jokes which we haven't heard before in any animated movie, or even in a live-action movie. This movie blends so many genres: Comedy, Adventure, Action, Crime, and Mystery. That said, you will never feel confused while watching it.\r\n\r\nThe characters are definitely some of the most complicated characters I've ever seen in an animated movie. Each character has its own point of view due to the experiences they had, and thus makes each character has different motives and feelings.\r\n\r\n(10\/10)","id":"5d129e06c3a36870fc1e5af8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d129e06c3a36870fc1e5af8","movie_id":269149}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> An unnecessary follow up! Foolander!\r\n\r\nEverything I wrote was just my personal opinion, definitely not intended to offend anybody. Ben Stiller is a good actor, but a fine filmmaker, His directional ventures were awesome, especially after his last film 'Walter Mitty' the expectation was very high on this, but I did not think it'll end like this. It hits the rock bottom, the lowest point in his directional career. His odd film experiment had failed, just for one project and I know he will come back strong. But as an actor, he still got the star value and I'm looking forward for his upcoming project.\r\n\r\nIt has been 15 years since the original film and I don't remember much of it. But before this, I had a very quick re-view, so I'm to get a clean flow for a better understanding. Anyway, the film gave a brief report about the past events in the beginning, but when I saw the first face in the opening scene I knew it will going to suck and it did.\r\n\r\nOkay, the first, the story was decent, but not the jokes. And the next, there are too many cameos that kind of ruined its pace to keep quiet for sometime and to focus on actual story development. From all those, the best part and where I actually had a brief laugh was to see Neil deGrasse Tyson. The second films are always very crucial, because it is a bridge between the original film and numerous follow-ups to set up a franchise status. So clearly this film stumbled and I don't think there will be any more films in this series.\r\n\r\nThe original 'Zoolander' had its own brand appeal, but with this bad film it got lost. The production was very good and so the performances, but the humours were average. No offense, there are some people who still liked it, but I did not, so I won't recommend it for the 'Zoolander' fans as well as if you're looking for a good comedy. But like I always say who knows you might like it, so think twice in which one is if you're reading this review and the second is analyse it before to decide anything.\r\n\r\n3\/10","id":"5752e54d9251410d14000b23","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5752e54d9251410d14000b23","movie_id":329833}

{"author":"CRCulver","content":"ZOOLANDER 2 is the follow-up to the 2001 comedy that originally tanked at the box office due to its release just after September 11, but then became a pop culture phenomenon once it was released on home video.\r\n\r\nWe again meet male fashion model Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) and his former rival Hansel (Owen Wilson), but both have lived in seclusion for years due to a tragedy that strikes just after the events of the first film. They are drawn back into the world of fashion when they receive an invitation from designer Don Atari (Kyle Mooney) and fashion mogul Alexanya Atoz (Kristen Wiig), but they are perplexed by the changed fashion and social mores of 15 years later, and the fashion world treats them like veritable dinosaurs. Will Ferrell's villain Jacobim Mugatu returns, and the plot is again driven by a conspiracy to commit a heinous crime, which Zoolander and Hansel must thwart with the help of an agent, played by Penelope Cruz, from Interpol's fashion police (fashion police, get it?).\r\n\r\nThis sequel was savaged by critics, and sadly I have to concur with that judgment. The film's problems are legion. For one, this is one of those sequels that thinks that any gag that was funny in the first film has to be repeated almost verbatim here. But this time, those gags just fall flat. The Zoolander story is too aware of itself as a phenomenon to have the underdog charm and quirky originality of the original 2001 film. The pacing is badly thought out; the unfunny exposition takes so long that the real meat of this comedy has to be compressed into so few minutes that ultimately, it's over almost as soon as it started. And then there are the utterly pointless cameos: Katy Perry and Neil deGrasse Tyson are brought onscreen with absolutely no relevance to the events that are transpiring, and audiences are just supposed to laugh at seeing them? Bizarre.\r\n\r\nThere are some nice parts here. I think Kyle Mooney is one of the most interesting and versatile comedians working at the moment, and his part here as a tiresomely ironic hipster (\"You guys suck, I love you!\") had some laugh out loud moments. To play Mugatu, Will Ferrel again gives an over-the-top performance that you could tell he had put a lot of thought and effort into, and it's so sad that his part was essentially relegated to a minor one in the end. But as I laughed at the good bits here, I kept wishing they could somehow be extracted from this film and placed instead into a much better one. Overall, this is probably worth avoiding even if you enjoyed the the 2001 film.","id":"5b0ae0e9c3a3684b750060a5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b0ae0e9c3a3684b750060a5","movie_id":329833}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This is a really, really good animated family movie. It is a perfect blend of funny characters, decent story and little jokes spread around in the animation.\r\n\r\nAlmost all characters are very likable and funny, each in a different way. The actual story has quite a bit of suspense (for an animated family film) while still being sufficiently light and funny. Actually it is kind of two stories. One is the story of Judy Hopps fighting to prove herself as a police officer and the other is the more sinister evil plot that she attempts to unravel.\r\n\r\nThe movie moves at a good enough speed leaving enough room to both tell the story itself and inserting jokes and comical situations. The two bureaucratic sloths were quite fun already in their first scenes but the last scene with them at the very end of the movie was absolutely hilarious.\r\n\r\nThe animation itself was certainly adequate although I sometimes miss the old hand drawn animations from Walt Disney.\r\n\r\nOverall, one of the better, if not the best, animated movie I have watched in quite a while.","id":"58b3fded92514177d1016987","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b3fded92514177d1016987","movie_id":269149}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Quality haunting ambiance, but ultimately a pedestrian mish-mash of several other horror flicks***\r\n\r\nReleased to TV in 2016, \u201cShadows of the Dead\u201d starts with a group of teens going out to a cabin in the woods to party (no, seriously). Thankfully, that\u2019s just the beginning as some kind of deadly shadow-like creature follows them back to their Southern Cal town where havoc naturally ensues.\r\n\r\nI like petite cutie Kennedy Tucker as the main protagonist and Thomas Miguel Ruff as her likable pal, Gabe. The rest of the cast is serviceable. The tone is serious, which is good in my book, and the haunting air makes this a good TV flick for the October\/November season.\r\n\r\nI also like the fact that the monster is explained better than the half-baked nonsense of similar movies, like \"The Night before Halloween\" (2016) and \"Stickman\" (2017). The shadow creature is reminiscent of the monsters from \u201cMothman\u201d (2010) and \"Scarecrow\" (2013), both superior to this, while including elements of \u201cAlien\u201d (1979), \u201cMessiah of Evil (1973) and \u201cFrom Within\u201d (2008).\r\n\r\nAlthough \u201cShadows of the Dead\u201d is better than \u201cNeverknock\" (2017), it suffers from a similar feeling of \"Meh.\u201d Something needed added to perk the movie out of its prosaic goings-on. Some of it works, though, and I appreciated the positives despite my tedium. The climax is totally predictable though.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 27 minutes and was shot in the more remote outskirts of Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C\/C+","id":"5be6b6050e0a263c0a00e4f6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5be6b6050e0a263c0a00e4f6","movie_id":418691}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A good cast and a potential thriller, but...**\r\n\r\nAt first, it looked fine. Well initiated by giving out a proper reason to develop what comes later. But that later part was the biggest let down. It becomes so clich\u00e9 and because of that I lost interest. Otherwise, it is could have been a decent one with all the good actors. Also the location was good, a perfect setting for the storyline. But not noticeable when the narration enters the second half, mainly because of thriller takes over.\r\n\r\nIt is the story of a psychologist who recently lost her husband in a car crash, but ended up taking care of step-son after he became mentally and physically incapable. When the life was in the routine, suddenly something bad happens where her young patient goes missing. Following the event, she begins to experience what others won't believe her. But what comes later is more shocker, a twist in the tale takes us the conclusion.\r\n\r\nAs the title and its genre suggest, it remained truth to that, but there is no innovation in storytelling. Most of the people would easily predict most of the parts if not the entire film. The casting was the advantage and they all were good, including the kid from 'Room' and Naomi. Even though it is rated very low everywhere, as well as by me, kind of entertaining, which means watchable till the end than cut it out in the middle. Not a film to recommend, but if you choose it to watch, I won't say don't.\r\n\r\n_4\/10_","id":"59288a469251413b4103e6a2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59288a469251413b4103e6a2","movie_id":329981}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"One might nostalgically recall the days back when the cheesy yet infectious Japanese monster movies were such a magnificent draw during those hazy Saturday afternoons showcasing the double creature feature matinees that aired weekly on television. We were considered very lucky if we had Mothera battle Gamera in one showing followed up by experiencing the sheer thrill of watching Rodan take on his latest ferocious foe as well. However, as well-known as these mentioned Far East big screen beasts were in all their glorious rage and colorful destruction nobody was as legendary or instrumental in seriously wreaking havoc on vulnerable Japanese soil both heroically or horrendously than our heralded King of Carnage in the celebrated _Godzilla_. \r\n\r\nThe famed and humongous rumble-and-tumble reptile makes a grand return courtesy of Toho Studios reviving the catastrophic critter in writer\/co-director Hideaki Anno\u2019s and Shinji Higuchi\u2019s monster mash offering **Godzilla Resurgence** (a.k.a.\u201dShin Godzilla\u201d). Interestingly, the last _Godzilla_ flick that was released by Toho Studios was more than a decade ago in 2004. Naturally, Japanese audiences were privileged to the exploitative antics of the favorable large lizard when **Godzilla Resurgence** premiered earlier this year.\r\n\r\nThankfully, Anno\u2019s and Higuchi\u2019s spry creature concoction is now showing up in limited release in other countries as _Godzilla_ dusts off his combative cobwebs from yesteryear and makes a contemporary return to the cinematic psyches for baby-boomers looking to revive their childhood memories of the spike-toothed rampaging rogue doing what he does best: stomping through the endangered streets of Japan in the name of high-wire popcorn entertainment. In any event, there is a willing welcome wagon to embrace this familiar and feisty monstrous menace with robust enjoyment. There have been previous _Godzilla_ editions that were not necessarily received with the pat-on-the-back reception (yes Roland Emmerich\u2013we are referencing your disastrous take on 1998\u2019s _Godzilla_). Still, **Godzilla Resurgence** accomplishes the impossible as it stays close to its humble 1954 roots while managing to sprinkle some fresh impishness within its clever manufactured mayhem.\r\n\r\nThe screening experience of viewing the majestic monster _Godzilla_ is stunning and surreal because the film\u2019s handlers create the terrorizing tension and torture of a full-scale predator crashing his way into the miniature-sized obstacles (people, buildings, bridges, power lines, etc.) with demolished durability. The physical details on the _Godzilla_ monster are hideously wondrous and every bloody drool from the creature\u2019s jagged mouth and ominous scaly skin is profoundly sinister. The thought of Godzilla\u2019s two-ton tail pouncing and waving with destructive defiance generates the additional mystique of this Asia-based destroyer.\r\n\r\nFor those not quite informed about the backstory of the _Godzilla_ mythology it is quite simple: a classical creature was born\/created back in 1954 at Toho Studios where filmmaker Ishiro Honda presented a monster flick that would go on to endure as a cult favorite in Japanese cinema and elsewhere around the world for the next six decades. Sure, the various _Godzilla_ installments (not including the derivative American versions) were saddled in inspired cheesiness (you got to love the laughable \u201cman-in-the-monster-suit\u201d cheapened special effects) with toy model sets serving as a deteriorating Japanese background to _Godzilla\u2019s_ cinematic wrath. Nevertheless, the clear message was received thoughtfully and philosophically\u2013_Godzilla_ and his creepy contemporaries was conceived and symbolic of that country\u2019s disillusionment with its atomic bombing past. As a result, the Japanese-based beasts were reflective of the man-made devastation that haunted a targeted region of the world that knew annihilation and humiliation. _Godzilla_ made for some escapist thrills and chills for Japanese movie audiences in the heyday of the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s but Honda\u2019s alarming predatory pest would also resonate as a freakish catalyst for the country\u2019s past and present turmoil for political, societal and technological survival. Hence, _Godzilla_ is a representative (and product) of a historical nuclear blast that remains as an immense ugly chapter in humanity.\r\n\r\n**Godzilla Resurgence** (_Shin Godzilla_) introduces good ole Godzilla as a mystery wrecking machine unbeknownst to the Tokyo city officials that have no clue in how to contain the unknown boisterous, beastly intruder as he storms through Japan like a loose sledgehammer through a light bulb factory. Once the return of the ravenous Godzilla had been identified the big brass now has to figure out how to eradicate the enormous fiendish phenomenon. Do they nuke the corrosive creature without the dire consequences of sacrificing its jeopardized citizens in the territory?\r\n\r\nAs the Japanese government agonizes over what should be done with Godzilla\u2019s dubious presence as he methodically smashes everything in his wicked path the cynicism grows moment by moment. Specifically, why is Godzilla\u2019s tumultuous existence impacting their way of life? Is the creature\u2019s overstayed welcome some sort of plot from the rest of the world to dump unrest and debauchery on their sacred grounds? Better yet can the foreign superpowers such as the United States, China or Russia collaborate to help terminate the mighty monster? Will Godzilla disturb global concerns and if so how will the militaristic mindset play out in Japan\u2019s beleaguered backyard?\r\n\r\n**Godzilla Resurgence** aims to be more than just a typical giant monster movie mired in splashy CGI special effects and engulfed explosions. Anno (\u201cEvangelion\u201d) and Higuchi (\u201cAttack on Titan\u201d) actually serve up a sophisticated and thought-provoking creature caper that digs underneath the throwaway exploitation surface. The tongue-in-cheek nostalgia is firmly maintained and the moviegoers are treated to their share of Godzilla\u2019s manic mischievousness. Importantly, Anno and Higuchi amp up their brand of a disguised political potboiler in the form of a sci-fi monster B movie that sufficiently labors at mirroring the current-day chaos and conflicts that bombard a modern-day Japan (or any inserted nation for that matter). Whether spotlighting international trust\/distrust or pinpointing kaiju (meaning \u201cbig, brutal monsters\u201d) terrorism as an allegory for Japan\u2019s temporary unseen but inevitable national fallout caused by an impenetrable nature disaster it is quite revealing that **Godzilla Resurgence** delves beyond its cartoonish ruination.\r\n\r\nWhatever interpretation that one derives from **Godzilla Resurgence** the verdict is undeniably sound that Toho Studios delivers a lively and message-driven platform about uncontrollable forces and critical decisions that befall an ambivalent country undergoing in-house scrutiny. To put it in layman\u2019s terms: **Godzilla Resurgence** is a surprisingly well-done despite its sometimes campy makeup. Surely **Resurgence** is solid enough to uphold the G-man\u2019s beloved legacy in the kaiju genre.\r\n\r\n**Godzilla Resurgence (Shin Godzilla)** 2016\r\n\r\nToho Studios\r\n\r\n2 hrs.\r\n\r\nStarring: Hiroki Hasegawa, Satomi Ishihara, Yutaka Takenouchi, Ren Ohsugi, Akira Emoto\r\n\r\nDirected by: Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi\r\n\r\nWritten by: Hideaki Anno\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: NR\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction & Fantasy\/Action & Adventure\/Drama\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016","id":"5807140e92514170b7018970","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5807140e92514170b7018970","movie_id":315011}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"For a horror film, Sowcarpettai is hardly scary. It is one of those cheaply produced, paint-by-numbers horror films that hopes to cash in on a trend, relying on tacky visual effects, an overloud score, and costumes and makeup that make the characters seem like poorly dressed guests at a Halloween party.\r\n\r\nThe plot takes off with Vetri (Srikanth) and Maya (Lakshmi Rai), who are about to get married, being murdered by Gothra (Suman, who, for some reason, is made to wipe his eyes every now and then like the Bond villain Le Chiffre that Mads Mikkelsen played in Casino Royale), a moneylender, who wants to take over their house. The lovers return as ghosts and start tormenting Gothra. Meanwhile, Shakthi, Vetri's look-alike brother and an evil tantric, is out to get Maya, whom he lusts after.\r\n\r\nGiven that the leads become ghosts very early into the proceedings, director Vadivudayan struggles to come up with plot points that could make the film interesting. We know straightaway that the villain stands no chance against two ghosts. And yet, he drags this plot beyond the interval point with comedy, involving the trio of Saravanan, Singam Puli and Power Star Srinivasan, that is excruciating. And then he realises that this might not be enough to cover the second half and so, introduces a sleazy Vaali-like set-up involving a brother who lusts after his younger brother's girlfriend. But the filmmaking in these scenes is so crude and vulgar. Whenever Lakshmi Rai is in the frame, the camera is often placed at voyeuristic angles. The dialogues are no better. When Maya begs Shakthi to leave her as she is a ghost, he says, 'Ponama irundhalum unna poratti paakanum'! Thankfully, the film is rate A, but there is no hiding the fact that the film, which seemed like a badly made TV soap that was sufferable despite the tedium, turns into something that deserves our contempt.","id":"56ebedf8c3a3682256002309","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56ebedf8c3a3682256002309","movie_id":369819}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**First date with a chocolate ice cream girl.**\r\n\r\nA small film with a small success. It was entirely shot in the two weeks of time. Directed by a first timer, it tells the true story of Barack Obama and Michelle Robinson's first date back in the 1989 during working for a big law firm in Chicago. Like how Michelle denied it is a date as co-workers should not engage in a close relationship. While Obama is trying to win her heart, the film reveals their day, what they talk and do and how it all ends.\r\n\r\nThis is not a biographical film I was expecting. I mean I was looking forward to the film, but not this kind of simple story. This looks like another version of 'Before Sunrise', and I won't be surprised if they make a sequel in a similar fashion, maybe a trilogy. So this is a one day event when they were young and passionate about their work, somewhat they both liked each other, though they knew their limits. The writer-come-director confirms all the events from his film really occurred, but not all of them in just one date.\r\n\r\nThe actors were good, especially I liked Parker Sawyers as Barack Obama. For me, this is not a great film, but decently made one. Obama fans might like it, though you could try it if you like date film in a realistic manner. It's Obama's early life, so there's nothing about his present politics or the president post, except talking about their future plans. But most of the film about between them and their life, like how they grew how, what they love and loved, those kind of stuffs. So I hope you watch it with a low expectation.\r\n\r\n_6.5\/10_","id":"585e9f44c3a3681a6801154f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/585e9f44c3a3681a6801154f","movie_id":310888}

{"author":"Shreyance Parakh","content":"**NO is a complete sentence in itself. Period.**\r\n\r\nThere are movies that have great plot lines, there are movies that have great actors who make the movie great, there are movies which have great directors. But this is a movie with a great message and one that our Indian society needs to listen, believe and enact upon.\r\n\r\nIncidents happen and are forgotten, people speak and they go quiet, mass movements are organized and they fade. But our mindset has not really changed. We still judge a woman's character by the way she dresses, the way she starts to feel comfortable with someone, by the time she steps in and out of home, by her choice of consuming alcohol or not, and the list can grow pretty long.\r\n\r\nPINK tries to make that exact same point that any sane society believes in, that we cannot have different set of rules to judge someone's character. One gender cannot be judged by some specific set of rules that do not apply to the other gender. In fact, it isn't even about the gender, judging anyone's character is a crime we all commit when none of us can measure our own selves with the same set of rules in the same scale of balance and come out of it pure and serene.\r\n\r\nNow, going towards the movie's review, this movie shouldn't be judged by it's story line, direction, editing, cinematography, or the acting. All of which were commendable in their own way so as to put through the point that the movie was trying to present to the audience precisely. Rather, it should be judged by the fact that our society deeply suffers from this disease of judging a woman's character and act with her in a manner according to the outcome of our judgement as we see fit. The part where Rajveer's character says that everybody present in the courtroom would feel the same way bout girls like these sums up the thought process of a great part of our society.\r\n\r\nAmitabh Bachchan's character's expressions in the end personifies the sorry state our country would feel at times like these. When we have to issue a manual about the woman's safety in our society. The points mentioned by Deepak Sehgal that should be there in the manual are cruel but true.\r\n\r\nI can go on and on about the greatness and seriousness of the point that the director has tried to put across, but it'd all be for nothing if we'd feel that it was another good movie that made a good point.\r\n\r\nWe need to change the way we grow up our boys and nurture them with the idea of respecting a woman's modesty and understand the firmness, completeness and absoluteness of the word NO. I wish dearly that I witness this change in our society in this lifetime where movies like PINK are no longer NECESSARY to make us realize that the way we treat women in our somewhat modern society, sometimes, is inhumane.\r\n\r\nGoing away from the preachy tone of this review I'd like to mention that the acting of all the characters, Amitabh Bachchan, Tapsee Pannu, and the other girls, Kirti and Andrea in fact, especially was just what was required, nothing less nothing more. It was believable and you could feel their helplessness. The direction by Aniruddha Roy Chaudhary was really good.\r\n\r\nAll in all, for me, this is more than your good , bad, average Bollywood movie.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Vijay Antony is hardly expressive and his dialogue delivery remains the same be it an emotional scene or an action scene. But he has displayed an uncanny ability in selecting roles that suit his limited range \u2014 he certainly looks the part in all these roles. As in his debut film Naan, in Pichaikkaran, too, he plays a character who is living with a false identity, and has to speak as little as possible so that he doesn't give away his true identity. But the film is far removed from Naan. That was a thriller, but this one is a melodramatic action film that seems to be the actor's first step in moving into the mass hero league.\r\n\r\nHe plays Arul, a multi-millionaire, whose mother Bhuvaneshwari (Deepa) ends up on her deathbed following a freak accident. A godman tells him that he can save his mother if he can live as a beggar for 48 days without revealing his true identity. Arul decides to do so and becomes part of a group of beggars. He also strikes up a relationship with Maghilini (Satna Titus), the girl he had intended to marry, but doesn't reveal his true self to her. Meanwhile, he gets embroiled with gangsters and has to fight for life. And there is also his uncle (Muthuraman), who is hatching his own plans to take over his properties in his absence.\r\n\r\nLike his previous film, India Pakistan, Pichaikkaran is content at being a crowd pleaser, even though its director, Sasi is known for the realistic Poo. The set-up feels like an anti Arunachalam. In that film, a servant accepts a challenge to be rich man for 30 days so that he can fulfill his father's wishes. Here, the rich Arul becomes a pauper to save his mom. And the film also gives itself caveats so that it doesn't have to present Arul as a beggar all the time. This cheat sheet \u2014 Arul can take off his beggar disguise and behave as a normal man after 6pm \u2014 allows the director to build up the romance between Arul and Maghilini.\r\n\r\nArul's transition into the life of a beggar is done mostly at a surface level. We see him living with beggars, but we hardly feel that he is living as one. And the set of beggars seem to be well-to-do ones. After an initial scene, we never see Arul having to put up with hunger or the lack of a shelter. There are also too many coincidences. Like when the beggars gatecrash a wedding where the heroine is also present; or the scene where Arul beats up gangsters and finds his friend waiting for him; the heroine, too, happens to be at the place. Even in the climax, we see a villain turn up at the exact spot where Arul is chasing a gangster.\r\n\r\nBut these niggles don't affect the film so much because the tone is that of an old-fashioned masala movie. Time and again, Arul beats up the men who try to attack him (he even uses a corn cob to maim his attackers) or those close to him, and we can't help but cheer his actions. And Sasi amps up the melodrama at crucial moments, like in the climax when Arul has to choose between revealing his identity and saving a life and protecting his identity and saving his mother, that the narrative is mostly propelled by the emotions in this tale.","id":"56ebee6cc3a3682251002485","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56ebee6cc3a3682251002485","movie_id":382736}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"With a plot that could be described as Aalavandhan meets Funny Games\/Naanal meets The Dark Knight (the director credits Aalavandhan, Babel, Oldboy and Tarantino's films as his influences), Raghavendra Prasad's 54321 holds promise in its first half an hour. Anjali (Pavithra) is staying in a lonely house. Her husband Vinoth (Aarvin) is on his way home. A thief (Jayakumar) breaks into the place. And soon, another man enters, but with a sinister motivation. When Vinoth comes home, he finds the house in disarray. Soon, he comes face to face with the intruder, Vikram (Shabeer), with whom he shares a past. And Vikram wants Vinoth to murder a little girl he has kidnapped if he hopes to save his wife!\r\n\r\nThis is the film's best stretch. It sets up the story and is also suspenseful. But then, we start getting the backstory \u2014 why is Vikram targeting Vinoth, why is the thief here, how did Vinoth and Anjali fall in love and so on \u2014 and the answer to each one of these questions is a disappointment. The romantic track is terribly corny, the story of the thief uninspiring while his actions in the present-day are unconvincing, and the Vikram-Vinoth conflict is feeble (a childhood rivalry). And the acting gives us the impression of watching a short film.\r\n\r\nPrasad does manage to compensate for the deficient writing through his filmmaking \u2014 the setting is largely a single room, but the director never makes us feel as if we are watching a video recording of a stage play. He keeps cutting from one character to the other in unpredictable ways to keep us on an edge, and the camera movements are quite fluid. One particular device he uses is the freeze frame every time he wants to cut to the flashback, though it gets tiresome after a point.\r\n\r\nBut what is troubling is that the violence seems to be there just for the sake of it. Both Vikram and Vinoth's characters are underdeveloped. We hardly feel the dilemma that the latter undergoes. And the film, too, never truly addresses the moral question at the heart of its plot \u2014 what makes one evil and is there difference between one evil act and another.","id":"57e8b843c3a368475d00f9e2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57e8b843c3a368475d00f9e2","movie_id":412410}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**An uprising to liberate it the supermarket.**\r\n\r\nHow many R rated animated films have you seen? This is not a hentai, but the Hollywood's rare animated-adult-comedy. Most of the big names are here, especially the young generation. The film took me by a surprise. I did not know when it was made and what its genre, but the posters made me very curious the with double meaning punchlines. It was a silly story, something like a parody of Pixar's 'Toy Story', but a very enjoyable film as it is a rare product.\r\n\r\nIf you check the last two decade's records, the animation films tore apart the live-action films in the box office clash. It is shocking, but the fact that animations make good revenue. This film is a trend setter in animation genre that targets the adult audience. Like Hollywood found its counterpart from the Japanese hentai. It just cost only $20 million to make and the production quality was not very standard, but acceptable. Hope there will be more like this in the future, but I would seek a sequel for this.\r\n\r\nSeth Rogen was the main man behind this film. The rest of the cast too was good. Nothing but theirs voice lending made all the difference, especially you would know who were who, while a watch, that kind of familiar it was. The story of supermarket products from all the categories who fight for their freedom.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed, it was short too, as well as a fast narration with some good adult jokes. There are a couple of negatives about it, like the first one was there's no innovation in it, like it is very familiar, but a different kind of comedy.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"A remake of the 2012 Telugu film Julayi, Saagasam has the ingredients that make a masala potboiler (not surprising given its origin), but the film also exists in a reality that is its very own where logic and realism are hard to find. The plot revolves around Ravi (Prashanth), a young man who wants to get rich quick. He challenges his father (Nasser) that he will earn Rs 1 lakh in two hours if he is given Rs 10,000, but crosses path with Bittu (Sonu Sood), who is planning to rob a bank for Varadarajan (Kota Srinivasa Rao), a minister. Ravi's intelligence helps the cops catch Bittu in the act, but the latter escapes and wants his vengeance.\r\n\r\nThe film moves at breakneck pace and in fact, belongs in the list of films that want the viewer to start thinking about the next scene even before the current one is over. This helps in a way because we do not have to focus on the absurdities in the scenes and take them at face value for the time they last. The screenplay also makes it less of an action film and more of a battle of wits between two characters, who might be more similar than they think. Think of it as a Hari film with an urbane setting and characters.\r\n\r\nThere is also comedy in the form of Thambi Ramaiah and MS Bhaskar, who play high-ranking police officials who are cowards and let the hero, who is staying in their house under the witness protection programme, call the shots. There is also comedy of the unintended kind that makes its presence felt every now and then when the film makes leaps of logic that make our jaws drop. Then, there is a romantic track, whose very existence is to provide the hero with something else to do apart from trading quips with the villain. And it also helps in extending the film's running time to over two hours, as we get peppy but forgettable songs (the music is by Thaman) that are shot in a cliched manner.\r\n\r\nPrashanth, making a return to the screen after quite a while, gives his best, but we can't help but feel that this required an even younger hero. But what lets the film down the most is that it is directed without any feel for the material, so we are unsure if we need to take the film seriously or as a spoof.","id":"56b9ca7d925141069f002157","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56b9ca7d925141069f002157","movie_id":280049}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Risking life, exposing a long hidden secret!**\r\n\r\nBased on the book of the name name tells the story of Tora, an American surgeon who moved to a remote island in Scotland with his husband for a new beginning after the miscarriage. Following the life in the new place, she discovers some secrets that are hidden for very long. Her attempt to expose it was foiled, and put her life in a threat. From there where it goes is what leads to a twist and the conclusion.\r\n\r\nThis is the same old formula for most of the thrillers. The story, its characters and the locations were fresh, but you would know how it all develops and ends. Still a very decent film with a fine pace of the narration. I think some of the coastal scenes were from the same place where 'Sing Street' were shot. But that was an Ireland film and this is Scotland, so I'm confused whether it was Scot or Ire.\r\n\r\nRadha Mitchell was okay, and the rest of the cast did not get enough scope for their roles. The direction and the production was not bad either. Except for the familiar theme, it can be watched for once.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> One can only show their passion for something, it's the others who are able to see their talent.\r\n\r\nInspired by the boxing culture of the north Chennai. It tells how Indians took the sport in their hand and mastered it, specially this film focused on the women boxing. It is definitely a confident boosting film if you are an ambitious sportsperson. But looks like its for adults due to too much use of the rude language. That really did surprise me, because it is expected for a Bollywood film, but Kollywood has a different culture and it was very strong.\r\n\r\nIt was not actually about Madhavan, he was just a coach like sharookan from 'Chak de India'. So it is about a young girl named Madhi, who hailed from a poor fisher family. Without any education and social manners, how she makes her fortune turnaround after a new chief boxing coach finds her passion and skill towards the sport. The remaining narration is all about her journey from the slum to the boxing championship.\r\n\r\nIt kind of reminded me the story of a flower girl from the streets who makes to the high society in the film 'My Fair Lady'. Except here, it was replaced by the boxing. With a bit of romance, music\/musical, humours, as well as rivalries and corruption this film is a quite entertaining. Well directed film, but I'm slightly not happy with the screenplay. Because, no doubt, it is a fine theme yet too much localised for domestic market. As a result, if you're an International audience, there's an issue to understand the culture and language translation the loses its originality in the subtitle.\r\n\r\nAnd one more thing is that the background score was good, but disappointing songs, though its video was decent. Awesome performances, especially by Ritika Singh, and Madhavan. The tale was told from his perspective, but Ritika takes the lead with her skillful show in the both, acting and boxing. For the Indians it is surely a must see and one of the best sports films in the recent time, but for the rest of the world, it falls into a decent category.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"577aa85f9251415600001f55","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/577aa85f9251415600001f55","movie_id":357706}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"It is inevitable that a sports film will hew to a certain formula \u2014 the discovery of an extraordinary talent, the practice montage, the challenges on and off the field, the grand finale with an outcome that could either be rousing or downbeat. So, it is not surprising that the outlines of Irudhi Suttru, a boxing drama, are familiar. We have a grumpy coach, a rebellious student, politics from the sport's administrators, jealousy from rivals and a tense climactic bout. But what makes the film stand out is how superbly the director, Sudha Kongara uses these plot points to paint her canvas.\r\n\r\nThe film begins with Prabhu (Madhavan), a once-promising boxer failed by the system and now a no-nonsense coach, being forced to move to Chennai due to internal politics in the boxing association. In Chennai, Prabhu comes across Madhi (Ritika Singh), a rowdy fisherwoman who has a natural flair for boxing, and whose sister, Lakshmi (Mumtaz Sorcar) is training for the boxing championship. Prabhu offers to teach the hot-headed Madhi, who is enthusiastic about the sport but is put off by the coach's stern attitude. The two warm up to each other and Madhi even develops a crush on Prabhu. But there are forces that threaten to derail both their dreams.\r\n\r\nThe writing is strong for the most parts of Irudhi Suttru and the excellent cast effortlessly conveys the various shades of their characters. The beefed-up Madhavan might be the film's anchor but it is the pocket-sized dynamo Ritika's performance that gives it its punch. The supporting cast is superb. We know what Nasser and Radha Ravi are capable of, but Kaali Venkat, as the girls' drunkard father who converts to Christianity just to make a few bucks, manages to overtake these veterans with his finely-calibrated performance. If there is a chink in the armour, it is the characterisation of the antagonist, Dev, who is one-note and cliched. And the (type)casting of Zakir Hussain for this role doesn't help either.\r\n\r\nThe little touches, like the observation on Chennai's poster culture (one of the posters welcoming Prabhu calls him 'Boxing Loin'!), the fact that Madhi's mother is a north Indian, that Madhi is a fan of Dhanush, the relationship between Radha Ravi and Madhavan, the explanation Lakshmi gets for why Prabhu prefers Madhi, add a bit of quirkiness to the tale. The fight scenes are also tensely choreographed and are plausible unlike the over-the-top boxing scenes that we saw recently in Bhooloham. But it is the relationship between Prabhu and Madhi is what drives the film and the director makes it amply clear that she needs him as much as he needs her. Their scenes have a charge that keeps us hooked and it is only when Prabhu disappears for a brief while in the second half that we understand how crucial their scenes together are for the film. On the whole, it might not deliver a knockout punch, but Irudhi Suttru manages to land punches that constantly surprise us (the rousing climax ensures that we walk out with a smile) and in a good way.","id":"56af1e91c3a3681c3b00c43a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56af1e91c3a3681c3b00c43a","movie_id":357706}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Having tried to break free of his image with Brahman and Thaarai Thappatai and not really succeeding in it, Sasikumar has gone back to his tried and tested formula of family feud, sentiments, romance, revenge and message. The only difference here is that instead of friendship, it is brotherly love that drives the hero's actions. This doesn't mean the film is disappointing; it is actually engaging.\r\n\r\nThe film begins in the past when a man commits suicide because he has lost an election to Rajamanickam (Prabhu, whose understated performance adds dignity to this character), his wife Kayavarnam's (Viji Chandrasekhar) half-brother. In the present, Vetrivel, a happy-go-lucky guy, is wooing Janani, who works in an agri college. His brother in love with Rajamanickam's daughter, and when Rajamanickam disagrees to the match, they decide to kidnap the girl. But things get screwed up when the wrong girl is kidnapped. And it happens to be Latha (Nikhila), who is betrothed to Arul, the son of Kayavarnam!\r\n\r\nDebutant director Vasanthamani confidently spins his yarn and this helps the film and prevents it from turning into a routine rural fare. In the filmography of Sasikumar, it should rank alongside Sundarapandian or just a notch below it. The actor is playing the quintessential Sasikumar role here \u2014 an intrepid do-gooder \u2014 but the Vasanthamani's writing of this character helps him overcome his limited range of expressions. Interestingly, in the credits, his name appears after all the other cast members, even though he is the film's hero!\r\n\r\nEvery character is well fleshed out, and it is quite interesting to see how situations keep getting out of the characters' hands even when their intentions are good. The scenes between Prabhu and Ilavarasu, who plays Sasikumar's father, are superbly written and the level-headed nature of these characters makes for a nice contrast with the hot-headed attitude of the youngsters. The director also finds a smart way to integrate this plot with Naadodigal, and it is a pleasant surprise when that happens. There is also enjoyable comedy in the form a running gag that involves Thambi Ramaiah's uneventful married life.\r\n\r\nBut after a point, things get predictable to an extent that we are able to see the twists coming \u2014 like the fate of Vetrivel's relationship with Janani, a match being fixed between Arul and Rajamanickam's daughter, Arul's offer to help the girl and so on. We keep wishing that Vasanthamani had thought out scenarios that aren't resolved simply by the battered hero taking on the villains in a fresh burst of fury. This is why, once the film ends, we cannot ignore the niggling feeling of having succumbed to a well-calculated formula.","id":"5738173492514112d20020af","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5738173492514112d20020af","movie_id":391059}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**When theirs rescue mission failed...**\r\n\r\nIt's not like I'm a big fan of 'Star Wars', so I disliked it. I have seen many space adventure films, but I never felt this series so interesting. I enjoyed some of the 'Star Trek' films though. I know this sequel is not good the previous ones, but for me this look okay than those. Because it was so simple, particularly story wise, and the rest of the film was action and adventure.\r\n\r\nNo offense, but this series is like the collection of the rejections from other franchises. I mean, look at the cast, most of them are comedians and some of them are the category two actors and the rest are, I don't know what they are, bur decent actors. But these films pulled off successfully at the box office. Not a big impact like the recent 'Star Wars' film or any Marvel's films, but quite an impressive figure knowing the above fact I stated.\r\n\r\nFrom the Taiwanese director who made four 'Fast and Furious' films, handled his best for this. This film tells the story of the captain James Kirk, who leads his ship and crew to a rescue mission to a distant planet where some alien race who had stranded. But when they reach their destination, an unknown space army takes them by surprise and they too take a refuse on the same planet. From there how they plan to escape and to learn who were those attackers, all comes in the next half.\r\n\r\nThis id full of action adventure. The story was little, but quite neatly developed characters, I mean the new ones with some good stunt sequences. As usual, there's no complaint about the graphics. I mean for the casual viewing, but who knows if you carefully look for the flaws, you might get a few. I suggest you to watch it just for an entertainment, but it might fail to satisfy the die-hard fans of 'Star Trek'. I think overall, it is not a bad film, even the two hours long is not an issue due to the good pace. \r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5835d8509251416c2e013535","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5835d8509251416c2e013535","movie_id":188927}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Some diehard **Star Trek** fans may not necessarily feel that the Justin Lin-directed third installment of this science fiction\/space saga film franchise \u201cboldly goes where no man has gone before\u201d creatively. Surprisingly, Lin (director of two \u201cFast & Furious\u201d flicks) shows some engaging and intriguing heft in **Star Trek Beyond** as the adventurous exploits of the USS Enterprise crew are likely to stir the collective pot where the nostalgic sentiments of the Star Trek brand from yesteryear bridges the gap to the current cinematic explosiveness of modern-day Captain Kirk and company. Although it is extremely difficult to immediately dismiss filmmaker J.J. Abrams\u2019s resourceful fingerprints concerning the imaginative **Star Trek** (2009) and the thoroughly enjoyable **Star Trek Into Darkness** (2013) he graciously steps aside to allow Lin\u2019s energizing directorial vision to further explore Trek mythology on the big screen.\r\n\r\nEssentially, **Star Trek Beyond** is a vibrant cosmic canvas that is expansive in its boundaries of exploration. Visually arresting, well-paced and armed with compelling story-telling and a healthy dosage of curiosity and mystery, Lin manages to stay true to the traditional Trek-oriented universe by incorporating rousing special effects and offering a galactic grandeur of planetary peculiarities and exotic alien races to stimulate the exquisite narrative. Screenwriters Doug Jung and Simon Pegg (Star Trek\u2019s on-screen character Montgomery \u201cScotty\u201d Scott) incorporate an eye-opening mixture of dramatic edginess, off-the-cuff humor and the cohesive rapport among the cast-mates that have inherited the iconic Star Trek personalities and made these familiar faces from the classic 60\u2019s TV show and previous non-reboot films a revelation in the millennium age of blockbuster sci-fi action adventure.\r\n\r\nThe plot channels in a sense of challenging malaise for the USS Enterprise\u2019s top officers in Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto). What seemingly spices things up regarding the deja vu space journeys aboard the spacecraft is the questionable and powerful device that Kirk and his crew are babysitting. This powerful tool of destruction is capable of destroying humanity as we know it. In particular, the opportunistic Krall (Idris Elba) is the lizard-looking culprit determined to get his diabolical hands on the corrosive contraption. Naturally, Krall and his menacing minions must subdue Kirk and his crew to achieve success in having this ominous object in his deadly grasp. Krall\u2019s willingness to cripple the USS Enterprise proved to be an ambitious mission fully accomplished. For Kirk and his group the results were disheartening as Krall\u2019s forceful attacks rendered the ship disabled as it crashed on the desolate planet of Altamid. Thus, Kirk and his charges are stranded on his rocky haven with no hope in sight. The harsh reality for the vulnerable USS Enterprise visitors, besides being divided and scattered in all directions on this problematic planet, involved getting into survival mode as the hostile reptilian creatures surrounded them at will.\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned split of Kirk and his exposed cohorts called for a series of various crisis carried on at different, chaotic spots. Kirk and Russian crew member Pavel Chekov (played by the late Anton Yelchin) were primarily tasked with trying to rescue their colleagues from the claws of Krall and his cronies. Elsewhere, Dr. Bones (Keith Urban) tries to patch up the injured Spock following the aftermath of the ship\u2019s wrecking. Pegg\u2019s Scotty and womanly warrior in alien Jayla (Sofia Boutella) make the valiant effort in trying to reach Kirk in the middle of total ribaldry.\r\n\r\n**Star Trek Beyond** has stylized flash and Lin ensures that his pulsating production stays faithful to the Trek legacy. Sure, **Beyond** is not anything innovative or wildly distinctive in comparison to the other earlier entries but it still thrives where it counts in the spectacle of space-aged escapism. The cast is solid as the players\u2013Pine, Quinto, Pegg, Urban, Yelchin as well as Zoe Saldana\u2019s Uhura and John Cho\u2019s Sulu\u2013all demonstrate a suspenseful unity on screen and give the audience an indescribable excitement in this latest chapter that far from disappoints. Elba\u2019s Krall is robustly villainous in physicality and attitude and the alien race featured are interestingly hypnotic in creepiness. Lin, in the same vein as Abrams, is not shy about gift-wrapping his **Star Trek** edition in boisterous, sweeping helpings of scope and whimsy.\r\n\r\nOverall, this kinetic outing of **Beyond** practically guarantees that the rebooted **Star Trek** phenomenon will not be experiencing its final frontier any time soon.\r\n\r\n**Star Trek Beyond** (2016)\r\n\r\nParamount Pictures\r\n\r\n2 hrs.\r\n\r\nStarring: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Anton Yelchin, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Idris Elba, Sofia Boutella\r\n\r\nDirected by: Justin Lin\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction\/Space and Fantasy Saga\/Action and Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** (2016)","id":"57932005c3a368636b006bd1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57932005c3a368636b006bd1","movie_id":188927}

Kim Coates and Claude Duhamel are on hand as his gang members.\r\n\r\nAdkins makes for an iconic Westerner, as witnessed in \u201cTraded\u201d (2016) and \u201cHickok\u201d (2017). The difference between \u201cStagecoach: The Texas Jack Story\u201d and those two is (1.) Adkins plays the main protagonist and (2.) it\u2019s noticeably inferior in overall filmmaking, even though it cost approximately the same amount to make. In other words, as low-budget as \u201cTraded\u201d and \u201cHickok\u201d were, they worked quite well as made-for-TV (or direct-to-video) Westerns, all things considered. \u201cStagecoach: The Texas Jack Story\u201d is almost amateurish by comparison.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it has some points of interest for those who don\u2019t mind slipshod productions: Adkins is a likable protagonist; the one-eyed marshal was the dope-smoking rebel in \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d (1985); Michelle Harrison is stunning as the protagonist\u2019s redheaded wife, Laura Lee; Helena Marie plays Bonnie, a striking tall blonde deputy with a penchant for killing; the British Columbia locations are effective; and there\u2019s a quality moral about not trusting people of dubious character, particularly LIARS.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 30 minutes and was shot in British Columbia (Mission and Maple Ridge).

{"author":"Reno","content":"**To realise their actual line of work.**\r\n\r\nI usually anticipate the animation films, but I was not interested in this. I saw it mainly because of how much I liked 'The Lego Movie'. This is not as good as that one, but cute little adorable animation. The film is exclusively for the kids and the families, but anybody can have a good time if they are not expecting according to their age, gender and other things. So if you are yet to watch, leave behind those in order to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nIt is nothing to do with the 2009 short film 'Partly Cloudy'. But those who wanted a feature film on the similar theme would enjoy it. It is a little different though. The storks who switched their business to another, 18 years later a chain of events makes them realise what they should be doing. So in an adventure, soon to be the boss, a bird named Junior struggles to fix his mistake. In the process, he unleashes some secrets which brings the final act where the narration decides which way to end.\r\n\r\nNot a bad story, which is a road adventure like many animation films. The comedies were good and the characters are well developed in the short span. Some parts seem very silly, but enjoyable. Particularly the wolf-pack and their weird approach to deal with things. The animation too was very smooth and overall film was short, so swiftly narrated tale. This is not the year's best animation, though watching it for entertainment would work.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Last Saturday me and the kids sat down to watch Star Trek Beyond which we received in the mail the day before. In general we liked the movie quite a lot. Plenty of action, good special effects and a not too bad story. However, one thing irked me to now end. They blew up the enterprise\u2026again. Stop destroying the bloody Enterprise in every movie for Christ sake! Been there, seen that done that. It is getting both old and frustrating.\r\n\r\nApart from that it was a good entry in the new timeline movie series. I am not sure what all those people giving it one star ratings and calling it the worst movie ever expected to get? Anyone who has watched the two other movies should be expecting a fairly action loaded blockbuster with lots of CGI in it and that is exactly what we got. Personally I think this is a good thing. I was getting rather bored by some of the previous installments in the original timeline where they almost never fired a shot and tried to talk or reason their way out of every problem they encountered.\r\n\r\nThe story was not too bad although I have to agree that it did not really advance the story or timeline much. It was more like a TV-show episode blown up to a full feature movie. It worked nicely though as a action story although I would have liked to know more about how Edison transformed into Krall and, although that could be explained by some mutation caused by the alien technology, how he managed to transform himself back to Edison.\r\n\r\nThe CGI with the alien swarm moving fluidly over the screen\u00a0and the huge\u00a0Yorktown station was quite stunning as far as I am concerned. I also liked that the ships, both Enterprise and the Franklin could take quite a bit of abuse before starting to fail. In a lot of the previous movies as well as the TV-shows it took one hit and some console exploded and the warp core went down.\r\n\r\nAll in all both me and the kids quite liked this installment in the series.","id":"58564e9d9251411a4604c3c2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58564e9d9251411a4604c3c2","movie_id":188927}

I don't know enough about camera angle choices to know if that's what makes the film feel disjointed, or the script, or editing chops, but something certainly felt unconnected. I started noticing details I had no business noticing. Everybody's hair is bigger. I watched Galaxy Quest recently, and when Krall showed up I choked on popcorn. In fact, prosthetics needed an above the title billing. Running from intruders in a dark corridor, I could see Uhura's earrings glinting. If I could see those, the enemy could, too. The device designed to End The Universe is too much like Big Hero 6. The space station too much like Elysium. And the jumpstart of a starship too much like Furious 7. One of these days in the near future scenic designers will stop putting skyscrapers on hula hoops in deep space. And it's a space station - where are all the people running to when the bad stuff starts happening? It's a scene device that needs to go. The Bad Dude airship docking station is right out of Independence Day. Can we get a little new here? Visual effects are gooey (literally) with some stuff that may or may not be a cue to the bee reference, and is at one point, squished out I don't know how while Kirk rides a vintage motorcycle in circles. And then the squish hardens. I also don't know how, or what that goo was supposed to keep in or out. Much of this is superfluous, but the story was not interesting enough to make me stop looking around. There are way too many wire bundles, a feature of Star Trek Next Gen Borg episodes. When we finally get the Bad Dude's backstory, it isn't enough. Kirk's bored, Bad Dude is disappointed, and how the hell Uhura survives every encounter requires too much suspension of belief. I also noticed that the guys in the theater were sporting ball caps with sunglasses perched on the brim. Noticing fashion in the cinema is not why I go to the movies. Read this week that Chris Hemsworth has signed on to the next Star Trek as George Kirk. Does not bode well for new better adventures.","id":"5795237dc3a3681f3100424b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5795237dc3a3681f3100424b","movie_id":188927}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**From loathing to romance and zombie hunting!**\r\n\r\nI did not know there was a parody novel of Jane Austen's 200 years old classic. This was based on that, a multi-starrer film, but the lack of star value let down the film. This is the film with a familiar plot, in addition to that zombies were there, but that was not enough. The big names from the cast would have pulled the film out of the box office disaster if it had one or two. But still I think this film was okay, an acceptable with awesome production and performances.\r\n\r\nIt ended like there will be a sequel, but now I don't think there's going to be one. The story was kind of predictable. Well, I did predict, particularly the character Wickham. Though I was more curious about the Zombies, like how it was going to be used in the narration. I must say, they were excellent. I mean they were not given any big preference, but theirs part indeed helped to build a nice plot. Pretty well composed stunts. I mean carefully, without strong blood and gore, so they got PG13 and warning for the violences.\r\n\r\nI think the film critics overreacted like usual. They're like the sheep herds, they follow one another and given verdict for this as a bad flick. But as a film fanatic, I don't think it is worth neglecting, especially if you are a fan of the original story. In the todays world, the critics are a bunch of circus clowns. So I hope you make a right choice on this, not because of me or the critics, if you haven't seen it yet.\r\n\r\n_6.5\/10_","id":"5851a58a9251416f1001a227","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5851a58a9251416f1001a227","movie_id":58431}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Fighting for shouldn't always be on its worth. Knowing what's right and wrong's enough.**\r\n\r\nA good awareness film, but struggled to narrate what it wanted to say in a standard way like any average films does. It was about forced prostitution, especially for poor immigrants. It was the story of Antonia and Maria, the illegal Mexican immigrants, but told from James, a truck driver who recently lost his wife. Now the life worth living is for his daughter who has been taken by the childcare. But one day on his job, while delivering a cargo, he comes to know his commitment is wrong. At first not realising the depth of the issue, later he decides to fight for it, but it was too late, yet he never gives up.\r\n\r\nFilms like 'Taken', 'Trade', 'Eden', all are very similar to this. Each tells undigestable tales, which mostly based on the real like this one. Thematically, this film can be praised, but not all quite well in the screenplay. The first is, it was slightly religiously motivated. Yeah, I like morals from the religious aspect, especially when it is used to fight for good, not to promote the belief. I appreciate, it did not lean on that overall, except the characters designed that way. On the other hand, the performances were not up to laudable, especially the emotions parts lacked the feeling.\r\n\r\nSince it was not entirely based on the real, but parts of various true events, the screenplay should have filled better with other contents. The opening and the final acts were good, though the middle section lacked the pace and the story event. So now you know what this film is about, and I think it is worth a watch, mainly for the message it carries. Interesting, this film turned into a book, which seems a good idea as it is more like that sort of portrayal than for a cinematic.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"596793599251413462003b31","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/596793599251413462003b31","movie_id":393765}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"One thing is for certain: no one can accuse director Burr Steers\u2019s off-kilter version of novelist Jane Austen\u2019s lyrical literary landscape **Pride and Prejudice** as being deemed solely melancholy and manipulative. The challenge of presenting a sophisticated and sudsy exposition while incorporating the ghoulish gimmicky of zombies to elevate the surrealism and cynicism of the British-based costume drama is an ambitious taking to say the least. Thankfully, Steers delivers a halfway decent piercing period piece that accentuates both the elegance and eeriness of Austen\u2019s blossomed universe of early 19th century English femininity dripping with refined defiance and desire. Hence, Steers\u2019s somewhat choppy but inspired **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** provides an imaginative and slightly insane spin on the austere exuberance of Austen\u2019s classic romancer highlighted with the butt-kicking antics of the bombastic Bennett sisters.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that movie and television audiences throughout the years have been subjected to the omnipresence of the Jane Austen Experience through countless interpretations of her treasured **Pride and Prejudice** artistic works. For the most part, the radiance of Pride and Prejudice has always maintained its ravishing romanticism in the various incarnations showcased. However, Steers looks to promote a bloody-thirsty blueprint and enhance the urgent sense of Austen\u2019s femme fatale movement\u2013in this case unite the Bennett brood and arm them with the alertness of sinister-made sisterhood. Instinctively, the premise for **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** gives off a bizarre but refreshing vibe when distributing its wacky brand of subversive feminine liberation.\r\n\r\nAusten heroine Elizabeth Bennett has always been possessed in her personalized convictions especially when it came to love and stability. Nevertheless, **Zombies\u2019** Liz (Lily James) has a mission in mind that does not necessarily involve finding that ideal suitor of choice. In this case, Elizabeth and her sisters Jane, Mary, Kitty and Lydia (Bella Heathcoate, Mille Brasy, Suki Waterhouse and Ellie Bamber) are the sisterly slayers trained to eradicate the unwanted walking dead. The Bennett beauties, all skilled at exceptional swordplay courtesy of intensified training in China, are looked down upon within their elite social circles. Furthermore, the concern over the feisty Elizabeth and her siblings finding their soulmates rests on the shoulders of their worrisome parents Mr. and Mrs. Bennett (Charles Dance and Sally Phillips). What is to become of the vast Bennett estate should their offspring not find the eligible companions to continue the bloodline? The question remains: will the bashing Bennett babes go down in family history as courageous zombie huntresses  or suffer the societal humiliation as available spinsters untouched?\r\n\r\nElizabeth\u2019s preference is to be vigilant in her quest to zap out the zombie presence whenever possible as opposed to obsessing over whether she will hook the grand love of her life. Still, the very idea of meeting Colonel Darcy (Sam Riley) at one of the festive balls may have at least humbled the combative Elizabeth a bit and had her entertain the notion of embracing a romantic feeling. Unfortunately duty calls and the agenda for terminating the pesky zombies as they invade the region is the top priority for Bennett brigade.\r\n\r\nActually, **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** is a frenetic fable that solidly works because it is able to competently marry two ubiquitous genres\u2013zombie B-movies with prim and proper Austen period piece adaptations\u2013and come up with a quirky and contentious commentary on female-oriented resistance and rage. Steers rips into the convention of womanhood wonderment with a horror flick romancer that has its sheer of nuanced nerve and chilly-minded charm. The gory shenanigans and showy execution of Zombies\u2019  cinematic makeup from Remy Adefarasin\u2019s luscious cinematography to David Warren\u2019s production design and Julian Day\u2019s costume designs all mesh with noted symmetry. The balance of wit, suspense, terror and tirade as the Bennett bunch and their suitors engage in swagger as they eliminate the detestable zombies feels delectable in manufactured naughtiness.\r\n\r\nThe performances are steady and give substance to the welcomed wackiness that uncannily defines this effectively compelling but twisted treat to Austen\u2019s pretty protagonists dressed up in gorgeous gowns that conceal their blood-laced daggers. As the lead Bennett sister, James is rather engrossing as the impulsive sword-swinging sass as her unique spin on Austen\u2019s curly-haired creation is as credible and creative as say Keira Knightley\u2019s stamp on the Elizabeth Bennett role.  Although rollicking in a zombie B-movie without relying too much on the crutch of high stakes camp, James and her supporting players are quite poised to go with the flow based on what the unpredictable material hands them.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** is a serviceable spectacle that dares to weave a Victorian-cultured social class romance yarn with an undead creepfest while finding a common ground in the hidden psyche of the young woman\u2019s destined determination for self-discovery. Perhaps introducing the less literate crowd to Jane Austen\u2019s brand of high class sensibilities through the battling Bennetts during the onslaught of an English countryside zombie invasion would make other future **Pride and Prejudice** installments feel more renewed and receptive.\r\n\r\n**Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** (2016)\r\n\r\n1 hr, 49 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Lily James, Sam Riley, Jack Huston, Bella Heathcoate, Douglas Booth, Matt Smith, Charles Dance, Sally Phillips, Suki Waterhouse, Ellie Bamber, Millie Brady\r\n\r\nDirected by: Burr Steers\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror and Fantasy\u2019Romance and Suspense\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** 1\/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng 2016","id":"56b5aa10c3a36806fc007933","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56b5aa10c3a36806fc007933","movie_id":58431}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**In yoga, you're right and they're wrong.**\r\n\r\nThey have targeted two things in this film. Mocking yoga and attacking (film) critics. They knew the film wouldn't be good enough for film critics, so they used an indirect attempt to slam them. And for as yoga, martial arts would have been a better idea, though they wanted the spiritual effect. Especially from the perspective of two current generation girls.\r\n\r\n> \"This is so basic.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a spin-off of the director's previous film, 'Tusk', starring Justin Long and he can be seen in this as well in a different role. A tale of two high school girls who work part time in their father's mini supermarket. They are passionate about yoga and got a best yogi to train them. But when they encounter an unexpected threat, they exploit everything they have learnt to tackle the situation. That's the story, and then follows the conclusion.\r\n\r\nWith this, Johnny Depp's daughter Lily Rose was introduced to the film world. I did not know he was in this, I had to find out after I heard his voice, but he was in a completely unrecognisable appearance. Father, daughter working together, that too in her first film, really wonderful to hear, but the choice of film does not convince. Seems a good concept, but a bad story and execution. Particularly, it was like a 40 minute television episode, so for a feature film it was too short and stupid. At least it is watchable, but not worthy, so I suggest you to make a right choice if you haven't seen it.\r\n\r\n_4\/10_","id":"5844661dc3a36847f900c5ef","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5844661dc3a36847f900c5ef","movie_id":290825}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**They're no strangers, yet they've never met.**\r\n\r\nProbably the most anticipated anime since the final film of Mr. Miyazaki. Because people know what these guys are capable of. This is one per cent sci-fi and 99 per cent fantasy. The concept is not new for us. From 'Freaky Friday' to 'The Lake House', even the recent American television film 'The Swap', you will remember a handful of names once you read this film's synopsis. Yet the film was so good, because of how well the theme was utilised.\r\n\r\nWe all know the technical brilliance of '5 Centimeters Per Second' and the beautiful romance from 'The Garden of Words'. This is an excellent mix of those two. If love either of them, or both, then you will love it as well. But if you ask me, my favourite is still 'The Garden of Words' from this director. I liked this film, enjoyed thoroughly, so liking it less than that means not a bad flick. Surely a film to recommend for anime fans, as well as for animation's (western audience).\r\n\r\nThe story of two teenagers, one from the rural Japan mountain region and the other one from Tokyo. The plot revolves around a comet that is to pass by very close to the earth. But before that event, the girl is bored with her life, so she dreams of living in a big city and that too as a boy. One day her wish comes true when she wakes up as she swapped bodies, including most of the memories with a boy from Tokyo.\r\n\r\nFor her, it is to live as she wanted and make use of the opportunity. But for him, it is like a curse, hence becomes rebellious. This thing keeps happening frequently for days and weeks. After some times, realising the phenomena is between two, they make a deal and strict order of Dos and Don'ts while away. All this until the day of comet and everything changes forever. Searching for the truth and the result of it leads to the end of the tale.\r\n\r\n> \u275dTreasure the experience. Dreams fade away after you wake up.\u275e\r\n\r\nUnlike Miyazaki, Makot Shinkai's storytelling is quite for the matured audience. It targets adults more than the children. Particularly for not shying away to include naturally occurring events in such situation as the story develops, despite\/even though the film revolves around the teens\/kids. As for this flick, the concern is not big, but it depends on the nation and its culture you belong to. It is very much acceptable and as the story progress, the best things keep replacing another till the finale. So hooked to it is assured.\r\n\r\nThe film length was good and so the pace of the narration. Well written screenplay, which was based on the book of the same name. But the director admits the inspiration from the previous flicks with similar themes. They have used the real places of the anime version with fictional names, but most of the Tokyo remains same and they all were awesome.\r\n\r\nIn many scenes, the camera panning was a treat. Especially the framerate was high, so no jerks, hence very pleasurable visual experience. Like I mentioned earlier, this is a unique film, despite not a original idea. The film proved the Japan is not overshadowed by Hollywood, particularly after the decline of animes in the recent years. It's up to the quality of the product, if so, then those glory days can be brought back for animes. Anyway, now this film holds the record for highest grossed anime.\r\n\r\nApart from technical dominance, the story is also enchanting. If you like romance theme, this will serve you well. A good film for date night. But usually people would skip animation for such occasion and one should not mix up that with anime. Because why I always put apart the anime and animation is, the animes are good at beautiful romance, while its counterpart from the west focus more on comedy and adventure. But the common thing from them is the well explored fantasy theme.\r\n\r\nUsually the ends are guessable for a film like this and the same case for this in here. Only as a result of the story, you would know what's coming, but not the frame by frame scenes of it. Yeah, I liked this conclusion, the final lines said might bring you tears in your eyes, romantically, if you are an emotional person. One of the best endings, even though it was clich\u00e9d. And the credits start to roll up, while you begin to recall everything you just saw in the last 100 minutes. A must see film, so highly recommended by my side. Now I've to wait for another couple of years for such film.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"5901278dc3a36810c600301c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5901278dc3a36810c600301c","movie_id":372058}

{"author":"Tiffany Lynn","content":"By this point in his career, there's not much mystery left to Zombie. From his days of White Zombie to his latest musical outpourings and films, he's made his desire to have fun and his love for the grittier horror of the past well known. Zombie fans know this. We go into each new project knowing there's little chance of being surprised but hoping that it's going to be a hell of a ride of full of homages. \r\n\r\n<i>31<\/i> is no exception. The film opens with a scratchy, shaky cam and proceeds to introduce us to a lot of the same cast we've seen before playing the same trashy and foul-mouthed character types we've seen before. The acting is intentionally full of cheese and the setting is once again his favourite decade. If you didn't enjoy <i>House of 1000 Corpses<\/i>, <i>The Devil's Rejects<\/i>, or <i>The Lords of Salem<\/i>, there's little chance that <i>31<\/i> will be your cup of tea. \r\n\r\nOn one hand, I'm not disappointed. <i>31<\/i> is pretty much exactly what I expected it to be. On the other hand, it's clear that Zombie is capable of doing something more unique and at this point it really feels like it's time for him to -- for at least one film -- take his horror a different direction. Sure, I'm tired of the boring cleancut CGI films of the mainstream, but if anyone can make one of these that is truly gorey and scary, Zombie's the guy. I'm not saying he should stop doing what's fun for him, but some variety would be nice.\r\n\r\nQuick notes:\r\n<br>- Richard Brake (Doom-Head) was perfection.\r\n<br>- Malcolm McDowell was underused.\r\n<br>- Sherri Moon Zombie wasn't the best casting choice for Charly, though I'd love to have her kicking ass here in a different capacity. \r\n<br>- Zombie really should make a full release of <i>Werewolf Women of the SS<\/i>.","id":"587318a19251410e71006075","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/587318a19251410e71006075","movie_id":284564}

If you are a 90s kid, you will feel closer to it than anybody else. Especially for the setting of the tale, just like watching a straight 90s released film. It also feels like a rural version of 'Sunny', mainly because of the friendship, but not comparable in any other way.\r\n\r\nIt's about the five friends and four of them returns to their island village for the school summer break. The other one is a handicapped, so she's not following dreams like her friends. That's where the problem begins. She presses hard to get normal like everybody else, so she can fly like a free bird anywhere she wants. On the side of the tale, two of her best friends has a strong feeling for her. But realsing that and whom she's going to choose comes with a twist before the film enters its final stage.\r\n\r\n> \u275dLove is like marathon. You might feel behind now, but if you keep running you'll reach the goal.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe trends of the 90s, particularly in the rural, how kids responded was briefed so nicely. Like similar timeline films, the audio cassettes are among the popular things. But in the remaining film, everything else were shared without focusing on any particular thing. So you won't know what way it is heading. That's a good thing, but slightly goes off the track. Maybe you can call it a stretch to fill the screenplay. Still you won't feel any lagness in any part of the narration. Overall, everything looked at its places, so the film easily accomplishes its goal which is obviously a bit clich\u00e9.\r\n\r\nYes, the end is not something you are seeing it for the first time, though it worked. I think that's how it should be. In some films while trying to avoid it, they mess it up. But still my upset with this film is the crucial twist did not make much of sense. I could have written about it in detail, but that's a big spoiler. So I indirectly mention it that the boy easily accomplishes while the experts couldn't. But overall, that part needed a little more in detail to explain how it all happened. In another way, the shortness helped the pace to keep up and also avoiding too muchness usually work and it did.\r\n\r\nSo it could be easily a film for all ages. Particularly keeping in mind many things like the 90s kids who are in their adulthood now would anyway attracted to it and revolving around teenagers, brings them as well into the same coverage. Being sentimentally filled tale, the family audience won't feel they are left out. From the performances to the production, including the direction was appreciable. It is no masterpiece nor guaranteed that it would emotionally appeal everybody. Just a simple fine looking film, so watching it for once's worth. So now you know whom I'm going to suggest it.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"5901272fc3a368110100309b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5901272fc3a368110100309b","movie_id":376494}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A violinist meets a dancer: A love story.**\r\n\r\nThat's a freaky poster, but the film was good. You know there are dance flicks even worse than this, especially, it was once a trendy theme, but now nothing impressive. In that perspective, this film was a relief, a decently made film. So dance flick means people expect extraordinary moves and music, but in this, they had kept them simple. They did not press hard on either street dance or the classical dance. It was kind of fusion between them and in addition to that live music like mainly violin.\r\n\r\nI don't know anybody from the cast or the director, but it does not look like a B movie\/indie, because the production quality was excellent. Even the story was somewhat clich\u00e9, yet enjoyable, mainly for its around 90 minute narration. I mean being a short and a decent pace with the good performances and musics and dances, this film can be easily become a dance flick of the year.\r\n\r\nThe film is not just for youngsters, but for everyone. The matured contents like maintaining the decency from the dialogues to the pictures, nothing obscene in it. A perfect PG film, the majority would like it or not, but surely will be entertained. Having lots of good quality, I did not like it entirely. In some parts it looked just fake to me like in the real world kind. I would say watch it, but don't expect too much, especially twist or surprises.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The other side story of the historic event!**\r\n\r\nThis film did not just represented the black people, but the women as well. Today we talk about discrimination against women, though this film is an example that it all had started way long ago, yet the struggle has not ended. Anyway, this is a biopic, a biopic of three women and their struggle not just being a black, but being women. When the nation was eager to send its first man to the space, there was some trouble within the team who are behind it to work together as one. Lots of inspiring events reveal how the history was made and the working culture was changed forever inside the NASA.\r\n\r\nThe film was nominated for the Oscars in the three slots, but did not win any. That's fine, because I would prefer those real women to be recognised over what this film had achieved. All the three actresses were good. Their roles were unique from one another. Really a wonder film about three real persons in one film. Something rare in films to highlight their achievements equally. The personal life, as well as their professional was well briefed.\r\n\r\nThe others like Kevin and Dunst in small part were also good. Directed by just a one film old filmmaker. He did good. The screenplay was adapted from the book of the same name. Deserved all the awards and praises it had received. After seeing how it had ended, a sequel could be possible. Mission Moon. I hope they would consider it! Seems a nice idea!\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"59bd90f2925141350b019805","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59bd90f2925141350b019805","movie_id":381284}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Not all the plans are foolproof.**\r\n\r\nNot quite what I was looking for, but still I had a nice time watching it. This is an Argentine crime-thriller. Minimal cast film and entirely shot a building and its surroundings. Literally, it was always a dark atmosphere, like it all happened at night time. The opening parts were intentional as everything deliberately put together for a quick start. It was not a matter of clich\u00e9, but knowing how all these stories begin, they did not waste time for all the details. Just the glances at related stuffs revealed all the necessary details, like unmaintained backyard, crashed car, photographs et cetera, would tell the story all you wanted to know. Even though the film ran for two hours.\r\n\r\nSo you might think they filled entire film with a tight plot, but that's not what really happened. Watching a film over that long was the tricky part, because there's no significant change in the narration in the first half, everything was in the following half. This is the story of a paraplegic computer engineer who is living alone in his house, but most of his time he spends at the basement working with computers. He was not as mysterious as he looked at the first glance. You will know him well with the progression of the story. Not from the past, but moving forward, and his intentions.\r\n\r\nIt's about the time a single mother and her young daughter come asking him the room as they saw the rental signboard placed outside. It all happens suddenly where she moves in in the next few hours. As staying together, there's no proper connection was made between them, her attempts does not bring any positive. As the days go by, he discovers some gang is planning a heist in the next building. Now all his focus come into it and it's time to decide how to deal it, and once he did, his plans and its executions are what takes the centre stage in the remaining narration.\r\n\r\n> \u275dIn the end no matter how organised your plan is, it always depends on either a girl or luck.\u275e\r\n\r\nYou probably would make a couple of guesses how it's all going to shape up, in particular how the finale sets up. So it is not that suspense if you think it would be. All the heist films you have seen in your life would make it easier for you to have many perspectives, whenever there comes a twist or turn. The bad part was the characters. All the film characters were clich\u00e9d. Like every weakness, strength is for a reason and those were not protected well for revealing it in the later parts. So concentrate every scene, even a small scene without ignoring. They all come into play in the crucial segment.\r\n\r\nIt was something like a well known story and character pattern, except the settings, which kind of gives a fresh look for the product. The fist one hour was too slow, no exciting developments. It's all between two groups, one was the criminal gang with a major plan in their hand and the second was a family, well, it was almost like a family in the next door. All the events happen separately, but once the contact was made in the final act, the slow drama turns a fast paced thriller.\r\n\r\nBut again, it compromises in the confrontation part. If you are going to expect a big face-off after what it all were developed in the earlier section, that's a pretty disappointment. But still it is a good film to watch once. Not a silly film on the overall, a theme like this to design takes quite a brain, though not a genius film and it was pretty neatly done. Especially the kind of audience they were aiming for, is not particular anyone, but mostly everybody.\r\n\r\nWhatever the characters were, the cast was excellent. They all performed their parts accordingly, including that little kid. Except it was a long film, if you are okay with a simple and entertaining product, this will do fine. For those who anticipate clever twists and turns, this will fall into an average. There were lots of opportunity to improvise the screenplay, but it was in my mind that I thought it should have been like this and that who is having opinions on the film that was already made. And that's the expectation that will kill your entertainment. I'm getting used to it, so for me it was a decent film and I'll recommend it to the selected viewers.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5967967692514133fe00404c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5967967692514133fe00404c","movie_id":394374}

{"author":"Lucky_Man","content":"I bought this movie recently for a very small amount, and began watching it with very small expectations.\r\n\r\nI was treated to a well-paced, stylish action film that relied more on esoteric ambiguity (and a passing knowledge of the video game franchise) than exposition and characterization. Rather than being a hindrance to the overall product, I believe this \"flaw\" serves the style of this movie wonderfully, and honors to source material to create an interesting and engaging fictional world.\r\n\r\nThe discerning eye of a devoted film-goer may think this movie is quite beautiful and would find very little argument from me. Certain shots and choices in lighting are remarkable, and the filmmakers emphasis on practicality over computer renderings translates very well during the action sequences. \r\n\r\nI would recommend this film - you may not love it, and you don't have to - but it is certainly worth watching.","id":"5c4400f9c3a36819fd23c511","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c4400f9c3a36819fd23c511","movie_id":121856}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**All about the apple of Eden!**\r\n\r\nOne of the much anticipated film of the year. It was a long wait for this film to see a light. I mean ever since the trend had started from the video games to the big screen, this one was a bit late to come into the party. My guess was, that's the disadvantage. The film fanatics thinks, there are too many graphics films. Besides, they did not pick the right screenplay for it like EA did for 'Need for Speed'.\r\n\r\nI have never played this game, so I was not expecting it like the others, but I'm surely disappointed with the film. I had no idea about the characters or the universe, it sets in. After watching the film I thought why this game is so famous where I did not find this film any good. Yep, it's not fair to compare two different formats. But the fact will remain that the film was one of the worst among big titles releasing on this year.\r\n\r\nI thought it was like 'Matrix', but more a periodic style action- adventure. I think the cast was good and the rest of the film was not. What I disliked the most was the smoky visuals. Yes, all the scenes with the ancient Spain was very smoky atmosphere that I had hard time to have a clear picture of what's going on. I hope there won't be any sequel to it, but if they do plan, I expect a miracle that erases all the bad image created by this part. The film is watchable, but not likable or enjoyable.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"l would lie if I said that I did not enjoy this movie. It has plenty of action, a bit of biblical mystery and some science fiction. It is a decently entertaining movie. However, I also felt a bit underwhelmed.\r\n\r\nA less than sympathetic bum happens to be some direct ancestor to an ancient warrior belonging to a ancient secret assassins society protecting the apple of Eden. Since he is a near identical match to his ancestor he is, apparently, an ideal candidate for the evil Knights Templars to unlock ancient \u201cgenetic\u201d memories that will help them find the apple. Yes I know, it is a bit of a scientific stretch but hey, it is a fantasy\/sci-fi movie and it originates from a video game story so give it some slack.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the video game. I have not played the game and I have no idea if the movie follows the story of the game or not which probably is a good think for this movie. What I did have a hard time with though is this nonsensical notion of the apple containing the genetic code for \u201cfree will\u201d. What a load of bullshit in so many ways!\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of quite good action and fight scenes in the movie. However most of them are flashbacks to the time of Callum\u2019s ancestor and it is not really Callum himself. It is not until the very end of the movie that Callum finally realizes his potential and gets to do some fighting in his own time. This disappointed me a bit.\r\n\r\nOverall I felt a bit underwhelmed. The movie plodded along at an almost leisurely pace except for the outbursts of action in the flashbacks. There was not really much happening that made me interested except for the action sequences. The acting is also adequate but not more.\r\n\r\nWhen Callum finally gets around to do some assassin stuff in our time it is too little too late. There is a nice fight when he and his assassin colleagues break out of the Knights Templar\u2019s facility but the final show down between the two parties is, well, bland.","id":"591d636dc3a368774e01d5d5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/591d636dc3a368774e01d5d5","movie_id":121856}

Instead, here a father and his daughter hit the road. Very brief introduction. Within the ten minutes, the adventure begins. It was like any other film you had seen, somewhat realistic, as well as cinematic. The life parts are so true, and so the relations between the father and daughter. The fun side of the tale is what the other side of reality. Just to make sure you are enjoying it, otherwise, those parts were never needed for such film.\r\n\r\nThe daughter who has given up her acting job to pursue a new career in the theatre management, embarks a road trip to Florida with her recently widowed dad. It is not meant to be a smooth trip. They talk stuffs, argue sillily, do things together for fun, so on. They are set to rediscover their relationship, after all the recent bad events happened in their lives. What happens when they reach their destination, lets us know before the narration comes to halt.\r\n\r\nNever seen this cast before, nor the director. A decent screenplay, but being an Indie film, it actually looked pretty better than that. Those father-daughter things, like generation gaps, I liked that part. Not too funny or very serious, a balanced narration. At first the performances did not impact, only as the story progresses, it got hold strongly.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"As expected this is a bit of a propaganda movie against BP but that was of course rather expected. It is still watchable. The dramatization is fairly well done and the effects are believable as well as enjoyable. If you watch it as a disaster drama and special effects movie it is definitely okay.\r\n\r\nAs a documentary, well I would say that it falls short. The movie only covers the initial explosion. Once the platform is evacuated the movie stops. I am somewhat disappointed at that. I would at least have liked to see the attempts to put out the fire. Where are the scenes with the boats trying to douse the rig with water for instance?\r\n\r\nI would also have liked the film to cover the attempts to close the well, the technical challenges involved and the fight against the oil spill. This is not at all covered.\r\n\r\nI feel that the film attempts to ride on public opinion, pretend to be a action\/disaster movie as well as a fact telling one and cash in on the accident. The action\/disaster parts were well done but the movie left out a lot of the, perhaps less spectacular, drama around the accident. It is a shame because now it became a rather ordinary movie as well as giving a distasteful feeling they were just trying to make some quick bucks on the disaster.\r\n\r\nThat also made the factual parts somewhat in doubt. I feel the movie is making a strong effort to portray BP as willful criminals. I am sure there is plenty of blame that should fly BP\u2019s way but at the same time one can read that \u201cOn November 8, 2010, the inquiry by the Oil Spill Commission revealed its findings that BP had not sacrificed safety in attempts to make money, but that some decisions had increased risks on the rig.\u201d. As always, things are not black and white and oil drilling is risky business after all.\r\n\r\nAnyway, enough ramblings, I found the movie okay, nothing more and nothing less.","id":"58b91d1dc3a368666b0071ba","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b91d1dc3a368666b0071ba","movie_id":296524}

The other reason was, we had other superheroes in our time, so this guy is kind of new to me. It was a stunning launch to the big screen for the Deadpool as well as for this new director. This film was merely an introduction tale than a fully stretched story. Like how a human becomes a mutant and later who seeks a revenge for ruining his natural life. But it yet to explain a couple of things and I hope it all will be revealed in its sequel.\r\n\r\nI am happy for Ryan Reynolds to get another chance, because his previous comic book character did not received well.

This was a strong R rated film so far I have seen in a superhero theme and there were plenty of other films referred. No offense to the people who liked it (and those who are going watch will do the same), but in my personal opinion it was a bit over-celebrated.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd\/10","id":"57375b8bc3a3687e1a0046bf","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57375b8bc3a3687e1a0046bf","movie_id":293660}
{"author":"fcsuper","content":"Dean is a comic artist and writer coming to terms with a father he cannot relate to, their shared grief of the loss of his mother, and a confusing relationship with a new girl in his life.  The film is somewhat formulaic with some stereotypical portrayals, like that of the love interest Nicky, or the crew of California firm that wants to hire Dean. But there's just enough heart to be an enjoyable story.  Casting was good.  Martin feels like Dean. Jacobs feels like Nicky.  And, Kline is himself playing Robert (father).","id":"593c15d0c3a3680ee00108a7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/593c15d0c3a3680ee00108a7","movie_id":305342}

Nice to see Larenz Tate in a lead role again.\r\n\r\nA bit like 'In Too Deep (1999)' but flashier (but not as great).\r\n\r\nOne too many montages and slow-motion scenes perhaps though. And too much Meghan Goode, but any amount of Meghan Goode is too much Meghan Goode really.\r\n\r\nAside from 2 or 3 mumble rap bs songs mostly good soundtrack: Nas, Shuggie Otis and Aloe Blacc for instance set the mood.\r\n\r\nDebating on wether it's a 3.5 or a 3 out of 5 star... I'd say it's a 6.5\/10 so I'll go with a light 3.5.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**To remind us our errors and limits.**\r\n\r\nIt was a surprising film. Because it was based on a real event, but there's nothing much about heroism which is essential for most of this kind of film and its success to inspire the viewers. I liked that. They just wanted to tell the story. Not to create a hero nor a villain. But due to the casting, Mark Wahlberg looks the centre of the story. And also points out a negative character without confirming anything properly. But if the film is depicting the real incident correctly, then it was no man's fault. It should be a technical error that led to the man's push over the limit.\r\n\r\nIt's April 20 2010 about 60 kms away southern coast of the US in the Gulf of Mexico. A new batch arrives to continue drilling in the deep sea as part of oil exploration. When they felt they have got it, but it's only a back foot. Small small errors, following a big blow, the entire crew with the greater effort to stop it ends in vain. Finally, it is a matter of saving their own life than the drilling platform. With lots of action, how one of the biggest man made disaster in the recent time comes to end covered in the remaining part.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'Lone Survivor' and his part in the project was appreciable. It is another sea disaster theme like the recent 'The Finest Hours'. The film was mainly developed from the articles and also got nominated for the Oscars in two categories, but did not win any. Visual effects were the key for such film and I liked those parts. I appreciate for recreating the event for the world know what really happened. It is a must see, not for entertainment purpose, but it will work for that as well.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A courtroom drama about who's right and who's wrong!**\r\n\r\nThere are many factors to consider, especially for a film like this. Yep, the film was based on the real courtroom event. The film is about two people to prove they're right on their book about the war crimes whether that took place or not. So all the episodes take place in a British high court with mention of Auschwitz concentration camp, particularly about its ruins than the events that happened in there. That means it's a great drama to learn about how these two fought in a lawsuit face-off, but there's nothing about the real event just like the film 'The Eichmann Show'. If you are not a Jew or a neo nazi or not even a European and North American, then this is an okayish film from the entertainment aspect, other than learning truth and history.\r\n\r\nI really expected some real events, but we have already seen in many films about Auschwitz camp. So they kept this film as a modern day court trial than mixing up with those old crime. Great acting by all. Timothy Spall nailed it in his negative role. He was just a fine supporting actor, till I started to recognise him since his genius display in a biopic, 'Mr. Turner'. This is his one of the top performances. He could play Don Trump in his biopic, beside Rob Redford who's a bit old for that. Rachel Weisz was okay. Her role was not strong enough, despite she's in the main character. Because everyone around her took the honour to rise above hers. Be it Tom Wilkinson, who was surprisingly awesome.\r\n\r\nSo in my perspective the film was good, but not great. The courtroom events lacked strong hold with what a film needs and what the viewers wants with twists and turns in the argument. But I'm very happy being honest than modifying its story to make film commercial worthy. Though the film had some its own moments, in the end it was not enough. Particularly how it concludes and to think why this trial even took place makes no sense at all. Seems more a joke than anything serious, just because of someone being crazily challenging and the other one responding to it. Anyway, it's still largely a sensitive matter and my view is just as an outsider. But the film is worth a watch, if you are not expecting a bigger picture after reading its synopsis.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58a376d4c3a3683f190010e5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58a376d4c3a3683f190010e5","movie_id":402298}
{"author":"jamitchell1509","content":"As a comic book fan, I was fairly dubious about Deadpool\u2019s cinematic outing. I wasn't altogether sure that a film that would obviously have to be fun, self-referential and self-aware could also be able to talk about a character who not only becomes seriously ill, but also struggles to keep a grip on his sanity well enough to do the character justice. \r\n\r\nWhen I watched the film, it was clear that I had been over-thinking. Perhaps the makers of the film had thought the same as me. Perhaps they thought that trying to be lighthearted and slightly dark at the same time would be like trying to keep too many balls in the air. I say that because the issue of Deadpool\u2019s sanity, or lack thereof, is only touched upon. If that is the case, I think it is quite a clever decision in a \u2018let's not try to run before we can walk\u2019 kind of a way.

{"author":"Ruben Schoenefeld","content":"Having watched Dave Chappelle's performance of Clayton Bigsby, \"The Black, White Supremist\" years ago, the basic synopsis sounded pretty familiar, but it being in Germany, in particular, eastern Germany, this felt a lot closer to home for me. Rather than just covering the common stereotypes faced by people who don't _look_ German, this goes deeper in asking the question what exactly _is_ German. Is it the culture? Is it the blood? Is it limited to the specific region, declaring everything that isn't Saxon to be foreign, including the demand to deport Bavarians and Rhinelanders? Is it the German virtues, as for example industriousness, resulting in the deportation of an unemployed Saxon to the Czech Republic? This movie is meant to be uncomfortable and it does a good job at it. In my view one of the better independent movies coming out of Germany recently.","id":"59664100c3a36825e8114cdb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59664100c3a36825e8114cdb","movie_id":388402}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**With an old clue, a new hunt begins.**\r\n\r\nThe third film in the 'Department Q' series that adapted from the book series of the same name. For this the director has changed, the one from 'In Order of Disappearance' and I think it was a good move, but the result was not as expected, at least not for me. As the sequels proceeding, it's losing its charm. Yeah, for me still the first film was the best one. That following parts were just okay, which rely highly on the great foundation that laid in the first.\r\n\r\nActually this story was good, despite like any cop-and-kidnapper- chase-thriller. But it was developed on the sensitive issue like faith which made the film a little shy. Because they don't want to bring in any serious debate, but wanted to balance everything as much as possible to be neutral from all kinds of this film series' fans\/viewer's perspective. So you will be entertained as the title promised, but at the end if you consider it just a film, then it's okay. Otherwise, particularly from the atheist's viewpoint, its not any favourable.\r\n\r\nThe story has a clear explanation for whatever happens, especially about the film character who commits the crime. So it is a challenging time for what Carl Morck believes in. So far we saw him as a tough cop, but this particular case he's dealing with is like he had never encountered before. There are some great scenes, like chasing a train which is actually a turning point in the narration. But the rest of the film was mostly has clich\u00e9 like any cop who tries to solve the crime.\r\n\r\n> \u275dWith that attitude you'll never enjoy a pork roast.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe plot for the crime was focused on the initial stage of the tale. The following narration was highly influenced by the cops and their attempt to resolve the issue. But before coming to that, an intentional connection between the two cases was not definitely a masterstroke as I expected. Although it looked something new on the screenplay, which might have worked so good in the dark and slow paced crime-thriller.\r\n\r\nWhile they are, Carl and Acid are looking to decipher the puzzle they have got which is dated back nearly a decade, now they come to know that two kids were kidnapped in a similar fashion. They begin to dig deeper from the previous clue for the new incident. If they are right, it is much closer than they have thought to solve it. But how it helps to plan for the fight and their full efforts which told in the final act with a fast pace.\r\n\r\nLittle disappointing was they wanted to remain those two cops as the heroes. So all the heroic acts were a build up from them alone in most of the accounts for the cinematic edgy moments. Especially how the finale turns out, is not appreciable from the writing perspective, other than giving satisfactory episode to the hardcore fans of the film franchise.\r\n\r\nFor me the locations were awesome, all the scenes shot at the right time of the day and its light that sets a fine tone regarding all the developments taking place. A decent follow-up and surely worth a watch if you had liked previous two films, but don't expect it to be the best in the series. Anyway, still some people think it is the best one so far. Now I think it's time to wait for 'The Purity of Vengeance' if they are on to it.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"59288d60c3a368780a03a084","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59288d60c3a368780a03a084","movie_id":348668}
{"author":"Gimly","content":"After what I honestly think is the best promotional & viral marketing campaign a film has had, probably ever, the Deadpool feature film is finally here! And it's... Alright.\r\n\r\nI always try to manage expectations with these things, but after the aforementioned advertisements as well as multiple critics I highly regard the opinions of raving about it (John Campea of Collider for example gave the film his seventh 5-out-of-5 in his entire career) and my well-documented appreciation for the character of Deadpool, not to mention it's higher MPAA rating, there's only so neutral you can be going in. Still, I don't think my own personal biases had me too overhyped for Deadpool, I think I can fairly lay the lion's share of my underwhelming experience at the film itself.\r\n\r\nI should start out by saying that I didn't dislike Deadpool, I'm giving it a positive rating, and I recommend that people go watch it. Three stars for me is not a low score at all, I am glad I watched the movie and would happily watch it again, this is not a scathing review; Ryan Reynolds has tried his hand at the comic book film no less than five times, and of those five movies, Deadpool is inarguably the best.\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting that among those other four films, Ryan Reynolds was not the problem in them, but they were all truly bad movies.\r\n\r\nThe way in which Deadpool is done is pretty impressive, we get all the gore-laden action, R-rated comedy, quip-havery and fourth-wall-breaking you could want from a feature of his own. There are lots of meta-references to previous work to the past failings of both Reynolds as well as the Fox Studio itself. It's non-linear. It's 100% non-serious, almost a comedy before an action film. It's like the 22 Jump Street of the superhero genre. Stylistically, it's a completely fresh comic book movie.\r\n\r\nWhich is why the complete juxtaposition of how unbelievably generic the actual plot is, is so jarring. It's not only completely unoriginal, it's sometimes downright bland. The \"how\" is great, but the core of the \"what\" feels completely uninspired, and these two aspects clash up against each other very unpleasantly.\r\n\r\nPoints go out to the work done between Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarin, although the majority of their characters' relationship is montaged through, the actors themselves had a great on-screen chemistry. I'm also totally on board for a Deadpool sequel (which has been greenlit) or seeing Deadpool show up in other X-franchise properties. But that doesn't mean I can give Deadpool a pass on the things that didn't gel for me.\r\n\r\n63% \r\n\r\n-Gimly","id":"5e08146e4c1d9a0015e34b0a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e08146e4c1d9a0015e34b0a","movie_id":293660}

The good thing about this movie is that Deadpool is a hero but in a very comedic way, you don't usually expect comedy from a superhero film but this one was full of comedy and the way they treated the plot was amazing, it was there, humor was there in every scene, even when there was fighting or romance or any other scene, the writers managed to add comedy everywhere in a very good way that'll surprisingly make you want to watch it again, and again.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Kathakali begins with a news report about a skirmish between fishermen in Chennai and Cuddalore. We think this might be the focus of the film, but then as the story unfolds, we realize it is one of the many red herrings that director Pandiraj provides us to narrate a whodunit tale that holds its suspense till the climax.\r\n\r\nThe plot revolves around the murder of Thamba (Madhusudhan), the fishermen's association head in Cuddalore, who is also a gangster. The prime suspect is Amudhavel (Vishal), who has returned to the town from the US after four years for his marriage. His family has had a skirmish with Thamba, which had left his father confined to the wheelchair. The cop in charge of the case, Saravanavadivel (Srijith), is after him because his friend (Kiran), who works for Thamba, had gone to the cops alleging that Amudhavel had murdered his boss. But there are various others who have a motive to commit the murder \u2014 Amudhavel's brother (Mime Gopi); his friend Sammandham (Pavan) and his ex-MLA father who were defeated in the elections by Thamba; a textile shop owner (Jayaprakash) whose daughter Thamba had gotten married to her lover much against her father's wishes; the Chennai fishermen; Thamba's son or maybe, it was his own men!\r\n\r\nWhat is refreshing about Kathakali is that it is less an action film and more a mystery. Pandiraj keeps us guessing as to who the murderer might be, even as he increases the tension by putting Amudhavel into situations from where getting away seems tricky. During the middle section of the film, Amudhavel is trapped inside a bus with no way out of his predicament. Even the mandatory romantic portion (with Catherine Tresa) is done away with in short time. Only recently, we had Eetti where a wrong call paves the way for romance to develop between the hero and heroine. It is the same case here as well but as he did in his debut film Pasanga, which also had a mobile phone-based romance, the director treats these scenes in light hearted fashion. He also narrates them in instalments even as he the plot keeps moving forward, giving us one more suspect to add to our list.\r\n\r\nIt is in the final portions that the film slips a bit. Given that Amudhavel is played by Vishal, the character has to be an action hero and so, we see him beating up professional gangsters with hardly any effort, and the film starts to resemble conventional action films. And Pandiraj gives us one twist too many in the end with a Murder On The Orient Express-like denouement that plausibility takes a beating.","id":"56af1fedc3a3681c4700c636","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56af1fedc3a3681c4700c636","movie_id":368012}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The clash of two gangs over Malaysian underworld.**\r\n\r\nOne of the most expected film of the year. It did break many records, before and after releasing. That was expected for the Rajinikant films, especially this one was directed by a young filmmaker Pa. Ranjith who was just a two films old. So the responsibility was big to handle a top brass from the Kollywood, as well as to deliver success. I think he did great, handling the pressure, the result and the numbers say it all.\r\n\r\nHe knows well how to mix the commercial elements to the parallel cinemas. He did that earlier, but here he had gambled where the lead actor is known for his style and mass appeal. In this, those clich\u00e9s were reduced completely, I mean completely. Even for Rajinikant, this looks a new territory to step in. I have never seen him like this before, not in the last 20-25 years of my watch. So this is something new in Tamil films.\r\n\r\nThank god, the songs are what I always had trouble in Indian cinema and in this they have reduced, but not completely erased. Especially the 'Neruppu Da' track was a massive hit, even before the release and I too loved it. Like usual, they wrapped up everything about the film tightly, so I did not know what kind of film it was till I saw. I anticipated kind of film 'Baasha', and I only surprised to catch up a completely different type of film.\r\n\r\nThe 'different' means, it kind of looked like a live recorded audio, so the appeal was like a mix of documentary and feature film. It was actually inspired by a real life gangster boss, the struggle for equal rights and respect since the British colony ended in Malaysia. The story takes in the capital city, Kaula Lampur, where a man named Kabaliswaran was being released after 25 years of prison. He was advised not to go back to his old life by the officials, but he gets out with an agenda, and then decides to meet a few people who were the reason for his jail.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the flashback reveals 25 years old events. By then you will learn everything about him, but his future plans remain mystery. Soon his new quest to find his lost family members takes a full coverage from onwards. He had to go to different places, countries, but the trouble follows. His old enemies fear his existence is a threat to their business. So between the personal journey and fighting the enemies follows in the rest of the parts.\r\n\r\n> \"Flying is its nature. Let it go. Free it. Let the bird decide whether to rise high or die trying.\"\r\n\r\nLooks like this film is not for hardcore Indian film fans, especially if you had loved the lead actor's heroism from all his previous films, you might end disappointing a bit. He retained his style, only somewhat, same goes to the punchlines, but his heroic acts were exterminated and brought the reality like how people react to situations in the actual world. So my advice is to you is don't expect mass appeal, but the pace was excellent, even for this over a two hour long narration.\r\n\r\nI mean he used to fight for the people against the corruption and corrupted officials and politicians in all his previous films. Whenever he sees there's something wrong, he right away steps in, so his fans go crazy. In here his character simply neglects those situations. I totally stunned to witness a different kind of him. But that's natural and I loved it, this is what an international film looks like. Thanks to everybody who involved in the filmmaking, particularly Rajinikant and Pa. Ranjith for taking all the risk.\r\n\r\nThis is entirely about Indian enthic's fight in Malaysia. They were brought into the land by the British to cultivate vast untapped land. Many years later, now the minorities, between Chinese and Indians a clash happens. One to take over the underworld market and the other to cease the illegal activities completely. I think it was a good theme, a message film, but told with a violent path. Since it is a gangster flick, that is inevitable.\r\n\r\nGreat locations, the mix between blue\/green screen and the real ones were so good, especially where the finale takes place. I'm very interested in Auroville after learning about it and I think this is the first film to shoot at that location. But disappointed for not fully utilising it. Not just the stunts, but there are some fun with a limited quantity. No romance, Rajinikant did the role, according to his current age, but the narration has the family sentiments. Other than gangster elements, the family plot exploited, particularly in the mid segment.\r\n\r\nAn Indian film debut for the Taiwanese actor Winston Chao. He was not bad despite this is a different kind of experience for him. Everyone were praising Radhika Apte, but she was just fine for me. Dhansika as Yogi was the surprise among the characters. Even in a small supporting part, Kishore was so good. No need to say anything about Rajinikant, he was phenomenal. Overall, I did not find any fault in the casting section.\r\n\r\nWith this success, there's already talk for a sequel, but they yet to confirm it. I am in favour of it which might happen after the '2.0'. Meanwhile, watch this film, especially if you are a non- Indian, because it was nothing like the regular Indian film. Though it was not a masterpiece, still can be watched once for being different. Particularly, it reveals Indian minorities struggle in Malaysia. That makes Indian must see. But this is a gangster film that balanced between action, crime and drama that mostly good for grown ups. Finally, it is a Neruppu da!\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"5851a80e9251416fad019d5c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5851a80e9251416fad019d5c","movie_id":366080}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"The project Kabali evinced interest among the hordes of die-hard fans of Superstar Rajinikanth and other movie buffs right from the beginning - for, they were sure that this wasn't going to be 'another' Rajini film with the star playing to the gallery, with his successfully tried-and-tested histrionics. With Pa Ranjith, who won appreciation from all quarters for his previous film Madras, it isn't an exaggeration to say that Kollywood was waiting to witness an all-new Rajini, nay, in fact, the old Rajini, which many people felt they have been missing for many years. As his legions of fans were disappointed with his previous outing, Lingaa, which had the star trying to please his admirers with unconvincing romance, comedy and action, Kabali, undoubtedly, was going to be a 'do or die' game for both, the star and his fans. Has he made a 'comeback' ('payback' is the word fans have chanting for a while) this time, with more than enough reasons for his millions of fans to cheer? Let's check out. \r\n\r\n\r\nKabali: Official teaser\r\n\r\nKabali: 'Neruppu Da' song with lyrics\r\n\r\nKabali: 'Ulagam Oruvanukka' song with lyrics\r\n\r\nKabali: Official dialogue teaser\r\n\r\nKabali: Telugu trailer\r\n\r\n\r\nKabaleeshwaran aka Kabali (Rajinikanth), who was born somewhere in Dindigul, is the messiah of Tamil labourers who work in Malaysia, after he fights for their primary rights and wages. His rise to an influential person in the society, in a short span of time, is now giving sleepless nights to a few, which further fuels jealousy and enmity towards Kabali. Veera (Kishore) is one among those jealous, and keeps hatching plans to destroy Kabali's gang, and defame him publicly. He convincingly brainwashes an aide of Kabali and successfully turns him against the latter. After a violent gang war, which takes place unexpectedly, Kabali, being convicted of various false charges, ends up in jail. \r\n\r\nReleased after two-and-a-half decades, Kabali goes in search of his wife Kumudhavalli (Radhika Apte), who was pregnant when destiny separated them. He seeks the help of his old gang, including Ameer (John Vijay), who are more than happy to help him. Jeeva (Dinesh), an overly enthusiastic youngster, too, joins him as a loyal aide. Thamizh Kumaran (Kalaiyarasan), the son of a yesteryear aide of Kabali, who backstabbed the latter, is another person who promises to help the old Kabali, but is confused. Meanwhile, Veera is ruling the roost in the town, with his own empire and Tony (Winston Chao), one of the dreaded gangsters is his business partner. Will Kabali get his wife back? Will he be able to make up the years that he lost in jail? The suspense continues... \r\n\r\nThough, with Kabali, most of the audiences were expecting a 'Ranjith film which has Rajini', it is the Superstar, like in most of his previous films, who carries the entire film in his shoulders, even though other actors shine in their respective roles. His scores of fans, needless to say, are in for a treat, watching him in, probably, the most stylish and dapper avatar in his recent outings. His majestic screen presence and the fast movements in intense sequences make the film watchable. Radhika, who has been cast opposite him is apt and their chemistry, their combination scenes, though only few, are convincing. Watching Yogi (Dhansikaa) is a delight, given her stylish makeover and ease in fight sequences. The climax of the film, however, is something that one least expects from a Rajini film. Just when viewers erupt with joy, with Thalaivar finishing off the baddies in style, there comes an unconventional twist. \r\n\r\nAs Ranjith isn't a run-of-the-mill director, and is considered as someone whose screenplay and dialogues have hidden meanings, comparisons with his previous films are but in order. In Kabali, one shouldn't expect the freshness in script and making style which his Madras offered. The flashback portions, on occasions, test one's patience, and lack evenness. The songs by Santhosh Narayanan are soothing to watch on screen, too. The stunt sequences and shoot-out scenes choreographed by Anbarivu, with Rajini putting his best foot forward, is sure to give adrenaline-rush to his fans, and are, in fact, among the things that work in favour of the film, in addition to an emotional scene. The story, perhaps, needed a tighter screenplay, but watch it for 'Thalaivar athiradi'. Nothing more, nothing less!","id":"57ba6b6fc3a3687d8400243b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ba6b6fc3a3687d8400243b","movie_id":366080}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"N Santhosh, the director of Kanithan is a former assistant of AR Murugadoss, so it is not surprising that the film bears resemblances to his guru's films. The framework of the plot \u2014 the hero trying to discover the villain's identity even as the villain is trying to track him down \u2014 is similar to the one in Thuppakki (even Ghajini and Ramana involve this set-up but on a minor level); a point made about the villain's men having a presence all over the state brings to mind Ramana, where it was the hero who had eyes everywhere; there is even a scene where the hero is looked down upon because he speaks broken English, which finds resonance in a scene from 7aum Arivu, where the heroine blasts a group of men for making disparaging remarks on Tamil. And the director is competent enough and the visuals are slick (thanks to cinematographer Arvind Krishna) that the film manages to be engaging... for a while.\r\n\r\nThe middle section of the film is a racy thriller. Gowtham Ramalingam (Atharvaa, sprightly), a reporter, gets arrested for fraud, and learns he has become a victim of a fake degree certificate racket (who either sell such certificates to willing buyers or take out loans using them). He decides to track down the person responsible for stealing identities and ruining the lives of many youngsters like him. Meanwhile, Thura Sarkar (Tarun Arora, menacing), who heads the racket, realises that someone is after him, and decides to find out who the person is and finish him off. There are tense action scenes, melodramatic but effective sentimental scenes and the plot keeps moving at a crackling pace that we have no time to mull over the numerous leaps of logic.\r\n\r\nBut, when looked at as a whole, Kanithan feels less than the sum of its parts. The chief reason is the scenes that act as a filler between the action, which are either banal or overlong or both. The film takes a while to get going and almost the first 30 minutes are wasted through cliched scenes in the name of setting up the hero's character and his romance. The film even finds time for Mano Bala to do his shtick. For contrast, you just have to think of another film from another assistant of Murugadoss \u2014 Anand Shankar, whose Arima Nambi dived into the plot in half this time.\r\n\r\nThere are also times when the characters act as if they have never heard of common sense \u2014 the hero knowingly keeps putting people close to him in mortal danger; first, his lawyer friend (Karunakaran), and later, a colleague (Kumki Asvin), even though he loses people because of this attitude! And there is the heroine (Catherine Tresa), whose only contribution to the plot happens when she gets a chance to prove her credentials as a Tamil film heroine by foolishly walking into the villain's den all alone and getting caught. You could at least defend such scenes as a first-timer's tentativeness, but how does one explain the 15-minute stretch in the second half when the film just stops dead in its tracks to include scenes of the hero and his friends discussing about drinking followed by a cringe-worthy 'romantic' scene and a song? This, at a time when characters have still not gotten out of their problem and some of their lives could even be in danger! Did no one in the unit point this out? Not even the editor (ironically, it is Bhuvan Srinivasan, who was also the editor of Arima Nambi)?\r\n\r\nThis segment proves to be as deadly for the film as kryptonite is for Superman, as until then, it seemed to be heading for a thrilling finish after a shaky start. The tension in the script gets killed and the film never recovers, despite making an effort to recover lost ground.","id":"56ebed5b9251414dba000c2c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56ebed5b9251414dba000c2c","movie_id":349740}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"As for as debut efforts go, Kalam is a well-made piece of work. The filmmaking is assured, the performances decent and the plot has surprises to keep us engaged. There are times when we can see the director, Robert Raaj, ticking off one must-have after another in this genre (hooded figures, possessed kids, suspicious-looking maid, creepy props, et al), and thankfully, they mostly do not come across as cliched. And it also helps that they are tense and scary, thanks to Mukesh G's camera angles and the background score by Josh Franklin and Subish Chandran (who has also written the dialogues).\r\n\r\nThat said, the film also feels like a show reel more than anything else for its director. He seems to have taken a leaf out of Karthik Subbaraj and gone for something that is a safe bet (horror, which is a trend these days) and more importantly, economical (the film has only a handful of characters and is mostly set inside a bungalow).\r\n\r\nThe plot involves a couple, Gautham and Deeksha, moving into an opulent house that has been gifted to them by the former's father, Madhan. Madhan is an extortionist and has managed to make this building, which belonged to a zamindar and whose heirs are no longer alive, his own. Very soon, eerie things begin to happen and Deeksha learns from Neela, an artist who visits the place, that the building has a gruesome history and it could possibly be haunted. Enter Srinivasan, a psychic who tries to help them. Can he save them before it is too late? Are the ghosts for real?\r\n\r\nAs in Pizza, a large portion of Kalam happens in a single building and with a handful of characters. Almost half of the film's running time involves characters (mostly alone, and at times, with company) walking from one room of the building to the next after sensing a mysterious presence. There is even a twist in the climax that makes us review whatever we have seen until then. But the characters are not strongly written to make us care for them. Gautham and Deeksha come across as a rather bland couple and they are given minimal things to do; he has to go to office and she has to act paranoid. There are also times when Robert Raaj stretches scenes beyond necessary (the episode involving Madhan, for example). And this is why the film never gets under our skin. Horror movies have also become commonplace these days that they need something special to truly thrill us. In that sense, you could call Kalam a thin-crust Pizza \u2014 has everything you expect, but somehow doesn't seem fullfilling.","id":"573816e4c3a36864be000b4d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/573816e4c3a36864be000b4d","movie_id":397288}

His First, 'Soodhu Kavvum' was a massive hit and now back with this retaining the same lead actor. I did not remember the original Korean film this one was based on, but while watching it, I remembered some of the parts. I think the directed did well, because it is not easy to keep up to the original standards. And as usual Vijay Sethupathi did not disappoint me.\r\n\r\nThe Madonna Sebatian's Tamil debut film and she was wonderful. This story was told from her perspective, well mostly, particularly in the first half. The story of an engineering graduate who comes to the regional capital, Chennai, seeking a job in an IT company. As she struggles to get one in this competitive world, meets her new neighbour, a thug who often bumps each other and needlessly have quarrels. But later everything softens between them, because the two are struggling in their life somewhat similarly. So one another, they comfort each other during tough times, till one day when things forever changes in their life.\r\n\r\nFor Kollywood and its fans, this is an extraordinary piece. But for the international viewers, I'm sure you would have seen such films, even though it is worth a watch. The young filmmaker changing the Kollywood landscape. Soon film like this will become mainstream films and the big actor films would turn into the parallel films. Simple story, yet many interesting stuff happens. Todays condition of IT professionals were highlighted quite factfully. It was more a friendship kind of film, but there are enough fun.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"The posters of Ka Ka Ka Po feature a long list of comedians, so, anyone who spends money to watch the film can't be blamed as they expect nothing but a few hilarious scenes, unmindful of its overall output. Unfortunately, little do they know that they are in for a harrowing two hours. The movie begins with a voice-over which unconvincingly expounds how romance can change the fate of people and how human beings possess super powers, thus evincing interest among viewers in the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe story revolves around Kavita Punyakodi (Sakshi Agarwal), a middle-class, college-going girl whose life is akin to a fairy tale \u2014 she is believed to bring fortune to people, thanks to her endless bizarre 'powers'. Kannadasan (Keshava Rajan), an unemployed youngster who considers himself unlucky, leads a despondent life, until he meets Kavita and falls for her. Rishabarajan (Subbu Panchu), a stinking-rich businessman in the town, too, desires to marry her with the help of his sister (Nirosha). Things, however, go awry in Kavita's life, in an unanticipated incident which takes place in a night club, during a party that Rishabarajan throws for his friends.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an unbelievable reversal of fortune in the lives of Kavita and Kannadasan, due to which the former finds a tough time. A friend of hers comes up with a weird suggestion \u2014 as weird as the film's plot \u2014 to bring her life back to the good olden days, which is sure to raise eyebrows. What follows is Kavita's desperate hunt for the person who messed up her life indirectly.\r\n\r\nWith a story which has almost no scope to keep the viewers entertained, the flimsy narration and sluggish making rubs salt into our wounds. What is even more disappointing is the spectacle of a myriad talented comedians making ineffective appearances at regular intervals \u2014 all of them being wasted in inept roles. A tiring watch indeed!","id":"57ba6b39c3a3687d840023d7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ba6b39c3a3687d840023d7","movie_id":407515}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"An educated girl falling for a ruffian has become such a cliche today that we have even stopped rolling our eyes when this happens in a Tamil film nowadays. But with Kadhalum Kadanthu Pogum, Nalan Kumarasamy shows that in the right hands even a cliche can feel fresh and new. The film is a remake of Kim Kwang-sik's 2010 Korean film My Dear Desperado. In fact, that film's alternate title, Gangster Lover, is such a blatant description of its plot. But Nalan has localised the story (with quirky humor that is unmistakably his) so wonderfully that right from the initial scene, when we see Yazhini (Madonna) explain how she 'ran away' from home, we are in Tamil cinema terrain.\r\n\r\nShe is an engineering graduate (as she puts it in a later scene, who in Tamil Nadu isn't?) who has come to Chennai from her small town Vilupuram in the hope of standing on her own. For a while, her dream seems to have come true. She gets a job, and does things that a single girl in the IT industry is expected to do. Until, one day, when this dream turns into nightmare. Her company closes down, and she becomes one of the innumerable job hunters in the IT industry. And the fact that she has studied in a namesake engineering college and her lack of experience ensure that she cannot land one soon. But she is too proud to go back to Vilupuram and admit defeat even if it means she has to downgrade her life from living in an apartment to living in a housing colony.\r\n\r\nAnd this is where she meets Kathir (Vijay Sethupathi), who happens to be her neighbour. He is an underling of a small-time gangster-politician, whose naivete and loyalty has been exploited by his boss, resulting in a jail term for a crime he did not commit. Nalan takes his time to show how these two vastly different characters warm up to one another and become neighbours. When he first meets her, Kathir doesn't even offer to help her with moving her stuff to her house, and when they meet for the final time (or so one might think), he has successfully held up an interview for hours with his rowdy act so that she can make it on time.\r\n\r\nThe director is clear that this is as much Yazhini's and Kathir's story as it is the story of their romance, and so we get elaborate story arcs that make these characters feel almost real. We know that Yazhini's father cares for her and despite his reservations initially (when Yazhini points out that scores of girls study or work alone in Chennai, he admits that he doesn't have the courage of their parents), he realises that he shouldn't stand in the way of her career ambitions. And when Kathir asks a younger gangster to quit the profession, we understand why he feels so. The stylish nonchalance of Vijay Sethupathi and the earnestness of Madonna complement each perfectly that we root for these characters to succeed.\r\n\r\nAs for the romance, it might sneak upon the leads invisibly but, we can always feel where things are heading to, even with the smallest and unintentional of their actions, like Yazhini embrace of Kathir in her hometown. Rather than being predictable, it seems inevitable. Some might have issues with the sedate pacing, but this is a film where the magic lies in lingering on \u2014 rather than rushing through \u2014 in this world. And when the filmmaking \u2014 full of breezy visuals (which are made more cheerful by the appearance of rain at crucial points), smooth segues, and expressive musical notes \u2014 is so understated and tasteful, what's there to complain?","id":"56ebeeb1c3a3682256002327","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56ebeeb1c3a3682256002327","movie_id":387252}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Using a multi-strand narrative, debutant director Charles weaves a heart-warming tale with Azhagu Kutti Chellam. The central strand involves a bunch of enthusiastic school kids who try to stage a play, for which the need a real baby, to help their principal (Suresh) secure financing for their school. One of the boys, Murugu, is from an orphanage nearby, where their childless teacher (Vinodhini) hopes to adopt a baby. For Jayan, the divorce of his parents is looming ahead. Their Sri Lankan Tamil friend, Dileepan's uncle and aunt are grieving over the loss of their child in the civil war. Meanwhile, Nila (Krisha), a chess player, has become pregnant but John, her boyfriend, is trying to evade marrying her. And there is an auto driver (Karunas) who yearns for a boy, which leads his wife to dump her new-born girl, their fourth daughter, in a garbage dump. The lives of the characters criss-cross and somehow, the children \u2014 both the school kids and the new-borns \u2014 offer them a chance at redemption.\r\n\r\nThere are times when Azhagu Kutti Chellam looks like a made-for-TV movie and the initial scenes, especially those involving the school children feel similar to TV serials like Kana Kaanum Kaalangal. The staging is also soap opera-ish and in an attempt to make the film look less like a TV drama, the director gives us visuals that are over-reliant on filters, at times giving the film an Instagrammed look. Some of the performances are just functional \u2014 the exception is Karunas, who is fantastic and walks away with the film \u2014 and we keep wishing for subtlety in the acting. There is also the track involving the Sri Lankan couple, which seems to have been shoehorned into the narrative just to score some political brownie points. And we are expected to dismiss the numerous leaps of logic and the spoon-feeding of messages.\r\n\r\nAnd despite these flaws, the film manages to sneak up on us, and we begin to care for the various characters. Composer Ved Shanker Sugavanam uses the haunting theme track to great effect and makes the scenes come alive while Charles manages to ratchet up the tension by nicely juxtaposing the lives of the various characters. Some of it feels overdone and the final suspense about the missing child is badly staged but by then, we are so moved by the emotional force of the narrative that we do not care and let ourselves be overwhelmed with emotions.","id":"568a29fe9251417c060022e8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/568a29fe9251417c060022e8","movie_id":375858}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**If one flag goes down, the other one will raise.**\r\n\r\nA decade ago, the same pair for a film would have been a laughing stock. The main factor was the chemistry between them, which is now improved a lot. Particularly Dhanush whose stardom rose into the sky high. I am talking about Dhanuhs-Trisha combo. They were good in this film, but the nature of their roles was another advantage to work out so well. Not very romantic as if you had thought that way, but it was about politics and achieving their goals at any cost.\r\n\r\nSo this is the story of the twin brothers, who were born and raised in the political influenced family. Since their father lost his life for a good cause during political struggle, one of the brothers got interested in his father's path from the young age. The story is to reveal his ambitions and the secret romance with an opposition party member. On the other side his innocent brother having his way of life which disturbs after something went wrong. With a twist, the narration shifts to thriller in its final act till the conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe actors' presence made this film watchable. The direction was average. The writing was not good. So much clich\u00e9, that straightly borrowed from the 90s Kollywood films. Though, overall the messages were good in a few parts. But sometimes overshadowed by commercial elements like unwanted punchlines, unrealistic fights and slow- motion clips in this modern era of the film world. Particularly, as usual, the songs were the big drawback. If you are an Indian and Tamilan, then you have a chance to enjoy it, due to familiarity with the concept of the film and the culture that depicted in the film. For an outsider, the 80 per cent of the film does not make any sense. But even for the native viewers, I would say choose it carefully, because it is not a must see.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"58b0963bc3a368235e000268","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b0963bc3a368235e000268","movie_id":376455}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"In better hands, Ko 2 would have been a crowd-pleasing political thriller and given how topical it is given that the state election is just a couple of days away, it would also have managed to generate a huge buzz for all the right reasons. But for almost an hour into Ko 2, a remake of the Telugu film Pratinidhi, you keep wishing that the filmmakers had had the sense to go for a different title as this one keeps reminding how inferior it feels to KV Anand's Ko, which, despite its faults, managed to be an engaging political film. Here, we get scenes that lack rhythm, flat staging and are tonally way off the mark, and actors who are badly directed.\r\n\r\nJust consider the scenario. The chief minister (Prakash Raj, understated for a change) has been kidnapped! His supporters are rioting everywhere! The kidnapper (Bobby Simhaa, agreeable in the dramatic moments, and fish-out-of-water in the romantic and action scenes) is toying with everyone! And yet, the officials who are in-charge of the rescue operation \u2014 the home minister (Ilavarasu), the chief secretary, the DGP and the commissioner (John Vijay) who has been handed the mission \u2014 act as if it is fairly routine. We also get a dispiriting romantic track (which comes with a song where the hero 'dances' around wearing T-shirts with spelling mistakes \u2014 Have respect or loose your teeth!) and the mandatory Ajith reference.\r\n\r\nBut just when we are about to lose hope, things miraculously start looking better. There is real spark in the conversation between the CM and the kidnapper, and the dialogues, which touch upon every contemporary issue from corruption to Chennai floods, the state of government schools and hospitals, TASMAC, and taxes, have a ring of truth that make us want to cheer. Everything, from the pacing to the performances, feel better. Even the narrative improves. We get to know why the kidnapping has taken place (cue a heart-wrenching flashback with a slightly showy but effective cameo by Karunakaran), who the culprits are, and in a lighter vein, why the initial romantic track felt like a terrible spoof of scenes from Tamil films. And this remarkable recovery feels so much like a minor victory that we willingly forgive the film's earlier lapses and leave with a smile.","id":"57381676c3a368148c0003ae","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57381676c3a368148c0003ae","movie_id":363978}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**This is a two-man job!**\r\n\r\nUnlike the first two films, this was not based on the book. Instead, it is an original screenplay that fills the gap between the second and the third book. So reading the third book before watching this film is a spoiler. Most importantly the fourth film is on, only officially have to be announced.\r\n\r\nThe original director returned to this, but I appreciate the story and the screenplay and people behind it. I did not think this sequel would work, but it exceeded my expectation. A simple story and very familiar settings, but developed so well. There's no Bridget's diary in this, instead an iPad.\r\n\r\nRenee Zellweger was totally unrecognisable. Actually, I said that in my 'The Whole Truth' review. But she was good to return as Bridget. Colin Firth looks too older than his actual age, but was great in his part. No Hugh Grant, but a new competitor was introduced which is none other than Patrick Dempsey.\r\n\r\nThis is not the same kind of narration that we saw a decade ago. Because all the characters are aged, so according to the situation this story takes place. It's a two hour long film, but it had some good jokes. Those who enjoyed the first two would surely enjoy it as well.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The trouble that had never let her alone.**\r\n\r\nA story about America, Hollywood cast, but produced and directed by outsiders. A powerful film. Kind of mix of 'No Country for Old Man' and 'Les Miserables'. The narration divided into four parts. The first episode called Revelation. An introduction life around Liz, but full of suspense after every unexpected turn in the story. Then in the second episode called Exodus, a young girl, Joanna introduced and following the third knows as Genesis, goes ever further back into Joanna's life, before returning to Liz's in the fourth known as Retribution.\r\n\r\nMaybe Dakota's best performance being an adult actress. As well as the young actress Emilia Jones. They both had played the same character, but in a different timeline. Interestingly, in real life, they share the same birth day and month as mine.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**He finally found his place, and now it's in jeopardy!**\r\n\r\nThe fourth feature film for the Kiwi director Taika Waititi. I loved all his films except the previous one, despite it was a famous title that the world loved, I'm not. So according to me this is a great comeback after a cheap vampire mockumentary. I was very confident that this would take up the New Zealand's the Oscars slot and then disappointed to find it was not in the initial list released by the Academy. Anyway, it does not need a tag like that, it is really an awesome film for everyone, though the theme has some adult contents in an indirect manner and violence like killing the wild animals. That means still it can be watched by kids with their parents' consent.\r\n\r\nWatching it takes you to the location live, so you don't want to end your vacation in the beautiful New Zealand wilderness which feels like untouched. It was nothing like you have seen in 'The Lord of the Rings' that altered with the computer tricks. This is raw and beautiful like the Tasmanian jungle from 'The Hunter'.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of an orphan boy named Ricky Baker, who is a troublesome. Finally a family from the remote place adopts him where with the initial hiccups, he started to get used to it. But after one of the members dies in his new family, the child service wants him back. This is where it all begins, because he finally found a place where he belongs, but they are trying to take it away from him. So he launches his protest that comes from a mistake which later becomes a national news. What's going to happen to him and the others around him told in the remaining part.\r\n\r\n> \"Sometimes in life it seems like there's no way out. Like a sheep trapped in a maze designed by wolves.\"\r\n\r\nSeems Ricky is obsessed with the films. He always talks about them and compares his actual state of condition to the different films he had seen and admired. Especially about the gangsters, I think that's why he became so rebellious, apart from his struggles in the orphanage. This film was based on the book called 'Wild Pork and Watercress' and I praise the author for creating a character like Ricky. As usual the screenplay by Taika Waititi was amazing. Not without the support from his crew and especially the actors like who played Ricky. So was the Sam Neill in an important role.\r\n\r\nFirst of all it is a fun film, despite whatever they have shown in this like about the feud between the child service and the kid. The film kind of looks like Wes Anderson's 'Moonrise Kingdom' without his signature. Except the initiation, what follows is quite aimless plot. So, not easy to predict the scenes, but somewhat we come to know the ending. It has to conclude either way, like happy or sad ending, or maybe both. But the overall film keeps us in the guessing mode, providing some laughs and thorough good entertainment.\r\n\r\nIt's really an appealing title and so the equally satisfying film. Especially if you like wild and green landscape, you should not miss it. The story was told in chapters which actually did not require, but those slices were helped to understand each section and its focus. I think it was a direct influence from the original source.\r\n\r\nThe director is now on a big leap, doing a superhero film in the Hollywood. The third 'Thor' film, that reunites him with Sam Neill for the second consecutive time. I'm waiting for that which is going to be a visual extravaganza. He has done great with smaller films till now, which are mostly the comedies, but what comes is his biggest challenge so far and if he does pull it off successfully, he would be another Kiwi director in the big league after Peter Jackson. Praying to happen that.

It wasn't the best written film ever but it did the job as a good, stupid horror film.\r\n\r\nIt was excruciatingly annoying in parts but I think that was the point.\r\n\r\nIt won't win any awards for acting or screenplay but it was fun and stands up against most modern, boring horrors.\r\n\r\nIt reminded me of 'Don't Breathe' which was a really good film too as it took modern horror conventions and played with them in a different way as the main characters had to struggle with the loss of an important sense.","id":"592af32fc3a36877df066406","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/592af32fc3a36877df066406","movie_id":376570}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Inside and outside, a cat-mouse game!**\r\n\r\nA limited cast film. One night event. The whole film was shot within the three weeks. Minimised dialogues, maximised actions. This film has such a good record those. But apart from the performances and settings, there's nothing special. The same old home-invasion concept with so many flaws. If you are looking for nothing but an entertainment, then this will provide you that. But you should not expect more than that, it will foil you from having a nice time with the film. I enjoyed it too, though when it comes to the rating, I should be honest.\r\n\r\nMaddie, an authoress who lost hearing and voice in her childhood is now living in a remote place, somewhat isolated from the people. On an ordinary day, unexpectedly, a masked man who killed her neighbour, is now after Maddie too. When she comes to realise that, the cat and mouse game begins. She locked herself inside. On the other hand the stranger trying to get in. As it goes like that for hours, so many twists and turns take place. How the remaining tale would turn out is should be watched.\r\n\r\nSimpleness was the highlight. They did not try too much. Particularly, for a thriller like this, they usually scare the viewers with sudden and loud sounds. This film had those, but minimised. You can't blame for isolated settings too, because such crimes can be easily committed on those backdrops. It's all about Kate Siegel. Her best film, according to me. Nice direction, from one of the latest horror flick maker. But this is not a horror film. It is a terror, a thriller. Short running time and it is worth a try.\r\n\r\n**6\/10**","id":"5a1ec0bbc3a3680b8807c6cc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a1ec0bbc3a3680b8807c6cc","movie_id":376570}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"The film begins with a voice over introduction of a typical family - grandfather (who is there in exactly a scene-and-a-half), mother, father, brother, and finally the narrator, who you expect to be the protagonist of the film, but isn't. In fact, this kind of sets the tone for the rest of the film - you expect a lot from it (like a coherent storyline, a decent plot, a proper understanding of characters) - but then it simply isn't there.\r\n\r\nWe learn in fact, that the protagonist is Sai (Irfan), who is suave enough to manage to hold down a full-time job at a recruitment agency, and an MBA degree. Sai isn't like most youngsters today. Sai strongly believes that India is still a 'developing' country, thanks to well-educated youngsters moving to the States or the UK, in search of 'better prospects'. So he sets up DQIM (the very original Don't Quit India Movement), which is basically a recruitment agency that discourages youngsters to from going abroad and instead finds employment for them in India itself.\r\n\r\nThis is the point where the film throws at you, confusing acronyms, which you have to sort of write down to keep track of. The inspiration behind DQIM is OPIC (Operation Positive India Conciousness), which we assure you, is not exactly what it sounds like. We eventually learn through a 'touching' back story that the OPIC movement was founded by his uncle, who is actually someone the antagonist, Riyaz Khan is after. How and why are confusing sub-plots aided by shoddy cuts and no scene-to-scene coherence!\r\n\r\nHowever, one has to hand it to the director and the writer, because all the characters and their stories seem to have a conclusion. Because, hey, what if the audience goes home wondering what happened to a character, right? And if that means killing off characters, for no rhyme or reason, why not?\r\n\r\nPerformance-wise, everyone has given it their all. Irfan makes an effort to look convincing (especially in the scenes where he is being brain mapped), and not comical. The heroine of the film Deekshita essays Archana, a typical college girl, who sometimes, cannot just take a hint. There are a smattering of other characters, too, like the vellaikaaris who are one minute by the antagonist Riyaz Khan's side, and the other, dancing to an item number in a bar. Only later on, do you realize that they have hidden agendas, too - because, hey, they aren't just mere props in the film, OK? Jayaprakash as Irfan's uncle\/inspiration plays his character well, delivering what is expected of him. Riyaz Khan is the trademark villain, backed by his politician father - played by Y Gee Mahendra.\r\n\r\nOne has to give it to this film, because it really does try. The director, V Vijay Anand Sriram a PhD holder himself (who makes an extended cameo appearance in the film, too), we learn, spent eight years researching the film. We only wish that everything about this film wasn't so confusing - starting with the story line, the back stories, the mind-boggling amount of actual 'science' in the film, brain mapping....(this could take a while).","id":"57036a0992514162630007cd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57036a0992514162630007cd","movie_id":388733}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"As it happened with Papanasam, a remake of the director's Drishyam, the Tamil remake of his Memories, is also tonally different from the original. That film was as much an emotional drama as it was an investigative thriller \u2014 it was about a cop who let his wife and child get killed before his eyes, and how he gets his chance at redemption when he is handed a case involving a 'serial killer'. Director Arivazhan takes this plot, underplays the redemption arc and turns Aarathu Sinam into a murder mystery that also happens to have a tragedy as a sub-plot. This treatment adds pace to the plot but robs the film of the psychological and religious layers, and turn it into a typical thriller.\r\n\r\nThat said, the film manages to keep us engaged from start to finish. The director is no stranger to an investigative thriller (his debut film, Eeram was one till its interval point), and nicely sets up the mystery. The film opens with assistant commissioner Aravind leading an encounter operation, and then cuts to four years later when we see a kidnapping that turns into a murder. A similar murder happens a few months later and the joint commissioner brings in Aravind, who is now an alcoholic after his wife and child are killed by the gangster who got to live after the encounter that we saw at the star, to help the investigation. The cop soon sees clues that the others don't and surmises that the murders are being committed by an individual who is taking revenge on a gang of women for a sin they had committed by in the past. Can Aravind stop him before he loses another person who is close to him?\r\n\r\nAarathu Sinam is not a frame-by-frame remake unlike many of the recent Malayalam remakes and some of the changes that the director has made to the plot work and make better sense in the context of the milieu where he sets his story. The reason why the gangster involved in the initial shootout gains even more credibility here (even the setting where he takes his revenge seems right here). The inter-religious marriage angle also is interesting and adds another layer to the guilt that Aravind has for letting his wife get killed (she had chosen to leave her parents to marry him). And he smartly lets the investigation scenes untouched as Jeethu Joseph's plot was tighter in these scenes. He also abandons the alcoholic angle after a while and this aids his lead actor Arulnithi as it rids him of the pressure to match up to what Prithviraj had done in the original. Visually, the film is more stylish than the original (cinematographer Aravinnd Singh continues in his Demonte Colony form) and Thaman's background score gives it a sense of continuous momentum.\r\n\r\nIt is only when it veers off its main plot that Aarathu Sinam feels like a lesser film. Visually, the scenes inside Aravind's home, especially the ones involving his brother, have a TV serial-like quality to them. The scenes involving Robo Shankar, who plays an assistant commissioner who is handed the case first, feel misjudged. The character is someone who has joined the force after being inspired by cop movies (\"Cinema police\" as a character puts him), and he uses popular cop movie dialogues as his lines. His initial scenes with Charlie (who appears as a fellow cop), in fact, remind us of Janakaraj and RS Shivaji in Apoorva Sagodharargal and Thaman's theme for this character, too, implies the same. In the original, this character had an officious quality about him, and Arivazhagan seems to have tried to make him more entertaining. But, his decision to turn this guy into a comedian feels misplaced. It makes the film's tone uneven by cutting into the in-built tension in the plot. The fisticuff between the hero and the villain in climax also feels wrong, and Gaurav Narayanan, who plays the murderer, is so hammy that he doesn't convey the character's motivation for his crimes properly.","id":"56ebedc4c3a3682251002470","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56ebedc4c3a3682251002470","movie_id":382743}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"While most filmmakers provide the message of their film in the end, Manikandan, in fact, begins Aandavan Kattalai with a card that says that the film is meant to create awareness. He gives us the message right before the beginning of his film: Trusting middlemen is like using others to scratch your nose.\r\nThe story revolves around Gandhi (Vijay Sethupathi, pitching in with a smartly judged performance that brings out the innate decency of this character), a forthright young man, who comes to Chennai from Madurai with his friend Pandi (Yogi Babu, who is the star of the first half, and brings the house down with his one-liners), hoping to go to London and find some work and settle his loans. An agent (SS Stanley) 'advises' him to lie in his passport application that he is married, so that he stands a chance to get a visa. However, his visa application is rejected (Pandi, meanwhile, gets his!), and Gandhi starts working as an accountant in a theatre group. But when an opportunity to go to London with the group comes his way, Gandhi has to get his 'wife's' name removed from his passport, to stay in the good books of the group's head (Nasser). For that, he has to find a girl who has the same name as the one mentioned in the passport \u2014 Karmeghakuzhali. And as luck would have it, he finds one \u2014 a journalist (Ritika Singh, spirited) \u2014 but can he convince her to be part of this divorce process?\r\nJust like how Manikandan's Kaaka Muttai and Kutrame Thandanai refrained from finger-pointing and sermonising, Aandavan Kattalai, too, is far from being preachy, despite involving a subject that offer plenty of targets to take pot-shots at. Both as a writer and filmmaker, the director acts as an observer of characters and their actions, never blatantly judging them (even the scheming ones come across as people who are just making use of an opportunity), and letting the viewer imbibe the message. This technique works marvellously here, where almost every character feels like someone we could encounter in real life. The film is superbly cast, right down to the minor characters like Cheenu Mohan, who works in the passport office. And it is filled with humorous stretches, like when Gandhi and Pandi go house-hunting or the proceedings in a family court. There is also an underlying pathos in this tale, which beautifully comes to the fore once Gandhi's lies start unravelling.\r\nThe film is somewhat leisurely paced, but that isn't much of an issue, as the scenes are engaging. The only underwhelming aspect here is that Manikandan doesn't show us Gandhi's admission of guilt with the theatre group's head, more so because his string of lies begins because he value's the man's trust.","id":"57e8bb56925141395b017faf","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57e8bb56925141395b017faf","movie_id":410432}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Chile's own catch me if you can!**\r\n\r\nIt was Chile's Oscars pick. It made into Golden Globe, but not the Oscars. After I disliked his previous film, looks Larrain back in action. Though, not entirely. This was a biopic, more or less a Chilean version of 'Catch Me If You Can' with a less intensity in its contents. If you are a fan of this director's narration then you might enjoy it. But I thought it was a little boring, due to slow moving story. Especially, half of the film was a background narration than the direct dialogues between the characters. The issue was, it was like someone in the bed, ill and they are narrating a tale. Too low voice like whispering which is equal to lullaby.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, now and then there were some fine scenes. It was a cat-mouse game. But nothing thrilling enough like you would expect from a cop chasing a bad guy films. The story was not deep or detail. Only those limited life events of Neruda were present on the screen. Most of them were silly ones, or maybe made it to look like that way. That's why it felt like a dark comedy. From the cop's perspective, don't expect like Sherlock Holmes level. The cast was good. The locations too, but not those projectors clips for backgrounds during vehicles scenes. So just an above average film. Though should have been better.\r\n\r\n**6\/10**","id":"5a1ec80d9251410330078136","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a1ec80d9251410330078136","movie_id":351454}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**It's a new batch, in the same neighbourhood, but all girls, trying to go wild!**\r\n\r\nI thought the first film was a mistake and now there is another one. I thought only people are reacting negatively, it could be much better than the previous one, but this is really a crap. I'm as a film fanatic hate myself to criticise a film like a film critic does, but there is no other option. I don't know who are the target audience, because it was too sexy for teens and definitely adults won't enjoy unless they are similar to what in the film depicted.\r\n\r\nI don't know why, but I disliked all film with Zac Efron in it. Beside, I'm disappointed in Chloe Grace joining this team. A bad decision, she will regret doing it in the future, maybe she's already. Regarding Seth and Byrne, I don't blame them doing this, at least theirs part were much better than the others. Yet there is no laughs, the film ran with totally dry. Maybe the youngsters would enjoy it than anybody else, because I'm sure the grown-up have already seen better ones in the similar style in the 80s and 90s.\r\n\r\nI hope this is it, no more sequels. Particularly not to end up like 'American Pie', but nobody can stop that if B filmmakers take over from here on. At least first film was much better compared between these two. If you are an adult, sure you should skip it. Zac and Chloe won the Teen Choice awards, so now you know who should watch it. No offense to those who liked it, but for me it is one of the top five worst films of the year. I never write the reviews like this, but I feel bad for what this film made me to do.\r\n\r\n_3\/10_","id":"57ed81649251414c8a000166","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ed81649251414c8a000166","movie_id":325133}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A mother's one final push to save her son's marriage.**\r\n\r\nRemarkable consistency in delivering great dramas. If you are a drama film fan without the language barrier, then you must have seen at least a couple of films of Hirokazu Koreeda. Less than a year ago I saw his new arrival 'Our Little Sister'. Despite not overwhelmingly impressed with that, I won't say that I did not enjoy it. I always fascinated with the realistic portrayal, but the points should be executed so well than leaving empty scenes and dialogues, and calling it an art film. This one was much better. The first impression was okay, but after giving some time between my watch and writing this review, I kind of started to like it more.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this story was not new for me. I have already seen a few similar themed films from other parts of the world, particularly in Hollywood. But none of them were as serious as this one while narrating its tale. The storyline was simple, entirely focused on a family, fighting on stumbling marriage. It was a long introduction, particularly aimed at a father, like how he messed up in his life with gambling. But opening few minutes made him look like a man of example. Only in the following event you would know how deep his troubles are.\r\n\r\nOther than his family, his work field was introduced to us. Being a writer, but for a few quick bucks working as a private eye on his part time, he misuses the opportunity with his loyal friend. Once the film reaches the half way mark, the focus shifts back to the family where the remaining story takes place. It was a stormy day and they all gather in his mother's apartment. This is where everything will be cleared out, whether the marriage will be saved or not. But the mother's one final push as it seems planned perfectly, would it deliver a result is what you should watch it to learn.\r\n\r\n> \u275dI wonder why it is that men can't love the present. Either they just keep chasing whatever it is they've lost, or they keep dreaming beyond their reach.\u275e\r\n\r\nYou can't doubt Hiroshi Abe's presence. He was perfect along with Kirin Kiki, whose a few films I've seen before, but only started to notice recently with her amazing performance from 'Sweet Bean'. The casting looked great, and the locations. I always like films about elderly people, especially to highlight their struggle. And most of the Japanese films I have seen on that concept were just like the way I wanted. Maybe because there are lots of aging people in Japan than anywhere else. Just kidding.\r\n\r\nObviously dialogues are very important for a film and there were many good lines spoken. At one point in the final stage, it flips towards sentiments. Very touching conversation, particularly coming from an old and experienced woman, which is definitely worth taking heed. This is a family film. Despite about a marriage crisis, there is no speculation, like twist and turns. Interesting enough with its plain narration. True to its title and when the title part comes into play, that's where it gets its peak. With its nearly two hours runtime, the pace was acceptable, but patience needed for those got trouble with long films.\r\n\r\nThis is the film about our life, that we can try for what we want to be, but achieving it not easy, not everybody would succeed that. Accepting the fact, as life my go on was the message. Incredible writing and direction. Feels like straight out of a book, it's an original screenplay though. Surely you don't want to miss this film, from this director. Because if you do, it is equal to failing to watch the latest Woody Allen film. Only he's a Japanese version. My final words are the director already made his masterpiece(s), but still it is near to one compared to the international cinemas. So I'm not saying it is a must, but surely worth a try.\r\n\r\n_7\u00bd\/10_","id":"58b34302c3a368528d00b0e0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b34302c3a368528d00b0e0","movie_id":374671}
{"author":"Jane Walsh","content":"Premiere Screening July 23, 2016 \/ Malibu Beach, California.\r\n\r\n**\u2018Billy Yeager \/ The Ineffable Enigma\u2019 ushers in an artistic revolution.**\r\n\r\nBilly Yeager believes in the power of film and music and everything he is doing he is doing in many dimensions at the same time; \r\nhe is not just smashing guitars and setting pianos on fire, he is breaking with tradition, he is breaking with the vanities of the world.\r\n\r\nEvery step of the way we watch and marvel at his talents. Whether he becomes Led Zeppelin, The Beach Boys, Pat Metheny, Jimi Hendrix or a 124 piece orchestra, Yeager proves his point, the matrix, the illusion, and it is a slow and painful process.\r\n\r\nBilly Yeager is a musician, singer-songwriter, filmmaker, activist, humanitarian and an all around living breathing performance artist. He has written and recorded over 2400 songs, and produced 6 films, yet most of his works are extremely hard to find and are considered to be very valuable by serious collectors, but if it can't change the world, the artist wants no part of it.\r\n\r\n\"Everyone can be bought, name your price, one million, one billion? You can't buy me, I don\u2019t need and I don't want your money or acceptance, all I care about is becoming truth, creating truth and changing the world\", says Billy Yeager sitting by his 1967 Chevy van parked out someone in the middle of the Death Valley desert. \r\n\r\nYeager is not just making films and music, his work contains a message and a warning for humanity, and the promises that may lie ahead, but only if today\u2019s artists heed the call of an obligation to society.\r\n\r\nIt may be hard for some to understand his ways and his artistry. Billy goes to the extreme to become that \"voice in the wilderness\u201d, calling our attention to the absurdities of the world. \r\n\r\nBilly states boldly: \u201cWhere\u2019s your righteous anger? Jesus turned over the money tables, it was obvious he was pissed off, there is so much injustice and suffering in the world, and we go on just entertaining ourselves to death? I can\u2019t do that.\u201d\r\n\r\nA sympathizer of Huxley\u2019s and Orwell\u2019s ideas, he doesn't care whether you like him or not, he would rather take his music to the desert to play for cactus and lizards (literally) than to succumb to the audiences of our fickle society that praise every 4-chord song sung by an \u2018American Idol\u2019 contestant. \r\n\r\nYeager sees the future being threatened by corporations and the music and film industry who are creating \"mind controlling entertainment\u201d for the masses.\r\n\r\nWhen Yeager made his first feature film \u2018A Perfect Song\u2019 he attacked one of his favorite rock bands, Led Zeppelin; this was when they had just licensed the song \u2018Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll\u2019 to Cadillac automobiles to be used in their television commercials. It pissed Yeager off. \"Music used to stand for something, but now Led Zeppelin is selling Cadillacs,\" says Lloyd, \u201c Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll used to say \u201cfuck the establishment!\u201d, but we all sold out like whores.\"\r\n\r\nThe character he plays \u201cLloyd\u201d is a type of musical prophet, challenging himself and other musicians to discover the world\u2019s perfect song; there is a great shot when he submerges himself underwater to find the notes to play on his guitar.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are snippets of some of Yeager's diverse styles of music featured in the film, what stands out the most is the soundtrack music, that expresses a haunting and mysterious melancholy, that reflects the beauty of the remote desert, and evokes a warm, sympathetic response to a flood of poetical emotions.\r\n\r\nWho would take 1200 recordings and throw them into a dumpster? One collector featured in the film says, \u201cIt is sad,\u201d but that\u2019s not the way I see it.\r\n\r\nSure Yeager is an amazing musician and songwriter, but what is most impressive is his willingness to depart from the past. Most people live in their past, they live so attached to their achievements and possessions, Yeager\u2019s concern is about creating music that can change the world.\r\n \r\nAnd what artist would be so bold to propose a legislative bill that would ban those \"low frequency noises\" from our public highways?\r\n\r\nDid Yeager really believe his legislative bill to \"ban low frequency rap music from all public places\" would be passed? Or was it just the chance to be able to say what many would love to say but don't have the guts, \u201crhyming words by using a rhyming dictionary to sampled drums is NOT music\u201d?\r\n\r\nHe knows it is an unpopular topic and that most artists would rather \"play it safe\", but Yeager doesn't care how it will reflect on his persona or pocketbook, that\u2019s just what makes Billy Yeager a force to be reckoned with, he is on a mission.\r\n\r\nYeager is taking responsible action challenging all artists to take stock of our collective consciousness, and consider the meaning and purpose of the work they create.\r\n \r\nFor me the Enigma in the story is that Billy Yeager is not just a musician, filmmaker or actor, he is a prophet of our times.\r\n\r\n\u201cEverywhere I look, there is no one to look up to, and I must be that example.\u201d states Billy Yeager","id":"57be4af2c3a36852dc00175a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57be4af2c3a36852dc00175a","movie_id":410845}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Game, music, celebration, romance, emotion, family, friends and the war!**\r\n\r\nAfter giving the career best, the director Ang Lee returned with this which is quite a long gap for him between the films. He has fallen back to the average, like usual whenever he gives a masterpiece. Most directors do that. This film was adapted from the book of the same name. It was not a full fledged war film. It has soldiers, but one day event theme where they are on the short break to homeland to participate in the felicitation programme for their victory.\r\n\r\nThe story closely focused on the young soldier, Billy, Lynn. He was the centre of the event, a war hero. During his stay, he recalls the original event. What really happened and what else he could have done. Apart from that, enjoying the day with a game from the stadium, dance, musics and many more. Meeting family has a sub-plot that reveals about his choice to join the army. Overall, a memorable day with happy and sad incidents.\r\n\r\nSo my first thought in the initial stage was like it is another film similar to the 2009's 'The Messenger'. No, it was not. It was completely different than anything I've seen so far. Refreshing, but not captivating. If you are okay with simple, yet want a feel strong, this is it. It is kind of like mixed result film. Great casting and strong performances. Wonderful debute for the lead actor.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, mix of colourful, full of music, emotional, romantic, thrilling presentation. A bit Americanised, like the film events and the patriotism. So, a much better suitable film for the domestic audience than the rest of the world, perhaps excluding western world. Even though, watching it once is no harm or not bad.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5943093bc3a3686c2c0126c3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5943093bc3a3686c2c0126c3","movie_id":293767}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Gethu begins with Craig (Vikranth), a sniper, who is ordered to assassinate India's top scientist, Abdul Kamaal (if you did not get who the director is referencing here, here's another tip: he has written a book titled Agni Iragugal). The challenge for him is to draw Kamaal, who never gets out of his research facility, to make a public appearance. So, he comes to Kumily, a sleepy hill town, with a plan in mind. Meanwhile, in the town resides Sethu (Udhayanidhi), a librarian, and his father, Thulasi Raman (Sathyaraj), a PE teacher. The righteous Thulasi gets into trouble when he takes on Kandhan (Mime Gopi), the owner of a bar which has sprung up next to the school and even gets framed for his murder. With Kandhan's politician brother and gangster mother baying for his father's blood, Sethu must clear his father's name. What he doesn't realise, initially, is that his efforts will also save Kamaal. \r\n\r\nDirector Thirukumaran has the essentials for a high-concept thriller \u2014 a determined hitman, an ordinary man who stumbles into a nefarious plot by accident, a sub-plot that provides some mystery, and a bit of family drama. It is in his execution that he falters. For a thriller clocking in at under two hours, Gethu moves at a pace that is as sleepy as the hill station where the action happens. The director's choice of slow motion shots as a device to make the action stylish and prolong the tension in the plot works against the film. Add to that a silly romantic track \u2014 featuring Amy Jackson, who plays a book thief! (you just can't help rolling your eyes at the naivete) \u2014 which is made further unbearable with songs popping up every now and then halting the story's flow (perhaps the director felt that he had to give Amy and composer Harris Jayaraj something to do), and you have a film that can test your patience. \r\n\r\nBut, the film redeems itself a bit, chiefly due to M Sukumar's visuals, which turn Kumily into a place straight out of a travel brochure. We just cannot take our eyes of the screen because the frames are so irresistible. Udhayanidhi as the dutiful son also fits the part, but Vikranth, as the terrorist who hardly speaks, feels a bit of a lightweight (he looks too young to be considered a formidable foe). Then there is Sathyaraj (who is given the top billing in the credits), and the veteran chips in with a performance that makes us care about the fate of his character and his family. Thirukumaran doesn't this character as just another supporting character. When the character comes out of prison on bail, we get a scene with only Thulasi and his wife, and the director treats it with the right amount of emotional drama. It is a pity that he could not find this balance when it comes to the other scenes.","id":"56af1f4e9251417e1100c715","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56af1f4e9251417e1100c715","movie_id":367778}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Get a job, get along in a job, drugs, video game addiction, young generation.\r\n\r\nThis film delayed its release for a couple of years due to the distribution issues. That's not it, the film is no good, the writing was terrible, but a bunch of good actors in it. It is about the recent college graduates who struggles to get a job, even if they do, finds hard to fit in. A very good theme, but they failed to draw a decent storyline for it. I think they knew the film won't get a good response, so they used 'distribution issue' card to hold it back, but now it's out and the result was as expected.\r\n\r\nIt should have been called a drama than the comedy, because right now it lacks from those two categories. It digs on the topics like workplace bullying, harassment, as well as the youngsters' addiction to drugs and video games. In one of the scenes it emotionally appeals when the father tries to pay the bill in a restaurant. They had the right content, but lost in the translation to the screen. There's no proper flow in the story, they had tried too much, at a time it all remained very plain.\r\n\r\nThis is the second film to release in this year for Anna Kendrick and both of them did no good for her, especially this film fell short from a long distance. Same goes for Miles Teller and Bryan Cranston. I hope they all forget it and come strong in their next projects. A few people might like it, but not me. I like quality contents where this film is not one.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Behind a great writer, there's a genius editor!**\r\n\r\nI felt the title 'Genius' was not appropriate for how the story revolved in the film. It was more like a commitment and priority given to those undertaking than any other stuffs and that's why it looked like a genius from others eyes. Though I won't deny the experience always comes very handy. This film tells the story of ant editor and how he meets one of the best writers of his time. But they two together give the literature world some masterpiece works and that's the tale the film very genuinely presented to us.\r\n\r\nThis story takes place around the 1930s. An enthusiastic writer and a genius editor develop a strong bond, especially from their professional, but it goes beyond that. When both the families struggle while these two men completely dissolved with their works. So the takes from different angles about the different issues nicely revealed.\r\n\r\nThis biographical film is nothing short for any inspiration if you are looking for some. If you are a book lover, then this is not to be missed, especially if you have read the books by Thomas Wolfe. It's unbelievable that the film was made by a first time director. The actors, including the Colin Firth and Jude Law in the major roles was exceptionally good. We have seen many great films about the authors, so for a difference this film focused on an editor. It stands on the line of Bryan Cranston's 'Trumbo'. I hope you won't miss it, because it is so good if you appreciate the real life achievers, even those standing behind someone's achievements.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"58a3779fc3a3683f19001186","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58a3779fc3a3683f19001186","movie_id":267192}

{"author":"sitenoise","content":"This is the second film **K\u00f4ji Fukada** has made about a stranger insinuating himself into a seemingly calm family. The stranger first starts working for the family in their home business, then he moves in to their home, and then ties between the stranger and the family are revealed and exploited. **Kanji Furutachi** played the stranger in the first one, _Hospitalit\u00e9_. He plays the family man in this one. I like this one better.\r\n\r\nAny time one of a character's introductory scenes consists of bad eating-acting you have the most simplistic of character definitions: the character is an idiot, with a bad moon rising. Both the family man and the stranger are introduced this way. They both turn out bad. No surprise. The first act of this film is full of bad indie nonsense, but after the lame setup material is out of the way, including Asano's snorefest of a background story speech that sets things in motion, the film finds it rhythm. And it's frighteningly good. And only then does it become unpredictable. There's a character swap about halfway through, and trying to figure out the relationship and motivations really put me on edge. The second half of the film is walking on razor blades.\r\n\r\n**Asano** has pretty much jumped the shark, imo. He's played this character a hundred times. I don't think he does anything special here, but he's not bad. **Kanji Furutachi** is a good creep. In the first act he tries to act like a creep and fails. In the second half he becomes a creep and is awesome. But the star of this film is **Mariko Tsutsui** as the wife. Her face is hard-coded for WTF sadness. She does the Japanese thing of remaining calm in the face of super-WTF-ness, wonderfully. There are several big moments, impact moments, in the film where if I were her my head would have exploded. I had no idea how she would react. She's fantastic. The opposite of acting. She looks like she's processing the information given to her for the first time--not like she's acting the part of processing information. Bravo!\r\n\r\nWhen you see what happens to the kid it's funny, sad, super weird and then some. It remains understated which doubles the funny, sad, super weird and then some of it.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what the ending says. It felt abstract and lame but didn't spoil things for me. I highly recommend the film to those who aren't bothered by bad eating-acting, or may not notice bad indie clich\u00e9 scenes, and to those who are forgiving of bad script writing and acting during a film's setup phase.","id":"59a9c38ac3a3685c51000458","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59a9c38ac3a3685c51000458","movie_id":392795}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Once upon a time the king Julius Caesar was kidnapped!**\r\n\r\nSo here's the new film from the Coen brothers. They have become rare in the recent years, I was always checking out what's next for them and now I'm slightly disappointed with this. I enjoyed watching it, it is one of those you want to rate them better, but you can't for some unidentified reasons. According to my analysis why I was not satisfied fully is the story. I mean the narration was rich, performances were phenomenal and music, locations, all were fantastic, but the screenplay was kind of aimless. The beginning, the ending or even in the mid part it had no purpose, but something like a mockumentary about the film industry of the 1950s.\r\n\r\nWith the average screenplay, the directors have shown their magic. Very cool presentation, you would enjoy it if you're theirs films fan. But I don't think all his fans would be pleased enough. This is truly a multi-starrer film, everybody was at their best in their retro characters. If you share your experience with others who also saw it, they might ask who do you liked the most. Probably many would favour Josh Brolin, because he had more priority than others who comes under his belt. But George Clooney and Alden Ehrenreich also have given a good show followed by Scarlett Johansso and Tilda Swinton. The remaining ones as well not bad, but Jonah Hill was completely a waste.\r\n\r\nSince it is about the film industry and its people, brace yourself for some good laughs. There is variety in it like different genre\/theme and multiple layers in the narration. Like from moving to the western to the historical subject and then to the musical and many more. It did good at the box office against its budget, only because of the star power it has and the filmmaker's reputation came in handy. Though I hope the Coen brothers would come back strong with another product and it does not take another 3 years. It is not an award winning film, just a good entertainer, but praisable quality.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"57ed843b9251414c9800029d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ed843b9251414c9800029d","movie_id":270487}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Music, sport and then there's gay.**\r\n\r\nI have seen many gay films, but I never felt very satisfied as this one. It removed all the cliches. You don't get a product like that often. I mean, despite being a gay film, there's no romance in it. But everything was told from a different aspect, like whether it is in the eye of sport, music, et cetera. Maybe if one film that families should watch regarding gay theme, that could be this one. Of course the families should be open minded on LGBT for that. Because the film does not promote gayism, but in a normal tone to say, it's about harassment being whatever you are. And at the end gives a fine message.\r\n\r\nWelcome to T18. I mean happy new year. This is my first review of the year. It is a good start for me being a cinephile. As I've said, it is a rare gem. An Irish film, but in English language. Remember, it is not even a British or Aussie, so the cast and crew are completely unknown. That means it is like watching some B movie. The initial setup reminded me 'Wild Child'. But that was an American film, from Americans perspective, how they see British boarding school. So if you are regular Hollywood teen film watcher, then you might feel slightly strange watching this. Because the students are obedient against their teacher, unlike American rebellious kids.\r\n\r\n> -xX] There will come a point in the future when you won't have to lie anymore. [Xx-\r\n\r\nThe film title might hint strongly that it is a gay romance, but as I said it was not. This is the story of two boys, but most of it was narrated from Ned's perspective. When his parents moved to Southwestern Asia for work, he was left behind at a boarding school. Among bullies, he's very popular for his sexual orientation. But it was never been confirmed, until a new roommate joins him. He's handsome and a rugby player, but they both put together for a talent show, where they have to prepare a song to sing. So the conflict of interest between sport and music surface and fuels further complication in what it is already out of control.\r\n\r\nThis film was made last year, before that year was when the same-sex marriage legalised in Ireland. But the timeline of the film is unknown. Mostly like it just before the legalisation. Because seeing how the story happened, it all makes sense. Still a mixed response from the people, the gays are hesitating to come out of the closet. So the harassers still targeting such people, that's what this film is about. In addition to that, the story was told from the teenager's perspective, but I loved that small part of aspect from a teacher. That kind of looked like a bonus advantage of the film.\r\n\r\nRegarding Rugby, it was part of the storytelling, not the whole story. So whatever happen in the sporting event was a normal result than considered as a cliche. The same goes for the music part of the film too. It did delivered the message cleverly. The best of it was how these two themes were merged to get a wonderful awareness film. Not just one of the best gay film, but one of the best films of the year. Totally worth a watch!\r\n_\r\n7\/10_","id":"5a7715570e0a26643904be84","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a7715570e0a26643904be84","movie_id":412202}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***Tribute to a real-life WW2 \u201cconscientious collaborator\u201d*** \r\n\r\nAfter Pearl Harbor, Desmond Doss of Lynchburg, Virginia, joins the US Army to become a medic and serves at the Battle of Okinawa. As a Seventh Day Adventist and conscientious objector, his goal was to save lives, not kill, which naturally causes problems with his fellow soldiers; until they observe his bravery in combat. Teresa Palmer is on hand as Doss\u2019 potential babe while Vince Vaughn plays the drill sergeant. \r\n\r\nBased on a true story and directed by Mel Gibson, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" (2016) is a reverent and compelling WW2 flick that includes the usual training sequences in the first half balanced by intense combat sequences in the second. The unique factor here is that the brave protagonist refuses to use a weapon and is determined to only save lives in the midst of the insanity of war. This is an interesting real-life tale that needs to be told and \u201cHacksaw Ridge\u201d is a good war movie only marred by laying on the heroics too thick as well as the lack of depth in the peripheral characters, which makes them uninteresting. The latter is in contrast to the outstanding \u201cPlatoon\u201d (1986) which featured several well-defined characters.\r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s about an individual who believes in ABSOLUTE pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that refuses to ever turn to violence, even in response to evil or for the purpose of national defense. He thinks this is supported by the Bible and, specifically, the New Testament, but it isn\u2019t. The Scriptures support LIMITED pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that only resorts to violence when justified. Christ' instructions to \"turn the cheek\" related to responding to a backhanded slap to the face, which was an insult in that culture. In other words, we could all save ourselves a lot of trouble in life if we learn to ignore the antagonism of various morons who would like to divert our focus and ruin our day. The Old Testament teaches this as well: \"A fool shows his annoyance at once, but a prudent man overlooks an insult\" (Proverbs 12:16). So Christ was talking about giving an antagonist a break for the sake of peace in situations of personal offense; he wasn't referring to cases of severe criminal acts or defense of one\u2019s nation. \r\n\r\nFor proof, Jesus' ministry team had a treasury box and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves\/murderers in their travels. You see, Christ & his disciples weren\u2019t absolute pacifists. On two occasions, the Messiah got a whip out and chased all the fools out of the Temple \u2013 throwing over tables, swinging the whip and yelling. He was a Holy Terror, pure & simple, and this caused the legalistic religious leaders to fear him and plot murder (Mark 11:15-18). Harmless pacifists don't inspire fear and provoke murder plots. Moreover, Romans 13 clearly states that the righteous laws of human governments are ordained of God for the purpose of punishing criminals, domestic & foreign, who threaten the lives of citizens. This includes the right to execute when appropriate. The majority of sane Christians realize this, but there are a few extremists, like Doss in the movie, who refuse to be balanced with the Scriptures on this matter and insist that violent conflict is never appropriate. They\u2019re wrong. Sometimes it\u2019s necessary, like after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, unprovoked, murdering over 2300 innocents and wounding 1100.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hour, 19 minutes, and was shot in New South Wales, Australia.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-","id":"5de41be5a7e36300196bca18","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5de41be5a7e36300196bca18","movie_id":324786}
{"author":"Alex Wen","content":"There\u2019s a scene halfway through the film when Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich), a Western B-movie star, is cast in a fancy melodrama helmed by Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes). Doyle is hopelessly out of his element, hobbling about in his new suit\u2013the switch was the studio\u2019s idea in an effort to broaden Doyle\u2019s appeal, much to Laurentz\u2019s dismay. It\u2019s not long before the two engage in a back-and-forth, Laurentz trying to get Doyle to pronounce \u201cWould that it \u2018twere so simple\u201d, and Doyle trying desperately to appease Laurentz. After a lengthy exchange, both are left exacerbated. Much later in the film, we catch a glimpse of the final version, where Doyle and Laurentz compromise with a much simpler: \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026complicated.\u201d\r\n\r\nComplicated is exactly what\u2019s at the heart of this situation. Laurentz\u2019s increasing frustration with this obvious miscast and Doyle\u2019s confusion may serve to fuel the slapstick comedy on exhibit, yet this scene alludes to so much more. It\u2019s the inner mechanics of Hollywood, where directors are mere technicians and actors are props, all to be assigned and managed. It\u2019s the clashing of proud classical Hollywood traditions of entertainment and escapism with the dreaded rise of message films and sophisticated art. It\u2019s the contradictory nature of unfettered creativity with capitalism and consumerism, where compromise\u2013and perhaps communism\u2013seems to be the only way out.\r\n\r\nThis is just one slice of the screwball nature that is the Coen Brothers\u2019 latest comedy, Hail, Caesar! There\u2019s also a kidnapped Roman soldier, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney at his dimmest and greatest), a handsome sailor (Channing Tatum) and a beautiful mermaid (Scarlett Johansson). All opportunities\u2013that the Coens gladly take\u2013to simultaneously demonstrate the power and influence of cinema, while mocking its sense of self-importance.\r\n\r\nEach scene is allowed to play out, Channing Tatum and his homoerotic musical number or Scarlett Johansson\u2019s hypnotizing aquatic acrobatics. It\u2019s not only an homage films of the Golden Era, but a demonstration of the mechanics that make film such an appealing medium. The Coen Brothers have a firm grasp on the allure behind each piece, using the acting, staging and costumes to propel Hail, Caesar! forward. It\u2019s a simple concept\u2013use filmmaking techniques to advance a theme and narrative, but by prioritizing these lengthy sequences over traditional narrative pacing or dialogue, the Coen Brothers give room for these fundamental concepts to breathe and thrive.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s all threaded together through Josh Brolin\u2019s character, Eddie Mannix, studio fixer. And there\u2019s a lot that needs fixing: a pregnant star, a discontent director, communism, threat from the future\u2013the usual. It\u2019s a packed schedule, and the film follows suit with a similarly hectic pacing. An array of symbols, innuendos and subversions are thrown at the viewer: Capital Studios butting with Das Kapital, Mannix being offered a role at Lockheed where they tout a more stable industry\u2013 weapon-making, or Whitlock staring at the audience as he addresses God. It borders on bombastic, but there\u2019s just too much wit, and heart, here to discredit any of the ideas presented\u2013fleshed out or not.\r\n\r\nHail, Caesar! doesn\u2019t break new ground in the increasingly crowded sub-genre of Hollywood-on-Hollywood, but it hits a Goldilocks concoction between inside baseball cynicism and endearing love letter. Though all these antics, the Coen Brothers argue, quite convincingly, that everything in film matters, while also making a case for the futility and hollowness of anything produced on the grounds of Hollywood. So is this a nihilistic shrug at our attempt at defining and contextualizing or a fierce exhibition of the inherent power of Hollywood where life imitates art? Well, as Doyle would try to tell you, \u201cWould that it \u2018twere so simple.\u201d","id":"5701ea29c3a368568c001e49","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5701ea29c3a368568c001e49","movie_id":270487}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Most of these men don't believe the same way you do, but they believe so much in how much you believe. \r\n\r\nHacksaw Ridge is directed by Mel Gibson and written by Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight. It is based on the 2004 documentary The Conscientious Objector. It stars Andrew Garfield, Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Ryan Corr, Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths. Music is by Rupert Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Simon Duggan.\r\n\r\nFilm is a depiction of the real life heroics of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic in WWII during The Battle of Okinawa.\r\n\r\nHow great to have Gibson back directing, more so when he's tackling the brutalities of war and the critical human interest stories within. The story of Desmond Doss is inspirational stuff and Gibson and his team have done his story proud. \r\n\r\nFirst half of the picture details Doss' upbringing, getting to know his family background, his beliefs and the forming of his loving relationship with Dorothy Schutte. Then after Pearl Harbour he enlists in service and we are then witness to boot camp, which comes with the horrors of bullying and ostracization due to Doss refusing to even touch a rifle - let alone use one! After the military based political thunder has exhausted its armoury, Doss and the rest of the 77th Infantry Division are sent to Okinawa to try and capture the Maeda Escarpment (Hacksaw Ridge). From where a true legend is born.\r\n\r\nAs is a Gibson trademark, the battle scenes are terrifyingly real and bloody as can be, the horrors of war laid bare for dramatic impact. Amongst the carnage, which is magnificently framed in smoky hazes and a landscape obliterated by weaponry, Doss (brilliantly brought to life by Garfield) comes to the fore. From within the madness comes humanity in its purest and most genuine form, and it makes for edge of the seat viewing whilst stirring the blood of those invested fully in this remarkable story. 9\/10","id":"5cea38820e0a261bf2ca8ba3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5cea38820e0a261bf2ca8ba3","movie_id":324786}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**On the battlefront, his intention was to save the lives.**\r\n\r\nThe film was awesome, mainly because of the good message it carried out. That's not it, the film was well made with the wonderful cast and their great performances. The special effects were top notch, as well as the location where the majority of the second half takes place. This is a US-Australian co-production. Mel Gibson returned to the director's chair with a bang after exactly a decade. It got six Oscars nominees, so let's wait and see how many awards it grabs.\r\n\r\nIt was the World War II theme, based on a real person and events.

After managing to make through, the remaining film focused to reveal his bravery on the battlefield against the Japanese armed forces at Okinawa in a place called Hacsaw Ridge.\r\n\r\nThe story was based on one of the ten commandments. Doss, who strongly believes in that carries the same ideology to the combat zone. But all the initial part of the film reflects why he is very on to it. Especially after a fight with his brother in his childhood, followed by saving a severely injured man in a road accident just before deciding to join the army. So it is like both, a war film, as well as an anti-war theme. Most importantly, it tells us the bravery of a man, like of something Gandhi in the battlefield.\r\n\r\nHe did it in what he had believed, but my perspective differs. I liked the film, as a biopic and the message it delivered. Very entertaining too, but when it comes to Doss' belief, I think it was flawed. In the first place he would have not joined the army if he's true to the commandment. That's the basic rule of the commandment if one wants to adopt it.\r\n\r\nHe was just one of the unique person with such idea and luckily succeeded following it in a hostile situation. Only if you think all his episodes from an atheist perspective, that's how you would feel. One of the major reasons for that is, when he saves his men by letting his enemy die. But appreciable effort, at least from the Americans perspective. A true hero for his nation. One of the best war films ever. Instead of saying a must see film, I would say don't miss it.\r\n\r\n_7.5\/10_","id":"58b097d5c3a3682354000338","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b097d5c3a3682354000338","movie_id":324786}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Some people are so tough, because that's how they grew up!**\r\n\r\nA biographical sports film directed by some Venezuelan filmmaker and actor Edgar Ramirez in the lead with De Niro in a supporting role. This is the story of a famous boxer from Panama, Roberto Duran. Takes place during the 1980s, when protest was intensified to free Panama canal from the US control. Duran was interested in boxing since he was a little and then he was helped by a local small time coach. But when his professional fight begins to take off big, he required someone who can handle him at the big stages. So that's where a former American boxer comes in and what happens between them, followed by how Duran's life turns out is what covered in the rest.\r\n\r\nBiographies are always good to watch. Sometimes it inspires, how those persons struggled to achieve something big. But this film was just okay, similar to most of the sports films. I did not dislike the story, I did not like how it was made. All I wanted was a better screenplay and it kind of failed on that part. The actors are the best thing in this. Both De Niro and Ramirez were decent, though expected big. Those 80s atmospheres were so good, but the stunt choreography was average. As based on a real person, it is a good film, though watching it for entertainment is a little disappointment. Overall, definitely worth a try.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5835df80c3a3682b3e019689","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5835df80c3a3682b3e019689","movie_id":184341}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"For most of its running time, Kidaari plays out like a mystery \u2014 Kombaiya Pandian (Vela Ramamoorthy), the feared bigwig of Sattur, is found stabbed, and the film takes us through a list of people who are most likely to have done the deed. Could it be Bombay Selvam and Kadakkarai who have tried to take revenge for Pandian murdering the former's father, Market Singaraj? What about Pulikuthi Pandian (OAK Sundar), a smooth-talking relative, whose businesses Pandian ruthlessly usurped? Is it Loganayagi (Suja Varunee) and Gandhimathi Nathan, a couple who are baying for blood because Pandian's arbitration left their son dead? Why not Mappillai Vinayagam, a politician who wants to be the boss of the place? There is also Pandian's own son Udayanambi, who is tired of being treated as the third wheel and is jealous of his father's preference for his Man Friday Kidaari (Sasikumar)...\r\n\r\nPrasath Murugesan uses a novel-like approach to present these suspects. He shows us who these characters are and then narrates the events of the past that triggered enmity between them and Pandian in episodic fashion. To his credit, the director does an effective job in providing us the motivations of each of these characters even as he advances the plot. The characters feel real (though, we wish some very interesting ones like Loganayagi, who starts an affair with Udayanambi upon her husband's suggestion to get her revenge, had been given more screen time) and the choice of actors is excellent. It is only Kidaari who sticks out. While everyone in the place seem to be one kind of schemer or the other, he is just a vettai naai (as the narrator describes him). He takes on his godfather's enemies without batting an eyelid, furtively romances the girl in the house, and stays extremely loyal \u2014 in short, does everything that we expect a hero to do.\r\n\r\nThere is a whiff of Gangs Of Wasseypur in the film's proceedings: the usage of the device of a narrator to tell us the bloody events of the past, the numerous rivalries, the stark cinematography (by SR Kathir), the grungy score (by Darbuka Siva) and even the Aatukaara Sandhu, the street where Kombaiya Pandian lives, is similar to the alley in which the protagonists of that film lived \u2014 surrounded by houses belonging to Pandian's men and a 'no entry' zone for outsiders.\r\n\r\nThe film manages to be engaging enough, with Murugesan nicely introducing humour (one old character who makes empty boasts is a scene-stealer) into the violent scenes. It is only in the final denouement that the film resorts to cliche. The backstory involving Kombaiya Pandian and Kidaari's father Kottur Durai (Napoleon, returning to the big screen after a few years) is so been-there-seen-that and overlong that it leads to an underwhelming end.","id":"57e8b935c3a368475d00fa7e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57e8b935c3a368475d00fa7e","movie_id":408743}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Well, there's always a first time for everything.**\r\n\r\nComing-of-age romance-drama from Britain. Low budget film that was shot a couple of years ago, but saw a delayed release. Everybody knows Will Poulter from 'Narnia' and apart from that he had done a good number of big films, but most of them are side roles. This is his film, the story was told from his character.\r\n\r\nThe story of a teen boy who always been a good boy, but now after meeting a girl on the street, decides to explore the life on the crazy side. It was the affection on her that changed his path. His expectation was to make her fall in love with him back, but it was a complicated environment. What are all his options, and his attempts that leads to the story's end.\r\n\r\nTotally refreshing cast. It was Will Poulter's film, but if you see the film poster it was Cara Delevingne in the front with a big pose who has only a small part in the story. But the reason was, her face, the most marketable among others in the film. The film was not that good, though a decent one.\r\n\r\nThe story perspective and purpose was good, but a little slow, even for a shorter than 90 minute film. The French actress, Alma was good. I liked some of the film scenes, not the overall film. But a nice effort, only if it was set in Brasil, particularly that carnival scene, it would have been a very cheerful flick.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"597e0e45c3a368539701c4dc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/597e0e45c3a368539701c4dc","movie_id":396557}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"The plot of this movie is not exactly a new one. Robots created by humans, created to learn, decides to do things their way. The way of robots is usually detrimental to the health of any humans nearby. When the robots in question happens to be combat robots then shit is about to hit the fan \u2026 big time!\r\n\r\nIt sounds pretty good. The problem is that I found the implementation rather mediocre.\r\n\r\nIt starts off looking rather good with scenes of Mills in the company head quarters and a few cool scenes showing off her eye implants. The movie then moves on to present the military squad that are about to have an unpleasant first hand experience of the \u201crobot way\u201d.  Unfortunately the writer fell for the all too boring and cheap plot element of making the commander an asshole who looks down on anyone who is not a marine grunt. Sigh.\r\n\r\nThen it is quickly off to the island training facility. After the obligatory banter between the marines and Mills in the rather bizarre and not very believable transport ship it is time for some action as the marines deploy.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the movie is pretty much a long sequence alternating between shot outs between the troops and the robots and moments of reflection. The behavior of this so called elite marine squad is amateurish. The robots are underwhelming. What especially ticked me off was that the robots did not seem to be able to hit anything except by pure luck. And these were supposed to be high tech stuff. The marines even use simple smoke to evade them. What the fuck? Advanced killer robots in the future that relies on visual and cannot shoot straight? That is disappointing to say the least.\r\n\r\nOf course there had to be a big shootout in the end. Unfortunately it was just more of what we had seen before. Robots shooting, and missing, wildly. The marines killing them off in rather large, but not sufficiently large, numbers. Finally someone thought about using EMP charges. However here the writer comes up with another stupid plot element. Implants that were not immediately hurt by an EMP pulse but would slowly degrade afterwards and, just for good measure, erase the human memories of the implanted person as well. Contrived and stupid as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nThe end? Well about as meh as you could expect from a low budget sci-fi\/horror movie wannabe. The movie was not outright bad and it did have some interesting ideas but it was pretty clear that it was on a budget with constraints. The writing, the robot designs which seemed to be done by someone caring only about visual appearance and not if the design actually made sense, dragged down the movie.","id":"58f9bb1892514158ae0072a9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58f9bb1892514158ae0072a9","movie_id":384798}

Maybe it\u2019s because director Will Allen was a member of the cult himself and couldn\u2019t distance himself from the subject, but I felt like there were so many missed opportunities to examine some deeper issues about the psyche of cults and religion. It\u2019s hard for me to understand how people can be so coerced into following some self-proclaimed guru and even more shocking that some members were enduring such horrible sexual and mental abuse but nobody cried wolf. The film\u2019s big finale, centering around the eventual disbanding of the cult and a subsequent confrontation of a former member and the leader in Hawaii, is deeply unsatisfying. This is a mildly interesting documentary that sadly fizzles out all too quickly.\r\n\r\n**MATT SAYS:**\r\n\r\nA man spends 22 years filming his own life and personal experiences in a cult named \u201cBuddhafield,\u201d led by a mysterious, charismatic man known only as Michel. In \u201cHoly Hell,\u201d director Will Allen gives us a uniquely personal look into the inner workings of a cult, based on the video he shot for the group while he was a part of it.\r\n\r\nAlthough unique both in its level of access and in its deeply personal connection to the filmmaker, \u201cHoly Hell\u201d is not a particularly well-made documentary. Many questions remain unanswered. The movie fails to shed any real insight into the whys and hows of a cult: what, specifically, attracts people to the group and why do they stay \u2014 particularly after the sordid and scandalous details of its leader\u2019s exploitation of the members become public? Why do adults allow themselves to be exploited? What is it in human nature that draws people to groups like this one and why do they refuse to leave even when they know something is very, very wrong? Because it failed to provide any real level of understanding about the answers to the questions, I give it two and a half stars.\r\n\r\nA SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com","id":"56d52c2dc3a3681e3c018407","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56d52c2dc3a3681e3c018407","movie_id":373472}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The young women's attempts to get the life they wanted.**\r\n\r\nAnother novel based film from the director of 'Love, Rosie'. About the four young women that tells how to enjoy the life by balancing the men and the parties. Very interesting cast, hot ones like Dakota Johnson, Alison Brie and even she's in her 40s Leslie Mann looked so fantastic. The narration had layers to focus on these different people and their different attempt to get the life they wanted. In that, I kind of like Leslie's, maybe the age fact and to be touched by her love tale with decency. But Dakota and Alison led it with their glamorous way and theirs each tale as well not bad, particularly depicting the present world's youngster's culture.\r\n\r\nFrom the all, the biggest surprise was the Rebel Wilson, who I never liked much as I did for in this, definitely she was at her best.

So that makes the stories of everyone take place within the circle and delivered a good entertainment, Lots of fun, even though it is a pure commercial film, there are many things from it that makes us to think seriously.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"One of the factors that worked in Aranmanai's favour when it came out in 2014 was the prospect of seeing Sundar C, a director known for the comedy in his films, attempt a horror comedy. That film was formulaic \u2014 largely a rehash of Aayiram Jenmangal \u2014 but the comedy (read Santhanam) and the kitschiness of the plot made it the kind of film one could politely dismiss as 'one-time watch'. Aranmanai 2 involves a different set of characters and plot, and still feels like a faithful re-tread of moments from the first film \u2014 awkward romantic track between two comedians, segment where the family tries to muster courage and divert the ghost (the one truly funny portion in the film), a group song that involves a comedy dialogue (Kuchi Mittai Kuruvi Rotti) and so on.\r\n\r\nThe plot involves the family of Murali (Siddharth), into whose mansion an evil spirit enters. His father (Radha Ravi) ends up in coma while his elder brother (Subbu Panchu) disappears. His fiancee's (Trisha) brother, Ravi (Sundar C) tries to solve the mystery and they learn that a ghost is responsible for the odd happenings in the place. And when they discover the ghost's identity, they realise it will not stop until every male in Murali's family is dead.\r\n\r\nDespite toeing so closely to the original's formula and being equally unpretentious, Aranmanai-2 feels underwhelming. The comedy is less funny (Soori takes over from Santhanam here) and the horror scenes not even remotely scary (though, the visual effects continue to be tacky). The cast and the director seem to be coasting along with a 'people will see this movie no matter what' attitude, and it is this blatant acknowledgment of the film being just a cash grab that is most disappointing.","id":"56af1efac3a3681c3400afa2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56af1efac3a3681c3400afa2","movie_id":367842}

Nowadays there are lots of altered versions coming that you won't easily say those are the remakes or reboots or spin- offs or whatever they call them in these days. Like 'Premotheus' to 'Alien', this film can remind you a few titles from the past, but 'Contact' is what the majority of us believes it got inspired.\r\n\r\nThe eight Oscars nominees for the film is insane. I know some people liked it, and the film was good, that does not mean it is an Oscar product. I'm okay with the technical side recognition as it deserved that.

Just a simple sci-fi drama, with a few thrills, particularly towards the end.\r\n\r\nWhen the unexpected visitors from the outer-space land their ships in the twelve different locations on the earth, the humans patiently try to communicate with them to learn their intentions. This story focused on the American soil, where experts are brought in to decode the alien language. How the rest of tale develops was told in the remaining parts.\r\n\r\nTo me it smells like a trilogy. If not, it should be. I enjoyed it, mainly because of being a drama. Sci-fi is always associated with action, adventure and thriller, but this drama was something fresh as per todays computer graphics dominated cinema world. This is particularly for the family and older people like the grownups. Like I said the youngsters love action and violence.

{"author":"BadChristian","content":"Arrival is an attempt to take a more realistic approach to how an alien visitation would play out, especially within global politics. The main thrust is that Amy Adams has to find out what the aliens want before any other country can fuck it up and they did a great job in casting Amy Adams. I'm not usually any more than indifferent of Adams, but she does a great job here with what she's given. Jeremy Renner does as good as Jeremy Renner can do with a character that isn't just stoic bad-ass. I like Renner, but unlike other alien films, Arrival isn't an \"alien invasion\" movie where he can run around shooting stuff and making quips, so I'm not sure he was the best choice. The only other actor of note is Forrest Whitaker, who does fine, but he has this stupid accent that has no purpose. I had to watch interviews with him to make sure he wasn't just doing an accent every other time and this was his real voice. No, he does some unnatural accent that really draws you out of the film because there is no reason for it. It's not a foreign accent or a regional one (or at least not one that I've ever heard), it's just some made up shit he does for no reason. The plot is fine for where they are trying to go with the story. Personally, there are some tropes that I really fucking hate and Arrival rides on one of the ones I hate the most. I won't say what it is, because Arrival really should not be spoiled, but subjectively it was a stupid bullshit play and it makes things unnecessarily confusing. Arrival is about the aliens coming to Earth, but that serves more as the gasoline that fuels the very human drama that is very dialog driven and much more about Amy Adams than any of the aliens. I'm unclear about how long the movie takes place, but once they establish the motive of the movie, it feels cheap to skip a huge chunk of time and give us a montage of what happens instead of keeping the flow of progression. The movie takes place mostly in Montana and we get some beautiful scenery and the sets are all great. The cinematography has some interesting ideas and they use shots and colors to enhance the plot. not just document it. Hearing the comparisons to Interstellar, I was afraid of how arrogant, indulgent, and pretentious Arrival might be and while I understand now what they were trying to convey with the comparison, Arrival is none of those things. Arrival doesn't pretend that it's more than it is. There are a few story that keep my personal score from going beyond a four, but I don't see how anyone who watches Arrival knowing what kind of movie Arrival is could give it much less. If you put on Arrival expecting Mars Attacks, Alien, Independence Day, or any other sci-fi spectacle films you are going to be disappointed, Arrival is much more of a drama. Sure, it is technically a sci-fi because aliens, but that's not the drive of the film. If you choose to watch Arrival with the understanding that it can be slow and aggravating and has none of the flash and awe of a typical Sci-Fi, but replaces those with authentic characters and drama, don't think you will be disappointed.","id":"5bf333700e0a261ac201cdf1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bf333700e0a261ac201cdf1","movie_id":329865}
{"author":"Smashing UK Productions","content":"Prior to approaching this film, a word of warning that it is what many like to call a \"thinking person's sci-fi\". If you're going to watch this, I beg that you dedicate your utmost attention to it, as it is truly one rewarding experiences, one of the smartest, most well-constructed science fiction marvels of recent years. 'Arrival' is Villeneuve's magnum opus.\r\n\r\nFirstly, to put your mind at ease, I won't be analysing the plot, thus avoiding the use of spoilers. This decade, Villeneuve has crafted some fantastic works of art in the form of 'Prisoners', 'Sicario' and now this science fiction gem, and here's hoping his career further develops with more movie masterpieces coming our way. In a world where mysteries remain and the possibility of extraterrestrial life still stands unanswered, 'Arrival' approaches this with it's cliche-free take on the genre.\r\n\r\nThe relatively unknown Bradford Young provides the film with some of the most stunning cinematography ever conceived, taking advantage of the twilight hour to give the film its somewhat unique look, supported magnificently by Icelandic composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson whose score is both haunting and beautiful. If you're someone looking for a science-fiction tale that keeps you guessing and thinking throughout, with fantastic performances, cinematography, music and near-flawless direction, then 'Arrival' is the film for you. The masterpiece of 2016!","id":"584312a4925141676400049c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/584312a4925141676400049c","movie_id":329865}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Seeking a second chance for the normal life.**\r\n\r\nWhenever I review a Stop-motion animated film, I always start with by saying it is a dying art form that needs a bigger lift from us. It gave a new life for filmmaking when there were no technology like computers hundred years ago for the creation of giant creatures to all the fantasy and magical world. I am glad that every year someone coming forward to show the world how beautiful these are.\r\n\r\nI think there's a quota for it and 2D animation for the Oscars. Otherwise, these formats would die sooner than we expected, so that recognition in the big stage. Every year at least one film from these two categories makes out. This year it was a double jackpot for Stop-motion animation. Including this, 'Kubo and the Two Strings' was the other one to shine in the world's biggest film awards ceremony. But winning the trophy is almost impossible in this 3D animated film world. Anyway, I'm happy for this, that I enjoyed watching it.\r\n\r\nIt was a short film, that ran for just one hour. First, we have to understand filmmaking in this form is a most challenging one than any other. It is a manual work. I mean people get in there and frame by frame do all the work. So for this one hour film, they had done the great hard work and it paid off well by got nominated for the Oscars. It was also Switzerland's official submission for the Best Foreign Language Film, but failed to make progress in that race.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay was based on the book. A simple story with a strong message. This is the tale of a boy with full of dreams and after his alcoholic mother died, he is taken to the orphanage. That is the last place he wanted to be where he meets a mean boy and soon becomes his close friend. Being young kids, they tend to play some pranks with officials, visitors and themselves. That's one of the ways to cope with for where they have ended. So the remaining is to tell us would they get a second chance in their lives.\r\n\r\n> \u275dI don't know why I'm crying. Sometimes people cry because they're happy.\u275e\r\n\r\nWhen some take up a project like this, they are not offered to make mistakes in choosing a weak screenplay. Because there are thousands of films in production around the world and in those, a handful of animated films, but probably he's only one up for a Stop-motion animated feature. Which means everyone with the knowledge of his commitment will be looking forward to it. So the filmmakers have opted to adapt a novel, which is always a best option in filmmaking.\r\n\r\nThe next is the characters. Making them come alive, particularly initial stage, the creation of models. Yep, they have done that job as well so well. Gooding looking ones, especially among the kids for having similarity with their vision. The frame rate was good. Very smoother for viewing. So technically it was a flawless for the normal watch. An impressive storyline, which might serve as a tearjerker for a few.\r\n\r\nThere's a little romance, but from the children's perspective of having a crush. Since the girl character was introduced, the narration takes a fresh look. The following event becomes even more adventurous and fun filled till the end. The voice-over was excellent. From the dialogues to the film scenes very impressive. It marks the directional debut for a short filmmaker. An appreciable work and I hope he makes more like them with new technics than migrating to computer animations.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages is it is a short and sweet film, but those who love such films might feel it is too short. Most importantly, there're not clich\u00e9s like what we've seen films that takes place in the orphanages. The opening was shocking. If it was a real life, the boy would have ended in a different place. Still the emotional parts were less explored, yet very convincing for not leaning too much on that facet.\r\n\r\nThe film is one of the best in its kind, but I agree it's not a masterpiece. Not if you have seen plenty of Stop-motion animations in your life. Yet it can't be neglected that easily and surely it is for everyone. I know there are folks who thinks this format of films are for little ones, but the truth is they are still in the pre 90s mindset. This is good, give it a try and you might love it. Anyway, for its rareness itself highly recommended, then you decided how do you liked it or not.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5901268a92514155f0003086","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5901268a92514155f0003086","movie_id":393559}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Another fat wedding in one big Greek family.\r\n\r\nA sequel after the 14 years, actually it was not bad. It followed a simple story of another fat wedding in the Toula's big family. Great to see them all once again, and I hope the third film as well will be made very sooner than another 14 years. This franchise has a wonderful set of the characters and each one was in a very unique that imprinted its trademark and so the film gave them all equal parts to explore the opportunity.\r\n\r\nYep, it's not anymore about Toula, particularly not in this part or if you're expecting it to be about her daughter, you will be disappointed, but it was a well distributed contents to all the characters and extracted as much as possible good comedies. Beside it was written by Toula (Nia Vardalos) like the previous film.\r\n\r\nMost of the stuff was as expected, like the slapstick humours. Not everybody would going love it, but if you had liked the first then definitely you would enjoy it as well. Even the first film was not a masterpiece and so this one yet undeniably a good entertainer. Nowadays, in this kind of theme you won't get a fresh storyline, but this one was very original. From the director by 'Everybody's Fine' fame, who really did a good job.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Kung Fu Panda 3 is about what you would expect. A roller coaster ride of gags, goof ups and outrageous martial art outbursts.\r\n\r\nPo is himself, clumsy, na\u00efve, martial arts master and funny.

The wise turtle Oogway from the first Kung Fu Panda is back as well, kind of.\r\n\r\nNaturally there is a big bad villain, General Kai, who it turns out have some past relations to Oogway. General Kai is pretty good as a villain with a suitable maniacal expression on his face. Then of course, a bull in itself is already projecting bad temper and violence so it is a good start.\r\n\r\nThe main story is of course about defeating General Kai but Po\u2019s reunification with his (real) father and the rest of the, funny and very clumsy, inhabitants in the Panda village is taking up a large part of the movie.\r\n\r\nIn general the story is quite nice with some nice twists.\r\n\r\nIt should come as no surprise that Po, as usual, saves the day in a cataclysmic showdown with General Kai.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Kutrame Thandanai, the second film from Kaaka Muttai director M Manikandan, is a solid low-key thriller that is also an understated morality play. The film begins like something out of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window. We are introduced to Ravi (Vitharth), a credit card debt collector. He lives in a run-down flat that provides him a view of the goings-on in the houses of his neighbours. And Swetha (Aishwarya Rajesh, a lingering presence despite her limited screen time), an attractive girl who has a fair share of male visitors, is of particular interest to Ravi.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we are told that Ravi has a unique eye impairment \u2014 tunnel vision; he cannot see objects in the periphery (the film keeps presenting shots from his point of view to reinforce this idea). He is told that he will need to go for eye transplantation, which would cost Rs 3.2 lakh.\r\n\r\nOne evening, Ravi notices Arun, a young man, leaving in an agitated state from Swetha's house. Later that night, he finds Vijayaprakash (Rahman), a middle-aged businessman, in her place, who shows him the dead body of the girl, and promises him money in exchange for his silence. The offer is a Godsend for the young man who thinks he can use the money to get his vision back. Where do his choices take him?\r\n\r\nFor a film that deals with crime(s) and its subsequent punishment(s), Kutrame Thandanai, refreshingly never gets heavy-handed. \"Edhu thevaiyo adhu dhaan dharmam\" says Nasser's character to Ravi midway into the film, and that is as close to sermonising this film comes. Otherwise, the film unfolds as a series of events that are presented in a matter-of-fact manner for us to witness and form our own conclusions. While Manikandan's filmmaking is restrained, curiously, it is Ilaiyaraaja's unusually insistent score, which keeps underscoring every key moment in a dramatic fashion, that feels tonally off, though the immersive sound design makes up for it.\r\n\r\nAnd just as it avoids being preachy, the film doesn't judge its characters and their actions as well. When Ravi chooses to accept cash, it doesn't turn him into a despicable man; in fact, we empathise with him even more because his actions resemble those of a normal man who might find himself under such circumstances. Even Swetha's admission of sleeping around with various men for personal benefits is delivered without any drama.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't mean there isn't any suspense \u2014 we get that a lot, too. We are constantly made to wonder if Ravi's crime might come to light or if his defective vision might undo his plans. The casting of Vitharth is a masterstroke as we are never sure if Ravi call pull his plan off and also keeps us guessing about his morality. Guru Somasundaram as a slimy lawyer's junior is fantastic while Pooja Devariya and Nasser are convincing as the two characters who are sympathetic towards Ravi.\r\n\r\nIt is the climax that somewhat lets the film down as it feels unconvincing and filmi as Manikandan introduces a twist involving Ravi and Swetha that removes the ambiguousness in this tale. It feels as if Manikandan hit upon the idea of the poetic justice served in the climax first and then chose to write the preceding scenes.","id":"57e8b8df9251412987019d15","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57e8b8df9251412987019d15","movie_id":371435}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Every once in a while there is family-friendly entertainment that lives up to its wonderment in imaginative storytelling and stunning visual scope. Certainly this is the case with the stimulating yet meditative Japanese animated fantasy-adventure **Kubo and the Two Strings**. Undeniably vibrant and philosophical in committed heart and soul, **Kubo and the Two Strings** is a majestic masterpiece in its colorfully realized presentation that ambitiously binds together opulent elements of ancient Far East folklore, eye-opening anime and origami (the finesse art of paper-folding). The competition for jaw-dropping animation within recent years (or even this year) has been remarkably stellar thus far but Kubo confirms its superiority above the ranks. No one can doubt the masterful film-making technique administered by the film\u2019s director Travis Knight in this glossy, whimsical medieval gem.\r\n\r\nAs with the majority of adventurous and challenging narratives that seek the high-minded exploratory vibes in its execution, **Kubo and the Two Strings** is about the creative coming-of-age quest of a young boy and the spellbinding encounters that materialize as a result. Knight and screenwriters Marc Haimes and Chris Butler oversees a profound and aesthetically remarkable production highlighted by notable voiceover performers (such as Academy Award-winners Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey), stylish and glowing animation and a hypnotic showcase that is an exquisite treat for moviegoers from all walks of life.\r\n\r\nImportantly,** Kubo and the Two Strings** is aided by its heralded association with the Oregon-based studio Laika whose treasured reputation in the stop-motion animation process is tremendously noteworthy. Among Laika\u2019s previously outstanding cinematic samples include 2009\u2019s _Coraline_, 2011\u2019s criminally underrated _ParaNorman_ and 2014\u2019s _The Boxtrolls_ so indeed Knight\u2019s superlative **Kubo and the Two Strings** is among exceptional stock. The detailed imagery in **Kubo** is indescribably luscious and the brilliant artistic manufacturing of Laika\u2019s refined flourishes only elevates Knight\u2019s enticing animated vehicle as a compelling journey into the ancient Japanese Edo period mythology.\r\n\r\nOne can tell that the coveted **Kubo and the Two Strings** is destined to stay true to its mystical leanings especially when the beginning film\u2019s sequence features the caustic quote: \u201c\u201cIf you must blink, do it now\u201d \u2026because \u201cif you look away, even for an instant, our hero will surely perish.\u201d As previously mentioned the story takes place in ancient Japan where we find the gifted 11-year old Kubo (voiced by Art Parkinson from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d) existing with his ailing mother on the outskirts of a nearby village. The young Kubo\u2019s talents is such that he is a natural story-telling magician that can skillfully convey his expressive communication through origami. Kubo enjoys the gesture of entertaining the local villagers. However, his mother advises that Kubo must be home before nightfall. Unfortunately, Kubo does not heed her advice but that is not due to his personal defiance or negligence.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Kubo\u2019s no-show at home is large in part cue to the dubious agenda of his grandfather Moon Father (Academy Award nominee Ralph Fiennes). In instructing his dastardly daughters to track down their beleaguered nephew the stakes are high especially when Moon Father was instrumental in the demise of his slain samurai father. Hence, Kubo must locate his late father\u2019s magical armor-related belongings and reclaim a sense of honor. The tag-a-longs at Kubo\u2019s side include the woolly-looking snow Monkey (Theron) and buff warrior Beetle (McConaughey). Together, the travelling trio is confronted by beastly specimens and other deceptive supernatural forces en route to the ultimate showdown with his sinister grandfather Moon Father. Armed with resiliency and determination Kubo and his crafty companions face uncertainties that are quite unimaginable to say the least.\r\n\r\n**Kubo and the Two Strings** is an astonishing offering that taps into its pulsating pulse with its mild intensity that should not deter the youngsters from fully experiencing the escapist vision of young Kubo and his offbeat sidekicks. Parkinson\u2019s Kubo is idealistic and has a fearless approach to questioning the unassuming world around him. The combination of roguishness and wide-eyed innocence is certainly appealing to the intrigued tots that may view Kubo\u2019s wily exploits as exciting and surreal in the name of his heroic daddy\u2019s destiny. Theron\u2019s acid-tongued Monkey is inspired in grand impishness with snarky flair. As for McConaughey\u2019s flippant gung-ho Beetle he is an odd serving of comical relief and well-intentional courageousness. Fiennes makes for an ideal unctuous rival as his Moon Father is the Darth Vader to Kubo\u2019s impressionable Luke Skywalker blueprint. Also, Academy Award nominee Rooney Mara is wickedly delicious as the scheming aunts\u2013the twin sisters of Kubo\u2019s sickly mother. Rounding out the supporting cast are the supplied voices of Asian contributors such as George Takei\u2019s (\u201cTV Star Trek\u2019s original Sulu\u201d) Hosato, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa\u2019s Hashi and Minae Noji\u2019s Minae among the Kubo personalities that populate Knight\u2019s dazzling display of a transcendent Japanese-flavored Grimm fairy tale.\r\n\r\nNaturally the real selling point for **Kubo and the Two Strings** is the standout computer-generated technology and other incorporated genres of animation that gives this polished fantasy fable its magnificent sheen. Knight, a first-time director whose background as Laika\u2019s primary animator is evidenced in the celebrated animation studio\u2019s first three films, demonstrates the authenticity of his amazing craft courtesy of the stop-motion precision that defines his sensual cinematic landscape.\r\n\r\nOverall, **Kubo and the Two Strings** radiates with sweeping charm, boldness, curiosity and depth as it exemplifies the epitome of the awestruck construction of an enlightening, sophisticated feature length animation. The mixture of humor, thrills, drama and tragedy is decidedly triumphant allowing **Kubo and the Two Strings** to flex its reflective, throbbing mysterious muscles.\r\n\r\n**Kubo and the Two Strings** (2016)\r\n\r\nFocus Features\r\n\r\n1 hr. 41 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Art Parkinson, Charlize Theron, Matthew McConaughey, Ralph Fiennes, Rooney Mara, George Takei, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Brenda Vaccaro\r\n\r\nDirected by: Travis Knight\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG\r\n\r\nGenre: Fantasy & Sci-Fi\/ Action & Adventure\/Animation\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: **** stars (out of 4)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016","id":"57bea80ec3a3682c4a005667","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57bea80ec3a3682c4a005667","movie_id":313297}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> This time no Skadoosh, but Chi time.\r\n\r\nThree successful films in an animation franchise is a great achievement and according to the production house, yet another 3 films are going to hit the screens in a decade of time. So if you are an animation fan, especially 'Kung Fu Panda' and Po's fan, brace yourself for the future treats. This film was amazing. After two wonderful adventures, now this story has calmed down a bit with simplicity. Visually, it was spectacular with all those fight sequences, but the story was quite dramatised with enough comedies and then the final battle to conclude the 3rd installment on a high note.\r\n\r\nI think it was a well designed storyline in advance keeping in mind 5 to 6 films, that's why the flow was very smooth between all the three with those flashbacks placed at the right place. This particular part belongs to Pandas, the furious five were absent in most of the film, but good to see the return of Oogway. The master Oogway comes at the beginning and then during the end, though very happy for presence as he's my favourite character in this franchise. He's not a big player, but like Yoda, he's amazing and tell me who won't like him.\r\n\r\nThis time no Skadoosh, but a new villain with a battle fought for a new powerful thing called Chi. Now Po got a promotion, so I'm very excited for the next film for how it will going to turn out. This is a beautiful family film and must not miss it. All the cast was returned from the previous two and a few more new were recruited and it is set in a new location for the most of the narration like the most of the animations has done in China. After all made in China is not so bad.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"577aace4c3a3682008001792","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/577aace4c3a3682008001792","movie_id":140300}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A boy, a monkey and a giant beetle team up for a quest.**\r\n\r\nThis is not an old fashioned stop-motion animation. This is a very modern, a hybrid of multiple techniques that includes 3D printing and digital special effects. The directional debut for the producer of 'ParaNorman' and 'The Boxtrolls'. The tale is about a one eyed boy named Kubo, who has been hiding in a seaside mountain cave near a small village from his grandfather, the moon king, ever since his birth, protected by his mother. He grew up listening the stories of a legendary samurai warrior Hanzo. But one day after he himself exposed to the moonlight, the troubles follow. Now his only chance to survive is to find his father's armours and so the quest begins where he teams up with other two.\r\n\r\nThis is a Japanese story, takes place somewhere in a fictional ancient Japan. Technically, this film was so good, very pleasant for viewing, especially the framerate was higher than normal stop-motion animation. The character models, music, the length of the film, the pace of the narration, all were so brilliant, but not the story. It was average, I mean very, very simple and familiar. Still, it is a very likable film, particularly the children would love it. I'm going to repeat again like I always say while reviewing stop-motion animation films that this kind of films are rare, so when they make one, that automatically goes to a must see list.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Raising up a child in the wild, ain't an easy task.**\r\n\r\nThe common tern we all have heard is 'made in china'. Thankfully, it is not about that cheap thing. It's about those beautiful, magnificent creatures born in those regions. Well, I've not seen many documentaries set in that place. So I was happy to watch it, but wasn't that excited as I do for any Disney films. It was the next destination for DisneyNature after venturing in Sri Lanka for 'Monkey Kingdom'. The tenth film. If you are a DisneyNature fan, brace yourself for the wild adventure.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of one of the most uneasy war films I've ever watched, 'The City of Life and Death'. That's the best, as well as the worst decision the DisneyNature had made. He's the best choice since the documentary is about china's wildlife. He knows his nation well than any western filmmakers. The production quality was top notch. But he did not understand the DisneyNature's way of filmmaking, if this film is not only made for Chinese audience.\r\n\r\nApart from those, it was quite an enjoyable flick. Little fun in the parts, as well as gets emotional towards the ending. From cranes to giant panda, monkeys, snow leopard and Tibetan antelope, the narration divides four ways. For every few minutes focusing on these creatures' families, the film reveals the story of their young ones from birth to growing to adult. Like how their mother dedicates to raise them, and the lessons they learn from their clan, as well as their own from their instinct. Then final the storytelling comes to halt when those youngsters set to begin their next stage of life.\r\n\r\n> \u275dThe joy a mother receives from raising a cub from birth, however... is worth a thousand farewells.\u275e\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you must understand the DisneyNature production type. If you know, well, that's good. But if you don't, then know that its products are targeted for little kids. Not like BBC, Nat Geo or any other nature documentaries that expose only reality. Here they identify the character and give a name, then create a story around it in the post production, that's similar to the human's for the kids to understand it better. Especially the harsh parts are trimmed out. Like Disney's fairy-tale, only you are going to witness them in the nature version without magics.\r\n\r\nI'm an adult, and I think it was an okay film. Not because what I stated in the previous paragraph, but I've been following DisneyNature films since its inception and this could be the least best one. I said the least best, not the worst. Tell me who would hate Disney films for being soft and touchy! Yep, only the grown ups do.\r\n\r\nVisually extraordinary, but not the story they have added to it. Narrated by John Krasinki. He did a good job as what they have told him to do. Though my issue is they were lying about everything. I don't think that's what the children should be learning. So on that perspective, this film is not for anyone above 9 years of age, otherwise it will be mislead. I prefer to show them BBC nature documentaries instead. Nonetheless, it is worth a watch once.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59cae05cc3a3687797005875","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59cae05cc3a3687797005875","movie_id":355277}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The Aussie Halloween!**\r\n\r\nYes, Australians too make bad films. No, this is not a bad one. An average. Though I liked the concept. Especially how it had ended. So if the prior parts were excelled, it would have been one of the year's best. It was a one night tale. The story of a Halloween night, that followed two friends fooling around. Actually, they were best friends growing up, but the time pulled them apart. This is a special night to them, so they once again come together and recall their old experiences. As the narration takes the lots of turns, finally ends with a big emotional surprise.\r\n\r\nI felt it had potential. I enjoyed it, but a little boring. They had the end part well planned, but initiation was not that par. Good characters, because of the nice performances. Since the whole film was shot in the dark time, for this kind of theme that looked so good. Seems predictable, maybe not the twist. They should have added more flavour to it before that fine twist. Although thematically slightly an awareness film. Told from the Aussie Halloween style. The film was a little too long, overall watchable one. Teenagers film, but for all ages.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5a77192392514105a6045f2c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a77192392514105a6045f2c","movie_id":409164}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"One would think that the ultimate showdown between two of the most iconic super-heroes would make for some downright compelling action-oriented exploits against a landscape of angst and destruction. Plus, it certainly did not hurt that exhilarating filmmaker Zack Snyder (\u2018300\u2019) was at the helm in bringing together the colorfully and concocted confrontation between The Caped Crusader and The Man of Steel. Also, it should have been an effortless task to bring together **Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice** leading men Ben Affleck and Henry Cahill since they had prior experiences donning heroic attire as mighty super-heroes on call to save the day. So why then does Snyder\u2019s big-budgeted connect-the-dots comic book caper feel so incoherently stiff and aimless?\r\n\r\nThe dour randomness of **Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice** is quite disappointing because this moping actioner wants to grab more than it can chew in its crowded mouth. Snyder and screenwriters David S. Goyer and Chris Terrio aspire to plug in such contemplative issues pertaining to moral ambivalence, political platitudes and religious themes but none of these factors energize or sustain this action-packed narrative that seems to slouch all at the expense of a sluggish approach to the mechanical hedonism that labors.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that **Dawn of Justice** has its share of visual opulence as this is obviously expected in an expansive superhero saga where the proven selling point are two mythical comic book titans spearheading the pumped-up proceedings. Again an overreaching script that plods along, a couple of super-powered sourpusses going the moody motions and the lack of carefree robust action undermine the potential explosiveness that **Dawn of Justice** could have capitalized on with dynamic aplomb.\r\n\r\nSure, there is a noted curiosity and interesting element about the topic of \u201cheroism fatigue\u201d and hidden demons that could have certainly contributed to the psychological strain for our Caped Courageous Ones. Still, **Dawn of Justice** never quite turns this premise into a sparkling case of burn-out conviction, Instead, knuckle-dragging duo of Bruce Wayne\/Batman (Affleck) and Clark Kent\/Superman (Cavell) make the common sleeping pill look like an excitable bag of M&M candy treats. Thankfully, another fan favorite superhero in the form of Wonder Woman (Gal Godot) is thrown into the mix to break up the monotony of the boorish Boys Club. Unfortunately, the appearance of the wily Wonder Woman during the tail end of the second half is too little and too late for her welcomed presence to rescue the film\u2019s clunky pacing.\r\n\r\nGotham\u2019s Bruce Wayne and Metropolis\u2019s Clark Kent are experiencing setbacks that could be perceived as reaching the depressive crossroads. For starters, a maturing Wayne\u2019s\/Batman\u2019s crime-fighting prospects have been tailing off drastically. As for Kent\/Superman his existence at the Daily Planet newspaper seems mundane especially when his boss in editor Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) declares that the public has moved away from print given the major impact of social media and other online resources. So yes\u2026Wayne and Kent are in a critical funk in their professional lives both in and out of their familiar costumes. However, can the slumping cities afford two down-and-out superheroes when one can probably carry the load in rough, unsure times?\r\n\r\nWhen the film establishes the dilemma that there can be only one muscle-bound ego to handle the affairs of the region\u2019s unprotected this is where the **Batman v Superman** portion of **Dawn of Justice** looks as if the frenetic fantasy will percolate. Inexplicably, the hype involving the sparring twosome is put on hold as the exposition takes its tedious time building up the conflict to satisfy the clashing insecurities of the capable caped crime-stoppers. For those that witnessed Cavell\u2019s mediocre **Man of Steel** a few years ago will probably understand the current bad blood that exists between the two super studs. Whatever the case both Batman and Superman have pegged each other as brawny bad news ambassadors\u2026something that does not sit well with either struggling superhero as their revered reputations are on the line.\r\n\r\nNaturally, there are other outside forces to consider as the acrimonious overtones continue to flow between the brooding mega-powers. The famed instigator in Superman foe Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) is realized as the high-tech billionaire nuisance that has an underlying scheme to eradicate both bickering super powers once and for all but not before Luthor pronounces his take on philosophical tirades. In the meantime, Lois Lane (Amy Adams) is on board to profess her undying love and support for her desired dreamboat Superman. Luthor loathing Superman while Lane fantasizing about her strong flashy fly boy. In other words it is business as usual. While Superman is trying to figure out his place in the sun Snyder piles on the bothersome dreamy anxieties that plague the aging Wayne.\r\n\r\n**Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice** is a jumbled mess. Snyder undertakes a convoluted production and tries to sell it as a sophisticated meeting of the misplaced minds between two embattled entities embroiled in uncertainty and super-sized cynicism. Still, Snyder\u2019s vision is mishandled as he seems to have forgotten one crucial point\u2013simply making an action movie that registers with genuine thrills. One cannot help but stumble upon the pretentiousness and piousness that ruins this boneless blockbuster. The film finally decides to stack on the combinations of boisterous match-ups involving everyone but the kitchen sink but all comes off as frivolously forced. Cavell was never really an enticing Superman ever since he donned the big \u201cS\u201d on his chest back in 2013\u2019s** Man of Steel**. Affleck\u2019s Batman is a little more palatable but the constant scowl (both on his face and on the mask) is too much to digest. One would not mind yelling at the screen for Affleck\u2019s alter ego to lighten up a bit.\r\n\r\nThe supporting players are virtually wasted in this exhausting CGI popcorn pleaser. Eisenberg, normally a trustworthy performer with considerable scope, merely irritates as the punkish techno-magnate Luthor. The always radiant Adams is a wash as the gushing Lois Lane. Oscar-winner Jeremy Irons\u2019s Alfred the butler won\u2019t make anyone forget Micheal Caine\u2019s take on Wayne\u2019s trusty man servant anytime soon. Even the reliably adventurous Oscar-nominated actor Michael Shannon cannot exuberantly bring to life the menacing presence of Zod.\r\n\r\nHumorless and hackneyed, **Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice** will probably satisfy indiscriminate devoted fans that will buy into the proposed heralded rivalry. As for others, they will wonder what lies ahead in terms of other League of Justice movies that hopefully can muster up more entertaining stimulation than this over-indulgent doomsday dud. Is anyone up for **Wonder Woman vs. Redwing** with an empowering feminine twist?\r\n\r\n**Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice** (2016)\r\n\r\nWarner Bros.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Anjali Menon's Bangalore Days was overlong with a plot filled with cliches \u2014 a marriage where the man is unable to forget his past love and accept his wife (a sort-of Mouna Ragam with the roles reversed), an impulsive, aimless individual learning to enjoy life after falling in love with a girl who is a motivational figure, a goofball character whose 'romance' is used largely for laughs, and even a climax that involves stopping a character from going abroad! And yet, the film worked and connected with its audience, because it played out more as a wish-fulfillment fantasy, invoking nostalgia (cousins enjoying each other's company), and filled with feel-good moments that one savour many times. But mostly, the cast, which included the younger generation of Mollywood, was simply terrific.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that when the cast of Bangalore Naatkal was revealed, the news was met largely with dismay. But, surprisingly, this remake works to a large extent (if you haven't seen the original, even better), because the director, Bommarillu Bhaskar hasn't made any drastic change to the original script and manages to capture the emotional drama of the scenes. The film is still overlong (despite clocking in at 156 minutes compared to the original's 172) and does take a bit of time to warm up to \u2014 the initial scenes are bland and the lead trio, especially Simhaa, are stiff and do not project the conspiratorial closeness that cousins share. Bhaskar is also unable to capture the rural setting. But once the action shifts to Bangalore, the scenes become more casual and free-flowing. It also helps that the three characters are finding themselves in a new situation and that makes their performances feel real. Sri Divya might not be as chirpy as Nazriya, but she gives a confident performance as a small-town girl in a big city. The only issues are her whiny voice (the actress has dubbed for herself) and the out-of-sync dialogues in the initial scenes. Arya, in fact, is more believable as Arjun, because the role is that of a biker and requires him to be a moody individual who doesn't show his emotions on the outside. We even get used to Simhaa after a point, but Rana Daggubati is clearly miscast. The actor can do brooding roles but here, as Prasad, a newly married man who is unable to forget his girlfriend (Samantha), he doesn't project the character's reluctance to let his wife into his life.\r\n\r\nThe sub-plot involving Kutty's mother and father does not feel as organic as they did in the original (even there, they seemed a bit unnecessary) but it delivers the laughs here and Saranya Ponvannan has a great time playing the role of a woman who gets to satisfy her yearning for city life.\r\n\r\nBut then, we begin to care about these characters and their problems \u2014 Can Divya make Prasad forget his past and fall in love with her? Can Arjun discover the happiness in live and get together with Sara (Parvathy, who reprises the role she played in the original and is fantastic) before she moves to Australia? Can Kutty find his one, true love? \u2014 we are swept up by the narrative (and Gopi Sundar's emotive score), despite the predictability, and start enjoying it.","id":"56b9ca52c3a3681e77002087","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56b9ca52c3a3681e77002087","movie_id":371425}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"An abandoned bungalow, a revenge-seeking young girl who faced a brutal death, an insight into her yesteryear happy life and a protagonist who frantically runs for his life \u2014 Bayam Oru Payanam has every done-to-death formula which we witness in a usual horror film. Nevertheless, the story idea offers enough scope to keep viewers hooked, if backed by strong writing.\r\n\r\nRam (Bharath), a passionate photographer who earlier worked as the reporter of a daily, is a workaholic, who is also a devoted family man. He sets out to Munnar for an assignment in his SUV, while his wife (Meenakshi) and daughter are put up at a guest house a few kilometres away. During his journey in the night through a deserted area (with curvy roads and dense trees), he meets Kavariman (Singam Puli), who helps him find a home to stay. Though the security of the home (Yogi Babu) initially refuses to give them accommodation, the duo manages to convince him.\r\n\r\nA few minutes after entering the house, just when Ram begins to feel comfortable there, he finds something, which could be a crucial evidence to prove his innocence against an alleged mistake that cost him his job as a reporter. However, an unknown force prevents him from using it for his benefit. The evil spirit starts unleashing its power on him in full form, making him run away from the place. But little does he know that the worst is yet to come. Worried about his family, Ram rushes towards the guest house where his family is but enroute, he encounters a number of dead people! A petrified Ram gets to know the story of the displeased spirit and also why he is being desperately hunted. Meanwhile, the spirit is in no mood to forgive him and targets his family, too.\r\n\r\nBharath is apt as a nervous family man. Vishakha Singh as a simple and caring girl, the only hope of her parents, is convincing in her role. John Vijay makes a brief appearance as the head of a moral policing gang, while Urvashi appears as a worried mother in a few scenes.\r\n\r\nAs the end titles rolls down and everyone starts leaving the hall, we are in for a surprise, as a crucial character in the film turns up as a ghost, followed by the announcement of a sequel, titled Bhayam 2. One wonders whether the makers really have plans for such an attempt \u2014 if at all it materialises, it would be appreciable if it has a few spooky moments, engaging story line, novel narration or edge-of-the-seat sequences, as this one is devoid of all these qualities. Despite starting out in hopeful fashion, the film ends up as a futile attempt.","id":"57e8b7f2c3a3687c5c003bcc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57e8b7f2c3a3687c5c003bcc","movie_id":412171}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"As I write this review I have just had a thoroughly disappointing movie experience and it so just happens that I have some strong feelings about the source material for this movie so be prepared for a bit of ranting and a few more \u201cadult\u201d words than usual.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I bought this movie only because I felt I wanted it in my collection just for it to be complete. I was really expecting to be, shall we say, not impressed. A movie about Batman and Superman, heroes that I grew up with, fighting is not my kind of movie.\r\n\r\nIn the end I realized that my expectations of crappines was not enough. I really disliked this movie. In short succession this movie turns several of my childhood heroes to bad guys and the greatest superman bad guy into a unstable hippie-like jerk that goes through the movie behaving like he is a drug addict. So basically this movie went drown the drains for me straight away and then I have not even gotten started about the plot. Actually I felt so annoyed over this crap that I actually spent time taking notes while I was watching.\r\n\r\nLet me see what I noted. Lex Luther is a fucking joke. Alfred, the same. Jimmy Olsen a fucking CIA agent? You got to be fucking kidding me! And not only does he screw Lois Lane but gets himself shot after a few seconds of screen time.\r\n\r\nSame stupid nonsense about XXX being too powerful, is a threat and needs to be government controlled that has been used in hundreds. if not thousands, of crappy low and high budget action movies. I hate that crap. It is stupid, stupid, stupid.\r\n\r\nWeird and totally uninteresting dream scenes, what the f... did the writer smoke? If they wanted to pad the movie it a) was a crappy way of doing it and b) why? With over three hours (Ultimate Edition) it is way to long for such a crappy movie anyway.\r\n\r\nOh, here is a (somewhat) positive note at least. It was indeed rather funny that they had chosen CNN to spew out the nonsense conspiracy theories about Superman being responsible for the bomb in the wheelchair. Fake news anyone?\r\n\r\nI had a little bit of enjoyment of the movie during the last part of the movie when it finally turned into a bit of action. Batman\u2019s car and plane was cool. The action, once Batman getting knocked on his head enough to get to his senses again, was a nice chunk of CGI goodness. That I have to admit.\r\n\r\nOkay, after three, mostly painful, hours the movie finally comes to an end. And what an end. Meh!!! Not only was it a crappy ending but they managed to drag it out forever with excruciatingly boring scenes.\r\n\r\nI am sure a lot of the above can be said to be subjective. For instance my dislike of the way my childhood characters where treated. I am not a professional reviewer though so this is my personal take of the movie. If you don\u2019t like it, fine with me and good for you but do not feel obliged to tell me about it.","id":"5a6353120e0a2619fe00e820","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a6353120e0a2619fe00e820","movie_id":209112}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Choosing something else over a most beautiful woman.**\r\n\r\nA much better film than I thought. Looks more like a television film, mainly because of the cast, except hottie Daddario. Yeah, I was interested in this because of none other than her, otherwise a skippable film. But the story was good. Not the greatest one, though for this kind of production, it fared well. And I think you should expect similarly to get a better experience out of it.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a geek who has a decent life with a well paid job. It is until a girl enters his life, which changes forever. He discovers the alternate way to cope with what he'd lost recently. And his romantic life going to be doomed even before getting it started with a most beautiful woman he had ever dreamed of. So what comes further explains his future from all the aspects of his life.\r\n\r\nI thought it would be a bakery related theme as I misread the title. Sometimes that's good, because to overtake over expectations. Good performances by all the cast, but like I said Alexandra Daddario could be the reason for many like me to have a peek on this film and it is worth apart from that case. You might see it rated average, but I think it is much better than that if you are honest with your experience of watching it. Surely once watchable film.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"591b621b9251415852072528","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/591b621b9251415852072528","movie_id":417877}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The return of the bad Santa!**\r\n\r\nI did not expect this sequel, especially not after 13 years. Even the first film has been just a good for me. I won't say it was an unnecessary follow up. They retained main cast, well, only lead two plus the boy who is now in his early 20s. A similar pattern storyline. If you have already seen the previous one, you would know what to expect from it, but not how much and that was the main issue with this. So anyone would predict the scenes, as well as the twist. Like most of the sequels, it indeed weakened. Though somewhat enjoyable for the good performances.\r\n\r\nR rated comedy. That's another advantage for the grownup audience. But if you aren't a fan of that thematic, then it is even worse than what it's rated everywhere. The length was good, a simple plot, yet the characters had not seriously developed, particularly the new ones. The big excuse was it is a comedy film. They all just came in and straight away displayed whatever they were up to as if we knew them very well. Despite an average film, it can be watched once, even if you liked or not the first part. And it is mainly because of Billy Bob Thornton.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"594307529251417f6b0138da","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/594307529251417f6b0138da","movie_id":338964}
{"author":"TheTenth","content":"Very short synopsis : Batman has been hit hard by the events of Man of Steel : a \"god\" descends on earth, is confronted by another god, and they fight, killing thousands of humans. He learns about a rock coming from his birth planet that can weaken or kill him. It's the property of Lex Luthor, who could target Superman too, but with evil purpose.\r\n\r\nSo I won't go deeper in the story. This movie, unlike most other superhero movie, is targeting adults. I don't mean 18 or 21 year old, I mean mature beings that have endured bad things in life, and have taken the time to see the goods and bads of humanity. Yes, not the Marvel (Guardians of the galaxy, Ant man) target audience. Batman makes it clear (rejoined by the senator) : if a being is so powerful he can't be killed and can kill thousands, even if for now he does good, what happens if he becomes a villain? What laws or weapons can stop him?\r\n\r\nNow going back to the movie and how it presents its argument. We have Batman's introduction to the new DC movie universe (death of parents, tortured psyche ...) done during the opening credits. That is both efficient and powerful. Then we see Bruce Wayne at the time of the Superman \/ Zod battle. We also see humans being scared and killed. So, yeah it's superhero movie making not showing merry world with superheroes saving humans. And doing funny quotes. It's people (or super people) facing tragedy and growing up to see how the future has to be settled. And then a new villain appears. Or rather, he appears as a careless billionnaire showing off - how could he be perceived as dangerous? He has the chance of having Batman wanting to take down Superman, when he wants the same thing, so he can go for his secondary plan to use Krypton technology to change the world.\r\n\r\nSo the last part of the movie is the fight of 3 super heroes against a creature created by the \"god\"'s technology and humanity's madness\/evilness. Yes, it's not a villain that is there because you need one to fight the bad guys, it's yet another consequence of Kryptonians coming to earth.\r\n\r\nSo the films rolls out and I'm so stunned by the content I feel I was treated as a human being, not as a popcorn eating teenager or a comics fan. Just as someone that could appreciate great movie making.","id":"5ad757419251413b2b010380","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5ad757419251413b2b010380","movie_id":209112}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**But it was all about the sub-operation 'X-Ray'.**\r\n\r\nBringing the stars from other film industry is not we never heard of. It is mainly done for the international appeal. So now it was Liam Neeson's turn to foray into a Korean film. He did not go a big transform. He just played an American character and spoke American English. But he did not get the opportunity to exploit well, the role he played was a very important one though. Even I was curious about this film for his presence than the director known for some great hits. The film did fairly enough to my anticipation, but I slightly disappointed with the overall.\r\n\r\nThis is another Korean war theme, that mean based on the real. I think only the events were inspired by, not all the details. Because seems they were improvised for the cinematic version like sentimentalising it. That's the opposite to X-factor in this film, according to me. I started to watch Korean films because of strong emotional appeal, but after all these years watching lots of films, I think that sub-theme was overused. This is a war film and casualties are expected. Not from the viewers' perspective, but the film characters'. So knowing the consequences, the film exploited that too much.\r\n\r\nI am sure that will patriotically appeal to the domestic (native) audience. For the rest of the world, it was a bit too much to take. This film is about a secret mission taken by the South Korean intelligence service after most of its territories were captured by the North in the year 1950. The general Douglas MacArthur of the US armed force with the UN coalition is the architect behind to hit the enemy at the right place. Where his team on an operation known as 'X-Ray' has to clear the way for the bigger one called 'Operation Chromite'.\r\n\r\n> \u275dNobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old only by deserting their ideals.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe team who left behind their family and friends, has to be ready to sacrifice for their nation. Their notion is to steal the military strategies of the North, but it goes beyond that after a series of twist and turns. Theirs brave attempt is what this film talk about. But there is a little chance for a sequel, particularly for what this title actually meant. I mean, the film was all about the operation known as 'X-Ray' which is a sub-operation of 'Operation Chromite'. But the way the film ended gives a hint that there's no more story left to tell us.\r\n\r\nI am familiar with most of the cast and they all were good. It was worth making a film of the real event, but as I know not the best work of the director. Especially the screenplay looked unrealistic in a few parts which is mostly the confrontations between two armed forces. Though in such films it is acceptable which is done for goosebumps and to highlight the heroism with a greater struggle. If you are watching it for Liam Neeson, then you will be let down. He was magnificent in his limited appearance. For me, he looked like a bit Popeye with a pipe and at sea. A couple great quotes from him, but his absence on the field of action would hurt his fans.\r\n\r\nDespite the disappointment, the film is watchable. Reasonable runtime and pace with the fine visual effects, it is worth a try. You will learn the history and apart from that there's nothing special. Whatever happens in earlier parts, the last 30-40 minutes makes the most of the film if you love war and actions. But still I'll pass, not going to recommend it to you, especially if you have watched lots of war films and spy missions. The final thing I wanted to say is don't believe those sites rated it very poorly. It stands between average and good, so the final call should be yours in such situation, but be prepared for whatever outcome you will receive.\r\n\r\n_6\u00bd\/10_","id":"58d808c59251411f8905c59f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58d808c59251411f8905c59f","movie_id":407887}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Moms don't quit! Quitting's for dads!**\r\n\r\nIt was more like a middle aged women's version of 'How to be Single'. So most of the younger audience won't get it, as well as the older people, because of the generation gap. I enjoyed it, but you know this is nothing close to any classic on the similar theme, just a decent entertainer though. From the director of '21 & Over', about the three moms whose children are in the high school, but it depicts those moms struggles over maintain the order in their professional and personal life.\r\n\r\nMila Kunis' character is the centre of the story, but I liked Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn as well. Basically, these three ruled the narration. Some of the comedies were good, though there are too much of sexual references in that. Not good as 'How to be Single', but definitely better than both the 'Bad Neighbours' films.\r\n\r\nIt got a mixed response, but a box office hit. Most of the story is predictable, though decently developed all the scenes by keeping them simple. I mean clich\u00e9 wise, but at some parts it gets loud and out of control. So make sure you are not watching for any inspiration, but the middle aged people feel more familiar with this than anybody else. Therefore, I think they're the target audience, and mostly the women.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"581cf6f3c3a3681e5400121f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/581cf6f3c3a3681e5400121f","movie_id":376659}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"Shares the few weaknesses of the short comic it is based on, but adds a bunch of its own new weaknesses to try and get it up to a theatrical runtime and justify its cinema release.\r\n\r\nI think part of the reason the reception for _The Killing Joke_ has been so overwhelmingly negative is that the expectations were so high going in. But that wasn't without cause. It sees the long awaited return of both Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill to their famed DC roles, and the comic it's based on is widely regarded as one of the better stories ever published by the company. And of these lofty expectations, _The Killing Joke_ falls short.\r\n\r\nHamill is great, and Kevin Conroy usually is as well. There are a couple of occasions that the latter slipped though. I don't know if he's rusty or just didn't care, but his voice performance is not 100%. The story essentially meets that of its source material, but rather than expand the existing story, they chose to awkwardly force an entirely different one in beforehand, to the point that this is essentially two episodes of two different shows, rather than a single cohesive movie.\r\n\r\n_The Killing Joke_ is a little gross and is not the return to form for DC Animation that we all had hoped it would be, but the final sequence is fantastic and I don't know that the movie overall deserves quite as much vitriol as it has had.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._","id":"57c93ed7c3a3687ca90000fa","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c93ed7c3a3687ca90000fa","movie_id":382322}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"\u201cYou can checkout anytime you like, but you can never leave\u201d\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2016 and directed by Andy Palmer, \"Badlands of Kain\" chronicles events when two young women (Rachelle Dimaria & Katrina Norman) embark on a road trip from Southern California to Flagstaff, but breakdown near Kain, Arizona, where the people are weird.\r\n\r\nThis is a low budget indie mystery\/horror, but it\u2019s professionally made. The plot is a little reminiscent of \u201cMessiah of Evil\u201d (1973) with elements of \u201cPsycho\u201d (1960\/1998). It plays like a movie-length Twilight Zone episode, albeit set in the modern day. The story needed tightened up, however; 20 minutes could\u2019ve easily been shaved off the runtime. But I didn\u2019t really mind; the two females kept my attention, especially Katrina Norman. Speaking of which, the creators kept things tasteful with only one tame underwear sequence and no nudity.   \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 48 minutes and was shot in Lake Isabella, Kernville & Bakersfield, California.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Know your enemy's weakness before challenging to a fight!\r\n\r\nIt is known that critics have no brain. It is the best Superman film as Henry Cavill in the red and blue suit. Yep, I know it is always DC versus Marvel, so it is then DC's reply to the 'Avengers'. I don't care their rivalries, as a film fanatic, I enjoy good films and I found it was so good. But I was a bit worried after the Superman was shown in a dark shade in the trailer, especially after Batwan was overly stylised by Nolan, I thought the black suit would take over. After watching the film I was relieved and happy that Batman was exposed.\r\n\r\nBatman fans might have been disappointed, but for the superhero and DC fans, this film is a great treat. You can't compare it with 'Avengers', it had its own style. It follows the 'Man of Steel' and directed by the same director. Excellent cast. I have never been the Ben Affleck hater, so I had no objection to his role in this. He did good along with Cavill and others. He would do better in his solo Batman films if Zack Snyder is retained to script and direct them.\r\n\r\nI'm not a comic book reader, so I did not know the story before the watch. I was surprised for the Wonder Woman's part in the film. The visuals were awesome, the story was unpredictable, well developed characters, cleverly composed scenes, wonderful stunt sequences and the film's overall tone was kind of dark and gloomy, a very satisfying superhero film. The content balance was perfect, but the characters did not do the same as we know Superman is a father of all superheroes.\r\n\r\nI already watched it twice and I can't wait for its sequel. Especially looking forward for Jesse Eisenberg, because he was kind of stayed low in this and I hope his character Lex becomes much stronger. It is a PG13, and there's nothing botherable stuffs in it for the underage audience, but I felt it is targeted for adults because of the matured flavour. Don't think about that I said, just watch it, it will definitely entertain you well if not blow you away. Surely recommended to all.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"5787d205c3a368391d0014b7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5787d205c3a368391d0014b7","movie_id":209112}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**An opportunity came their way for an unplanned venture.**\r\n\r\nAs far I know, there's a thin difference between Canadian films and the US. Just like the Hong Kong's Cantonese and the Chinese Mandarin films are. They exchange starts and crews, but most of the Canadian film I've seen were French language. Those English films are not as popular as the Hollywood's on the world stage. Lots of good films go unnoticed like the recent film 'The Confirmation' I reviewed a few months ago. If this same film were made in Hollywood, would have been considered an average. But for the Canadian standards, I mean they usually won't make the big budget fancy films, hence it is so much better.\r\n\r\nThis is a coming-of-age thriller drama. Revolves around two teenagers as they run away with a bag full of cash from their parents. It all begins with a girl, who arrive in a small town with her father. Soon she makes a friend with her neighbour boy. His parents are neglect kind when it comes to him, and her father is an alcoholic, abuser, as well as a dirty cop. One day her father comes standing between them, that's the opportunity they were looking for to run away, since being with their parents has not been any good. But her father is not in the mood to let them go as his money was involved. So the running and chasing game begins.\r\n\r\nYou might say, you have seen this story in all the similar themed films, no matter its Hollywood, European or the Korean. That's what I thought too, but still it is a very good film. I'm not expecting it to impress you as well. If it does, then that's great. But it all depends on your taste in films, quantity of films you watch regularly and most importantly your expectation from it. It was like another 'Cop Car', but there's no car involved in the core of the plot. It's all about the money and the mad-cop father. It looked kind of western style, or the tale that very much suitable for the humid California settings.\r\n\r\n> \u275dIt's no ocean, but it's ours.\u275e\r\n\r\nIn this, it was always cloudy, wet and chilling moisture atmosphere where all the chase takes place. The great locations that avoids to get in any major town\/city. Other than 3-4 main cast, there's no one else. Because most of the scenes are between the boy and the girl and sometimes her cop father in isolated places. There's a dog in the film, but not focused enough to classify it as a dog film from one of the angles. The pace of the narration was so fast with not too long or very short overall runtime. It had many twists and turns, yet definitely you would predict most of them.\r\n\r\nNice performances, by both the youngsters. As usual Bill Paxton nailed it in his negative role. It was one of his final films before his death early this year. It was a small appearance, but a prominent role that I surely would remember it for him. I was not anticipating anything extraordinary. But when I learnt about its synopsis, I thought I understood everything about the story there itself. Though watching it in the film was a different experience and one of the reason was, it is a different cast and atmospheric setting.\r\n\r\nI felt they should have improvised in some of the parts, but at the end I'm satisfied being what it is. Especially in the initial stage, the intro was so simple and skips fast to the next stage. I did not fully understand any of the characters about their earlier life events to the point where this story commenced. But going forward, I started to have an idea, seeing how the tale has progressed. That really helped to come to the point directly.\r\n\r\nThere are no smart scenes like the film characters to take measures to counter the threats in a fancy way. That's done mainly to impress the viewers. This screenplay tried to be realistic as much as possible, but there's a couple of scenes that could only work in cinematic. I think that's sometimes necessary for a film. After all it is a film and made for entertainment purpose, not a documentary feature. But overall film was much better with enough tense moments and interesting developments. Lots of good films released in the last 12 months and this is not one of them, but considering it is from Canada, surely it is. Because I've already given the reason for that in the very first paragraph. So thumbs up for it from my side.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59519d3192514129c4013be3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59519d3192514129c4013be3","movie_id":393732}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Now that Mohan Raja has proved that he can do original films, Mithran Jawahar has become the go-to guy for remaking a film. 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it,' seems to be the mantra of his filmmaking (though, who knows, he might surprise us all with a Thani Oruvan one day), and that has helped him so far. And that is the case with Meendum Oru Kadhal Kadhai, a remake the Malayalam hit Thattathin Marayathu, which is a fairly competent film as far as remakes go. In that sense, it is on even ground with Bangalore Naatkal, another remake of a Malayalam film that is popular among youngsters in the state. \r\n\r\nThe story revolves around Vinodh (Walter Philips), a happy-go-lucky youngster, whose watching of Mani Ratnam's Bombay at an impressionistic age results in a fetish (of sorts) for the purdah. And his wish comes true when he stumbles into Ayesha (Isha Talwar). That encounter results in a fall \u2014 literally for the girl, and of the head-over-heels kind for Vinodh. And thus begins his dogged pursuit of the girl. But even if she does love him, will her orthodox family, headed by her authoritarian uncle Abdul Khader (Nasser), a politician, agree to the match? \r\n\r\nGiven that it is pretty faithful remake, and the changes that Jawahar does are purely cosmetic (and negligible), it all depended on the cast to make Meendum Oru Kadhal Kadhai work, and they deliver. Jawahar even retains a few actors from the original like Manoj K Jayan (as a police inspector who helps out Vinodh after hearing his love story) and Vanitha Krishnachandran (as Vinodh's mother), and of course, the female lead Isha Talwar, whose chief job here is to make Ayesha look ethereal enough to make us believe that a guy would instantly be besotted with this girl. The other actors, from seniors like Nasser and Thalaivasal Vijay, to the bunch of younger actors who play the characters helping the hero in his romance, are solid. As for Walter Phillips, he is passable in a role that made Nivin Pauly a heartthrob in Kerala. But Walter, who lacks the charm of the latter, plays the role in a po-faced manner, while Nivin performed with a twinkle in his eye. \r\n\r\nEven when the staging or the acting isn't up to the mark, we respond to Shaan Rahman's enchanting score. Take away the score and we wouldn't be caring for this romance as much as we do. We sense it every time the film uses the songs that GV Prakash Kumar has composed, which keep breaking the spell that the background score builds around us (a duet in the second half is pretty much a bathroom break). Even the director seems to realises this and acknowledges the effectiveness of the original's music by reusing a couple of those Malayalam songs at key moments. \r\n\r\nThe original did have its weaker moments \u2014 like the underdeveloped characters in the hero's and the heroine's families \u2014 and it is no different here. And for an (almost) frame-by-frame remake, the scenes feel stretched and Jawahar doesn't quite capture the playful tone of the original. For those who have seen the original, this Tamil version wouldn't seem as charming (obviously!), but there is enough here for someone looking for light-hearted entertainment.","id":"57e8b7b29251412987019c55","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57e8b7b29251412987019c55","movie_id":412224}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Desperate men seek desperate paths.\r\n\r\nPut aside the mainstream Indian films, even I don't watch them. The parallel films, especially in the recent years, it is taking a big leap towards the Internation stage. It is not all about melodrama and typical romance with sexually teasing songs that trademarks Indian films, that's commonly known as masala films. The young filmmakers exploring the new path that earlier Indian films never dared to enter. This is a Kollywood film, about a south Indian metro city, Chennai, that unfolds the dark secrets of the chain snatching network.\r\n\r\nAfter debuting with an average film, the director came strongly to highlight the theft menace in the city of 8 million population. Snatch theft is so common and easily committable crime in the third world, but chain snatching is specially tagged to Indian subcontinent. The Indians love gold, because they culturally very attached it. It is a worrisome thing in all over India today, but the director was successful to disclose how this thing works, probably the first time in Tamil cinema that entirely centralised on it alone.\r\n\r\nThe film opened by unleashing some mysterious event where an abductee was tortured to death. But very soon the flashback commences to reveal the reason behind such act. So all the focus shifts to a small happy family of two brothers and their parents. When the younger brother seeks a motorcycle to impress his girlfriend, his family denies to fulfill his desire. As he's desperate not to lose his girlfriends, decides to take a wrong path not knowing one day it directly affects his own family. The remaining part of the film covers the crucial turning point of the tale before concluding emotionally.\r\n\r\n> \"This world is slave to the man with money.\"\r\n\r\nI think most of the actors, especially main cast was new and\/or second string actors, but they all well done in their respective parts. The storytelling was very good, so once again the credit must go to the screenwriter who is the director himself. Like I mentioned earlier, it is a very important film for the Indians and outsiders to learn about the Indian crime. Besides chain snatching, it also goes length to cover what happens to those goods and how it was forwarded to the next stage of the crime world. So the story was largely concentrated on the thieves to let us know how it all works.\r\n\r\nI'm truly impressed with how Kollywood is focusing to transform the industry by trailing the Korean film style cop, thief kind of dark tone themes. One such example was the breathtaking recent crime-thriller 'Interrogation'. Great characters and stories, but still connects strongly with the local culture when presented them on the screen.\r\n\r\nThis story was developed with lots of inputs like how the middle class family suffers and managing a girlfriend in todays hi-fi world. In a couple of scenes, the father-son's talk was very moving. In other side, the thieves ideology of their work totally disgusts. But it's good to know a few of their strategy. We learn most of the things like this by watching films.\r\n\r\nProbably no one heard of it, I mean not a large population, including me. But when I heard some people praising it on the social network, I quickly on to it. Glad that I watched it, and I'm surprised for its production quality. For the Indian standards, it is surely a gem and for the Internation audience, it might be an unexpected, especially the story wise. If you are not an Indian films follower, it's time to change your stance. As the Indian economy booming, their films as well transforming. There are many awesome flicks released lately and this is one of those. You must check it out if you are interested, but surely worth a watch.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"57a379a0c3a36829a4003b6a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57a379a0c3a36829a4003b6a","movie_id":402692}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Changing one's fixed mind is not an easy task.**\r\n\r\nBased on the novel of the same name, directed by a new lady filmmaker. This British film has two young sensation Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke in the important roles. The story of a young man who was paralysed recently meets his new caretaker. Initially they both won't fit for each other, but after some time everything changes when they together do some outdoor activities. While the film progress, it only gets more emotional. Besides, it's fun watching the first two acts, particularly the performances from both the lead strikes strongly.\r\n\r\nAfter a very long time I watched a good tearjerker, but not that strong. It is a simple story, there's no big adventure or romance in it. That's right, it is not a romance film and if you decide to watch expecting one, you will be definitely disappointed. Also slightly it delivers a bad message like the negativity for being one seriously ill and alive. This issue is only on the humanity ground, but afterall everyone entitled to do what they want, because it's their life.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the film avoids the usual clich\u00e9. Like there's no scene that you had seen in other similar theme repeats here. Deliberately avoided to make it a fresh piece. Basically, if you observe closely the both two lead characters, they had a different agenda about their life. Particularly the caretaker never ever tried anything seriously to accomplish her undertaking.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those parts were very realistic, but still gives us a cinematic experience due to the fancy screen presentation. Surely a good watch, I think everyone should watch it, because there's no drugs, sexes or nudes or even the strong kissing scenes. Only the main theme is something disturbing, particularly for the tender-hearted people. Other than that, I hope you watch it if you haven't yet.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58013bae925141300c000b0f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58013bae925141300c000b0f","movie_id":296096}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"The makers of Meera Jakirathai should thank the recent controversy involving Bobby Simhaa, without which the film would have hardly garnered any attention from moviegoers. Simhaa had alleged that the crew shot the film as a small-scale production without the intention of making it a proper feature film. In fact, anyone who watches this movie will have to agree with him. \r\n\r\nThe film opens with a simple, ineffective establishment shot of a bridge (called 'Kayaar paalam'), which has gained notoriety, owing to a series of horrifying deaths happening near it. Intrigued by this, a visual communication student plans to make a short film on the same, and forms a group of four. The 'enthusiastic four' set out to gather information pertaining to this bridge, said to be somewhere on the Chennai-Puducherry road. They get to know that a supernatural power\/ghost is behind the unsolved murders. \r\n\r\nLater, it is understood that the mystifying homicides occur as part of avenging the brutal injustice done to the person who is the ghost. Thus, the film joins the umpteen numbers of films which have attempted this done-to-death formula. The wrongdoings of Sivanesan (Bobby Simhaa) and his set of friends lead to his own family member getting possessed by the evil spirit. How the ghost unleashes its vengeance and what exactly becomes the driving force for it, is for the viewers to watch... but only if they have the patience to sit through this ordeal. \r\n\r\nMonica, who (supposedly) plays the female lead in the film, comes only in the second half, and is apt in her brief role of a girl who is ready to elope with her lover. 'Lollu Sabha' Swaminathan, who has been brought on board for two scenes to provide comic relief, doesn't succeed, though the fault doesn't lie with him. Editing by Shyjith Kumaran is annoying in most of the scenes, and one finds it really challenging to watch the film till the end despite its under two-hour duration. The less we talk about the music by Raja the better. The actors, mostly debutants, are unimpressive; to be fair to them, they have no scope to do anything. The unconvincing climax coupled with a hint about a sequel just rubs salt into our wounds.","id":"57553dc2c3a368091a002b5a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57553dc2c3a368091a002b5a","movie_id":400962}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"British badass Jason Statham is back and doing what he does best: kicking butt and taking targeted names in the process. The veteran action star is out for more blood in the labored sequel **Mechanic: Resurrection**. The trouble, however, is that fist-swinging wrecking ball Statham\u2019s taste for boisterous blood in his latest toothless and meandering globe-trotting caper may be in desperate need of a transfusion. Woefully repetitive, aimless, strained and riddled with formulaic sharp-shooting shenanigans, **Mechanic: Resurrection** is yet another bombastic Bond knock-off that synthetically strut its stuff in stunt-driven oblivion. The majority of Statham fans may find this latest installment of **Mechanic** worth tinkering with due to its kinetic action-pack parts in motion with its stylish bald-headed anti-hero at the helm of voyeuristic mayhem. Still, for others the excitable human bullet factor routine that the aging Statham has perfected in his past furious film exploits (read: \u201cThe Transporter\u201d film series in particular) is getting long in the tooth as **Mechanic: Resurrection** is yet another familiar and feisty vehicle that the punishing tough guy has predictably driven before.\r\n\r\n**Resurrection** is the follow-up to the 2011 blueprint _The Mechanic_ where Statham portrayed a stone-faced iron man \u201cgun-for-hire\u201d whose mission is to travel the world while eradicating high-profiled baddies\u2013a specialty that he mechanically and skillfully carries out with polished precision. Naturally Statham\u2019s charged take as the combative assassin is based upon the 1972 flick _The Mechanic_ featuring the late great gravel-faced action icon Charles Bronson who was no stranger to vigilante-style cinema.  Statham\u2019s \u201ctake-no-prisoners\u201d approach as the hardened terminator Arthur Bishop is definitely inspired when the English acrobatic avenger is summoned to brandish exotic weaponry, engage in calculating yet cockeyed ways to utilize boobytraps to exterminate his assigned targets and find time to occasionally court the hot chicks that dig his masculine, mischievous charm. No doubt that Statham\u2019s blue-collar Bishop tries to echo the eye-popping sentiments of the aforementioned Bond\u2019s debonair endeavors in intrigue, over-the-top villains, lavish locales and luscious ladies. As for watching the five decade-old adventurous James Bond it feels like an excitable surreal vacation laced with imaginative dare and danger. In witnessing Statham\u2019s stiffened and procedural Arthur Bishop it seems somewhat like an assigned chore in chronicling the gadget-loving gumption of this action-oriented covert clone.\r\n\r\nSure, **Mechanic: Resurrection** derives its occasional chilly appeal from the scenic locations that allows the athletic Bishop to bounce around the globe on an elaborated whim. Plus, some may get an aesthetic rise out of the choreographed in-your-face confrontational fights and showy staged daredevil stunts that feature Bishop\u2019s physical prowess. This is all well and good but the dubious dalliances and action-oriented swaggering that is demonstrated by Statham\u2019s bone-crushing Bishop is rather uneventful and recycled. Unfortunately, **Resurrection** refuses to allow Statham any flexible growth or depth to differentiate his caustic characterization or the high-wire dilemmas beyond the previous antics regurgitated from his earlier copycat fare as _Crank_, _The Bank Job_ and yes\u2026the obvious mention of _The Transporter_ series.\r\n\r\nHit man Arthur Bishop is basking in the scenic Rio de Janeiro  surroundings in hopes of drowning out his deadly duties from yesteryear. Soon, Bishop\u2019s wake-up call to resume his treacherous trade in taking out toxic targets is encouraged by his archenemy in warped businessman Riah Crain (Sam Hazeldine). Specifically, Crain wants Bishop to assassinate three persons of interest in particular that has him roaming three different continents. Bishop is not too receptive to getting back in \u201cthe grusome game\u201d but of course the crooked Crain has a twisted way of convincing him otherwise. The critical key to changing a reluctant Bishop\u2019s mind was to hit him where is heart hurts\u2026that is, abduct his gorgeous girlfriend Gina (Jessica Alba from \u201cSin City\u201d).\r\n\r\nHolding Gina captive clearly gives Crain the upper hand to urge the beleaguered Bishop to return to the fatalistic fold of his poisonous profession\u2013wiping out the assigned undesirables while making it look like accidental incidents. Thus, Bishop puts on his traveling shoes as he hunts down an imprisoned African warlord, an Australian human trafficker and finally a Bulgaria-based arms dealer Max Adams (Oscar winner Tommy Lee Jones). If and when Bishop delivers his three kills for the ruthless Crain then Gina\u2019s release is assured. It is a no-brainer that Bishop wants to ensure the safety of the exotic beauty Gina.\r\n\r\nAlba\u2019s Gina is not the only lovely lady that is attached to Bishop\u2019s hip affectionately. In Thailand, Bishop manages to catch up with another cute bombshell in buddy Mei (martial arts goddess Michelle Yeoh wasted in a transparent role), an innkeeper that worries about her friend\u2019s worldly welfare. Curiously, German director Dennis Gansel\u2019s decision not to give the desirable ageless Asian actress anything to do constructive in this by-the-numbers actioner besides providing sideline concern for Statham\u2019s Bishop is inexcusable. Why not play to Yeoh\u2019s cinematic strengths as a karate-kicking cutie pie with a deadly disposition\u2026you know, what movie audiences have come to expect and cherish about the beautiful Malaysian performer\u2019s film-related credibility? The 1997 Bond film _Tomorrow Never Dies_ effectively used the curvaceous Yeoh to compliment Pierce Brosnan\u2019s Agent 007 so Gansel could not oblige her more on-screen activity with the robotic Statham?\r\n\r\nOf course any Statham-oriented movie would not be complete without the arbitrary display of colorful explosions, glorified chases, exaggerated gunplay and a no-nonsense Bishop predictably flexing his acrobatic leaping, climbing, swimming and fighting muscles as if he was participating in his own self-indulgent Olympic games. There is no real rhyme or reason behind Mechanic: Resurrection other than to revisit the nostalgic relevance of Statham\u2019s left-over box office heft from yesteryear. Perhaps the proven off-kilter spark that Statham generated in the Melissa McCarthy well-received espionage laugher _Spy_ could have been injected in this gimmicky and pointless pot-boiler that has all the succulent juices of a dried-up meatloaf. All the challenging stunt work and exquisite locations cannot excuse the lack of lubrication that Mechanic desires in its insipid, loud execution.\r\n\r\nThere is not much to chew on the bone concerning the so-called return of Statham\u2019s harried hit man that constitutes round two of another dazzling but dense **Mechanic** offering.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Falling in love is a trap, but some men risk everything for it.**\r\n\r\nThis is an unexpected sequel. Actually, I was looking for other sequels from Statham's filmography, particularly the third 'Crank'. I think the idea of going for it was good and the film was not that bad, if your purpose of a watch is time pass. The story was so bad, but the filmmaking was excellent. Because it was made by a renowned German director. Only if he had got a better script, the outcome would have been different. So it's the actors and the director makes it watchable. Other than that, this film falls into the average category.\r\n\r\nThe story follows after Arthur Bishop was found living in Brasil by some people who know him. Then he narrowly escapes from there and lands in Southeast Asia, where he meets Gina, a woman struggling from domestic violence. But he soon discovers that's a setup. After she was taken captive by an international criminal, now he has to follow his instruction to set her free. So the action begins where he takes a series of missions across the globe and how it all ends follows in the rest of the narration,\r\n\r\nIt's good to see Jason Statham back to his signature role. This is what he's good at. Even if the story is not good, that's okay, because Statham's presence is a very comfortable to watch without any trouble. Jessica Alba as well, I haven't seen her in any major hit film at the recent time. Even though the film was received below average, it kind of puts them both back on the track.\r\n\r\nDefinitely they both needed this breakthrough. There's a third film is coming, it's not official yet, but the conclusion was a hint where Tommy Lee Jones can be seen in an important role in the next part. You won't like this film, but surely enjoy it if you are a Statham's fan, that's the only reason to go for it.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"584467c5925141676400c697","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/584467c5925141676400c697","movie_id":278924}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Assassinating the nazi general was their mission, but it initiated the resistance.**\r\n\r\nHonestly, I thought it was some science fiction film. The title sounded like one, so I had to google for its definition. This is an assassination theme, that sets in the early 40s in the Czechoslovakia. The early days of the world war two, where the exile soldiers were sent to eliminate the nazi general Reinhard Heydrich, who was handling the Czechoslovakian affairs. From theirs preparation to the plan execution and the outcome of the result was what this film reveals for us.\r\n\r\nA war film, that too was based on the real, especially the WWII means no need to say how powerful it would be. This was directed by the 'Metro Manila' filmmaker. An internationally produced film, but the cast does not have any big names. I mean Jamie Dornan and Cillian Murphy are not globally recognised, particularly when it comes to the film marketing. So it stumbled at the box office. I liked them both and the others as well. The film was not bad as criticised by the film critics. I would say make your own call after watching it.\r\n\r\nIt was so neat and clean on what it dealt with. The issue with it was too much blank space and then in the mid part where the assassination happened, the film came alive. Again towards the final, the pace gone up and finished strongly. So I think overall length should have been trimmed for a better narration\/result. Not for me, I liked as it is now, but some viewers think it is a draggy.\r\n\r\nSmall budget film, but worth a watch. Because the production quality was great, no compromise on visuals or the settings, but most of them were shot in the real locations to give us the real effect. Definitely one of the best film among WWII related theme. Anyway, this is not a war film, but very much similar to the recent Korean film 'Assassination' about killing the Japanese general. Films like this are must see, because it reveals how much the people, the society and the nation struggled under the nazi atrocities. Surely recommended!\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"584462d79251416ae800bf55","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/584462d79251416ae800bf55","movie_id":351339}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"There are some films that manage to leave you with a warm, fuzzy feeling even though they have their issues. Anjala is one such film. The plot revolves around a 100-year-old tea shop \u2014 Anjala Tea Shop \u2014 that was instrumental in an entire small town developing around it and the struggles its owner, Muthu Velaandi (Pasupathy), a genial, soft-spoken person, faces to keep it open. First, the shop's existence is threatened when the government decides to widen the road for a highway; next, the owner and some of its regulars (who consider the place as home) are arrested on suspicion and the shop is sealed after a customer uses it as a conduit for circulating counterfeit currency. Then there is UK (Subbu Panchu), a big shot, who blames the people in the shop for him getting arrested for selling illicit liquor, and wants to have his revenge. How these events impact the lives of those who hold the place dear is narrated by Thangam Saravanan in a somewhat melodramatic but heart-warming fashion.\r\n\r\nAnjala is an uneven film, with filmmaking that is hardly remarkable and a script that lacks finesse and focus. Yet, the film makes it clear right in the initial scenes that it is more interested in going after our emotions. A couple of stretches are quite impressive. One occurs in the first half when the film flashes back and tells us the story of Muthu Velandi's grandfather, who set up the tea shop. We are shown how a barren expanse of land gradually turns into a community in a plausible manner and the director also uses this segment to impress us with period details \u2014 the independence movement, the advent of radio, the floral prints of the 80s... The other notable segment is the climax where the shop and Velaandi \u2014 in one way or the other \u2014 play a role in sorting out the lives of the shop's regulars, and the community standing together for the shop in its darkest hour. These scenes require some suspension of disbelief from the viewer, but they press the right emotional buttons.\r\n\r\nEven the romantic track between Kavas, the film's nominal lead (played by Vemal, who once again gets to display his one-note talent for playing an affable small town guy) and Uthra (Nandita, who is also typecast as a demure college girl), is kept to the sidelines. Most importantly, despite painting his characters in broad strokes, Thangam Saravan presents most of them as people whom we might encounter on the street.\r\n\r\nThere are also times when the director succumbs to cliches and compromises. The entire arc involving UK seems redundant, considering the shop already has two more serious problems that need to be sorted out. The comedy bits \u2014 one with Adukalam Murugadas as a 40-something bachelor wanting to have a love marriage and another with Imman Annachi as a customer \u2014 are mostly irritating and only end up making the film feel overlong despite its under two-hour running time. Still, Pasupathy's solid, unfussy performance, which at times brings to mind his Kuselan effort, ensures that we do not give up on the film and makes us care about the fate of his character and his tea shop.","id":"56bff29ec3a36817f200aab1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56bff29ec3a36817f200aab1","movie_id":280115}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"The challenges of growing up in a desolate Southern trailer park with an irresponsible, single mother\r\n\r\nA creative & smart 16 year-old girl (AJ Michalka) comes-of-age while living in a trailer park built on the site of a defunct drive-in movie theater in Central\/West Texas. She finds solace in her (imaginary?) relationship with a mystical cowboy (Billy Burke) while dealing with the challenges of her man-hungry single mother (Alicia Silverstone) and her troubled little brother, who has an affinity for a Native neighbor, Tenkill (Michael Spears).\r\n\r\nReleased in 2014, this was director William Robert Carey\u2019s first-and-only film based on his 2013 novel \u201cJesus in Cowboy Boots,\u201d which was the movie\u2019s original title. It\u2019s an offbeat, mundane and gritty drama with one fantasy component; it\u2019s definitely not a comedy as advertised elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSimilar quirky films that come to mind include \u201cMichael\u201d (1996), \u201cDreamland\u201d (2006), \u201cDon\u2019t Come Knocking\u201d (2005), \u201cMud\u201d (2012) and \u201cJoe\u201d (2013). It has the fantasy element of \u201cMichael,\u201d the trailer-in-the-desert setting of \u201cDreamland\u201d and the ugly redneck drama of the other three, as well as the indie artiness of \u201cDon\u2019t Come Knocking.\u201d It lacks the great amusement and positivity of \u201cMichael,\u201d but it\u2019s arguably on par with the others, just different.\r\n\r\nSilverstone was a hot item in the mid\/late 90s and early 2000s, but she has since sorta faded away. The last movie I remember her in was from a decade earlier, \u201cScooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed\u201d (2004). Here she was 37 during shooting playing a 31 year-old woman (who looks older) desperate to settle down with a man before she\u2019s over-the-hill. She had a couple of kids during those ten years and so put on a little noticeable weight; yet she\u2019s still a stunning babe, just with more \u201cmileage,\u201d as it\u2019s put in the movie.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 39 minutes and was shot in Agua Dulce & Santa Clarita, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-\/C+","id":"5b71ddc20e0a267ef6199a33","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b71ddc20e0a267ef6199a33","movie_id":255454}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The Sidekick's way to the superheroes league.**\r\n\r\nThe third film in the 'Antboy' series and probably the last one. If that's true, then it'll be a decent trilogy in the category of children's superhero film. When I saw the first film, I did not think it would come this far. All these three films were decent. The first one was okay. Following, the second film looked much better, but still an average. And now this, surely the worst among three. Watchable, though not any good.\r\n\r\nThe basic plot itself failed. There's no story, just an evil corporation against the Antboy and other superheroes. The best thing about the film was the intro of the Sidekick. At first, it was so suspenseful, yet you can predict that, but once it is revealed at some point, the film loses its charm. What the remaining part is to cover puts the film a back foot to below average. So it is easily the screenplay that failed to deliver.\r\n\r\nThe story continued from the previous part. Albert is also known as The Flea was released from the prison for the good behaviour. But the people of Middleland do not trust him, and so the Antboy. While all the eyes on him, the CEO of Exofarm plans to takeover the city with the company's invention, the Exoskeleton. On the other side of the tale, a new unnamed superhero making some news in the town. Who joins whom and fight against, all the unpuzzling part comes in the final of the third act.\r\n\r\n> \u275dTo be a hero does not mean not having weaknesses. But overcoming them to help others.\u275e\r\n\r\nAs usual, I was not looking forward to it. Because I did not think there will be another sequel. But after seeing this, I felt it was unnecessary. They say it was based on the Danish children's book, but I don't know whether it was just the characters that borrowed or the whole story. This kind of storyline might suit for the book, but not for the film. Because of too simpleness. This same film in Hollywood would be considered a television film probably rated PG for the summer telecast.\r\n\r\nIf you have seen the serious superhero films from DC, Marvels, Sony et cetera, this would seem very silly. But the target audience is the kids aged below 9-10. So even if you watch it, you can't just blame it for not providing you the entertainment you were looking. But you can share your experience, that's what I wanted to do in here. Still, I pointed out a few other things, even if the youngsters reading it, should know them.\r\n\r\nIt reminded me the gap between the two films of 'Kick-Ass'. It was just a couple of years, but the young cast grew up. Yeah, in this you can say they're in their teenage, which makes it the final chapter in the 'Antboy'. But that does not how it ends. It was an open end, without any clue about the future of the franchise. Who knows, they might surprise us with another installment.\r\n\r\nThe actors\/kids performed well. Decent filmmaking as well. Only if the story was much better, the film would have triumphed. Especially for a superhero film, the stunt sequences were too ordinary and too short, as well as too late to come into the party. All these stuffs would come only in the adult's mind, but I think the little kids would just enjoy it. So they should be watching it, not us.\r\n\r\n_4\/10_","id":"597e1041c3a3685440019fe9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/597e1041c3a3685440019fe9","movie_id":378932}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Trying to be a good husband and father!**\r\n\r\nIt took nearly a decade for Denzel to direct another film and this time it sailed through the Oscars with four nominations and one won out of it. Yeah, it was Viola Davis, who snatched the most prestigious award for her supporting actress role. Originally the film based on the stage play of the same name. It is a drama takes place in the 50s about a hard working family man, Troy. His past was not very good, which makes him a little arrogant when it comes to raining his boy. Marrying Rose was the best ever thing happened in his life. Though it was not a perfect family. The differences between them is what later bring twist and turns in the tale before heading for the final of the final act.\r\n\r\nA very simple drama on the fine topic. Most of the film was just a conversation or arguments. And most of the film was little slow moving with the very long overall runtime. If you can manage that, you can enjoy it. If you are a drama genre fan, then you will be more than happy for giving it a try. One of the best drama films of the year, yet not the greatest. It's all finger points at the performances. Those magnificent actors displayed magnificent show. Nearly 35 years old screenplay and 70 years old timeline, still looked the same and powerful. Despite the film's success and poured praises, I don't think it is for everyone. Definitely young generations won't enjoy it.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Deeraj Vaidhy, the debutant director of Jil Jung Juk, seems to belong to that rare breed of filmmakers in Tamil cinema \u2014 one who uses visuals to tell his story. Aided by his cinematographer Shreyaas Krishna, he gives us flamboyant visuals (the film is set in a not-so-distant apocalyptic future), which are further enhanced by Vishal Chandrashekar's boisterous score (that, at times, drowns out the dialogues). In that sense, the film heralds the arrival of a promising talent. But, the film, as such, is somewhat of a minor let-down because the writing is not as strong as the visuals and, while it is definitely offbeat and brave, it doesn't feel as ambitious or as remarkable as it wants us to take it. The film has an attitude that is instantly likeable but look beneath all the coolth and the quirks and what we see is a plot that is formulaic and even predictable.\r\n\r\nHere, Jil (Siddharth), Jung (Avinash) and Juk (Sananth) are tasked by their boss Deivanayagam (Amarendran) with getting a car containing cocaine from one place to the other. But they lose the car in spectacular fashion, and decide to pass off a similar-looking car as the actual one. During this effort, they run into trouble with Deivanayagam's rival, Rolex Rawther (Radha Ravi) and Attack (Dheena), a drug supplier. So, they plot to pit them against one another and get away unharmed. But will their plan work?\r\n\r\nThe jerky narrative follows a structure that we have seen in some of the black comedies (Neram, Moodar Koodam, Burma and Naanum Rowdy Dhaan) over the past few years. We have a lead who aspires to punch above his weight, his sidekicks who are funny and weird in a good way, ganglords who are bitter rivals waiting for an excuse to shoot down each other, goof-ups, misunderstandings and a climax where the leads manage to save themselves by pitting the various players against one another. This could still have worked, but we are hardly able to get the dire situation that the leads are in. One reason for this is that, in his efforts to give us eccentric villains, Deeraj makes them less threatening.\r\n\r\nThere are some big laughs, courtesy the excellent duo of Avinash Raghudevan and Sananth, and Bipin, who nicely plays off on the Harahara Mahadevaki WhatsApp viral audio series. But the problem is that they aren't consistent. For every joke that works, there is an equally laboured (the bit involving Rawther's prostate cancer) or dull one (the scene where the trio try to pass off a drug addict as some from Uganda). To some extent, the director offsets such disappointments by providing us with a steady stream of quirkiness \u2014 Jil's blue-streaked hair, Juk's colour blindness, a cocaine-coated car that is in bubblegum pink colour, butterfly effect, film references (one involving Karagatakkaran's Soppana Sundari joke and the other, a mandatory hat tip to Ajith), animated sequences that play out like cartoons and comic book frames, and a shoot-out that plays out over a funky Carnatic musical piece, but the climax, which is over-stretched and cliched, leaves us with a film that we admire but cannot wholeheartedly fall in love with.","id":"56bff2c5c3a36817e4002ce3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56bff2c5c3a36817e4002ce3","movie_id":366148}

But after checking out the nominees again, I realised it's in there, except a place in the list of Original Song. Having watched it, I know it is not a masterpiece as it should have been, but the film's intention was fulfilled. They have revealed everything we wanted to know. Everything from the Jim's perspective, though his friends and family. In some way this film can be compared to 'Into the Wild'. The only difference is what kind of challenge those two were chosen to face. In one, about the nature and in another, made made.\r\n\r\nA man with no ambition, but he was desperate to do something and then finally he discovered what it is. So James Foley was an average American and had his family's backing of whatever he wanted to do with his life. But shocked them by announcing to be a photojournalist on the battlefront. His first volunteer assignment was in Libya. Made a few friends and ventured together to get what they wanted. Soon a terrible thing happened, but he did not back off. Following that he went to Syria and can he be second time lucky, is what the remaining tale discloses for us.\r\n\r\n> \u275dJim has a million dollar resume and a ten cent interview.\u275e\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I knew Jame Foley story through the media coverages when it hit the headline a couple of years ago. But I did not know this film was based on that, until I saw it. Not easy to watch if you have already known what's going to happen at the end or seen the original clip. I was uncomfortable watching the entire film. Because I think I'm too soft for such kind of conclusion. All I know is if it was the Bush administration, the response would have been different.\r\n\r\nThe film was directed by the Jim's childhood friend. I hope someday someone would make a feature film based on this documentary. If you had seen 'A Thousand Time Good Night', you would know what it is like to be in a combat zone. A similar kind of film, but the result was different. Those being the conflict journalists are really very brave to be at the frontline with the cameras, not the guns. Bullets and bombs flying everything, just one hit, totally fatal. Hats off to them to let us know what's happening in those parts of the world.\r\n\r\nIt covered well, all the basic information about Jim, before entering to the crucial section. When you know enough about him, you start to feel and see from his perspective. There are some recreated accounts, just to give the original effect. But you have to have your own imagination, as much as possible realistic like when you do for reading books. Because that's where it little slipped away, otherwise, and still it is a great documentary. This is a must see film, particularly if you are familiar with the name James Foley.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"58b343b492514177a400b5f8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b343b492514177a400b5f8","movie_id":373441}

Sometimes its common that some films comes out without my knowledge, particularly non-Hollywood English language films. This British film was about a wealthy couple from the New York, especially the husband who tries his best to fulfill his seriously ill wife's dream to be an opera singer. The problem is she's not any good. Not just him, but everybody who is close to them and once laughed at her, try to understand them and give their support. But not all the occasion seems to remain the same. So on one such a big event, the disaster strikes and how it affects the couple is the rest of the tale to disclose.\r\n\r\nA very surprising film. I thought it was just a comedy like it brings small smiles on our face, but I laughed out loud on many occasions. This is definitely a right time, because I felt like it was a music and cinematic version of the American presidential candidate Don Trump. Yep, there not much difference, but still this film is some way inspiring, not Trump. It says you must never give up on your dream. As much as you laugh watching it, as much you realise how hard chasing a dream to be if one is very passionate about something, but does not have the talent to reach the height. The message is very similar to the film 'Eddie the Eagle'. Do you think everybody got talent in the world, so I believe you should watch this and you will know why I'm telling you to watch it.\r\n\r\nWhen I read about the film's storyline, I thought it was so silly. But when I learnt it is a biographical film, that interested me to have a look at it. It is truly an unbelievable film, in a sense of humour and overall a good way. The couple was rich, so they could do anything they want just like what Donald Trump believes. But both the things are not the same, especially this one is more about the real life struggle against the odds. In some parts, it gets more emotional and I loved that final line said by the wife. It's always, the participation that counts, not how you fared it.\r\n\r\nOh my god, another Oscars nominee is almost certain for the record holder Meryl Streep. Hugh Grant was equally amazing and this is one of the best of him I have seen, particularly in the recent times. One of the best main roles for Simon Helberg, he was not next best after the Streep and Grant. I still feel this film is underrated.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**There comes a time for everyone to prove their worth.**\r\n\r\nThe Russian disaster film, partially inspired by the 1980 film of the same name. One of the film to do good business outside the domestic market, particularly in Japan and China. So there are lots of great stuff about it, from filmmaking to the box office and I enjoyed watching it, but did not like it as overwhelmingly. That does not mean it is overrated, but I liked it less, that's all.\r\n\r\nIt is set to tell the story of life of pilots, their personal life, such as trouble with romance, family issues and tackling obstacles in their professional line, especially when they were needed the most. So in the first half it was all about drama, an introduction to what comes in the latter half. A pilot father struggling with his troublesome teen son. And another pilot who got fired from the Russian air force, now in a private airline where he meets a woman, but having a difficulty to stabilise the relationship.\r\n\r\nWhen the second half begins, the narration completely flips. Like it is a different film, particularly brings attention to the action- adventure fans. Fate brings them all together in a plane and they decide to evacuate people who are stranded in an airport near the Alaskan region island when it was hit by volcanoes and a series of earth quicks. The remaining is to reveal the heroic acts by the pilots and Co.\r\n\r\n> \"He's a pilot gifted by God. My hands are only hands, his hands are wings. I have never seen anyone like this before.\"\r\n\r\nVisually, it was good. All those crucial parts of the graphics were rendered neatly. Even the stunt sequences were composed so well. But some of them were unrealistic. That's very common, even for a Hollywood film, so I think it's not a big deal. My issue was the film length. It was over two hours long and I did not like much of the first part. The next half was quite good, because of its thriller. When I thought it's over, the narration surprised with another adventure followed by in the final segment.\r\n\r\nLike usual this Russian film too has been built on the corruption plot. Not the whole film, but in the initial stage. The influenced people who target the honest employees for going against them. Really a good theme, but when the disaster part takes over, everything will be forgotten. Then it gets edgy, so that's where you will forget the time and sit straight to enjoy it. If you had seen plenty of similar heroic films, then it will be another okayish type. If not, you will have a good time with it.\r\n\r\nIt took an hour to get into action-adventure, but in those times, it failed to build the romance part to its best. I'm disappointed with that since it had fine actors and situation to build on. The Father- son duo looked much better. In the second half, nothing of these sentimentally appealed as it should have been, not for me. Because it became more a heroic type with sacrifice than family and relationship influence. So overall it's a good attempt, a nice film for the weekend watch.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"585ea158c3a3681a6500e731","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/585ea158c3a3681a6500e731","movie_id":380111}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**It's a men's club or women's, but jobs are done in the same way.**\r\n\r\nIt's a woman oriented financial film drama directed by a woman filmmaker. That makes it empowered by women. On the perspective it was my first experience, so I think it could be the only of its kind. It is not as bad as it looks, those who liked financial related films like 'Margin Call', 'The Big Short', 'Glengarry Glen Ross' et cetera would enjoy it as well. This film stayed true to its title, so that's what you are going to expect, but nothing a bit more than that.\r\n\r\nThere are unexpected turns in the narration. Particularly the characters, that too the females. It is about the commitment and trust in the colleagues. No matter what you do, the company always judges you by your result. The pace might look slow, but it gets better in the latter half. The film turned into kind of thriller and ended with a little drag, though satisfying.\r\n\r\nAnna Gunn was so good and looks like we have here another talented woman director Meera Menon. This film did not get as popular as its counterpart on the same theme, I mean men's Wall Street thriller. But somewhat I liked it and seems a sequel is not a bad idea, after how this story had ended. Finally, this is for the selected viewers, so those who are from the outside of its bandwidth won't end watching it happy, hence the film will lose its rating, but not the quality.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"585e9e43c3a3681a6b00f9b6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/585e9e43c3a3681a6b00f9b6","movie_id":347033}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Mission save the pub!**\r\n\r\nWell, we always look for something new in cinemas. 90 per cent of all films are based on the same old contents. This was a little different, yet I won't say it was pure new. I enjoyed it, thought better than hundreds of boring films I've seen in the last few months. Surely it does not make sense in the real world. From the entertainment perspective, it delivered, but in the British style.\r\n\r\nIt had wonderful characters and cast. That little girl from 'Golden Compass' all grown up. This is an adult comedy, but nothing was obscene. Quite nicely written story. Four friends who everyday meet in the pub is now trying to save it from closing down. So they have to raise money and they come up with an idea of writing a novel, but want to stay anonymous. That's where a young woman enters that changes the fate of the book, the pub and theirs.\r\n\r\nNot probably, but surely an under-rated film of the year. As well as under-noticed. If you can watch mindless Hollywood comedies, then it is much better than them in many ways. All you have to do is give it a try. Only disappointment was the end. I did not expect it to end just like that. I anticipated emotional conclusion. That would have changed the overall aspect of the film.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The same old gang in a new territory against the new opponents.**\r\n\r\nI have watched all the Venkat Prabhu's films that had started with the original of this film a decade ago. Since sequels are not very trendy in Kollywood, possibly no one would have thought of this installment till the director himself revealed the plan. Definitely worth an attempt. Because Tamil film business had seen a bigger leap, especially in the financial sect. So, big spending for a film with the big names means, even bigger collection and in faster. Giving small sum of it for a talented\/trusted filmmaker is not a big deal. This film closely falls into that category and they have done it.\r\n\r\nYou can call Venkat the king director of comedy films. If you know his filmmaking style, particularly his comedic sense, surely you will know what to expect and how to enjoy it. That means, it is especially targeted the native audience with no age bar. Because some of the comedies highly influenced by the local culture. In addition to that, if you have some knowledge of Hollywood, that will help even better. They had retained almost all the cast and characters. Good to see them all once again in the same frame.\r\n\r\nThe story as well follows after the ten years where many things have changed in the lives of the Chennai Shark (local cricket team) members. Some of them are married with kids and some are yet to settle down. When another guy from the gang is set to enter the wedlock in the rural, something terrible happens when they all decided to participate in a local cricket tournament. Now they have to fight back hard to come clean and save their friendship, as well as the marriage, in particular the girl. With some twists and turns, the tale enters the final segment entertaining its viewers all along.\r\n\r\nThis is very youthful. If you are one, you will enjoy it better than kids and elders. The film was very good, that does not mean it is better than the original. So comparing it with the previous is where it falls back. But I advise not to do that. I had a good time and I think you as well did the same. Definitely there will be third, which might be called 'Super Over' or 'Extra Innings'. Overall, it is not a must see film, but worth giving it a try. #TheBoysAreBack.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58c1e88e9251417b27000239","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c1e88e9251417b27000239","movie_id":410562}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Quick money always ends in a big trouble!**\r\n\r\nIt's one of those films with aimless narration. Indeed, it has a nice cast and characters with the basic storyline, but that did not expand and explored well as it should have been. At least the pace of the narration looked fine. Some characters looked unnecessary, and so a couple of scenes. If these all were managed, then still it could have been a decent film. Because since it is an action- adventure, they did not generate those crucial parts like the stunts and dialogues related to the gangster thing to turn it a better film in its kind.\r\n\r\nThe two veteran actors coming together for the first time added more curiosity than flavour we are looking for. They did okay and so the rest of the cast. Ideal runtime, a few stuffs were in the favour of the film, but those were not enough for the overall success. If the same film was made from the non-English world like perhaps Germany, which was one of the producers of the film would have done better than this existing one which is very familiar with this language.\r\n\r\nPeople would watch it only for Hopkins and Kingley and so did am I. But they might end in disappointment, or that could be the reason to rate it fairly better. Whatever, this is an okay film, which is barely entertaining and of all, not a boring film. So trying it for one is okay, but I think not worth if you have got plenty of options over this one.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"5901251c92514155f4002ebe","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5901251c92514155f4002ebe","movie_id":195590}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Love. Time. Death.**\r\n\r\nI think I underestimated this flick. Despite a wonder cast, I judged the film before watching it. I was surprised how beautiful film it was. Though not a film of the year. It was like 'A Christmas Carol', except the past, present and future were replaced with different topics. And for each topic, separate set of characters with one twist at the end. The overall film was short and sweet.\r\n\r\nA successful businessman man who had lost his child seems not able to come out of the sorrow. His partners are worried for him, as well as the firm's future. So they come up with an idea to bring back their partner that they hire actors to help him recover. How the remaining tale turns out and the last part of the story brings an emotional ending.\r\n\r\nThere were lots of actors for just an 90 minute film. But everybody had a fair share. Nobody was greater than others. Smith had less dialogues as his role demanded that. From all, Winslet role was so ordinary, comparing her star value. Knightley was good, but her one of the dialogues about 'love' was awesome. Norton, Pena and Mirren, all were good in their respective parts.\r\n\r\nAn emotional film, but I don't think it appeals enough to everybody. As I'm being a fan of that theme, I felt it should have been a bit strong in those parts. Other than that it was a good film, a family friendly drama. It was not based on any book, though, looks like one.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A tale of two cities!**\r\n\r\nDid not expect it. It was a unique film. I love such films, because I'm bored of the same old action, romance, horror, thrillers. But it had loads of flaws. It was hard to get rid of them. Even I thought without those flaws, there's no tale to tell. In the end, entertainment matter and this film provided that without logics. So put aside your adult brain and enjoy it like a kid.\r\n\r\nI had not seen the teaser, trailer and never heard the storyline before trying it. I just went and sat, the initial parts were not that impressive. Because returning the hometown is a common clich\u00e9. Though once the story had taken a twist, the rest of the narration changed completely. Well, the story is about the two cities and each city split into a black comedy and a disastrous theme.\r\n\r\nAn unemployed and alcoholic young woman returns hometown after break up with her boyfriend. Befriends an old friend, and starts anew life. Until she discovers that on the other side of the world, a giant monster wrecking up a city. Once again, she discovers that she had something to do with that. Following it, how her response reshapes the entire episode was told with a twist at the end.\r\n\r\nAnne Hathaway was simply good. But not to forget Jason Sudeikis' part too. Both of them controlled the narration. This is a film to have fun. Not to go after errs. A film with the giant monsters, but less graphics used. Very clever writing by the Spanish filmmaker known for some good titles. I think the film is a little underrated. Recommended for those who seek nothing but an entertainment.\r\n\r\n**8\/10**","id":"5a1ecab0c3a3680b9607b649","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a1ecab0c3a3680b9607b649","movie_id":339967}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A woman with many faces!**\r\n\r\nNo doubt this was wrongly labelled as an average film. The title, the story, the performances, all stood to my expectation. I jumped into it prepared for another boring film. Indeed, it was a slow narration, at least in the initial parts. That twist in the early mid sect unleashed the bright side of the tale. Not knowing what to expect, I thoroughly got entertained for the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nIt all was a day event. In fact, most of the story happened on one night. Though for a brief moment in the opening, they have shown us events from the different timelines. Just to convince us. Alice, who befriended a man while in the lunch, decides to attend a birthday party of his friend with him. But that night the things change as some secrets about her was revealed. Then event takes a different path with different adventure revealing more about about her.\r\n\r\nYeah, everybody saying they saw it for Shannon, but for me, Rachel Weisz the reason the film looked so good. It is one of the underrated film of the year. It was unique. Probably less familiarity compared to any film. So not easy to predict the story. The suspense made me so curious and kept my eyes wide open till the end. I would like to see the other side of the story, probably in another film\/part\/sequel. Seems that's a very interesting aspect.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**On the verge to set a foot into the college, theirs wild side unleashed!**\r\n\r\nThis is like a lighter and smarter version of 'Animal House'. The story takes place in the mid 1980 and three days prior to the first day of the college. This film follows a freshman named Jake, who is a baseball pitcher, with his first encounter with his new teammates, as well as housemates. And then a beautiful girl who he befriends. So it's all about the girls, party, video games, dare games and what else, these young guys make their footprint before the college opens. A very satisfying film, all the comedies are within the limits. I mean, usually American teen\/student comedies are overwhelmed by adult jokes and mostly unrealistic. But this one seems real, yet cinematically very appealing to stick with it still the final scene.\r\n\r\nAll the actors were so good. Looks like it is the first film for most of them or I'm watching theirs. Many of them are going to be a big star in the future. Another excellent film by Richard Linklater and an awesome screenplay as well by him. According to him, it is a spiritual sequel to both his previous films 'Dazed and Confused' and 'Boyhood'. I've seen one, I'm going to check it out the other one very soon. Because I'm kind of started to like this filmmaker and his signature.\r\n\r\nI was very impressed by the way the scenes and characters developed. Like everything was simple and familiar, yet very fun to watch. You know, between the seniors and freshmen, it's not like the film promotes bullying, but an understandable compromise which brings smile among us. The 80s setting was so good, almost flawless. The opening scene freaked me out, and then the rest of the film was completely different. Without the big stars, this film was a box office disaster, but surely it will find its place in the coming years. So I suggest you to check it out this rare comedy.\r\n\r\n_7.5\/10_","id":"5835db5c9251416bc601a6c2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5835db5c9251416bc601a6c2","movie_id":295699}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Winning the race, winning the family.**\r\n\r\nThe film was loosely based on the true story of some Italian rally racer. I didn't recognise any of the actors or the director, but I really enjoyed watching it. The film was two hours long, but worth giving a try. I anticipated something different, though what I got was kind of unexpected. If you read the title correctly, you as well think it is a pure race film. The film was well balanced between sports and the family drama. As well as there some funs and highlights the family bond, particularly about the siblings. It was a quite good film for me, but then it all depends on your interest that will decide how much you are going to like it.\r\n\r\nIt is about a teen GT racer whose father had died during she was racing. After the incident, her life begins to fall apart. She's surviving with a younger brother, but their mother left them a long ago. Not so certain about their future, especially the house which they are going to lose soon if she lose the upcoming race. That's where her older brother who ran off long ago comes back. But he's a junkie and needed a place, so comes crashing down with her in the house. Despite his condition, she learns his capability, so offers him a job. Now this duo, as a family and professionally, what they are going to achieve is what follows in the remaining segments.\r\n\r\nIn some parts, the older brother character seemed like a intentional. Like since his entry and his behaviour, most of the viewers would know where this story is going to head. But there are some turns in the midsection, in addition to give depth to his character, as well as to the story. I mean to define how he's changing along the story progression. Though when the film started, he was like in a supporting role, and then the takeover had happened slowly and unexpectedly. Particularly the end event, I did not think he would be on the roll.\r\n\r\n> \"I take a curve at 200 mph and you are worried if I have sex?\"\r\n\r\nOn the other end, I was looking for that young racer to give some spectacular stunt sequences. Then realised this is not a 'Fast and Furious' kind film, but the conclusion was. Yep, I did not expect that after what I saw in the previous 95 per cent of the narration. Because it was like a struggle between desperate to accomplish in a sport and saving themselves from the legal life, since they both are minors. Like I said before, theirs older brother was designed to influence on them in a situation like this.\r\n\r\nDon't go for it thinking it is a sport film, especially impossible high end stunts. The races were the part of the film, but focused on different points in the different segments. Mostly about the life events. Very interesting characters. Three sibling, but belong to three different generations. Theirs bonding was the highlight.\r\n\r\nThe actors who played those roles were superb. In the first half it was that teen girl and then her older brother in the remaining narration. His final race event was what this film turned into a different perspective. More like the 'Fast and Furious' kind, so I think if they are planning for a sequel, they should focus on that kind of plot. Because that will commercialise the product and makes to promote the film itself internationally. Originally it was about the family, so I afraid that does not happen.\r\n\r\nThe overall film was interesting enough to hook with it, but if you had seen lots of Hollywood films on the same theme, you won't be pleased with the race events, except maybe the final one. One of the reasons is that it is a drama-sports, not an action or thriller or a crime- sports. The film was overwhelmed by the drama ingredient. No cops, no villain involved. If they do, not excessively. I think they did not spend much on the film production, though the quality was so good. Whatever the others thought, for me it was just a good film. One time watchable film. I did not like it as much I can suggest it to the others, so I hope you would make a right choice on this.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58446b75c3a3683e1600c231","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58446b75c3a3683e1600c231","movie_id":375572}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A simple job, but a big responsibility.**\r\n\r\nThis was not strong with its screenplay, but visually. The story was trying to be unique and somewhat it succeeds on that. The concept was simple but it worked for the way they have made it. There are lots of colours, especially lights (as you can see from the film poster) and in particular a corridor was regularly used as its trademark. So now and then visually pleases, specifically when the suspense or tense moments arises. I would say a better film than I anticipated for a low budget like this.\r\n\r\nThe kid from the recent version of 'Les Miserables' was one of the leads. There are 3-4 main characters, including one an AI. Like any recent trend in that theme, about the near future with kind of utopia setting, but in a small enclosure like in a building the entire film takes place.\r\n\r\nWhen three new supervisors arrive to maintain the stability in the education programme for the kids, which initially looks fine, but soon one of them started to experience some oddness around. While trying to find what, the story takes twists and turn heading towards the finale where the fate of entire institute will be decided.\r\n\r\nThose who take chances in small films should try it, but not to expect big. Without much of high-end graphics the film achieved the target quality what a standard film requires. If it was slightly well written, it would have been a cult film for sure. But some people still find it better. So I feel worth it a try when you are out of the options on choosing films to watch.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"59288b929251413b4a03ea0d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59288b929251413b4a03ea0d","movie_id":376579}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Dreaming's easy, but chasing it needs all the effort.**\r\n\r\nWell, I praise a lot, particularly the European animations for preserving the 2D animation. That does not mean they lack behind in 3D format. The recent film 'The Little Prince' was the perfect example of a quality 3D animation outside Hollywood. Pars with Disney, Pixar standards. Technically, as well as the story contents. But the quantities are very less and also making it a bit expensive. So they usually prefer producing it in the English language for the wider\/international market, keeping North America particularly in mind. This is a French English-language film that co-produced by Canada.\r\n\r\nThis is a nice film, that particularly targets little kids and mostly the girl audience to inspire Ballerina. Cute characters and scenes, but very familiar story. Shares lots of similarities with 'August Rush', except the field of interest. I am not an expert or know all about Ballet, but some of the parts involving them were turned me off. I know the gravitation force is irrelevant in animation since they're not real world to comply with science, but maybe I'm being an adult and knowing that stuff might have influenced me to think that way. It reminds me I'm really an adult, though this film should be watched as a kid despite whatever you are. However, nothing affected me from enjoying it.\r\n\r\nIt sets in the 80s of the 19th century France. At the time when Eiffel Tower and Statue of Libery were on the construction, a poor orphan girl named Felicie escapes orphanage with another boy to pursue her dream to be a ballerina. Then they arrive in Paris, and very soon they find their separate ways to achieve the goals. Not all smooth sail, especially for her. So she takes the opportunity that comes her way, even after knowing it was wrong to do.\r\n\r\n> \u275dYou have something that she can only dream of: passion!\u275e\r\n\r\nFrom there, with all the complications tailing her, how far she could go to make her dream come true. Which also includes the amount of dedication put on her undertaking to meet the expectations of her trainer, rivals and many others. And to show the world the interest is not simply based on enthusiasm, but willingness to sacrifice anything for it. Her journey from nothing to the edge of something new to define her life is the film that briefs for just short of 90 minutes.\r\n\r\nThis is not another 'Billy Elliot'. Animations are usually comedy, fantasy and musical, but recently the adventures and science fictions are surging. I don't remember I ever have seen an animated dance flick. Not the classical dance, not in the modern 3D animation format. The closest one was a decade old 'Happy Feet'. So that makes it is a unique product and comes under a must see for all the animation fans. But the storyline is predictable and many sequences were intentionally dragged to be clich\u00e9. Because it works, particularly if they're aiming for the younger generation who haven't seen many films in their lives. Only we the grownups whine.\r\n\r\nMost of the voice-over artists are well known Americans actors which boosted the film. The character combinations are good. It brought the variety, especially slightly to ride off the main theme in a few occasions. Like the boy's interest in inventing things which were other major parts of the twist and turns in the narration. It is not a great animation if it was from Hollywood, but coming from France and the theme it focused on, the effort must be appreciated. Overall a much better film than what the average reviews and ratings around the internet says.

The park is literally magical as night falls, when the heroine starts with disarming ingenuity in a mad attempt to reconfigure the past.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**An American girl in the Amazon Jungle.**\r\n\r\nThis is the tenth film in the 'American Girl' franchise. And this time the theme is a rescue mission. Like I mentioned in the 'Grace Stirs Up Success' (the previous film), I haven't seen all film in the series. This is for children, particularly the preteen girls. So for the grown ups it is like a joke, especially if you are a man. But basically I watch anything, there's no restriction to that, because I want to be an all-rounder. Despite I'm not the target audience, I think it is just an okay film, I mean an average. Though the response from the kids would differ, so watch for them, with them, if you have got one in your family.\r\n\r\nWell, the 'American Girl' films never followed the order or the cast had ever returned. It is so random from the story to the characters and the timeline. So this tale is about another American girl called Lea Clark, who loves adventures and the wild animals, but it is a far more dream than reality to her. But when her family receives a message that her brother gone missing in Brasil, she packs her bag along with her mother and lands in Manaus. While her mother making an effort to bring him back, Lea makes her own attempt and while doing that, she gets lost in the Amazon forest. From there how she makes back and what about her brother, all comes solving in the final quarter of the film.\r\n\r\n> \"What one finds is not stolen. Whoever lost was careless.\"\r\n\r\nThe little girl Maggie Elizabeth Jones from 'We Bought a Zoo' all grown-up to a teenager. Looks like another young artist who might make big in the filmdom in the near future. Because many who played in this series are now the well known names. Maggie's role was decent, but the issue was the story's silly and predictable. Anyway, that's how a children's film looks like, without the adult contents and explosions. So if you want to watch this, you must compromise on those stuffs, otherwise don't go for it.\r\n\r\nAs I have heard, the story takes place in the Amazon forest, but the filming was done in the African rainforest. But I guess some of them were the settings. Overall, the locations are very beautiful and they make good use of it tell the story. Since it takes place in Brasil, some of the lines are in Portuguese. This is suppose to be a comedy, but the theme was very serious, still somewhat it manages to produce a few jokes now and them. A good mix of everything, like a whole family can sit and watch together.\r\n\r\nNot all the films in this series were the theatrical product, but this one was with a couple of others. One thing I always fascinated with this franchise is that they all gives a good message to the youngsters. So every time with a different topic and on the bottom line, takes a bit sentimental dip as well. This time it is highlighted the poaching and its related problems. The wildlife and the forest conservation is a good message to teach kids in this global warming era. So I think it would be a good watch for them. It's nearly time for the production house to announce the next film, so I'm looking forward to know what theme they would choose. Meantime, if you think it is not for you, at least show it to your kids.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"581cfa04c3a3685b3a00006b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/581cfa04c3a3685b3a00006b","movie_id":400045}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Recently I have quite liked the Marvel movies that I have watched. Sadly I did not like this movie at all. The only reason that it does not get a zero or one star rating is cool special effects and a few laughs.\r\n\r\nI want my heroes to be just that, heroes. Unfortunately this movie gets off on the wrong foot right away by not only \u201cincriminating\u201d the Avengers in the eyes of dimwit politicians and putting them on surveillance of a political body but to make matters worse it is the useless black hole of taxpayers money, the\u00a0United Nations, that are supposed to surveil them. That pretty much ruined the movie right away for me.\r\n\r\nWhen I though that it could not get any worse it actually does. In true Hollywood fashion the Avengers start to bicker and fight among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe few redeeming qualities\u00a0of this movie\u00a0is great special effects and a few fun comments that made me laugh from time to time. Even the ending is pretty crappy with the Avengers remaining divided and the main bad guy feeling that he achieved what he wanted.\r\n\r\nTechnically there is not really anything wrong with the movie. The actors are good, the filming is good and, as I wrote, the special effects are great. The story however is not my cup of tea to put it mildly.

{"author":"tmdb44006625","content":"The Captain America movies have managed to ground the MCU by exploring the political and social climate created by the Avengers' existence. Actions have consequences and consequences influence more action.\r\n\r\nCivil War isn't as focused as The Winter Soldier. It's also overstuffed with characters and fan service. However, the movie works by always being intriguing. Both sides of the conflict are portrayed as equally valid. The exploration of superhero accountability isn't anything new (explored in Watchmen and The Dark Knight), but it's nice to see it incorporated into a grand cinematic universe. Also, Captain Zemo is a better than average villain because while underdeveloped, his motive is interesting and not just \"destroy the world.\"\r\n\r\nAlso, SPIDER-MAN IS FINALLY IN THE MCU!!!! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01","id":"5c842610c3a3684e95db3de3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c842610c3a3684e95db3de3","movie_id":271110}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Ouch! Ouch!\r\n\r\nMy my, the most horrifying thing about this Cabin Fever remake is the vitriolic scorn poured on it by the horror hordes! It is in no way a great film, or even a particularly good one either, but to me it's no worse than a whole ream of other gore based horrors I have been bored by since the new millennium dawned.\r\n\r\nIn my defence, I wasn't over enamoured with the original in the first place, so it was no big stretch for me to give this one a shot. It also obviously helped me that I haven't seen that original since the year it was released, so hazy memory and all that. What I got here was a pic full of blood and grue, sex and stereotypes, and poor acting. That is often the norm in the gore slasher genre of things...\r\n\r\nOn the plus side is the superb cinematography by Gavin Kelly and a truly head rattling musical score by Kevin Riepl, the latter of which even does a cheeky steal from Symphonie Fantastique (Hector Berlioz). And there's the gorgeous and sexy Louise Linton playing a fantasy driven Deputy! Hoo-Hah! But I digress.\r\n\r\nI'd never watch it again, I wouldn't dream of recommending it to serious horror buffs, and although there's a very good emotional pull late in the day, it's pretty much an empty shell.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A boy from the east, a girl from the west and their life choice over romance.**\r\n\r\nIf you are a film fanatic or a film critic, then the year never comes to end without watching a film by Woody Allen. He's just a Takashi Miike of the Hollywood, but the thing is he always delivers. He had created his own style of screen presentation like in the line of Wes Anderson and very few others. Uniqueness define his works and so this another romance twisted tale where the first half of the film sets in Los Angeles and the next half in the New York.\r\n\r\nA young Jewish American wants to try his luck in the Hollywood seeks help from his uncle who's a popular an busiest agent in the film industry. He falls in love with his uncle's personal assistant, but she reveals she already has a boyfriend who's away now. After some twists in the tale, it becomes a romance-triangle. Who gets who and how it all ends brings the curtain to the film.\r\n\r\nLike usual Woody Allen's background narration had an important role in the storytelling and all those romance troubles were quite nicely told. It opened so well, developed at its best in the middle, but it did not end on a high. I did not like the conclusion, or the last 10-15 minutes. But thankfully it avoided giving out the usual stuff and the end credits rolled up before clearing the situation in the story. That's one of the way to finish it off, which is obviously not clever like lots of films does that same trick. Whatever, still the film is worth a watch, because of the decent story and great performances, and obviously for Woody Allen.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"57f412fc9251417fd70019a1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57f412fc9251417fd70019a1","movie_id":339397}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Surviving isn't just a good education, but needs the physical training.**\r\n\r\nThis is from a supporting actor turned a director who is just one film old before this. So he wrote and directed this beautiful film. One of the best films of the years that should be in must see list. It was just like the film 'Alabama Moon', only the initial plot that extended for over the hundred minutes. The first thing is the cast, it was the best combination. Lots of future stars are here. It was more like a road movie, except in the opening few minutes.\r\n\r\nI did not like the entire film, I found a couple of things uncomfortable. Like the killing a deer in the opening scene and the end part. The conclusion was good, I thought it was the best solution for such a story, not for the theme. But then the final shot gave me an impression that they had got compromised. After all these years hard work, I felt they had given up. That did not stop me from enjoying it and recommending it to the others. Still, it is a very unique film that tried its best to avoid the usual clich\u00e9.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a father of six kids, raising them by his own outside the society in the wilderness. But the children are not left behind on the knowledge of the world, especially the philosophies theirs favourite topic. They are bright, as well as tough and can survive in any condition. One day when they get a message that their mother died, the journey begins to attend the funeral and during their way all the adventures are what we're going to witness.\r\n\r\nDue to the copyright issue the birthday song was altered. Surprisingly, the film was not based on any book. So my utmost appreciation goes to the creator of this wonderful product. Surely it will be a cult classic. It has lots of great dialogue, and bold revelations in a simple way about the facts of the world. Especially like related to the sex and other grown up stuffs clarifying the little kids' doubts.\r\n\r\nAt some point I thought it was okay for the kids to watch with their parents, but it did not get better on that perspective. I mean having lots of main characters as children, the film is not good for their watch. Though the adults should not miss it, even though you are a religious person or any other kind. So highly recommended by me.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"5835dbfcc3a36829d901c7a5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5835dbfcc3a36829d901c7a5","movie_id":334533}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Well another super-sized Marvel Comics superhero saga hits the big screen with the selected savior Captain America taking the top billing on the marquee. Thus, the pulsating popcorn pleaser **Captain America: Civil War** arrives on the scene to giddy audiences that have been loyal and fixated on the successful spring of mighty Marvel heroes that have been paraded to viewers throughout the last few years. Thankfully, **Captain America: Civil War** carries on the tradition of spry superhero-studded spectacles that have been glorious and adventurous from the stable of Marvel-based movies guaranteed to win over the enthusiastic hearts of avid comic book fanboys everywhere. Joyously overstuffed and convincingly extensive with a super team armed with crime-fighting excess, **Civil War** seizes the moment to introduce a noteworthy twist: two factions of rescuing superpowers engaging in some explosive in-house fighting led by two of Marvel Comics main standouts in Chris Evans\u2019s Captain America and Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s Iron Man.\r\n\r\nCo-directors Anthony Russo and Rene Russo were instinctively crafty to link the overly successful Iron Man film franchise to the **Captain America: Civil War** inner circle to ensure an even more treasured toxic atmosphere. Superhero fans will get a thrill of witnessing the extra add-ons concerning other dynamic titans to join the action-packed festivities involving Team Captain America versus Team Iron Man. True, **Civil War** has its share of flaws but that does not take away from this heroes-in-crisis flick demonstrating its ambitious overtones.\r\n\r\nSo what has caused the bad blood among the great and grand good guys known for protecting the world from evil dominance and destruction? Essentially the theme of collateral damage, the involvement regarding civilian-related deaths and injuries plus the world-wide backlash has created a controversy pitted against The Avengers. Specifically, Captain America (a.k.a. Steve Rogers) and Scarlet Witch\/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen)  are responsible for the boisterous battle that caused such negative sensation resulting in political turmoil. Avengers head honcho Iron Man (a.k.a. Tony Stark) is dealing with his own personal regrets in the ill-advised creation of the unpredictable Ultron. The political authority want to hold Iron Man, second-in-command Captain America and the rest of the Avengers accountable for the global devastation that have taking its toll when trying to oversee the potential harm wreaking havoc on humanity.\r\n\r\nLeading the charge in putting a watchful eye on the labeled reckless Avengers is Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) that suggests the super group be monitored by the United Nations. Naturally friction develops between the superheroes that either agree with Ross\u2019s UN restriction policies or disagree with being placed under a microscope that threatens to handcuff their free-wheeling heroic duties. All these contrasting beliefs eventually turn into epic back-and-forth confrontations where the raging Avengers are at odds with each other.\r\n\r\nFor Stark\/Iron Man\u2019s stance, he is willing to toe the line and ultimately agree that his crew needs to tone down their tenacious tactics as crime-stoppers. Iron Man\u2019s consciousness, particularly in the case of a disillusioned mother (Alfre Woodward) making him feel guilt-ridden over her son\u2019s death during an intense Battle of Sokovia, is probably the main factor behind his decision to have his team reigned in a bit from the political watchdogs. Siding with Iron Man\u2019s viewpoint are the likes of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). As for Rogers\/Captain America, he is not too thrilled being put in check by the intrusive governmental pencil-pushers that want to scrutinize the team\u2019s every move. Standing with Captain America firmly are Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and the aforementioned Scarlet Witch.\r\n\r\nOn top of Captain America\u2019s current Avengers-oriented strife in his contentious mingling with Iron Man and his ardent backers, he now finds himself trying to defend his old buddy-turned-wanted man Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) who is accused of killing civilians. Iron Man believes in Winter Soldier\u2019s innocence and goes so far as to help him escape. Yes\u2026Winter Soldier does come with more baggage attached to him\u2013mainly in the form of the menacing Zemo (Daniel Bruhl).\r\n\r\nThe Russos and screenwriters Christopher Marckus and Stephen McFeely (all attached to the previous \u201cCaptain America: Winter Soldier\u201d) provide the eyeful visual effects that predictably stimulate and effectively add to the overload of frenzied frolicking in this boisterous blockbuster. Certainly the deepened angst among this bombastic bunch works far more solidly than what was displayed in the stiffened and problematic Batman v. Superman. The notion that the entire globe and its leaders are weary of all the collective chaos at the hands of the Avengers trying to save their hides is a bit ridiculous. Besides, why are not the foes of the Avengers put on the hot coals for the societal ruination? It seems rather counterproductive to chastise the noble superpowers offering the safety of mankind yet the detractors not being grateful for the services that the Avengers bring to the table. It is somewhat convoluted to think that the global community are sour on our heralded heroes or that the heat generated within the walls will completely destroy the Avengers and their colorful, capable colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s aptly entitled **Civil War** does invite more punch to the proceedings especially when a who\u2019s who of superhero showstoppers join the feisty fray at hand. The noted inclusion of defiant do-gooders are packed with the likes of Spider-Man (Tom Holland), the retired returnee Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and nifty newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). No doubt Captain America: Civil War is the impish and energizing launch pad for upcoming Marvel-induced movies waiting to make their future distinctive arrival on the big screen. Although Evans\u2019s steady and charismatic Captain America more than holds his own as the solo act billed in the film\u2019s title one cannot overlook Downey\u2019s compelling Iron Man as the reliable source that lifts the profile of Evans\u2019s Masked Wonder. This is indeed a collaborative big score for the glorified costumed cast but special kudos are reserved for Stan\u2019s killing culprit as well as Boseman\u2019s African president assuming the slick and resourceful Black Panther.\r\n\r\nYeah, **Captain America: Civil War** is true to its frenetic form as revved up entertainment preparing moviegoers for the upcoming summertime sizzle at the box office. After all, the on-screen Marvel Comics gravy train keeps moving merrily along so stay tuned.\r\n\r\n**Captain America: Civil War (2016)**\r\n\r\nWalt Disney Pictures\r\n\r\n2 hrs 26 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Chris Evans, Robert Downey, Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Daniel Bruhl, Alfre Woodward, William Hurt\r\n\r\nDirected by: Anthony Russo and Joe Russo\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Superheroes Saga\/Action and Adventure\/Science Fiction\/Fantasy\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s Rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n**(c) Frank Ochieng**","id":"572d7bc1c3a3680fdb001d69","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/572d7bc1c3a3680fdb001d69","movie_id":271110}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The diary that found a homeless man.**\r\n\r\nIt's not what the title says. I mean it's not a sports film, but it has a little influence of that. Instead the title should have been related to the word 'diary'. Because that plays a main part in this narration. This is the story of a homeless man who one day finds a diary in the trash. The diary of a young girl who had lost her mother and living with her abusing uncle. So on, it reveals her unpleasant life, but he finds some similarities with her. So he writes the replies, but since he doesn't who she is and where she lives, it goes straight into the thin air as a paper plane. On the other side, he often makes money on the street fighting that one day does not go well. So after that where he ends is what brings the end to the tale.\r\n\r\nA much appreciable small budget film. Feels like a sentimental theme, but was not exploited so well. I have seen Thomas Haden Church in many flicks, but never in a lead role like in this one. He was the whole film, a couple of other characters come into the frame very often. So he was good, but expected a lot more than that. The blame goes to the screenplay, but also I liked the simple drama. Simple is quite enjoyable than too much of twist and turns and developments. So if you are the guy who takes chances in B movies, this is the one. Not the best film, though a heartwarming conclusion favours it. I know that part was a bit offbeat, but acceptable. So I say go for it.\r\n\r\n_6.5\/10_","id":"5851a5d79251416f6301b35c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5851a5d79251416f6301b35c","movie_id":413452}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Life happens and we just've to flow with it, making better choices!**\r\n\r\nA better film than I thought. What I thought was seeing how it was received. It was based on the book of the same name, directed by a newcomer. A coming-of-age film, about a 19 year old smart girl, but struggling in the real world since finished her education. Particularly, she's having a trouble with her father in communicating. Not that she's incapable of blend in with the rest of the world, but she's preoccupied with what she's interested in. Now her therapist hints to make a list to accomplish things than the dull life according to him she's presently living on. During her attempt, what are all things she go through was told in the remaining narration.\r\n\r\nBel Powley was brilliant in the title role. It was more like a sequel to her previous film 'The Diary of a Teenage Girl'. Like it was the next stage of her story. Between adulthood and teenhood, at the edge of teenage. Apart from her, the rest of the cast was decent. I usually like this kind of films, but they are all same. Developed from the basic storyline that we are very familiar with. In that perspective, this is not an impressive film, especially if you have seen plenty. Even though not bad for watching it once. Since the characters, cast and settings differ, besides the presentation was good, it surely a nice film to watch alone in a lazy weekend. Probably under- appreciated, but definitely an under- noticed film of the year.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59976b14c3a3685816000afa","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59976b14c3a3685816000afa","movie_id":317560}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The heroes're divided and so the fans!**\r\n\r\nBefore watching this I thought what the Avengers are doing here. I believed they got the title wrong. Once I watched it, I'm still the same. Because it did not look like the Captain America's film, he never was dominated, so calling it as his film totally inappropriate. Technically, it is a third Avengers film and well done. I liked it, it was entertaining. But the Civil War means it's nothing a nation's war within, just these super-guys fight for themselves against what kind of administration they want to come under.\r\n\r\nI think they have heard that people's complaint about blowing up the buildings during reviewing other films by bringing up this one. So they finger pointed those events in this narration and that is one of the reasons for the Civil War to take place. Particularly disturbing the public and loss of many lives when these powerful men fighting the bad guys. The fun part is they are off the street and had a most important confrontation of the film in a deserted airfield. So does it make people who were whining about that be happy?\r\n\r\nI don't know, but as an entertaining film, it did everything it can give the best for the viewers. Like the title and posters reveal, the heroes are divided here and probably you're going to take a side. Like usual, I'm with the Stark. So if you're like me, then you would feel the annoyance with the opposite team, particularly like Antman and obviously Captain America's rebellious decision. It was like the world versus United States, because only Americans are behind Captain America. Anyway, I did not like dividing the fans and what this film has been a serious damage. I hope the fans won't take it seriously.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"57f40f319251417fe300171a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57f40f319251417fe300171a","movie_id":271110}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"<b>A long form review originally posted in 2016<\/b>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s commonplace for me to need more than one viewing to really nail down my feelings on a movie, that\u2019s particularly true of MCU, and even more so of this particular film. That all said, here is my initial reaction to _Captain America: Civil War_.\r\n\r\nAs is often the case, it\u2019s hard to write down too comprehensive a post about a film this early on while remaining totally spoiler-free, so for starters, I\u2019ll just go ahead and ask the thing that was on my mind from about five minutes in to _Civil War_: I want to know how it is that two guys who have a filmography so firmly rooted in sitcoms of all things, manage to direct action this spectacularly? Honestly. It\u2019s insane.\r\n\r\n_Winter Soldier_ is one of the strongest MCU films in my opinion, and just like that felt mostly like a follow up to both the prior _Captain America_ film and the prior _Avengers_ film, _Civil War_ feels the same, but for the sequels to said films (_Winter Soldier_ and _Age of Ultron_). That said, it might lean a little too far on to the side of _Avengers_-sequel, and a little too light on the _Cap_-sequel. If you had to pick a lead here, it would be Steve Rogers, no mistake, but this does feel like a film painted with a very broad brush of characterisation to be solely a \u201c_Captain America_\u201d movie.\r\n\r\nConsidering the sheer scope of the piece, it\u2019s amazing that the Russo brothers managed to get the ball rolling on _Civil War_ as well as they did. Even so, there are a couple of roles I felt could have been cut altogether without really impacting the story, and that time could perhaps have been used to serve some underrepresented puzzle pieces. Perhaps both the inclusion in places and lack of inclusion in others is because of plans for future MCU films (though certainly not all instances can use that excuse) but either way, if I\u2019m hunting for flaws, that to some degree is one.\r\n\r\nI will say, that for all of _Civil War\u2019s_ ups and downs (mostly ups), it is both a worthy entrant into Marvel\u2019s franchise, and perhaps even more importantly, it actually even addresses some of the problems left in _Age of Ultron_. Of course the acting is all above board, the primary action set-piece is just dumbfoundingly fun, and the evolution of the mythology meshes with the universe at large.\r\n\r\n_Civil War_ may not be my favourite superhero movie, or even my favourite MCU movie (I mean it also might be, I think I need to give it at least another two watches to be sure) but it might just be the best comic book adaptation movie. By that, I don\u2019t mean it accurately portrayed the events of the Marvel \u201cCivil War\u201d event from back 2006, because that\u2019s not even close to true. What I mean is, there are so many instances that manage capture the spirit of what the comics are. And you almost feel like you are watching one unfold before you on the screen. A glorious, squillion dollar, two and a half hour comic book.\r\n\r\nOh yeah. And the new superheroes introduced in _Civil War_? They\u2019ve got me pretty bloody excited.\r\n\r\n79%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_","id":"5b167ad80e0a262dd60153f2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b167ad80e0a262dd60153f2","movie_id":271110}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> I would like to try the director's cut; this one is a post-production disaster.\r\n\r\nIf you say it is the worst film of the year, I won't deny that. There are more substandard films than this, but having a big name like Keanu Reeves, it is a great disappointment. It was written and directed by an inexperienced filmmaker. That was a big challenge the production house has taken, and in the end it's a failed attempt. But that was not the actual reason for the disaster.\r\n\r\nMaybe the director's cut would have been better than this version. Because the actual film was a bilingual drama that reminds us classic cult films. But the production house decided to turn it into a money generating product. Due to that plan-B it went through the lots of cuts to turn it into a single story. In the end the 'lost in translation' happened. So that's answers why it was credited under a false director's name.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to give an opinion on the story, because it's a confusing narration due to imbalance in the genres which is originally meant for two different stories. The twist was taken straight out of another film, so that makes the conclusion was very silly. First of all, Keanu Reeves' character was next to nothing. I don't understand how he ended up in this project. If his side story was chopped off, it would have made a decent short film and vice versa. I am sure, 8 out of 10 would feel a letdown and the remaining 2 might like it or maybe fall into a confused state.\r\n\r\n3\u00bd\/10","id":"57375490c3a3687e2f0043c4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57375490c3a3687e2f0043c4","movie_id":331962}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"How can someone who displayed so much filmmaking flair in his debut come up with such a lacklustre sophomore effort? That's the question that crops up after watching Jackson Durai, which is directed by Dharanidharan, who gave us the stylish crime thriller Burma. The film is a horror comedy, a genre that is very much the trend today, and going by the director's previous film, you expect at least a competently made film that keeps us entertained. But the only thing that we have in store is disappointment.\r\n\r\nThe plot is set in Ayanpuram, a village that is bothered by ghosts that put in an appearance every night once the clock strikes nine. So, the police send Sathya (Sibi), an empty vessel of a cop, to investigate these claims. He, in true Tamil cinema tradition, falls in love with Viji (Bindu Madhavi), a girl in the village the moment he steps foot in the place. Even as he begins his so-called investigation, he realises there is another challenger to Viji's hand \u2014 her relative Veera (Karunakaran). So, the girl's father provides them with a challenge \u2014 whoever manages to stay alive in the haunted bungalow in the village for seven days will be the chosen one.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the writing seems slapdash with scenes that are either cliched or too convenient. The best example of this is the flashback portion that shows us how the ghosts came to be, and what they are after. It involves the independence struggle and a personal conflict between the local British head (Zachary) and a revolutionary (Sathyaraj). There is tragedy but it doesn't feel tragic enough; there are patriotic lines but they aren't rousing enough; there is a villain but he isn't fearsome enough; there is also Sathyaraj, and he isn't entertaining enough. It's no wonder the film goes downhill after this segment. Even a Groundhog Day-ish situation that comes next is dealt with in an unimaginative manner. In fact, at least until then, we are kept amused thanks to the comedy elements. Karunakaran, especially, is very funny in these portions, and keeps the scenes engaging, with Yogi Babu chipping in now and then. But these handful of laughs cannot compensate for the overall tediousness.","id":"57ba6a2cc3a36845ee005495","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ba6a2cc3a36845ee005495","movie_id":371815}
{"author":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","content":"A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com\r\n\r\n**LOUISA SAYS:**\r\n\r\n\u201cJason Bourne\u201d is a spy movie for imbeciles. The entire film feels like it\u2019s written using nothing more than the vocabulary of a 12 year old and consists of two very tiring hours of repetition. Bourne gets chased, throws some punches, and gets away. Shoot, bleed, run, escape. Shoot, bleed, run, escape. Shoot, bleed, run, escape. Repeat to infinity.\r\n\r\nI actually felt bad for the actors having to deliver such dreadful dialogue; their onscreen characters literally describe everything that\u2019s happening as it unfolds (\u201cIt\u2019s Bourne!\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m going to shoot!\u201d and \u201cHe\u2019s running upstairs!\u201d and \u201cThe files are downloaded!\u201d). At some point it started to get funny.\r\n\r\nMatt Damon is back as Jason Bourne and it feels like he\u2019s sleepwalking through the entire movie. Even the talented Alicia Vikander phones in her questionable performance (is she supposed to have an accent or not?) and Tommy Lee Jones plays yet another scowling caricature of a sinister government official. There\u2019s little in the way of character development and the only actor who\u2019s enjoyable here is franchise veteran Julia Stiles. What a pity that she\u2019s not given much to do.\r\n\r\nEven the action sequences are inexcusably incoherent. Paul Greengrass is one of my least favorite directors, mainly because he loves that fast cutting junk where I can\u2019t tell what is going on in the movie. It\u2019s a filmmaking style for those with short attention spans and it\u2019s a sign of extreme laziness.\r\n\r\nGreengrass sucks all the fun out of what should\u2019ve been a spectacular car chase down the Las Vegas strip. Instead of taking his time and showing off the pageantry of stunt driving with a steady hand (see the legendary cinematic car chases in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cDeath Proof,\u201d William Friedkin\u2019s \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d Peter Yates\u2019 \u201cBullit,\u201d Justin Lin\u2019s \u201cFast Five,\u201d or hell, even Michael Bay\u2019s \u201cBad Boys II\u201c), Greengrass once again opts for the lazy way out and gives us a messy commotion of three second snippets that seem to be edited together in a blender on the high setting.\r\n\r\nNone of the elements work: the film covers no new ground, it lacks any energy, and it simply feels tired, making \u201cJason Bourne\u201d the lamest of all in the series.\r\n\r\n**MATT SAYS:**\r\n\r\n\u201cConversation\u201d with 5-word sentences using spy and techno-jargon. Quick cut to person typing on computer: Beep, boop, beep. Quick cut to shaky cam conversation. Another five-word-sentence conversation and more shaky cam. Cut to shaky-cam motorcycle chase with no sense of geography. Cut back to computer.\r\n\r\nCut, cut, cut. Shaky cam, shaky cam, shaky cam. \u201cJason Bourne\u201d might as well have been shot and assembled by a seven-year-old with ADD that hasn\u2019t taken his Ritalin. It wasn\u2019t so much edited as jammed together. So little artistry went into making this movie that it\u2019s hard to even call Paul Greengrass its \u201cdirector.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne of my recurring rants is on the use of quick cutting and shaky cams in action films: it\u2019s the hallmark of lazy filmmaking. When your action sequences are constructed by using cut after cut after cut, you don\u2019t have to worry about storyboarding (contrast \u201cThe Raid: Redemption\u201c). You don\u2019t need actors who have any training in fight choreography (contrast \u201cThe Raid 2\u201c). You don\u2019t have to concern yourself with geography or spatial relationships. In other words, instead of having to WORK at creating a compelling action sequence, you can hack your way through it. And boy, there is NO ONE working in film now that loves hack action better than Paul Greengrass. And nowhere has Greengrass\u2019s hackiness been on display more than in \u201cJason Bourne.\u201d It\u2019s his masterpiece of hacketry. I can continue making up new word forms using \u201chack\u201d to describe this movie and director, but I think you get the idea.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the bad direction and editing, \u201cJason Bourne\u201d stinks because it\u2019s a poor excuse for a spy thriller. We are subjected to scene after scene of dreadful acting. Julia Stiles (Nicky Parsons) is the worst of the lot, but Matt Damon (Jason Bourne), Alicia Vikander (Heather Lee) and Tommy Lee Jones (Director Dewey) are only marginally better. The script is abysmal, with the characters not so much dialoguing with one another as speaking spy techno-jargon while they type on computers that are constantly beep-bloop-bleeping (no computer I\u2019ve ever used makes so many noises when scanning files). Using words that sound cool does not make a scene interesting. And the plot? It\u2019s barely even there.\r\n\r\nI found only three things enjoyable about this movie. The very first fight scene between Bourne and some nameless guy \u2014 the one you see in the trailer. The story thread featuring the Silicon Valley billionaire that refused to screw over the public in the name of national security. And the final vehicular chase scene down Las Vegas Boulevard \u2014 which I liked in spite of the terrible editing (which, incidentally, got the geography of the Strip all wrong).\r\n\r\nPlease don\u2019t make this movie a hit, because then we will get lots of imitators (like we did after \u201cThe Bourne Supremacy\u201d and \u201cThe Bourne Ultimatum\u201c, when quick cuts and shaky cam were used in 95% of all action pictures).\r\n\r\nDemand more for your money. There are so many movies that do it better than this one. Do you want an engaging, twisty techno-spy thriller? Check out the \u201cMission Impossible\u201d series. Do you want a well-written story of international espionage and intrigue? See \u201cOur Kind of Traitor.\u201d Do you want well-choreographed fight sequences? Watch \u201cThe Raid\u201d movies. Hell, even this summer\u2019s \u201cWarcraft\u201d did a better job with its fights and action that this film.\r\n\r\n**A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com**","id":"579cf601925141066e000c65","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/579cf601925141066e000c65","movie_id":324668}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The four day episodes after the tragic event!**\r\n\r\nAn unusual biographical film. I have seen films about JFK, either based on the real or just fiction, but this one was entirely focused on his wife. It sets in just weeks after his assassination and soon goes back to that day and the following to tell us how Jacie Kennedy handled the bad time. From tragic event to conducting the final rites, that four days she has to fight for the right decisions. All these revealed by her to a reporter in one of the following week. Remember this film was originally meant for an HBO mini-series and then they turned it into a feature film. That was the risk taken by the filmmakers, later it paid off well.\r\n\r\nI never knew who was Jackie, so when I saw Portman's performance in the opening stage, I thought she was overdoing it, the accent and imitation. But after some progress in the story, I got used to it thinking that's how it would be. Yeah, she was excellent and she deserved that Oscars nomination. I wondered what was the source, but after the research I came to know that it was based on the magazine interview by the same reporter you would see in the film. The Chilean director's Hollywood debute. He has done a good job. Also one of the final films of John Hurt in which he was in a small role. Worth a watch for it is being unique and especially revealing some unknown truth behind and\/or after death of JFK.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"594308e99251417f9b0125b7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/594308e99251417f9b0125b7","movie_id":376866}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**...but he did go back and got into a trouble!**\r\n\r\nThe original source is a long book series, so they did not do it in order. Like the first film, which was based on the ninth book, this one was on the eighteenth. It was a stylishly made film. The actors were good, and their stunts were excellent. But not the storyline. This is a very familiar theme. You know, someone framed you and you go on to dig the truth while everyone trying to hunt you down. There are lots of close encounter, which give great thrilling entertainment. So, other than the story, everything looked fine.\r\n\r\nJack goes to meet one of his ex colleagues at his old headquarters. But soon he discovers she's behind the bars and now he's too for the crime they did not do. So escaping from the prison and looking for clues, who framed them and why, all one by one disclosed with some excellent running-chasing action sequences. The film almost as good as any timepass action film. But like it was the new wine in an old bottle. So it won't work for everyone, especially those with greater expectations.\r\n\r\nThe 55 year old Tom Cruise on the edge to become a veteran actor, but still he got that action hero macho in him. Probably another 3-4 films, including the upcoming 'Mission: Impossible' sequel. So this franchise could replace his cast with younger one in the future. Because another 20 books to go. Though, I'm thinking about the television series. Cobie too was awesome. The film justifies to its original, but not more than an above average.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**New officials, new operations at agency, but the same old Bourne!**\r\n\r\nI thought the original films are meant to be a trilogy, but when filmmakers saw money, they went ahead with the fourth in a new direction. So now with this, it has returned to the original storyline. The Jason Bourne, whose quest to find the answers was over. Yet, a new chapter begins with this like another trilogy is on making like the 'Star Wars' with a new storyline and adventures.\r\n\r\nStill the theme remains the same, like running and chasing. So the story was just a one or two liner. But if you like the action sequences, this has got plenty of them to entertain you. That's should be a main reason, if you want to see it, other than that the film was average kind. Matt Damon's return for the title role was the best thing happened in here with the director of 'Supremecy' and 'Ultimatum'.\r\n\r\nI think Alicia Vikander's role is yet to exploit and that would be in the next two films. Looks like an interesting combo between her and Matt, so waiting for the official news. The same formula for this is what disappointing, though not a bad flick. After all, that's how we know Bourne series. So go for it if you are up to date with this franchise, because there's going to be at least another two films if my guess is right.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"584469a4925141676400c7b0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/584469a4925141676400c7b0","movie_id":324668}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Independence Day: Resurgence is pretty much what I expected. Actually, given all the negative reviews floating around, it is almost better than what I expected. As is almost always the case, all the 1 and 2 star ratings and \u201cworst movie ever\u201d reviews are pure bullshit. The biggest advantage the original movie had was the novelty of it all. This movie is really pretty much the same except for the special effects being even bigger to the extent that they are somewhat over the top at times and the plot somewhat thinner. Having said the latter, the original movie did not really have much in terms of plot either and the nonsense of giving a totally alien computer a virus was so bad it really dragged down the movie.\r\n\r\nIn the relatively short timespan of two decades humanity have improved their technology base by several orders of magnitude (ray guns on the moon etc. etc\u2026). The speed of improvement is of course pretty unrealistic, even with access to alien technology, but hey, I can live with that in order to increase the coolness factor of the movie.\r\n\r\nThen comes an alien ship. Not the aliens we all expected by another one. The ship is totally different from the previous ones, do not seem aggressive but of course dumbass politicians manage to screw everything up. Fast forward a couple of scenes and the \u201creal\u201d aliens arrive. Of course this time they have a bigger flyswatter and they perfunctorily proceed to swat away the puny, extremely slow firing, little ray guns of the humans and we are back to where we started in the original movie. Huge space ship parks on Earth, time for plan B.\r\n\r\nWell there were quite a few scenes of big space ships, destruction and mayhem before the aliens finally manage to park their spaceship. I guess finding a parking space for a 5 000 kilometer space ship can be a bit tricky (I though I had an issue with my Jeep). Here is were I have quite some gripes about the movie. The special effects are cool, no question about it, but they are also exaggerated and throws any attempt to be remotely adhering to the laws of physics out the window. It is clear that whatever low intelligence storywriter that wrote that garbage flunked science classes in school, if he ever got that far of course. For instance, we have a 5 000 kilometer (the Earth radius is about 6 370 kilometer) that is big enough to generate its own gravity (apparently the engines somehow contributed to this) flies in and lands on earth. When it approaches items on the surface, cars, trains, ships, skyscrapers and bits and pieces of the Earth itself starts to fly upwards. It makes for cool effects but anyone with a mediocrum of intelligence ought to realize that such a force would actually destabilize Earth itself. Possibly change the speed of rotation as well as the orbit around the sun.\r\n\r\nThe story is full of other typical Hollywood stupidities and plot holes. Christ even my kids could spot the plot holes which were often big enough to drive a battleship through!\r\n\r\nAs for the acting. Well, I would say there is not too much to say about it. Most of the main actors managed to make it through the movie without screwing up too badly. Given that it was not the deepest or thought provoking movie one could imagine I would say that was good enough. The best character in my opinion was Judd Hirsch as Julius Levinson. The worst one was probably Dr. Okun. Not that Brent Spiner was making a bad job of representing him but the character was just to crazed out for my taste.\r\n\r\nOkay, I will stop whining now. This movie was pretty much exactly what I expected. Great special effects tied together with a paper thin story. I went into it hoping that the effects were going to be good with little expectations on the rest and that is exactly what I got. The movie fulfilled my expectations completely and thus I consider it worth 7 out of 10 stars. I enjoyed the two hours watching it.","id":"58c7e513c3a3683df300d9fd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c7e513c3a3683df300d9fd","movie_id":47933}

I don't know what's the reason, but surprisingly it was a much better film than I expected. It had a decent cast, particularly for a small budget horror, it was a well made film. Even the screen-writing was good. They should have improved it a bit, but still not a bad film with all the fine performances.\r\n\r\nThis is about a man who can enter the minds of the possessed ones by the evil spirits. Like most of the horror films, the exorcist has a person feud with one particular spirit. So after searching for it many years, he finds that a boy was possessed by the same spirit. Now it's his time to avenge whatever he had suffered from earlier in his life.\r\n\r\nThe horror film fans and film fanatics might think it is an average, but for the common people it will work fine. There are some good moments in the film. Overall, well designed film in those crucial parts. You are going to see totally a different Aaron Eckhart, especially being in the lead. So I feel it is worth a try.\r\n\r\n_6\u00bd\/10_","id":"591b6263c3a3683fb606aae2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/591b6263c3a3683fb606aae2","movie_id":241258}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Racing to stop men with bad intention!**\r\n\r\nCompared to the first two films, it took a long time for the third film. But I expected 'The Lost Symbol' before this one. I don't know why they skipped that book from adapting which was done in the last minutes by the production house. My guess is it might be a controversial as the first one, or simply not good enough for the cinematic version. Anyway, this film was not as good as previous two. Once again, it was directed by Ron Howard and Tom Hanks returned as professor Robert Langdon. Two hours long, but very fast storytelling, non-stop adventures.\r\n\r\nThis is another tale in the series about fighting against the men who believes in the ancient text that's written about to curb the issue the human would face in the future, which is now. After waking up without any memory, professor Langdon with the help of a young woman escape from an assassin. In result, they look for the reason why and whoever behind it wants them dead. So it's not a good story, but entertaining film. Especially if you like action-adventure- suspense.\r\n\r\nNice cast, including Hanks and Jones. The other supporting cast was not bad either. Like always, it's a European adventure, particularly in Venice and neighbouring countries. Some cool secret places, might be the settings, but awesome. Since this part was not received well, I wonder the next one, 'Origin' would be made or not. Even before that, this time I expect 'The Lost Symbol' first to hit if they want to continue with the film series. This is not a film to recommend, but not bad for watching it once.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"5935cf5ac3a3685bac003063","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5935cf5ac3a3685bac003063","movie_id":207932}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Life is unexplained, but to keep it going depends on the events surround it\/us.**\r\n\r\nThe film certainly defines two things, the life is unpredictable and the college life in the 1950s. Based on the book of the same name, made by a producer turned director which is his first attempt. A pure drama that follows a Jewish American student who is pursuing a degree in a small Ohio college. The film reveals his social skills, confused romance with a troubled girl, having differences with the college dean and many more.\r\n\r\nDefinitely a better film than I anticipating. Initially I did not get some parts of the narration, but there are more details in pieces and we have to put them in the right places. For example the editing was a bit confusing, particularly about present, past and future events. But at the end you will understand everything, I think. The twist was average, though very good, it totally altered the entire perspective. Logan Lerman is getting better and better in his every new film and Sarah Gadon as well getting more sexier every day.\r\n\r\nWhatever it narrates us in the mid part, in the end it sticks to the point on what it opened with. So it is more about life like how a small mistake can change everything forever. But it's also how a big mistake can lead to preserve some sweet memories till life continues in whatever state. A practical subject dealt in a thoughtful way as much as possible. For some people it will be a must see, but surely worth a watch by everyone.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5835e0dfc3a3682fad01a066","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5835e0dfc3a3682fad01a066","movie_id":340611}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The earthlings are united to defend the home from another alien attack.**\r\n\r\nI have said it many times that when I love a film, I always pray for a sequel to come. But I won't do that for all the films like perhaps 'Taken' and this one. These are not designed for that kind of a stretch or to own a franchise. So anyway they have made it and I'd watched. Since I was not expecting it, I did not care about the how it ends. I mean critically failed and the box office was okay, but did not meet the expectations. I mean not found anywhere near to the original film's collection.\r\n\r\nFor me, minus half point for the Chinese flavour. I think the Hollywood must stop leaning towards Chinese contents. It is like they are ignoring the rest of the world. I want the old days American films, not this yuan targeted films. Sorry, that is one of the reasons why I disliked films like this, 'Now You See Me 2' and many other recent sino-Hollywood films.\r\n\r\nThis story takes place 20 years later to the original film. Only a handful of characters returned and many of them were new. So now the humans leaped forward after adapting the alien technology. But when they learn the distress call was sent to the base of the enemy from the 20 years ago event, they are underprepared for another alien attack that follows very soon. Without any option they push their full force to defend the earth and it would they succeed or not is what the remaining film to reveal.\r\n\r\nNowadays the graphics are not an issue. The filmmaking had touched down for a standard in the visual quality, especially a big production like this. So those parts even overplay the performances of the real actors. We have seen that from Gollum, King Kong and many other monster films. So if you are watching a today's high end film means, it is a pleasure from the blow ups we expect the most. Similar to killings from the horror thrillers. This film does that so well, that mean it is entertaining, but not the overall film very praisable.\r\n\r\nThis story can be easily connected to many classics such as 'Star Wars' and 'Avatar'. Because how it ends seems like a story about the origins of those films. So the third film is like definitely takes us deep into the space. Looks very interesting, but does it work is the real question. It is already in the work with the same director. So lets wait and see how it corrects its mistakes. Meantime, you can watch this if you haven't yet, but it is an average film.\r\n\r\n_5.5\/10_","id":"581cf459925141344d00134c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/581cf459925141344d00134c","movie_id":47933}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"The Denton Rapscallion.\r\n\r\nIn a Valley of Violence is written and directed by Ti West. It stars Ethan Hawke, Taissa Farmiga, James Ransome, Karen Gillan and John Travolta. Music is by Jeff Grace and cinematography by Eric Robbins.\r\n\r\nEthan Hawke plays Paul, an ex soldier accompanied only by his dog, Abbie, who is drifting across the desert towards Mexico. Stopping off in the dying town of Denton, Paul finds trouble that will have consequences for himself and town alike.\r\n\r\nTi West is more well known for his horror ventures, where although divisive in that genre sphere, he can be proud of his success rate. Here he tackles the Western, and true to form, he homages past genre masters whilst unmistakably putting his own stamp on things. Opening with credits straight out of Spaghetti Western land, and introducing us to a musical score that will accompany the story that is wonderfully feverish, West is in no hurry for blood and bone shenanigans. He always favours the slow burn and so it proves here.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing remotely new here, it's a standard tale of a gunman - one damaged by his war efforts - who through circumstance is forced to abandon his hope of a quiet life. He's a loner man of few words, thus giving viewers a classic Western character staple, an anti-hero to root for and for us to yearn for him to find peace. When the violence comes, it's sharp and bloody, but often there is humour as well, deftly inserted into proceedings, whilst the canine is skillful and a key character to all and sundry.\r\n\r\nPerfs are more than adequate. Hawke sifts seamlessly into being a believable drifter type of complexity, Ransome is annoyingly brattish, but that's actually job well done, and Travolta - sporting a wooden leg - gets better once (and if) you buy into him in this setting. Gillan isn't given much to do, but lands some decent emotive punches, but it's Farmiga who stands out as Mary-Anne. She's utterly infectious and thankfully she gets a well written part, that of a young woman trying to hold her own in the most trying of township circumstance.\r\n\r\nThe purpose built town of Denton looks just that!, but this is off- set a touch by the nice location landscapes (Santa Fe, New Mexico), and with the story working from solid genre foundations then this is a pleasure - without pulling up any trees - for fans of such. 7\/10","id":"59eb076ec3a3686346009ee0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59eb076ec3a3686346009ee0","movie_id":291356}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**In the old west, it's always about the revenge!**\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, this is the western version of 'John Wick'. Same storyline except it takes place in the desert of the old west. A man who had enough killing native Americans, is now abandoned everything and heading towards Mexico for a fresh start. But on a way in a small town, he gets into a trouble. After surviving the assault, he goes back to hunt them all and like most of the western film, the end is predictable.\r\n\r\nThis is not a bad flick, but it was not fresh enough, either its story or the gun fights. With a bunch of decent actors, a decently made film. The characters were limited, the atmosphere was like deserted. So the overall narration was focused on a few characters in its entire 100 minute run. I felt sorry for Travolta, they did not get anything out of him, he just had a presence and nothing else. In other hand Ethan was okay, but his role was designed as an average man in the old west, not a powerful one as we expect in this type of film.\r\n\r\nThe title says it all, but it was not that ruthless as compared to the most of the similar western films I have seen. Mostly it will bring a disappointment for its viewers, but definitely a few would enjoy it for its simpleness. For me, it was an average, but thought it could have been better, particularly in the gun battle. So it's nothing more than just once watchable with a low expectation.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"587a9981c3a36846c3006201","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/587a9981c3a36846c3006201","movie_id":291356}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Sometimes the crime decides its own fate.**\r\n\r\nI had no thought before the watch, but while watching it, I felt it was overrated. That's for a moment, once I finished watching it, realised it's a better film. I mean I changed my stance, after over and over thinking about the film. So its the patience you need, wait till the film to end to decide how much you liked it. It was too long, but every space was filled up with the best parts. It took time to understand the characters, and with multiple angle events in one woman's life. Isabelle Huppert was amazing. Despite so many characters in the film, she ruled it. One of her best films I have seen.\r\n\r\nThe film focused on the boss of a video game designing firm. It opens with as she's been sexually assaulted in her home by an intruder. Followed by one of her employees morphed her face to an animated character as a sexual explicit material for the game they are working in. So she begins her investigation to find both the culprit who might be the same person. This is where the suspense comes into play to develop interest in us. Besides, facing family troubles takes some extra development. Subsequently, all the mysteries will be solved and to know how it ends, you should watch it.\r\n\r\n> \"Michele to her cat: You did not have to claw his eyes out, but scratch him at least.\"\r\n\r\nIt is official French submission to the 89th American Academy Awards. But as per the latest news bulletin, this film is out of the Oscars race, despite made into the Golden Globes. From the director of the original 'Total Recall' and his first French film. Based on the book named 'Oh...'. But I felt it was developed from a small part of 'The Little Death'. Basically, there's an understanding being it is the story of the adults, despite the sexual violences and that's how this story was built. So you must compromise on a few things that is shown in it if you really want to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nI did not like it all the sudden, though looking back all the film events and joining them together made me see the film was decent. Especially that final line said by a woman who was evacuating her house makes whole thing sense. Maybe that's the real twist in the tale. Initially I did not think to write a review, but surely it deserved one from me, so I wrote this short and quick. This is the film for the grown ups, but not for all the grown ups. So I hope it will meet your expectation if you decide to try, but according to me definitely it is worth.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"585edbb692514115c7013371","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/585edbb692514115c7013371","movie_id":337674}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Oyee begins with an establishing shot of a ladies prison. Enter Swetha (Eesha), who is yearning to breathe free from the nauseating atmosphere there. Though she doesn't seem to be someone who has been in a prison for a while, we are given a hint that she has a purpose to leave the place. Then, lady luck smiles on her, as she has been granted parole and comes out of prison to attend her sister's marriage. What made Swetha, who comes across as the quintessential girl-next-door, to commit a crime? This question is left unanswered till the end, though there is a vague mention in a scene of her having murdered someone unintentionally.\r\n\r\nThe plot kicks in when Swetha meets Krish (Geethan Britto) on a bus. He is on his way to Chennai, to meet his lady love Gayatri (Papri Ghosh). In an unconvincing turn of events, Swetha ends up with Geethan's ancestral necklace, though he remains unaware of this! So, she goes to Krish's village to return the necklace, but his family members mistake her for their soon-to-be daughter-in-law, as they see her wearing the necklace. They are so affectionate towards her and start admiring her beauty and innocence, and do not give her a chance to reveal the truth.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Krish returns home and tries to convince his relatives that they have mistaken a stranger for Gayatri. But Swetha refutes his claims, and succeeds in making the family believe that she is Gayatri! The director reasons this act of Swetha by saying that she did this out of her attachment with the family, as she was a girl who was deprived of a lovable family since childhood.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Krish takes up the challenge of participating in a 'silambu' competition posed by another prominent family in the town for the village festival. Whether he saves his family's esteem in the competition, is left for the audience to watch. The unexpected arrival of Gayatri to his home later, and the much-expected love track between Krisha and Swetha, turns the film into a predictable and slightly tiresome triangular love story.\r\n\r\nActors Sangili Murugan and Arjunan, who essay characters who are part of the family, try hard to evoke laughter in several scenes, but in vain. Nagineedu as the head of the family is apt, while Neelima Rani's character as Eesha's sister makes a blink-and-miss appearance. The effort taken by Geethan in learning the basics of silambam deserves mention.\r\n\r\nThe scenic beauty of the village has been captured well in few scenes by cinematographer Yuga, while fans of maestro Ilaiyaraaja are sure in for a disappointment. The film would have made more sense and could garner a little more attention had the makers produced it with the silambam contest as its core theme.","id":"5738177bc3a3680935000497","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5738177bc3a3680935000497","movie_id":392382}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A man with the two minds!**\r\n\r\nThis is a very familiar theme, but a different format and gives a different scientific excuse to execute the story. It is kind of 'Face\/off' and 'Self\/less' meets the 'Hardcore Henry'. It has some decent stunt sequences, but most of the film was just running and chasing around. And then there's a youngster whose involvement was the centre of the narration.\r\n\r\nIt all begins when an American secret agent was killed before completing his mission in the London. The important data from his brain were transmitted to a prison serving convict and then after the surgery he goes loose. So the man hunt begins against the running out of the time where the original mission needs to be accomplished. How the rest of the story shapes up were a fast paced action-thriller.\r\n\r\nSomething I don't like in the todays films are the open ending keeping in mind a sequel. This was an average box office film, but they might make another film. Wonderful cast, though. There are too many big names and everybody did the brief roles, except Kevin Costner in the main character, a tough one. But I did not know it was his film till I watch. In the poster he looked like somebody else. Though he did well along with the others, particularly Gal Gadot who I saw recently as Wonder Woman and now as an ordinary wife. A swift pace, but the story was nothing, overly depended on the star value as well as the stunts and the technical quality.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I had no idea what this movie was about when I sat down to watch it on Netflix yesterday. I certainly had not watched its predecessor which, as I discovered afterwards, seems to have received quite high ratings.\r\n\r\nTo me this was a fairly decent movie quite adequate for a little Monday evening TV session. I would probably have been a wee bit disappointed if I had spent money and effort to see it in a movie theater though.\r\n\r\nI did like the overall story and the cinematography. It did feel quite a bit like a old western in Asian setting. Make the sword a shipment of gold, the setting in the old west, add the hero and the gang of good guys with pistols instead of swords, do not forget the bad guy with his cronies and you have a good old fashioned Western. That is not really bad thing as far as I am concerned. The Asian setting and the Asian honor culture adds a lot of elegance to the movie.\r\n\r\nThe story is plain and simple with few surprises. As tradition dictates there is plenty of Asian martial arts going on. The fights are a little on the slow side and clearly intended for a rather low content rating. You never see anyone get really hurt. Sure people die but the deaths are quite bloodless. Personally I would have preferred a bit more hard hitting action. The fights almost became a bit comical at times.\r\n\r\nI would say that the characters are okay. Not the best actors I have seen but I found them to be adequate. I did like the good guys. The bad guy could have done with a bit more charisma and the witch or whatever she was supposed to be felt underwhelming and underdeveloped.\r\n\r\nOne thing that annoyed me was this unrealistic flying around by some of the characters. Sure, it looked somewhat cool and very elegant but come on! Suddenly it appeared like the character became weightless and just floated through the air. Not very convincing.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I did enjoy the movie but, as I indicated above, it was not really a wow kind of movie. I have actually added the predecessor to my shopping list since that one got so good reviews. Speaking of reviews, on all the review sites I have looked this movie gets a rating of about 6 out of 10. Of course one site just had to stand out. Rotten Tomates! Their so called \u201ccritics\u201d gave it a rotten rating with an abysmal score of 19%. What the f\u2026?

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"The first half-an-hour or so of Joker plays out likes a farcical drama on contemporary society and politics. Director Raju Murugan (who earlier gave us Cuckoo) doesn't spare anyone. From cops who salute helicopters flying across the sky to leaders who stage half-day hunger strikes and movie stars, everyone is a fodder for his sharply written dialogues that sting like barbs. \r\n\r\nWe are introduced to Mannar Mannan (Guru Somasundaram), a villager, who, for some reason, calls himself the president of the nation (a chart in his house has photographs of all the presidents we have had till date, with Mannan's own mug) and takes it upon himself to solve the issues that he comes across. He also has two accomplices \u2014 Potti Case Ponoonjal (Mu Ramasamy), an elderly man who has a habit of taking offenders to court (Traffic Ramaswamy seems to have been the real-life inspiration here, though his look is modelled on the late writer Jayakanthan), and Isai (Gayathri Krishna), a young widow, who shares Mannar's ideals and functions as his secretary and social media manager (she uploads every moment from their protests, and these become viral memes online). \r\n\r\nThere is also plenty of humour in these scenes (a goat kid is called Usain Bolt; Mannar refers to his work place as Pappireddy Bhavan). There are also some issues that keep getting raised again and again \u2014 illegal sand mining and open defecation, in particular. And slowly we are told how Mannar became 'President'. We are shown the love story of Mannar and Mallika, the girl from his neighbouring village who rejects him initially and is later charmed by his sincere attempts to woo her (Mallika lays down one condition to marry him \u2014 that he should first build a toilet in his house). We also see how Mannar becomes fixated with the powers of a president, thanks to his conversations with a father-figure (Bava Chelladurai). Meanwhile, the actual president is about to visit the village to launch a 'Toilets for everyone' scheme, and Mannar's life becomes interlinked with this. Tragedy strikes in the life of this couple, and this changes Mannar completely, and he begins his unique fight for justice. \r\n\r\nRaju Murugan seems to have realised the chief problem that hemmed in Cuckoo \u2014overpowering melodrama, and in Joker, he strikes the right balance between drama and comedy. And the dramatic moments are dealt with in such a subtle manner that they are heartrending. The director still hasn't completely gotten rid of the didactic nature of his lines, but given that the film is built as an 'issue film' driven by a dramatic plot, this doesn't harm the film much. Still, the climactic breakdown by Mu Ramasamy, while searing in its intentions, sticks out as a message moment. \r\n\r\nStill, the director, once again, displays a flair for using music and casting. Sean Roldan's fabulous songs and score enhance the drama in the scenes, and the actors are wonderful. The two female actresses are very natural while Bava Chelladurai adds humour.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> The story of women's fate from the men's perspective.\r\n\r\nIraiva means God and Iraivi means Goddess, but it should have been Iraivigal which means Goddesses. This film talks about three women, who dream how their future should be. That's the opening, but the remaining film tells a different story. In this men dominated world, what is the part of women and their sufferings revealed in its nearly 2 and half hour long run.\r\n\r\nSo like the title implies, it is about women, but from the perspective of men who influence in their life. From all this, one thing I learnt was, Indian women yet to stand on their own feet. I mean India is one of the country that allowed the equal right for women, but they are unable to take the opportunity in the hands as something is blocking their way like men or culture maybe. So this film explains some of the facts which partially inspired by a book by Sujatha, 'Jannal Malar'.\r\n\r\nOnce again, I'm very disappointed with the film length for an Indian film. It was just too long, but this is a well patched story with the twist and turns all the way till the final scene. Filled with kind of unpredictable stuffs. The script was the first best thing from it, followed by the performances by all and then decent quality production.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier about the runtime, I'm upset with the unnecessary songs and dances as well. Those music video tracks killed the rhythm of the narration. It might be okay for an Indian viewer, but if you an international audience, that's totally annoying. Same thing happened to the director's previous film 'Jigarthanda' as well. I consider 'Pizza' was his best work in that perspective, yet all his three films, including this is a great achievement, that's betters the average of the Indian cinema standard.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the actors, it's good to see SJ Surya after a long time in his best performance. Vijay Sethu nailed his part. His character was simply outstanding and so his other co-star Bobby Simha. But in the actress section, it was Anjali who ruled alone with the par to the performances of her well acclaimed earlier films. Overall, with the next generation actors, it is one of the best multi-starrer from the Kollywood. Movies like this once again makes me watch the Tamil films as I was once a regular follower. As stated a few things I did not like from the film, yet I enjoyed watching it, so surely recommended.\r\n\r\n8.5\/10","id":"57a378359251410c7d002ee3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57a378359251410c7d002ee3","movie_id":369094}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**About the bio-war.**\r\n\r\nA simple but an effective storyline. A refreshing action-sci-fi that had a few flaws. First of all it was unnecessary the lead actor playing the both good and negative roles. That gives the impression how character obsessed these actors are. Yep the negative role was powerful, so if someone better actor in the part would have been much better for cinema. That's the major setback in this and the rest of the film is enjoyable.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of an ex Indian agent who brought in back for a special mission. The death of his wife and this new organisation has something in common. So he has to find out what's it and if they are the same gang, then it'll be the revenge time. The remaining film is a cat and mouse game, and how it all ends was told with a final face off between two men.\r\n\r\nI liked the story, but many scenes were so clich\u00e9. Besides, the songs were disadvantaged. Indians might enjoy that, not the international audience, because it disturbed the rhythm of the fine story of an agent. The stunts were okay, the cinematography was good. Actors, actresses, all were excellent. Even that sci-fi theme was impressive. Somehow they have missed to turn it into a masterpiece. So once watchable film, a decent agent film like this won't come easy from India.\r\n\r\n_6.5\/10_","id":"587a9a0e9251413f3300751f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/587a9a0e9251413f3300751f","movie_id":391274}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A medicine tale.**\r\n\r\nThe lives of doctors. Most of the film covered from the professional aspect and between two. A junior and a senior doctor. When I decided to watch it, I anticipated either fun or an inspiring film. But it was like too serious and a casual storyline. I mean it could have been a documentary, but the presentation was clearly a cinematic. Then all cinemas need a writing, so does it. More like from someone's real life experience. It had the ingredients, but everything was straightforward without twist and turn.\r\n\r\nIf you consider the story progressing to the next level is a twist or turn, then the film had a few of those often. Though they are not effective as what a viewer actually meant a real twist in the storytelling. Nowadays, twist means a mind blowing development\/scene. The characters were well designed. Between the main two, the narration keeps hopping, revealing their lives as doctors, especially in the rural. There's more to it, that theirs commitments and differences within their passion for their work.\r\n\r\nA single doctor who has been dedicated all his life to the poor patients from the rural, now discovered he has a brain tumour. He begins his treatment right away, but he was advised to retire and rest. That's where a junior doctor comes in. His replacement. The two work together, where she learns all his patients, but it was not a smooth ride. Since he's not happy to be replaced, particularly his patients are unique, their different style of treating the patients brings a crack in the relationship even before they had one.\r\n\r\n> \u275dWhat I call nature may be something else for believers. But don't tell me nature is beautiful.\u275e\r\n\r\nOne thing that unites them is the medicine. Despite the differences, they make their best effort to contribute from their field of expertise. They are the best doctors, but joining the hand at the wrong time is what the English translated title meant. That's almost the entire story of it. Along with their struggle in the rural settings like it be commuting from place to place, at day and night, whenever the service required.\r\n\r\nThe film justifies on the roles it focused on than the concept it deals with. So most of those who watches it won't say they saw a very good film. Even me too felt that way. That does not mean it was bad flick. Some people surely would enjoy it being as it is. I think the real doctors or their friends and families and patients, to see their similar experiences on the screen. What I had liked was, highlighting the work ethic between the rural and the city doctor. It was like a two different world.\r\n\r\nI have rated it better, because of the quality of the content than what I wanted to have a nice time. Besides, it's almost free of clich\u00e9s. Like no romance, no medical miracles or the unexpected subplot developed to brighten up the narration in places. That kept me going. Like I have already mentioned, it was practically a documentary feature, with a cinematic experience.\r\n\r\nThe trivia say, it was made by a doctor turned filmmaker. So what do you expect from such director. His previous flick too was about the same theme. Usually when such films are made, the writers, director do research for depicting the contents perfectly. That has not required here. Nicely made film, but not for everyone. One of the under- noticed film, and that's reasonable for such a film, but bashing it even after watching it like what illiterates does. So watch it and respect it or else do not think about it.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59ec9a6ec3a3686f700087ab","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59ec9a6ec3a3686f700087ab","movie_id":375950}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"If Anand Shankar's previous film Arima Nambi had echoes of K Bhagyaraj's Rudhra, the set-up of his Iru Mugan recalls that of Kamal Haasan's Vikram. An intelligence officer is tasked with investigating and foiling a nefarious plot. The mastermind behind the plot is the man who killed his wife, and he is now conducting his operation from a foreign nation. So, the officer has to go there with a female sidekick in tow and save the day. Here, it is Akilan (Vikram, with beard), a RAW agent who goes after Malaysia to capture Love (Vikram, with prosthetics), an anarchist and a brilliant knowledge about chemicals, to avenge the murder of his wife Meera (Nayanthara, whose character feels underwritten despite a terrific twist). He is accompanied on this mission by Ayushi (Nithya Menen, in a rather minor role), a trainee officer.\r\n\r\nWith Arima Nambi, Anand Shankar showed us that he has a flair for Hollywood-ish action thrillers. Iru Mugan, too, feels like something that Hollywood might have come up with. There is a high-concept involving a super drug that increases one's adrenaline and turns ordinary men into supermen for five minutes. The villain is an over-the-top figure who seems to indulge in evil acts not out of any agenda, but more because he relishes the chaos he can create in the world. There is also a clever twist involving the heroine that is actually borrowed from Fast & Furious 6. The characters look chic and the visuals have a sheen that we don't usually see in our films here.\r\n\r\nBut, unlike the first half of Arima Nambi, where Anand Shankar hardly deviated from the plot, here, perhaps because he is working with a star, he settles for compromises \u2014 forced comedy by Thambi Ramaiah, who appears as a cop in Malaysia, that sits uneasily with the seriousness of the hero's mission (it is a stark contrast to what the director achieved with MS Bhaskar in Arima Nambi); a melodramatic character, played by Riythvika, who seems to have dropped in from another film (perhaps Kabali, given that she plays a similar character here); the ease with which Akilan and Ayushi trace the whereabouts of Love, who is built up to be a cunning person; clumsy exposition that is provided through a character (Karunakaran) who seems to exist just for this purpose (the guy works for the villain, but is only too eager to tell everything he knows of his plans to the hero); the several logic leaps (for example, the almost magical recovery by the hero in the climax after taking the super drug, which we are told leaves a person drained for hours after the five-minute mark).\r\n\r\nAnd yet, the film works... to an extent. And that is mainly because the director gives an antagonist who is more than an equal to the hero. His Love seemed to be more of an indulgence in the promos, especially because of Vikram's predilection towards gimmicky roles, but the character works in the film, and keeps us in thrall. And the actor nails both the mannerisms and the modulation of this character. The film feels alive whenever this character is on screen, and that is why the second half \u2014 despite the implausible scenes \u2014 comes across as more engaging than the initial portions.","id":"57e8b9679251412987019d50","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57e8b9679251412987019d50","movie_id":391274}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Iraivi signifies the transition of Karthik Subbaraj from a whiz kid who delivered visually dazzling works to a major filmmaker who merits serious discussion. If Pizza and Jigarthanda showed his directing flair, Iraivi is a showcase of his writing prowess. That doesn't mean the film is visually a lesser experience. In fact, it is equally impressive. The film is certainly the most interesting 'drama' we have seen in Tamil cinema in a while. \r\n\r\nThe plot revolves around three men and their attitudes, which impact not only their lives, but also those of the women in their lives. For the filmmaker Arul (SJ Suryah, fantastic), the fact that his film is lying in the cans because of a tussle with his egoistic producer (Vijai Murugan) is reason enough to turn to booze. Michael (Vijay Sethupathi, perfect) is so taken in by Arul and his family that he never thinks twice about his 'devotion' impacting his own life. He doesn't even mind ending a between-the-sheets session for them. Jagan (Bobby Simhaa, effective), a college student and Arul's brother, is perhaps the only male character who sees the two men for what they are. His own father (Radha Ravi) had mistreated his now comatose mother (Vadivukkarasi) when she was in good health. Naturally, he is angry with the way these women are treated and wants things to be better for them. But he doesn't realise that what his actions denote is not empowerment but condescension dressed up as concern. \r\n\r\nAs for the women in their lives, Arul's wife Yazhini (Kamalinee Mukherjee, solid), cannot make up her mind on whether she wants to live with her drunkard husband or move on and remarry. Ponni (Anjali, excellent), Michael's wife, knows that she has ended up with a husband who doesn't really love her, but soldiers on because that is what women are meant to do in our society. On the other hand, Malarvizhi (Pooja Devariya, impressive), a widow, is clear that Michael is just a friend with benefits to her, despite him professing his love to her, and has no qualms about using him for her biological urge. \r\n\r\nKarthik's writing is novelistic, with each character having their own well-sketched arcs (it is definitely a film that merits repeated viewings). The narration, too, is never rushed and he lets the scenes breathe and gives us time to savour them before moving on to the next one. And he provides terrific bookends for some of the scenes. Sample this: Just before the film's intermission, we get scenes that raise our hopes that these men \u2014 and women \u2014 could finally be having their break. And we see that notion getting broken down, with a sledgehammer, literally! This happens in the climax as well. The promise of a better future for the characters, struck down (again, literally) in a moment! This kind of symmetry is carried even to the credits as well. The film begins with a disclosure that it is heavily inspired by K Balachander, Balu Mahendra and Sujatha. It ends with a hat tip to Sujatha's Jannal Malar. \r\n\r\nThere is an autobiographical angle as well, like in Jigarthanda. In that film, it involved a filmmaker forced to compromise and making the most out of it. Here, the sub-plot involving the tussle between Arul and the producer, has echoes of the wrangle between the director and the producer of Jigarthanda. Not surprisingly, we get a line that goes \"Nee padaippaali pa. Aathiram kobam ellaam un ezhuthula kaatu\". \r\n\r\nVisually, too, the film is interesting. Sivakumar Vijayan's camera work is so subtle that we never realise how well they impact us (the presence of rain in many crucial scenes, for example). The usage of visual signifiers like a prison dress falling out of the clothesline to imply the release of a character from prison, or a monkey toy to underscore a character's indecisive nature feel like a nod to KB. The songs (by Santhosh Narayanan) feel unnecessary, but even here, they are used within the context of the film, and Karthik even takes a dig at equating song-less films with art films (\"Paadinaale art illa commercial nu sollrangale da\"). \r\n\r\nHowever, for a film that boasts of thoughtful writing, the twist is a disappointment. One, the reason for a character's decision to bring about the downfall of another feels too convenient. Two, in a film that is visually inventive, the manner in which this revelation is done is cliched. But most importantly, it implies a director not completely trusting his writing and going back to a plot device that worked wonders for him in his previous films. Also, one of the sub-plots, involving the stealing of idols, seems to have been included as a way of injecting some thrills into what is essentially a relationship drama. \r\n\r\nBut what underwhelms us is that it is through dialogues that we get the empowerment angle \u2014 \"Poruthukarathukkum sagichukkardhukkum naama enna pombalaya\", \"Ponna irundha solla koodadhu \u2014 ketta vaartha-da ingellaam\" (referring to women mentioning the word sex), \"Aan nedil, penn kuril\" (justifying the capitalisation of men in the film's tagline \u2014 Sila woMENgalin kadhai) and so on. And are the film's women really in a better place in the end? Maybe. Maybe not. The female characters, barring Malar (to an extent), come across as women who need the intervention of men in their lives, and do not seem to be capable of possessing an agency of their own. One (Vadivukkarasi) is literally passive, lying comatose in a hospital bed. Even Malar, for all her outspokenness and bold outlook, is shown breaking down when she cuts her relationship with Michael, sending us conflicting signals. Perhaps, Karthik wanted to make a women empowerment film that isn't gung-ho about its message and delivers it rather in a subtle way, but in that case, he has succeeded only to an extent.","id":"57553e05925141338c002118","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57553e05925141338c002118","movie_id":369094}

{"author":"Lucky_Man","content":"On the surface, this is a well-made action movie set within the Star Wars universe filled with nods and homages to \"A New Hope\" that will make you tingle with warm nostalgia. The reappearance of sets, costumes and characters from our favorite childhood movies might make you say \"Now, THIS is a Star Wars movie!\"\r\n\r\nHowever, nostalgia and making copious amounts of money on that nostalgia seemed to be Disney's primary strategy with this movie. It's mimicry, plain and simple. The CGI recreations of Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher felt very dirty and a flagrant disrespect to the departed actors, not to mention jarring, for a first time viewer. The digital appearance of Grand Moff Tarkin disengaged me from the frail story and made me settle my stomach with a handful of antacid tablets. \r\n\r\nThe story, writing, characterization is on-par with what you'd expect from modern cinema and the movie serves it's primary purpose of being entertaining.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Every dog has its day.**\r\n\r\nYeah, just like what we say in our country on 'made in China', a poor and cheap quality product. It seems they never ever see the bright side in this business (making products). This is the Sino-US collaboration product and as usual the film was too poor. The animation was much better than some of the B animation features. But the universe was too small, or you can say restricted for certain enclosure makes it fall in as a bad film. That's when you observe the backgrounds, you would notice how substandard it is.\r\n\r\nVisually and basic storyline seems not much different from other animated flicks. Because it kind of reminded me many awesome films from the recent past like it either be ' Kung Fu Panda' or 'Zootopia'. All about chasing the impossible dream and an inspiring theme. But still I believe the little kids like under 6-7 might enjoy it. Yeah, this is definitely not for the grown ups like most of the modern animated films are. That's a sad part, yet some adult would find it better.\r\n\r\nThe film was built on the most common clich\u00e9d platform. A young Tibetan sheepdog is not interested in what his kind destined to do. Instead, he's very much into the musics and after inspired by what the famous musician said, he embarks a journey that would decide his fate. So how his life going to change comes with the remaining parts. There were some nice comedies, but nothing tried hard to uplift film. From the beginning itself, it was so familiar, which did not give any space for a better improvement in the later parts. An average film, maybe below that, yet watchable one. Short film though, with the nice music.\r\n\r\n_4\/10_","id":"597e050dc3a368545101912a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/597e050dc3a368545101912a","movie_id":333667}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Oups! I just realized that, for some reason, this movie had fallen between the cracks. It was quite some time since I watched it but I seem to have forgotten to write a post about it.\r\n\r\nFor me this was one of the best of the new (after the original trilogy) Star Wars movies. It was fun, entertaining with plenty of good, old-fashioned Star Wars action. I generally do not like prequels but this time I felt it was nice to get a bit of the background to the statement that \u201ca number of spies died to get this information\u201d in episode IV. We were even provided with a bit of an explanation as to why the Death Star had this silly weakness in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe actors were doing a decent enough job of it. The chatty android was fun without being totally silly. It was a nice roller coaster ride of action, improvisations, and gung ho ludicrous stunts inside and outside of various forms of transportation means.\r\n\r\nAs usual with Star Wars the science part of science fiction is somewhat lacking. What looks cool is what is put on the screen and screw science. When reading books I am more sensitive to such things but for a Star Wars movie it works well enough.\r\n\r\nSome people seem to be dissecting the characters and dialogue, trying to put logic into it as well as wanting to have more emotions and \u201ccharacter development\u201d. Come on! It is a Star Wars movie. It is supposed to be all action and visually stunning.\r\n\r\nOn that this movie delivers. Sure the plot is not really the most developed one and has plenty of faults.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The episode III\u00bd.**\r\n\r\nSo this is like a bridge between the original trilogy and the next three prequels. A story where the main characters from the original tale are not involved. Being a big fan of this franchise, I loved it. I did not expect big, so got entertained well. But pity that this wonderful characters are not going to return. This is just a one-off film. For seeing its overwhelming success, there could be a prequel, which has a very very slim chance.\r\n\r\nThe story was like that had started in a half way. That's why I wanted a prequel to tell us the Galen Erso's point of view story. When he has been taken back to the base to work for the Empire, his daughter is the only one who escapes from there. After a few years later the grown- up daughter, Jyn, end up on the rebel's side. When she hints a plan for them to strike the Empire, nobody considers it. But a rogue gang forms where they all does according to her saying. That's the story, and how it all ends are the rest.\r\n\r\nThe story was simple, but the action-adventures were good. Like what a 'Star Wars' fans want to see. The main drawback was there's no familiar faces around. Even the original franchise style of title and credit presentation was off the beat. Though there were cameos. Darth Vade, Princess Leia, R2D2 and 3PO, including a small lightsabre fight at the end, just to satisfy the fanboys.

{"author":"Matthew Brady","content":"Dark Vader: \"Be careful not to choke on your aspirations, Director.\" \r\n\r\nRogue One follows Jyn Erso (played by Felicity Jones) a Rebellion soldier and criminal, who is about to experience her biggest challenge yet when Mon Mothma sets her out on a mission to steal the plans for the Death Star. With help from the Rebels, a master swordsman, and non-allied forces, Jyn will be in for something bigger than she thinks. \r\n\r\nI had my worries with Rogue One, if I must admit. After the massive success of \"The Force Awakens\", the universe of Star Wars has now expanded even more. There's going to be more sequels, prequels, and spin-offs every year now. Why this worries me is because I fear I'm going to be sick of theses and not really get exited anymore. Star Wars should be treated like a three year event like before, it gives more time for the writers & director to really flesh out the story. It may seem like a long wait, but it'll be worth the wait. But that's not all. The trouble re shoots this went through and the ridiculous short deadlines during post-production. But after seeing the film myself, I can safely say that this new prequel isn't a bad one. \r\n\r\n\"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\" is a good movie. Not great or amazing, just decent. In my opinion, it's not up there with \"A New Hope\" or \"Empire Strikes Back\". It's more in the middle for me. If I have to be honest, I actually enjoyed \"Force Awakens\" more than this. Yeah, I said it. The movie is flawed, but it dose have a lot to like about it. \r\n\r\nI can't imagine the pressure Gareth Edwards must have felt making this, kinda like what Abrams was feeling. In interviews, Gareth has said he was a Star Wars fan and it was the reason why he wanted to make movies. So this is very dear to him and while there where some slip ups in parts, but I must say that he handed the material really well. Gareth Edward is very good at making things feel huge and the heavy scale of things. The action scenes were directed so brilliantly that it actually felt like a war movie. \r\n\r\nThat's what really surprised me about \"Rogue One\" is how dark and depressing it is. Some people may have a problem with that, since everyone is use to these adventures with are favorite characters. For me, I didn't have an issue with it. Heck, I'm kinda glad it had the balls to go that far and be violent. The humor is very limited, but when there is humor is mostly from K-2SO (played by Alan Tudyk), who was just the best. \r\n\r\nThe CGI in this movie was incredible and quite groundbreaking. I mean, it's TOO GOOD. The way it blended with the real life environment and the action scenes was so good that half of the time I was watching computer effect's on screen. How it was executed was so beautiful and quite the achievement. \r\n\r\nNow the biggest complaint I've been hearing from Star Wars fans is about Peter Cushing Digital Resurrection. Yep, he's back to cinematic life through the use of state-of-the-art visual effects wizardry. He's character Grand Moff Tarkin is in the movie, but instead of re-casting the role or kept his digital face in the shadows, but that's surprisingly not the case. He's in the movie quite a lot as you see him in full form and up close. This is getting a mix response from people and even I was a bit mixed on it. I was a bit weird out by it, as Peter Cushing has been dead for 22 years and seeing up there was hard to digest. But after letting it sink in, I thought it wasn't too noticeable and in a few scene I actually brought into it. I thought it looked real when he wasn't moving around or any close ups to his face. But that's just my thoughts.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of bringing back old characters, Dark Vader makes a appears in this. While he's screen time is very short, but he steals every scene he's in. Eventually the hallway scene, that was so bad-ass and one of my favorite moments in the movie. It's great to see him and James Earl Jones back as one of greatest villains of all time. \r\n\r\nNow for the problems: The first half of \"Rogue One\" was a bit rough for me and I was kinda bored at times. I didn't care or got attracted to the characters. The characterization was lacking and that's a real shame, because Star Wars is all about the characters, as it's the thing we remember from these movies. It's not all about Lightsabers and battles, it's the characters. Felicity Jones, Alan Tudyk & Mads Mikkelsen characters were the only ones that I cared about. The others not so much. \r\n\r\nAnother major part of the Star Wars movies is the score. John Williams score is so iconic that it's hard to top it. It's the heart of the series and I kinda wish he did the score for this, because Michael Giacchino score wasn't that good. But I'll cut Giacchino a little slack, he only had 4 weeks to compose it and it is a tough act to follow. That goes back to what I said about the deadlines being too short. \r\n\r\nOverall rating: \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\" is a good entry to the series and it dose feel like a dark Star Wars movie. I may have problems with the movie and I have to be honest with that, but I do think it ties in very well with \"A New Hope\". A plot like this was needed to fill in the 40 year old plot gap.","id":"5e2f2b801685da0013e9f8be","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2f2b801685da0013e9f8be","movie_id":330459}

{"author":"Dan_Tebasco","content":"Serial shooters is definitly something that is close to Uwe Boll's heart and it shows in the movies he makes about these (he's made a bunch when he's not making super poor videogame adaptations and other things), he simply puts in that extra effort in to these films that he doesn't do in other films, let's be real Uwe doesn't exactly scream quality film generally speaking.\r\n\r\nAnd while this is not as good (or great) as the other 2 movies in the Rampage trilogy it's still a decent enough way to end it.\r\n\r\nHad my concerns that it wouldn't be because the reception in general wasn't the best and Uwe was also rather pissed at his fans when he wasn't able to fully fund it via Kickstarter, to the degree that he vowed to never make a movie again. Which of course he later detracted and ended up making this anyway.\r\n\r\nSo I was wondering if the lack of public funding would make him lose interest just going to half ass it this time, but luckily that doesn't seem to have been the case. While not perfect I think this movie does get alot of things right and brings some more depth and character development to the character of Bill and Brendan Flether does get to showcase more range in his performance so yeah overall I was not let down.\r\n\r\nIf you are wondering if you can watch this without seeing the others the answer is, you can but it would be a mistake as the other 2 are better and well you'll lose out on context and stuff.","id":"58f28d6d9251413d840039a5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58f28d6d9251413d840039a5","movie_id":395925}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"When American audiences last saw our diminutive chopsocky champion in the iconic Jackie Chan he was kicking butt and taking numbers alongside ex-<em>Jackass<\/em> and <em>Dukes of Hazzard<\/em> star Johnny Knoxville in the flaccid and forgettable 2016 voltage vehicle <em>Skiptrace<\/em>. Well, the sixty-something martial arts megastar has found yet another frenetic farce to strut his stuff as he stars and co-produces in the vintage actioner <strong>Railroad Tigers<\/strong>, a vanity project that enlists his son Jaycee by his side as the nepotism card is dealt for the rollicking father-son tandem and their ragtag of hangers-on. \r\n\r\nThe good news is that <strong>Railroad Tigers<\/strong> is more of an entertaining roar than the aforementioned tiring and convoluted <em>Skiptrace<\/em> (this is not saying that much in terms of a compliment). However, the bad news is that <strong>Tigers<\/strong> does not challenge Chan and his high-strung hucksters to anything creatively crafty or freshly distinctive despite its nostalgic, stylish feel and loose ode to classic cinema that range from the old-fashioned <em>Robin Hood<\/em> movies to collaborative capers such as <em>The Dirty Dozen<\/em> and <em>The Magnificent Seven<\/em>. Still, <strong>Railroad Tigers<\/strong> is serviceable enough to satisfy watching the aging Chan and his applied magical mastery of chops, kicks and punches provide the escapist cartoon-inspired fight sequences that is the veteran actor's trademark trickery. <strong>Railroad Tigers<\/strong> is all-too-familiar film fodder for the Kung-Fu Crown Prince of Pain but Chan's off-kilter western chugs along in a Chinese-language action movie that systematically delivers more than it sputters to the finishing line.\r\n\r\nNo doubt that Chan has seen his better days in cinema as the maturing martial arts statesman continues to tinker around with formulas while still trying to keep his cinematic relevance in tact. One can definitely applaud Chan for his staying power on the big screen regardless of the classic hits, box office bombs or middling movies that have painted his film-making resume. Chan hooks up once again for the third time with his <em>Police Story 2013<\/em> and 2010's <em>Little Big Soldier<\/em> director Ding Sheng as he finds himself in a period piece centered around the exploits of a moving train. Indeed, <strong>Railroad Tigers<\/strong> is a rip-off of sorts and the premise is as predictable as one of Chan's acrobatic and comical kinetic pokes to the groin. Time does not stand still for anybody and that includes the combative senior citizen with the impish grin and stored bundle of energy that still oddly resonates on the big screen for Chan fans worldwide. Although it is understandable that we yearn for the young Jackie Chan of yesteryear with his <em>Supercop<\/em> identity one should try to appreciate the traveled actor's attempt to recapture his roguish reputation in a battered body that has seen its share of high-wire hedonism. \r\n\r\nIt is 1941 in eastern China where Ma Yuan (Chan) is the head porter for a rural railroad station. Ultimately, Yuan becomes the leader of a rebellious squad of railroad workers-turned-freedom fighters whose sole purpose is to hijack a Japanese supply train during the Sino-Japanese war effort in order to accommodate their fellow impoverished citizens. Furthermore, Yuan and his mischievous minions set their sights on the big prize--blowing to smithereens the bridge that serves as the major supply route for the train in crippling the Japanese transport system. The cockeyed crew are deep-rooted in craziness due to the fact that a.) the risky mission is suicidal in nature and b.) the fact that even professional soldiers are not ballsy enough to take on this kind of agenda against the mighty Japanese forces. Nevertheless, Yuan and his renegades undertake what is an ambitious albeit far-fetched gamble.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the combination of the clumsiness and caliber of choreographed fisticuffs of Chan and his cheeky charges is the physical source of appeal for this action\/comedy military-western. Writer-director Sheng inexplicably takes a while to let the animated nuttiness roll before the wackiness is fleshed out along with the kooky characterizations that includes the offspring of Chan's in Jaycee as one of the maneuvering misfits that participate in this peculiar Far East <em>The Bridge on the River Kwai<\/em> knockoff. The supporting players contribute fairly effective to the farcical proceedings including Darren Wang's Chinese soldier that informs Yuan and his giddy group on the Japanese operations, Wang Kai's noodle distributor\/sharpshooter Fan Chaun, Alan Ng's pick-pocketer San, Xu Fan's Xing'er (crushing on Chan's Ma) and Huang Zitao's tailor Dahai to name a few. Other noteworthy personalities featured in the mix are the villainous Japanese presence led by Hiroyuki Ikeyuchi's military law enforcer Yumaguchi and his femme fatale colleague in Zhang Luxin's Yuko. \r\n\r\nOverall, <strong>Railroad Tigers<\/strong> hits its stride as Chan and company gives their audience the desired ingredients to make this messy mayhem acceptable--awestruck stunt work, quirky-minded theatrics from the amusing Chan and an obvious nod to some of Hollywood's notable salute to train heist flicks and wartime fables that stimulate more than sedate. These <strong>Tigers<\/strong> claw their way into a frivolous lather but whether or not Chan's latest spectacle deserves a boarding pass to enjoy the same blueprint thrills...well, hey...would you rather see the sequel to <em>Skiptrace II<\/em>? We rest our case...      \r\n\r\n<strong>Railroad Tigers<\/strong>\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 5 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Jackie Chan, Jaycee Chan, Zitao Huang, Kai Wang, Darren Wang, Hiroyuki Ikeyuchi, Zhang Lanxin, Alan Ng, Zhang Yishang, Fan Xu, Sang Ping, Wang Ta Lu\r\n\r\nDirected by: Ding Sheng\r\n\r\nWritten by: Ding Sheng and He Ke Ke\r\n\r\nDistributed by: Well Go USA Entertainment, Beijing Sparkle Roll Media, Shanghai Film Group Co., JQ Pictures LTD.\r\n\r\nProducers: Jackie Chan, Qi Jian Hong, Ren Zhong Hun, Song Ge.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Space warriors, mad scientist, chosen one and saving the planet.**\r\n\r\nI might have heard the name, but seems nothing familiar. So it is very much like my first encounter with these game characters. And this is really a good first film, I enjoyed, but did not like, because I'm not the target audience. I know, many grown-ups liked it, but they had reasons like they have known this for some time. One thing that fascinated me was the production quality. I can't believe, it was not those silly B class animation, it was very much comparable to Disney, Pixar and DreamWorks films. The only thing that did not favour it was the story. If they have got that part right, it would have been one of the best animations of the years.\r\n\r\nSo the truth is I tempted to rate it higher for the quality of animation alone. The directors, and all artists must be praised for that. If I were a kid, it would have been my favourite. So what I'm saying it, this film will be loved by children. There's not child film critic, otherwise this film would have been appreciated better. The problem is the critics did not like it, and so the adults, but families with kids might have chance to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nSome of the big names in the voice-over artist list, but that did not help the film to see its success. There's no innovation in it, everything you see in the film was already exploited in other films. All those the space warriors thing, the chosen one, villain, mad scientist, betrayal, you have seen them from 'Star wars' to 'Guardian of the Galaxy'. That is another reason for not having a good time with it. It is still very much a watchable film.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"57f41248925141398a00048f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57f41248925141398a00048f","movie_id":234004}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"A popular PlayStation-era game is the frivolous foundation for the kiddie sci-fi action-oriented animation adventure **\u2018Ratchet & Clank\u2019** that makes it a playful stamp on the big screen. This kid-friendly space saga, armed with its beloved reputation in the world of gamer groupies, could be deemed as the junior-sized \u2018Star Wars\u2019 for the minor sect. Why would the mini movie-goers not find this big screen adaptation an appealing space-aged actioner worth its weight in innocuous, escapist gold? After all, what is not to like about the roguish and heroic feline-looking creature Ratchet (otherwise known as a \u2018lombax\u2019) with the Buck Rogers attire as well as the cute clanking companion in the green-eyed, robotic Clank (channeling the impish and lovable R2D2 from that certain George Lucas-directed worldwide cinematic sensation from yesteryear?).\r\n\r\nOur galactic good guys look to save the universe and the avid youngish video game fanatics will eat this fun-loving fantasy up with moon dust soup. Unfortunately, **\u2018Ratchet & Clank\u2019** musters up a tepid by-the-numbers frenzy that will predictably hold the munchkins\u2019 imaginative attention. As for others, the hyper hairball and his trusty tin can tag-along get lost in the shuffle of this somewhat serviceable but sluggish cartoon pie-in-the-sky popcorn pleaser for the little ones at large.\r\n\r\nDirectors Kevin Monroe\u2019s and Jerrica Cleland\u2019s spotty spunk captures the loose lunacy and spirited sauciness on occasion where even the movie\u2019s poster promises to \u2018kick some asteroid\u2019. It is too bad that the breezily bland storytelling cannot overcome its conventional confines as one may get a more stimulating kick engaging in the actual video game than viewing this kinetic crater kiddie showcase without much distinction or creative plucking pop. Basically, **\u2018Ratchet & Clank\u2019** is safe and generic but never grabs the challenging aspects behind its one-note presentation in good versus evil\u2013something that may in fact be a clich\u00e9d overload even for those tykes out there begging for these amiable planetary protectors to bring something fresh outside of its gaming inspiration.\r\n\r\nThe youthful mechanic Ratchet (voiced by James Arnold Taylor who also provided the voicing duties in the video game) is a dreamer with heroic plans to join the prestigious glory-seeking Galactic Rangers. Specifically, the Galactic Rangers are known for their courageous crime-fighting activities on Ratchet\u2019s home planet. Ratchet\u2019s lofty ambition to hook up with the Galactic Rangers is somewhat alarming to his boss and mentor Grimroth (John Goodman) who is not too thrilled with his employee\u2019s\/protege\u2019s questionable expectations. The Galactic Rangers are currently recruiting for skilled members to collaborate with them and expand the elite unit. For the star-eyed Ratchet this is a golden opportunity to become a starry-eyed superhero reaching for acceptance and self-importance.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, a treacherous tyrant known as Chairman Drek (Paul Giamatti) is the galaxy\u2019s menacing madman and one of the main reasons why the Galactic Rangers are nursing the thoughts of growing their interstellar roster of crime-stoppers. Drek is out of control as he has been destroying planets left and right. Naturally, the dastardly Drek needs to be stopped in his hideous mission to castrate and conquer. Drek\u2019s calculating cronies include his second-in-command robot Victor (Sylvester Stallone) and ominous scientific aide Dr. Nefarious (Armin Shimerman from TV\u2019s \u201cStar Trek Deep Space Nine\u201d). They are instrumental in creating killer robots whose sole purpose is out to eradicate the celebrated do-gooder Galactic Rangers. Of course this begs the question: does Ratchet really know what he is getting into regarding his heralded aspirations to become a Galactic Ranger?\r\n\r\nIt would take a pint-sized turncoat from Drek\u2019s robotic renegades in the form of defective and rejected Clank (voiced by David Kaye) to escape the mechanical baddies and whisper the devious goings-on to the noble Galactic Rangers. The initial meeting of Ratchet and the British-sounding Clank is incidental but when they thwart the sneak attack initiated by Drek\u2019s tin-plated terrorists the pair are invited into the applauded team\u2019s inner circle courtesy of the tandem\u2019s rescuing efforts. Galactic Ranger head honcho Captain Quark (Jim Ward) has his doubts about the eager talented twosome but the other members embrace Ratchet and Clank with open arms. Still, the common goal is to eliminate Drek and his horrible henchmen Dr. Nefarious and Victor from orchestrating the ruination of their jeopardized universe.\r\n\r\nAlthough showing some spunk and off-balance wittiness,   **Ratchet & Clank** feels notoriously recycled as it obviously borrows from other animated fodder while tapping into the all-too-familiar Star Wars mantra that features a young adventurer from a distant planet thriving to save the galaxy from sinister forces. There are colorful action sequences and gun-toting shenanigans that will entertain the impish kiddies as they engage in the elaborate space battles. Both leading lads Ratchet and especially the merry-minded, metal-plated Clank will come off as an adorable yet oddball duo to behold. The villainy of Drek and his devious drones will probably spark the giddiness in the wide-eyed youngsters. The common sense behind Ratchet & Clank is to arm the movie\u2019s presentation with the feel and feisty-oriented flavor of its video game blueprint. If that is the case then why bother serving up a family fantasy on the big screen if it cannot separate occasionally from its vintage gamer blueprint?\r\n\r\nCuriously, the fast-paced hit-and-miss jokes and the spry-looking makeup of this kid-approved cosmic caper is a passable revelation for a movie representing a fourteen-year old video game from yesteryear. Also, the notable names behind the characterizations in **Ratchet & Clank** seem to give some measure of breezy joy to their on-screen roles. Celebrity voices instilled in the fired-up female warriors consist of the likes of Rosario Dawson\u2019s Alaris and Bella Thorne\u2019s Cora which evoke the recent reminiscences of Star Wars: The Force Awakens\u2019 Daisy Ridley\u2019s heroine Rey. Consequently, all these factors mentioned in the rousing yet rudimentary Ratchet & Clank boils down to just another basic and tiresome \u201cgood-against-evil\u201d gimmick for the chorus of the kid-watching crowd.\r\n\r\nIt is a given that **Ratchet & Clank** will be a spell-binding spectacle to the young viewers but for the rest of us let\u2019s hope that a nostalgic rerun of Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space will suffice for our adequate needs blocking out the fire-power crafty cat and his diminutive autotron sidekick.\r\n\r\n**Ratchet & Clank (2016)**\r\n\r\nFocus Features\r\n\r\n1 hr. 34 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring (the voices of): James Arnold Taylor, David Kaye, John Goodman, Sylvester Stallone, Paul Giamatti, Rosario Dawson, Bella Thorne, Jim Ward, Armin Shimerman, Vincent Tong\r\n\r\nDirected by: Kevin Munroe and Jerrica Cleland\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG\r\n\r\nGenre: Sci-Fi\/Space Fantasy\/Action & Adventure\/Kids & Family\/Animation\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n**(c) Frank Ochieng**","id":"5726a2e5c3a3683841003416","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5726a2e5c3a3683841003416","movie_id":234004}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"The best way to watch Thodari is to consider it as a spoof thriller. Prabu Solomon seems to have taken a leaf out of Radha Mohan's Payanam for this film, which feels novel because of its setting \u2014 a train. There's isn't a properly focused plot as such (at least until the interval) and the film chugs along like a series of incidents that happen inside a train that is en route from New Delhi to Chennai.\r\n\r\nA motley bunch of characters are travelling on the train. We have the pantry team headed by Chandrakanth (Thambi Ramaiah) of which Poochiyappan (Dhanush) is a part. Poochi's love interest Saroja (Keerthy Suresh, whose 'loosu ponnu' role is used to provide humour) is the touch-up girl of an actress who is also on the train. A central minister (Radha Ravi) is also among the passengers. His NSG commando (Harish Uthaman) has temper issues, and Poochi and Saroja become his target. The pacing in these portions is quite slow \u2014 more passenger train than superfast express \u2014 but the comedy sequences featuring Dhanush and Thambi Ramaiah are amusing, and help us look over this fact.\r\n\r\nIt is only closer to the interval that some semblance of plot emerges, when the train's driver dies inside his cabin and the train starts picking up speed (the film, too, picks up pace). Even as the plot begins to feel like a comic version of Tony Scott's Unstoppable (though, the director tries to counter this with a dialogue: Idea kudukka ellaam Hollywood padam paakanum-nu avasiyam illa), the scenes begins to resemble a satire, with media sensationalism, and the opportunism of politicians being the prime targets.\r\n\r\nIn his previous film, Kayal, Prabu Solomon exploited a disaster like the 2004 tsunami to shore up a romantic tale. In Thodari, he exploits the romance between his leads to mount a near-disaster. He alternates between comic and mock-serious tones and that helps us overlook the tackily staged romantic and thriller portions. The almost two-dozen supporting actors (from Radha Ravi, Karunakaran and Darbuka Siva to A Venkatesh and Chinni Jayanth) help keep us from getting bored while Dhanush, who is used more for his star value, is in fine B-movie form, gamely providing comedy, romance and heroism.","id":"57e8baf9925141395b017f69","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57e8baf9925141395b017f69","movie_id":376446}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Rajini Murugan reinforces what we had learned from Varuthapadatha Vaalibar Sangam \u2014 director Ponram has a flair for entertaining us even with a story that sounds dated and cliched. The film actually feels like more of what we had seen in the earlier one (the director even finds a way to link the two films in the climax), but posses a sense of joie de vivre that lifts it up and keeps us amused.\r\n\r\nAs for the plot, it revolves around Rajini Murugan (Sivakarthikeyan), a happy-go-lucky (Tamil cinema slang for wastrel) youngster, whose only care in the world is to marry Karthika (Keerthy Suresh), his childhood sweetheart.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, their once friendly fathers are now not on talking terms. So, with his friend Thothadri (Soori) in tow, he starts wooing her. Meanwhile, Yezharai Mookkan (Samuthirakani), a thug (of sorts), tries to get a share of Murugan's ancestral property by defaming his grandfather Ayyankaalai (Rajkiran). Of course, everything ends well. And no, this isn't a spoiler.\r\n\r\nSomething for everyone seems to be Ponram's philosophy here and so, he gives us romance, songs, villainy, family melodrama \u2014 all laced with a touch of comedy and presented to us in eye-poppingly bright visuals (the cinematographer is Balasubramaniem). Rajkiran has fun playing the patriarch and also gets a scene in the end to get us all emotional. Yezharai Mookkan does not come across as the kind of villain who needs to be feared and Samuthirakani plays this role with the right amount to seriousness so that we don't discount his threats entirely either. As for Sivakarthikeyan and Soori, they seem to have picked up from where they left off in Varuthapadatha Vaalibar Sangam. True their shtick is a bit predictable but they manage to deliver the laughs. And, of course, the film is overlong with innumerable songs and comic scenes that could have been left at the editing table. It is also utterly unambitious, content with clearing its low bar, but this unpretentiousness is also what makes it work to an extent.","id":"56af202cc3a3681c3700b112","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56af202cc3a3681c3700b112","movie_id":329133}

A simple middle-class family \u2014 an over-sentimental father (Nadodigal Gopal), a concerned mother (Meenakshi), and two brothers, Surya (Kaali Venkat) and Karthi (Kalaiyarasan) \u2014 which is content cherishing the small joys in life. However, the marriage of 30-something Surya, has been a worrying factor for them for a while, and things are not working in favour of him. He becomes a laughing stock among the public, though he is hopeful of winning a woman's heart. Karthi, too, takes potshots at his elder brother Surya often for his marriage proposals repeatedly going haywire, adding to the woes.\r\n\r\nIn an unexpected turn of events, cupid strikes Surya and he falls head over heels for his neighbour Mahalakshmi (Vaishali). Though he is over the moon and puts his best foot forward to impress her, he sees a potential competitor in his younger brother, after the latter tries to move closely with the girl, only to annoy the former. Quite skeptical over Karthi's intentions, Surya ensures that Karthi gets admission in a college which is a little far away from their home. But, lady luck fails to smile on him for the umpteenth time, after he messes up his chance with a hasty decision. Meanwhile, Karthi falls in love with his classmate Subha (Shaalin) and starts dreaming of a life with her.\r\n\r\nThe audiences are in for a surprise when a dejected Surya moves on, and gives a nod to a bride whom he likes at first sight. But, the real twist is revealed when the viewers are shown who the bride is. The story then dwells on how Surya pins hopes on a married life with the girl whom he was impressed with, Karthi's struggle to win his love with the help of his friend Sathish (Bala Saravanan), and how interestingly both these tracks are intertwined.\r\nKaali Venkat as a naive, breadwinner of the family fits perfectly into the role, puts up an impressive performance, and is the show-stealer of the film. Kalaiyarasan is decent, and so are the heroines. The character artistes appear real and are apt for the story. PG Muthaiah deserves mention for his cinematography, which has captured the rustic beauty of the village, while Justin Prabhakaran does not impress except for a song. The film, overall, is a harmless entertainer if you go without expectations.","id":"57ba6a09c3a3687dc90024a8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ba6a09c3a3687dc90024a8","movie_id":402698}

[Xx-\r\n\r\nI have seen many films like this, but this one was a stand-alone from all of them. I'm not saying it is a masterpiece, but they have got all things right just as they wanted. Obviously this is for grownups, though not all of them can watch without feeling disgust. Some of article, reviews says, people left the cinema hall halfway through. A very challenging film to watch. You might think I'm exaggerating for a simple cinematic performance, but that's what I really experienced. Only when you give it a try, you might get it.\r\n\r\nA bit confusing as the story progressing. Like what kind of universe, it is set in. Because whatever happens around Justine, seems nobody caring. Where were the professors! So many doubts. It's just what it is. An imaginative perspective, what if kind of situation turned more uglier. But if you analyse it properly, the only issue was the cannibalism. Not that one showing a desire in consuming meat all of sudden. So, I appreciate the writing, direction and performances, but definitely it is not my cup of tea. Probably for most of you as well.\r\n\r\nSo this is not for all, but selected viewers. Films can be anything, only we have to assert whether we liked it or not. The maker knew what they were doing, the kind of subject they have undertaken for their film. Often a film like this hits the screen, and makes some noise among the film critics and film goers. I don't know on what merit one should decide to watch it. Because it is not for entertainment, nor an art, nor a message film. But I still think it is worth a watch. Just be aware of what you are going to watch.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"5a770e55c3a36859cf043425","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a770e55c3a36859cf043425","movie_id":393519}

{"author":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","content":"A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com\r\n\r\nChances are, you already know how the story of disgraced former New York congressman Anthony Weiner plays out. You may think \u201cWeiner,\u201d a documentary about the man\u2019s unsuccessful New York City mayoral run, will just be a series of \u2018been there, done that\u2019 storytelling. I had the same trepidation going into the screening for this film but instead left the theater having viewed a riveting, engrossing, expertly crafted documentary.\r\n\r\nSome viewers may find this film exploitative, focusing too much on Weiner\u2019s personal life that is, quite frankly, none of our damn business. Political junkies (like myself) will delight in this compelling behind-the-scenes peek at the inner workings of a campaign in crisis mode. Watching public relations tactics changing from offensive to defensive is absolutely fascinating, and this timely documentary also tackles the media\u2019s rabid obsession with scandal (and reveals the true power of their public influence when it comes to electing our governing officials).\r\n\r\n\u201cWeiner\u201d digs deep in its look at the professional and emotional damage that a political scandal can inflict. Directed by Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg, the film obviously started out as a celebratory highlight reel to feature the delight of a disgraced candidate\u2019s comeback. Early scenes in the film are cheerful, filled with boisterous scenes of neighborhood campaigning and percolating with a general \u2018yes we can\u2018 atmosphere. All of this suddenly comes crashing down as we watch, on film, the breakdown of a candidate\u2019s dreams, ideals, and a huge chunk of his personal life.\r\n\r\nWeiner is married to Hillary Clinton\u2019s long-time right hand woman, Huma Abedin. Huma is one smart, strong and tough woman, but it\u2019s seriously sad to watch a marriage nearing collapse under the weight of a sexting scandal. Whether intentional or not, this film heavily implies spousal emotional abuse. There are many instances where the camera captures a teary-eyed Abedin with her head hung low, crossing her arms and sadly staring off into space. I have much respect for the family for allowing the camera to hang around, even during some uncomfortably tense and very embarrassing personal moments.\r\n\r\nMost viewers will know that Weiner (aka \u2018Carlos Danger\u2019) is a trainwreck when it comes to his personal life and most know the outcome of the race for mayor, but this film is still completely mesmerizing. The man\u2019s a political survivor, driven with a sincere desire to work hard to make his city great. His policies and beliefs all make sense \u2014 so why can\u2019t this guy keep his stuff together and quit sending naughty photos and inappropriate texts? The most compelling scene in the entire film is when he\u2019s asked on camera if he thinks he \u201chas a problem.\u201d Weiner\u2019s candid response is as weighty as it is revealing.\r\n\r\nThe smart \u2018show don\u2019t tell\u2019 angle of this film makes it a winner. While it doesn\u2019t quite reach the heights of my personal \u2018Hall of Fame\u2019 docs like \u201cMan On Wire,\u201d \u201cGrizzly Man\u201d or \u201cThe Act of Killing,\u201d the film is clear, concise, well edited, and a prime example of what all documentaries should aspire to be.\r\n\r\n**A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com**","id":"579cfafc925141069c000d86","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/579cfafc925141069c000d86","movie_id":376261}

{"author":"talisencrw","content":"Though I tend to go for older science fiction, and, on top of that, from proven directors, two things sold this for me (and I ALMOST ended up seeing this at theatres as a result): John Goodman and J.J. Abrams--the first being solid in everything he does and the second with the Midas touch, especially when it comes to my favourite of genres. I really admired its originality. The cloying nature of the antagonist, the ambiguity of the unique situation and the way everything was tied together quite neatly left me both very satisfied as a cinephile and yearning for hopefully its inevitable sequel.","id":"57ad1821c3a36820610011f6","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ad1821c3a36820610011f6","movie_id":333371}
{"author":"iieeef","content":"What starts off as a beautifully shot, wholly engaging film is marred by a few jarring twists and unnecessary plot developments. Kevin and Sean are brothers who, from an early age, realize they have the gift of speed. They naturally are taken to running with the older Sean constantly referring to the younger Kevin as a tag-along. Of course this sparks in Kevin the desire to beat his brother, and so he pursues long-distance running with a fierceness of spirit and a refusal to ever give up. With a strong opening act, this film really just had to ride the tailwind to be successful. Throw Kevin a few losses, maybe a steamy love story that threatens to steal his attention,  and an eventual big win in the third act and it's hello, Rudy! But that's not where Director\/Writer Simon Hung takes us at all. \r\n\r\nAs the older Sean's life falls apart and he is reduced to a life of drug crime, Kevin's foolishness gets the better of him as well. What follows are several subplots of varying degrees of silly, including one that tries to pull off a Revenant style battle with a CGI wolf (unsuccessful), and another where someone's kidney is stolen on the black market. By the time we reach the 10,000 mile race of the title, the Director is so confused about what's important to the audience, that the film ends abruptly, leaving the earnest heart that was once at the forefront of this film inside the travel size ice chest with the black market kidney.","id":"58ca47a4c3a36841820085da","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ca47a4c3a36841820085da","movie_id":435797}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Adds a new perspective to the original film yet it retained the mystery.\r\n\r\nInitially it was called 'The Cellar', but later it became spin-off to 'Cloverfield'. It was a regular type screen narration, unlike the first film as a found footage style. But if you the original film fan, especially monster film fan, you might end in a disappointment. Because it was a psychological-thriller-mystery than the sci-fi-action-adventure.\r\n\r\nOnly the final act determines where and how it actually connects to the Cloverfield universe, yet not very evident other than the clue the title had given and the filmmakers insisted that is indeed from the same franchise. Because I felt, it was very close to other alien invasion films like 'Skyline' and 'Battle LA' or even the latest 'The 5th Wave' than the 'Cloverfield'.\r\n\r\nI surely enjoyed this film, like an another crazy bunker hideout theme and something which is quite similar to the recent 'Room'. Since they have revealed its association with the 'Cloverfield', I expected different kind which was actually insanely misled everybody. If there won't be a sequel, then the link between the two films are unnecessary, so I'm waiting for that. But still a very good film without those mix-ups. And I recommend you all to consider it as a one-off film in order to have a great watching experience.\r\n\r\nAnother limited cast film with barely a four characters in it and shot in a single location that cost just $15m, but earned in multiple folds. All the credit goes to the marketing tactics to tie it up with the 2008 blockbuster. It would have also done great independently, in the end everybody, including fans and filmmakers are happy for what it is now.\r\n\r\nThe suspense was so good, but it was carried out for too long. The third act picked up its pace like hell which was obviously anticipated since 'Cloverfield' hooked to it. When everybody was thinking of monsters, it is going to delivers differently and that's how the film fairs.\r\n\r\n7.5\/10","id":"576d7e939251410af900032b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/576d7e939251410af900032b","movie_id":333371}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"People are strange creatures. You can't always convince them that safety is in their best interest.\r\n\r\n10 Cloverfield Lane is directed by Dan Trachtenberg and collectively written by Josh Campbell, Matthew Stuecken and Damien Chazelle. It stars John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. Music is by Bear McCreary and cinematography by Jeff Cutter.\r\n\r\nMichelle (Winstead) awakes from a car crash to find she is in a locked underground shelter...\r\n\r\nFrom the off it has to be said that to know nothing about this film prior to viewing it will be an absolute bonus. For the rewards are plenty. Trachtenberg and his team have crafted a film that is tense from the get go, a piece that consistently has you wondering just what the hell is going on, not only are we puzzled by the three character dynamic in the shelter, particularly as regards Howard (Goodman), the proprietor of this particular shelter, but also just what has happened in the outside world? If anything? This only helps further the claustrophobic feel that's already brought about by the location setting of the tale.\r\n\r\nA key strength of it, is that it, via Michelle's mindset, coerces us viewers into feeling her unease, and yet conversely we rejoice at her resourcefulness. On the same side of the coin comes her relationship with the third party in the shelter, Emmett (Gallagher Jr), it grows honestly and offers hope in what looks to be a bleak situation. But of course as tale unfolds, things start to come together, edgily so, with little spurts of action, shocks and genuine dread, all building up to the big finale, the reveals. Which will either have you spitting feathers or cursing the makers for the routes taken...\r\n\r\nSuperbly acted by the three principals (it's great that some film makers still realise Goodman is a major talent), and technically impressive for sound and vision, this coiled spring thriller is a winner. 8.5\/10","id":"58812913c3a368145b0020b0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58812913c3a368145b0020b0","movie_id":333371}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A life changing game.**\r\n\r\nI am not a big fan of Mira Nair. But I like some of her films, particularly 'Amelia'. Because she usually prefers India and Indian subjects and cast as what she's. Outside that circle, she was not that successful, until now. It was a sport film, that revolved around chess game. Inspired by an incredible true story from the dark continent. It all happened less than ten years ago. Disney and ESPN together produced it. So when these two productions come together, you would know what to expect.\r\n\r\nSeeing the opening few minutes, it reminded me the recent New Zealand film 'The Dark Horse'. Kind of a similar film, but I was not that impressed with that. But this one was awesome. Simply a miracle. Like any fairy-tale from the Disney. She was not a princess, but in a way she turns to be one. Years ago when I reviewed 'Searching for Bobby Fischer', I said that was the film should be shown in the schools. Now add this title as well to the list.\r\n\r\nThe opening was the ending. Then followed the flashback, which went to the 4 years ago. Living in a slum of Katwe, a single mother raising her children, but not without their contribution to the family. Now the focus shifts to one of the family members, Phiona. Curiosity on her brother who disappears every day after sold out his goods leads her to a new path. That's when she discovers a game she had never heard of before. After learning the basics, she quickly picks up the rest of the game on her own and becomes a prodigy.\r\n\r\n> \u275dLosing teaches me how to play better.\u275e\r\n\r\nThis is like most of the true stories you have seen, but that's the truth as well in here. What might come later could impress you. Because it was not like she has a superpower, so she can clear her life path just like that. Honestly, the real test begins now for her, how she uses her gift. But it was her coach who understood the situation, and tried his best to push her further with the big tournaments, in the national and the international level. Not just her, there has been a team behind her. So the remaining is to reveal how far she would go, as well as the story of her struggling family.\r\n\r\nThey have got the cast perfectly. Everyone was brilliant. David Oyelowo was amazing, surely one of my favourite British actors for now. This is the second consecutive time he's making a such impression. Not long ago with 'A United Kingdom'. Definitely the Oscars is just a corner. And then Lupita Nyong'o, she was not the centre of the story, but had enough part and she excelled every bit of it. The rest of the actors, including the one who played Phiona was amazing. At the end credit, both the cinematic and the real life characters appeared. I felt that was a result of excitement, but liked it.\r\n\r\nThe sad part was why such films were ignored at the big stages! This is a must see film, especially if you have a kid(s) in the home, show it to them. Being the parents, uncle and aunt, that's one of the best thing you would do for them. Because no one knows when and where kids gets their confidence boost, inspiration or discovering a new path. You can't compare films with real life, even it was a biopic. But still the true story always remains a true story, even after they're compressed to 120 minutes. Particularly the Disney film gets rid of harsh parts, making a family friendly film. So watch it for a change, you have no other reasons, you could be impressed!\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"59cae0de9251412b98005478","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59cae0de9251412b98005478","movie_id":317557}

There is bad audio, continuity errors, hammy dialogue, some very bizarre choices in cinematography and the occasional scene of poor acting.\r\n\r\nThe story however (while following a fairly predictable family-friendly line) is totally engrossing. Chess may not be the most engaging spectator sport, but the journey of lead-character Phiona is a thorough one, and an intriguing side-step away from the usual Disney setting.\r\n\r\nDavid Oyelowo is particularly worth looking out for. He (unsurprisingly) gives a fantastic performance.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I personally recommend you give it a go._","id":"5844ceb392514169d90102eb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5844ceb392514169d90102eb","movie_id":317557}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"For those so-called devoted Tyler Perry fans out there wondering why it took so long to bring back their favorite sassy gun-toting grandma after a two-plus year absence from the big screen can feel some relief that America\u2019s acerbically gray-haired Queen of Quirkiness has arrived for her latest holiday-themed shtick (following the humbug dud known as 2013\u2019s \u201cA Madea\u2019s Christmas\u201d) in the generically goofy-minded comedy horror **Tyler Perry\u2019s Boo! A Madea Halloween**. Woefully witless and as appetizing as a box of stale Junior Mints the terribly contrived **Boo! A Madea Halloween** is a nightmarish experience and it has nothing to do with the nature of the ghosts-and-goblins seasonal spirit either. Indeed, **Boo! A Madea Halloween** screams of being a cruel trick for the mis-treat-ment of Perry enthusiasts eagerly willing to embrace this piece of throwaway holiday hokum.\r\n\r\nPerry, whose brief sabbatical leave from film-making has mainly been devoted to stepping up his various television projects, elects to go drag once again as he dusts off his frothy old ladies garb and grayish wig to bring his acid-tongued _Madea_ to life in yet another embarrassing and exhausting platform in sheer ridiculousness. The majority of Perry\u2019s fare, whether mired in silliness or seriousness, usually has a Christian-based foundation to accompany the robust \u201cslap-you-upside-the-head\u201d brashness that pushes across Perry\u2019s signature penchant for urban wayward wackiness. From a cinematic perspective the _Madea_-oriented movie franchise has been Perry\u2019s most consistent and financially artistic enterprise for the specialized audiences that get a raucous kick out of his over-the-top shenanigans.\r\n\r\nNaturally, **Boo! A Madea Halloween** is yet another convenient excuse for Perry to reintroduce the Southern slapstick garrulous granny to another shameless round of farcical mayhem where the straight shooter oldster recycles the same old gimmick\u2013threatening to hush the mouths of the pesky juveniles that get on her last nerve through preachy sermons and nonsensical action-packed chicanery. It appears that **Boo! A Madea Halloween** is an unlikely senior citizen _Ghostbusters_ knockoff where Perry gets to place the predictable mouthy Madea in idiotic situational \u201cHallelujah\u201d high jinks. In essence, the banal boofest that is _Madea\u2019s_ Halloween horror hoax is neither genuinely funny or refreshingly spooky but merely lame and forced in its masked mediocrity. Somehow Perry\u2019s off-kilter Madea and her two stereotypical sidekicks in Aunt Bam and Hattie (Cassie Davis and Patrice Lovely) along with the anemic satire of a few notable frightfests past and present plus the annoying hearty-party teens add up to nothing but a smashed jack-o-lantern of random, limping cheap chuckles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to snuggling up to the ballistic and bespectacled Madea\u2019s busty bra and house dresses Perry assumes the role of Brian, a worrywart father trying to contain the hormonal tendencies of his 17-year old daughter Tiffany (Diamond White). In general, Brian\u2019s pretty offspring and her equally fetching friends are curious about attending the Upsilon Theta Fraternity Halloween bash where you guessed it\u2026the scene where touchy-feely hot college guys are there for the taking. Brian\u2019s fatherly instincts is to shield Tiffany and her tag-a-long vixens from that male meat market on campus. Since Brian cannot guard Tiffany due to a business commitment he recruits honorary \u201cwarden\u201d Madea, the aforementioned Aunt Bam and Hattie (along with Perry\u2019s other persona in Joe) to watch over the tempting teen to ensure that she stays put in the household. Obviously it is going to be a task for the determined Tiffany to sneak away from the intrusive elders keeping a watchful eye on her. The unflappable Madea and her Preparation H posse are challenged by restraining the young beauty as she attempts to apply an assortment of pranks and other methods of distraction to throw off her geriatric guardians.\r\n\r\nOf course Tiffany is successful in eluding Madea\u2019s clutches and ends up at the Halloween bash after all. Thus, Madea and her old school associates realize the girl\u2019s deception and schemes to snatch Tiffany away from the high-wire costumed event hoping to return her home before Brian learns what has happened in their failed mission to keep Tiffany home-bound. Not only is Madea and her \u201cback-up muscle\u201d in Aunt Bam and Hattie not effective in retrieving Tiffany they bring additional chaos and confusion to the frat house in the process. Madea is dismissed from the Halloween frivolous function but not before the fraternity decides to get even with the elderly loudmouth party-pooper and her aged minions. Madea and her rowdy team are not only in hot water with the miffed mob of fratboys and their guests but she must battle the array of creepy agitators in ghouls, zombies, killers and other ominous spirits looking to tame matured wily women\r\n\r\n**Tyler Perry\u2019s Boo! A Madea Halloween** is nothing more than an aimless, gaudy goosebump of a farce that does not care to incorporate any kind of consideration for the Halloween celebration other than to serve as a shoddy showcase for Perry to parade out the insufferable Madea as well as other degrading characterizations in this relentlessly toothless romp. Perry\u2019s paper-thin direction and scripting is lazy, uneventful and just plain stillborn in conception. The cockeyed camaraderie among Perry\u2019s Madea, Davis\u2019s Aunt Bam and Lovely\u2019s Hattie is synthetic and mindless. The thought of these Halloween-havoc hags engaging in pseudo side-splitting discussions that range from whipping misbehaving minors to the legalization of marijuana comes off as desperately hapless for the sake of the transparent humor. Also, the continual religious-minded exclamations by Madea convincingly overstay their welcome.\r\n\r\nOne never gets the idea that the formulaic Boo! cannot just settle for a side dish of minimal jolts and jumps and just leave it at that level. Unfortunately, Perry lets this myopic material feel labored in its lackluster nuttiness while regurgitating the same old Madea\u2019s incredulous tics highlighted by nonsensical yelling, cringe-worthy bugged-out eyes and carefree slapping. The only ones that come off rather plausible in this comedic crappy costume caper is White\u2019s spoiled brat Tiffany and her on-screen galpal Aday (played by Liza Koshy). Otherwise, this dismal bump-and-jump laugher nary registers with crude grandma cursing, tepid off-balance jokes, weak sight gags, meathead himbos and vapid bimbos, stunt casting (YouTube sensation Yousef Erakat), servings of \u201cOh Lord\u201d exasperation and trendy inclusions of the day (twerking movements and creepy roaming clown sightings that have dominated the real-life news as of late).\r\n\r\nSure, _Madea\u2019s_ sophomoric antics have amassed an inexplicable following in the past but this tired and empty-headed retread is simply going through the makeshift motions.\r\n\r\n**Tyler Perry\u2019s Boo!

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The young arctic couple and their adventure.**\r\n\r\nIt was another film about life in the Arctic. That's wrong! Surely it sets in the Canadian Arctic region, but it was much more than a simple drama. As the story progress, you would come to know the depth of the film. It does not expand, but the characters become stronger. With unexpected twists and turns, the narration heads to the other end.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'War Witch' that nominated for the Oscars. What you learn from the title is about three persons, but there's a fourth. The father of one of the lovers. Except in the initial stage, the film is all about them. The young couple in a remote frozen town begins to witness their relationship breaking away because of one of them leaving the town very soon. With a brief breakup, they mend it up and then decides to face any obstacle together. Hence the adventure begins.\r\n\r\nThe financially struggling couple, plans to overcome the situation by taking the snowmobile to reach their destination. It was not an ordinary road trip you had seen in other films. In a vast deserted land, you never know what might happen any time. Till now it was a casual drama like that happen in anybody's life. But their trip brings to the film a different tone. The adventure with a little thrill. When they are about to catch in an unforeseen blizzard, they take a shelter in an unusual place. After that, everything is about to change for them forever.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing is the story. It was like someone's real life who are in the relationship and their daily activity. But the adventure changes everything. A perfect atmosphere to give away the secrets. Most of you would have already guessed it, though what it reveal, the way it reveals was good. Makes sense, every doubtful event that occurred before. But it was not designed to keep everything suspenseful for its viewers. So that makes us acceptable the film being what it is.\r\n\r\n> \u275dIf you hurt yourself, you hurt me.\u275e\r\n\r\nIndie films are commonly small budget, but it was good enough to enjoy quality. It was not anything about the environmental issue or the Arctic people's struggle. It was just a young lovers tale. Once I have got confused between literal and metaphor, what the film is actually trying to tell. With being a bear on one side and a trouble giving father another, I anticipated some kind of brief flashback to explain the stuffs. But that was never required once it opened up all in a straightforward narration.\r\n\r\nThis is a beautifully written film. For a small film, they really had some tough time shooting in a tough conditions. The locations were breathtaking. Especially in the second half. In those parts, many scenes were totally unexpected, contrast to the first half you have got used to. That change makes the film very interesting.\r\n\r\nApart the overall film, the end was decent. I don't think everybody would be happy with that. Even I was not sure, I'd liked the film or not after seeing that kind of conclusion. Something is sure that it might not be a perfect cinematic end as we're used to, definitely that's one of the possibilities in real life. If the end would have been compromised to satisfy its viewers, then the result too would have been much better. But I think the unusual and unexpected ending is much better than a clich\u00e9, any time.\r\n\r\nBoth the lead actors, Dane DeHaan and Tatiana Maslany were very good. The characters were not challenging, but the performing in the given tough conditions were. The entire film was about them, where the other characters come only for a very brief. It is worth a watch for them, despite it might not be their career best. They are being a couple on the screen is what striking the most. Because what you had thought about them, against the transformation of their roles in the next half, spices up the story.\r\n\r\nI have heard that they had used the real bear. I wondered how they did it being made on a tight budget. Simple and cutely done. Initially I thought it could be a fantasy. But that's the point the story had to hold back for the later part. This is one of those films gone unnoticed. Not every film has to be top notch. Telling the same story in a different atmosphere using its resources could work out sometime. Whatever. The film was not the bad for why it was ignored so far since its release. People not aware of its existence could be the reason and turning it down after seeing low rating. But I think if you are looking for a refresher from the regular cinema, this is the one to go for.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59ec9ad2c3a368535b00a039","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59ec9ad2c3a368535b00a039","movie_id":325373}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> It's something beyond a manhunt...\r\n\r\nI just want to review it as a film, so my take on this is pure based on the entertainment and technical aspect, not historical or the religious stuff.\r\n\r\nThe story was not bad, which is set in the Israel 33AD where a Roman man tells his story what he just went through. So the flashback begins, just like an unofficial sequel to 'The Passion of the Christ', the story continues after the crucifiction of Yeshua.\r\n\r\nSealed the tomb with the roman mark and guarded it by an armed force, the body of Yeshua goes missing. With the widespread speculation going around and the order from a higher authority, the Roman soldiers led by Clavius attempts to locate the body by following the hints. So the rest of the story is racing against the time where many unexpected and strange events follows.\r\n\r\nIt was a perfect setting for a tale like this. The characters were good, but in the end it certainly questions their actions based in what purpose. It was told from a Roman perspective and his transformation to what he ultimately believes.\r\n\r\nThe details were good while depicting the events. A simple narration with not so fancy stunts and others tricks, yet somewhere it loses its realistic approach to the supernatural thing.\r\n\r\nSince they did not mention anything related to the real account, it is fairly debatable yet not worth debating seriously. Because different people have different opinion regarding religious, historical and entertainment angle. But absolutely this film is target every one of them.\r\n\r\nThis kind of films is worth watching, because each writer, filmmaker gives us a different take on the person who is behind the world's largest faith. So 'liked it' or 'didn't like' should come after the view. Though it was a quite enjoyable film.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"5752e743925141187e001e8d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5752e743925141187e001e8d","movie_id":335778}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> They both are getting closer professionally as well as family.\r\n\r\nWhen I liked the first movie, I wanted a sequel and now they made one for it that I liked even better than the original. I don't think Ice Cube's solo performance could have pulled the crowd in, the impact was because of the Kevin Hart's presence, he really rocks. He's doing some awesome movies lately, and he's the best sidekick and comedian available for now in Hollywood, just like Simon Pegg in England.\r\n\r\nOnce again a movie is totally underrated, especially by foul mouthed film critics. Trust me, this film is much better than what they say. If you liked the first, you'll surely going to enjoy it as well. I'm confident the rating will recover in the later days once the regular people rent it. A simple follow-up story, but it was the comedy that lifted this film. The two cops soon-to-be bros-in-law goes to Miami on a job, but the case they're working connects with others, so they join the local force to take down the gang behind it.\r\n\r\nWho needs a spoof film for it, the movie mocks its own characters by saying 'a low budget Jackie Chan' for Keng Jeong. Apart from the comedies, the action sequences were very impressive. Olivia Munn was a great addition and I believe she would hangouts here for the next. Yep, I want the third movie and I'm hoping it to be even more stylish kick-ass action-comedy. So just retain the director and writers, after the first two films, I got high hope on them.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"5729fa089251416595000eea","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5729fa089251416595000eea","movie_id":323675}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Rather a 20th century tale!**\r\n\r\nYou have seen films like this often. This is where a chick film meets art. Art means not the flick full of inspiration, message, awareness. But the presentation was so pleasant. The screenplay carefully picked the right events, and the dialogues were good. The book fanatics would go and look for the original source it was adapted from. But the truth is it was an originally written screenplay, and that's why it got a nomination at the recent Oscars. Another way to say, it inspired by the director's own childhood life, being raised by his mother and sister.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a single mother, whose teenage son is struggling to blend with the world. Then they have two roommates, one a woman in her 20s and a middle aged man. Beside a girl of her son's age visits regularly and sometimes secretly. So how all these people influence in the boy's life is the story that revealed. His mother being from different generation and not understanding the present world, which was the year 1979, where the film sets in.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'Beginners', yet another unique film. Thematically there's nothing special, though it was carved with the excellent bunch of actors made the difference. I'm not sure the title was perfect for what the film narrated. Yes, if it was Annette Bening's Dorothea's story, then it justifies. But the story does not have one perspective of narration. All the main characters like Bening, Elle, Greta, Crudup and Zumann, shared screen equally. So, instead I would have preferred the title, '20th Century Tale'.\r\n\r\nGreta kind of reminded me Kristen Stewart with the hair like that. Two hours long drama with some funs. Really a good film. The topics it brings in for discussion were interesting, especially which is in the current era. Films like this should be watching. It is about the life, people with different characters and ambitions.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59b1eab3c3a3682c2208b442","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59b1eab3c3a3682c2208b442","movie_id":342737}
{"author":"iheardthatmoviewas","content":"The year is 1979 and Dorothea Fields finds herself in her 50s raising a teenage boy, Jaime, while running a house in Santa Barbara that is always going through renovations. Jaime\u2019s father is not in the picture but who needs a father when your mother rents rooms to a handful of particular individuals ranging from different generations.  Director Mike Mills casts three powerful actresses, Annette Bening, Greta Gerwig and Elle Fanning, to fill the roles of the different women in Jaime\u2019s life and they help create three compelling female characters that pulls you in. The problem? These three exceptional characters are subsided for a coming-of-age narrative that fails to compare to the women that help raised it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Set in Santa Barbara, the film follows Dorothea Fields (Annette Bening), a determined single mother in her mid-50s who is raising her adolescent son, Jamie (newcomer Lucas Jade Zumann, in a breakout performance) at a moment brimming with cultural change and rebellion. Dorothea enlists the help of two younger women in Jamie's upbringing - via Abbie (Greta Gerwig), a free-spirited punk artist living as a boarder in the Fields' home, and Julie (Elle Fanning), a savvy and provocative teenage neighbor.\r\n\r\nBeing a single parent is tough, it is even tougher when your son is a teenager dealing with romances, the freeing energy of punk music and playing games which entails panting real hard while someone pulls on their diaphragm. After a trip to the hospital, Annette Bening\u2019s Dorothea realizes she might not be able to raise her son by herself and requests the aide of the different women in Jaime\u2019s life. Dorothea does not need help with the physical needs of raising a child in providing shelter and nutrition but the psychological needs of raising in a child in providing the knowledge about life, women and what it means to be a man. Each female was born in a different generation and dealing with their own issues that life has handed them and this leads to Jaime becoming that much more confused about life.\r\n\r\nAnnette Bening is absolutely fantastic as Dorothea and you grow a connection with her because Dorothea isn\u2019t developed as a motherly character but as a human. It isn\u2019t all Dorothea\u2019s fault as she was raised during the Depression as Jaime loves to points out. She put a barrier around her and her son when his father left and this is shown through her moments of conservatisms despite being a free spirit of sorts. She tasks these females with a job that she should be doing but that doesn\u2019t mean she is taking a step from the spotlight. She joins them to a trip to a punk rock club so she could not only understand her son but these females as well.\r\n\r\nThe first to tackle the challenge of raising Jaime is Greta Gerwig\u2019s Abbie who is influenced by feminism, punk music and photography. Abbie uses the first two influences to help guide Jaime into an understanding of what it means to be a man. As titles such as Our Bodies, Our Selves and Sisterhood is Powerful find a way onto Jaime\u2019s lap and words such as clitoris stimulation and menstruating find a way into Jaime\u2019s ears, Abbie\u2019s attempts to help Jaime define what a man is by allowing herself define herself through a the perceptive of past males in her life.\r\n\r\nThis is a trend that could be found in all three women as Ellie Fanning\u2019s Julie uses her promiscuity to rebel against her therapist mother and the world. Ellie, who is closest to Jaime\u2019s age, is the last one to tackle the task given to her and if she wasn\u2019t already sneaking into Jaime\u2019s bed every night, she probably would have avoided the task altogether. Jaime yearns for Ellie and she informs him that he just wants the idea of her. Jaime is confused, after all he is a teenage boy, and all the hormones and feminist literature is not helping.\r\n\r\nThe definition of what a man and woman is changes every generation. My great grandfather would tell me that a man buys a woman flowers, write her love letters and a bunch of other things males in 2016 no longer consider tasks a man does. Three different females are attempting to define these terms through the scope of their generation and how their generation saw it and unfortunately, majority of those definitions are no longer validated for Jaime\u2019s generation.\r\n\r\n20th Century Women takes things one step further and gives us backstories and what is to come of everyone living within the house. There is no real problem with this except for the fact that these backstories don't offer any real reflection which adds to the frustration that the film does not have an arc, well not one I could point out. At one point, I thought the film was concluding as we learn what is to come of Dorothea early on. I was later surprised that there was still an hour left within the film. Dabbled with nostalgia, 20th Century Women would have made for a better coming-of-age if the film decided to follow our titular women than just a boy that connected the three together.","id":"581bbe36925141120700024d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/581bbe36925141120700024d","movie_id":342737}
{"author":"in_the_crease","content":"*** This review may contain spoilers ***\r\n\r\nI was indifferent to the first TMNT movie. It was okay; it could have been better. It could have also been far worse.\r\n\r\nSo, there was some apprehension going into TMNT: Out of the Shadows, because, traditionally, sequels were worse than their parent films.\r\n\r\nWell, Turtles wasn't. The second film is actually much better than the first. It still has hard- to-digest action sequences right out of Michael Bay's wet dreams, but this one also had some heart. It had a theme. \r\n\r\nBeing a teenager is difficult enough without, one, having to shoulder the burden of saving the city from an evil ninja, and, two, being forced to hide from the very society they are protecting. The TMNT concept practically begs to touch on things like teen angst, and the feeling of being an outcast that almost all teens feel at some point. But, because they're mutant turtles, this would of course be magnified 10 times. \r\n\r\nBut the franchise, in its various incarnations, hardly addresses this. But the new Turtle film does. It appeals to the sensibilities of people who recall the awkwardness of being a teenager. This movie actually says something.\r\n\r\nThere are some flaws, however. Shredder and Krang meet for the first time, Krang proposes an alliance, Shredder accepts. At no point does Shredder flip out while a talking brain rambles on about his plans for world domination. At no point does Shredder question Krang. He is a banished evil warlord. Why would Shredder trust him?\r\n\r\nMegan Fox, unfortunately, is still a thing.\r\n\r\nWould have been nice to have Casey Jones truer to his original character.\r\n\r\nBut where the film works is in the script, and, particularly, the scenes with the Turtles, sans their human friends.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's Rocksteady and Bebop. We 80's kids have been waiting 26 years to have them on screen, and, when it finally happens, it doesn't disappoint. There's an interesting dynamic at play with them: While the Turtles yearn for acceptance and to be human, Rocksteady and Bebop, former humans, are happy to be monsters.\r\n\r\nI guess the ooze is always on greener on the other side.\r\n\r\nBut a pretty good Turtle movie overall, and a lot of fun.","id":"58d2acf6c3a3681289000dd2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58d2acf6c3a3681289000dd2","movie_id":308531}

It was a must buy for my collection since I had the first movie already\u00a0and the kids wanted to see it anyway\u00a0so yesterday when the kids where at my place we sat down to watch it.\r\n\r\nIt is definitely a movie for the younger audience. My two youngest kids had quite a few laughs while watching it and there was one ore two that entertained even me.\r\n\r\nOtherwise this movie is a rather messy concoction of loads and loads of CGI, action, stunts, cheesy comments and silly acting. It borders on\u00a0being a slapstick movie.\u00a0It is rather unbelievable but Megan Fox was the one of the main actors that did the most serious performance in the movie.\r\n\r\nThe enjoyment of this movie is pretty much the CGI action, ludicrous stunts, primarily by the turtles, plenty of explosions and gadgets. The turtles garbage truck was rather fun for example. Silly but fun.\r\n\r\nAs an adult be prepared to leave you brain in idle and try to enjoy the cinematic magic that went into this movie.

{"author":"losman94","content":"Terrifier is a gory movie with a sadistic killer clown that revels in mutilating his victims in creative ways and willing to use any kind of improvised weapon as well as one not often seen in slasher movies. The movie makes effective use of practical effects and the gory murders are graphic enough to make you know this movie means business. David Howard Thornton stars as Art the Clown and his portrayal is devilishly effective as a villain who is mute and must use facial gestures to express himself in his ghoulish clown makeup. The story is the usual cat and mouse variety but this film is more about watching Art capture, torture and mutilate his victims. Terrifier is an effective and bloody slasher film that follows the usual formula of 1980's horror films and has crowned Art the Clown as one of the new faces of horror.","id":"5d34e0e22f8d090388d4540e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d34e0e22f8d090388d4540e","movie_id":420634}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> When the cops and the bad guys hunting the same duo.\r\n\r\nA simple crime-thriller involving the father-daughter duo running away from the cops and thieves. It was based on the novel of the same name, but kind of feels like another version of Nicola Cage's 2012 film, 'Stolen'. In this the father at any cost protects his daughter. He was actually a heist planner and when his latest bidder was murdered after successfully accomplishing the heist, he and his daughter was targeted by some unknown men. So they're on the run, but how it will solved are told in the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nTo me the film was okay, but the same old stuffs with the new cast and locations and a bit altered storyline. So nothing new in it, but somewhat entertaining. That's the point you know remade, rebooted or copied, all matters if it is boring. Anyway, I was not expecting a masterpiece. But with a concept like 'heist designer', the film was utterly wasted for running and chasing clich\u00e9 stuffs. Instead, it should have had made a better film by focusing on the main character's special gift.\r\n\r\nThere were none great stunt sequences, but there were some black humours in it, since Vince Vaughn is not known as an action hero. But the character and the story suited him very well and the other side Hailee Steinfeld was not bad either. The film is not worth recommending, but if you choose it, I won't stop you as it wasn't going to hurt anybody.\r\n\r\n5\/10","id":"57c8b17c92514148e90009fa","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c8b17c92514148e90009fa","movie_id":257440}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A Cool kind, but suddenly feeling the real life pressure!\r\n\r\nAnother teen comedy-drama, precisely to say a coming-of-age theme based on the novel of the same name. It is not from the big production house, but the well known faces make it a worth a watch and their performances were too not bad. The tale of a teen tomboy girl Lucy, whose father visits home often who works in Canada and her mother is an easy going type. It's about a time for her sexual exploration and the first choice is her best buddy Kenny. But quickly the things around changes which forces her to opt the life she wants and what follows is how it all shapes up before bringing a curtain to the narration.\r\n\r\nI felt like wanting to give it a better rating, at least it deserves a decent respect, but narration had lots of up and down. That does not matter, even for how a tale begins, but the ending should have been a better one where I slightly disappointed with it. Sarah Bolger looked solid, totally one man show you could say. Maybe that is how the story was designed, but that did not stand a chance to impress me, because I thought it leaned excessively on her alone leaving other characters less developed. Anyway, it could also be said like this that it was her story which lacked the good support.\r\n\r\nIt is not just a coming-of-age film, but when you look at how the story ends, that's kind of self-discovery. Maybe the girl was caught between the teenhood and adulthood, especially in the climax it leaped forward too long. The hardest part is the R rating for a teen film, though there were none nudes, even in the sex scenes, but the film topic itself highly influenced by those like experiencing and moving-on in the life. So the film is not worth going after for a watching by someone's recommendation, only when you get an opportunity without much options you could try it.\r\n\r\n5.5\/10","id":"57c8b1cfc3a3685bec000a67","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c8b1cfc3a3685bec000a67","movie_id":257440}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**They are back with even more stimulated to fight the crime.**\r\n\r\nAnother great addition to the franchise, I completely enjoyed. The first thing is the pace, it was so fast, from opening to the end, non-stop actions and comedies. I regret that I was not able to watch this in digital 3D, other than that, this is a wonderful film for TMNT fans. I know, some people downgrading it, but don't believe them, it is just a fine film if not an awesome as I'm praising, particularly keeping in my mind the common people. So watch this for entertainment and it will deliver for sure.\r\n\r\nThere are some flaws, but I did not care about them, because it was not a documentary film or even a sci-fi film, it's just a fun-action film. So everything was aimed to bring laughs and it did successfully. If you go with science, then this is a nonsense film. Anyway, the vfx was very impressive, the CGI characters looked even better than the previous one. Don't compare it with the DC or Marvel's films, it is setting up its own trend. Like those new additions, Rhino and Warthog characters were seems more like reading a comic book, straight outta from the sketches.\r\n\r\nExcellent follow-up and expecting another sequel in the next two years. The director of 'Earth to Echo' did a great job, and also all the actors. Little disappointed was the villain. I expected some strong confrontation between the heroes and the bad guys which was a let down. Though, all the stunt sequences were well designed. Those clich\u00e9s like a mad scientist, alien invasion, hole in the sky et cetera, did not stop me from having a good time. Surely I would watch it one more time, just for entertainment, that's what this film is good at. I suggest you as well to watch it if you're seeking the same.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"58013c31c3a36848e6000b4c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58013c31c3a36848e6000b4c","movie_id":308531}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A film director, his actress and her driver!**\r\n\r\nI kind of felt deja vu. I don't remember the title, but it was similar to this from the recent time, where it revolves around a taxi driver and a woman who wanted to be an actress. In this the distinct feature was the Beatty's role. After returning from the retirement, he's in business now. Directing it, as well as in one of the prominent characters. An 80 years old and still has left lots of spark in him. It was really a great comeback, yet the film is not fully convincing. Even though an enjoyable one, particularly for the awesome performances by all.\r\n\r\nThe film was about Howard Hughes, but I don't know whether it is a biopic or just inspired by. Anyway, it was in the backdrop of Hollywood film industry. The story takes place between three characters, including a driver, film director and a wanted to be an actress. Triangular romance, but not exactly a romance film. Everything was drama, on the struggles between their professions. Often the narration jumps off to Hughes other business affairs. Overall, it comes back to the original path and takes us to the conclusion.\r\n\r\nA very slow screenplay. I'm used to such kind of narration, so I did not find any hard to finish it off. But it won't be same for others, especially if you are not interested in what the film plot deals with. And it is over two hours long. It covered everything it wanted to tell us. They should have avoided them, to make the film a bit quick which would have worked in its favour. Beatty is a very conscious man. Look at the Oscars, he knew the error, but while having a doubt, his partner hurried and announced the winner. I hope he makes another film very soon and stun everybody who criticised this one.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"59519952c3a3680d7301190c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59519952c3a3680d7301190c","movie_id":291328}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"You are driving on the road, following the traffic rules and yet, you meet with an accident because some other person chose to drive recklessly. Vil Ambu is based on a similar train of thought \u2014 our lives are decided not just by our own choices but also by the actions of others, who might not even realise the impact that their decisions are having on our lives.\r\n\r\nThe film revolves around two young men \u2014 Arul (Harish Kalyan) and Karthi (Sri). The two have different upbringings. Arul is your normal middle-class guy, with a father who wants him to be practical and choose a routine career even though he is passionate about photography. Karthi hails from a poor family and grows into a petty thief. In the first half, we see how events in Karthi's life affect Arul's life \u2014 his bike is smashed, he misses an interview, he is suspected for a drug peddler and worse, ends up in lock-up when he is lured by Siva (Harish Uthaman), a criminal, with promise of cash, unaware that he is planning a robbery. In the meantime, Karthi finds love when Poongodi (Samskruti), the school-going daughter of Sekar (Nandhakumar), a local politician, starts wooing him. But, Arul's descent into despair continues. He is released on bail but shame haunts him and he cannot find Siva, who has vanished into thin air, and who is his only chance of clearing his name. But Arul's actions start to have an impact on Karthi's life. His luck begins to run out after the love affair is discovered by Sekar. Soon, the couple are on the run, but the lives of Karthi and Arul are once again intertwined. Can the two come out of their problems?\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting premise and there are elements that work well. In a normal film involving two heroes, we always get to a point where their lives crisscross, but here that doesn't happen. Arul and Karthi are blissfully unaware of the other's existence. The characters are also well-written and performed impressively by both Harish Kalyan and Sri. Debutant director Ramesh Subramanian also manages to sustain the tension in this tale and we care about the fate of these characters. There is also some laughter, courtesy Yogi Babu, who is turning out to be the new-age Senthil.\r\n\r\nBut the director doesn't take full advantage of the novelty of the premise. We get sub-plots that are routine (the friction between Arul and his father) and unnecessary (Sekar feeding off the rivalry between two of his party leaders), coincidences that become too much to take after a point (the all-too convenient climax, for example), and romantic tracks that stretch patience and plausibility (one, between Arul and Nithya (Srushti), his college mate, and the other between Arul and Kanagu (Chandini), a slum-dweller). He even contradicts the entire premise of the film when a character remarks that it is God who writes the destiny of the good while the bad write their own fate. It is this lack of conviction that pulls down Vil Ambu despite its lofty ambitions.","id":"56ebec3092514143fc002067","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56ebec3092514143fc002067","movie_id":349732}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"'You're so easy to love' reads a wall hanging in the apartment of Bala and Priya, the leads of Zero. It is a killer in-joke in a film that deals with the trauma that follows for these two characters who do not have any idea of what is about to happen because of their romance. He is a social worker with a successful lawyer for a father. She is an orphan. They have married against the wishes of his father, who has a valid reason for his reservations about this match. Priya's long-dead mother, Devi had become mentally unstable during her pregnancy to such an extent that even her husband had to leave her. Bala's father is apprehensive that Priya, too, might become crazy.\r\n\r\nIf anything, debutant director Shiv Mohaa is ambitious. He could very easily have turned this construct into a horror film, but he reaches for more. He spins out a Biblical fantasy that starts at the very beginning \u2014 the birth of the universe, and races towards a situation that could destroy the balance in the universe.\r\n\r\nThe director keeps things very much ambiguous in the first half. Even though we see that Bala (Ashwin Kakumanu) and Priya (Sshivada) are clearly in love with each other, we can sense that things are off-kilter. Bala keeps running into Solomon (JD Chakravarthy), who speaks to thin air but maintains that he is speaking to his dead wife Andrea. Priya turns real nasty when she is called a thief in a store. She sleepwalks. She hears noises. She gets visions. Of a white serpent. Of her mother taking her into another world, a world that has white women roaming about in a daze. Is it the loneliness at home (she is a university rank holder who says she is content being at home) that is playing a trick on her? Is she imagining these things because she has read her dead mother's diaries and is influenced by those writings? Is she really becoming mentally unstable like her mother, just as Bala's father feared?\r\n\r\nEven though we are soon told that the answer is none of the above, for a while, these thoughts stop us from predicting what might happen next. Zero is certainly that rare film where the audience is unsure where it will go next. The weirdness in the scenes are, at times, spine-chilling. Like in the scene where Priya is seen talking to Bala and the doorbell rings and she opens the door to find Bala standing there! The scene turns even more bizarre when she finds herself seeing four to five figures who all look like Bala. And when the phone rings, guess who it is on the other line!\r\n\r\nThe filmmaking in these portions is also solid. The film has a surprisingly large number of tight close-up shots and these superbly convey the helplessness of the two characters. The actors are perfect. Ashwin Kakumanu's low-key performance acts as a superb counterpoint to Sshivada's intense turn. The latter is a role that demands a real actress and we can see why the director chose this under-appreciated actress and not a star. She is excellent and shifts her expression from sheer terror to apprehension to vulnerability in a few seconds and sometimes all at once. Even Ravi Raghavendra and Thulasi are perfectly cast.\r\n\r\nIt is only in the second half that Zero's minuses become evident. Once we realise that there is a supernatural element at work, the film loses out on suspense. And while Shiv Mohaa's script actually clearly delineates the events that happen, we somehow begin to get the feeling that things are getting too messy and complicated. Even Solomon's character, which is built up quite a bit as an intriguing one, turns into something of a routine.\r\n\r\nAnd once the fantasy element starts to take over the plot, the events, involving a likely end of the world due to a demonic force, feel somewhat similar to that of the underrated 2014 horror film Ra. While that film was bold enough to end on a nihilistic note, Zero sticks to its romantic outlook. Somehow, the latter view doesn't feel satisfying. But most importantly, as the ambition of the plot keeps getting bigger and bigger, the film struggles to match up to it visually. By the time the film ends, we begin to feel that this story might have worked even better as a novel. Perhaps, we all have our own versions of God, Satan, Adam, Eve and Lilith in our heads that whatever that we see on a large screen might not be as impressive.","id":"5703697dc3a36822cc0007f7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5703697dc3a36822cc0007f7","movie_id":349200}
{"author":"Linda Robinson","content":"Stuxnet was malware that flashed around the world via Microsoft computers, triggering arbitrary BSODs and random reboots. In 2010 cybersecurity firms captured and began analyzing the worm. Stuxnet (name derived from merging two random lines in the code) had digital certificates. Digital certificates require biometrics (human identification) and pass codes. But Stuxnet could attain access without that. It ominously coded multiple zero days exploit. Symantec's investigators see maybe one a year, looking at thousands of lines of code. Stuxnet had four. As we learn in the documentary, it also had undoubtedly stolen product identity codes for PLCs (programmable logic controls) from Siemens. Where were these PLCs? Installed on centrifuges at Natanz, an Iranian nuclear site. And the game's afoot. Whose program? To what purpose? Gibney does an excellent job of gearing us up for the technowizardry with hunter\/seekers Eric Chien and Liam O'Munchu (Symantec) as geek guides to the nation-state business of cyber espionage and, as General Michael Hayden, former CIA and NSA director calls it, the \"hideously classified\" world of cyber weaponry. We meet the journalists, bench players and sideline government officialdom who were not a part of, or even aware of, Stuxnet. The documentary is a mild, entertaining but serious call to start a dialogue about cyber weapons and deployment of same. How do countries begin to arbitrate treaties regarding use of life-threatening coding? Filmed well, the effects shrouding the unnamed informant are great viewing. The on-camera personnel are well-chosen, entertaining and as informative as they're able to be. There are enough tech buzzwords to keep nontechs like me interested, and enough about how dangerous coding with a mission to DISRUPT DEGRADE DESTROY can be for those of us who count on critical infrastructure systems.","id":"578d91ba9251413fa400e330","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/578d91ba9251413fa400e330","movie_id":380808}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**For Pete, home is where Elliot is.**\r\n\r\nI saw the '77 film prior to this so that I'm not going to miss anything if the upgradation was done in this new version. That was a quite okay film, so do this one. The difference between two was mainly the technology, but there's a major surge on all departments. Somewhat this looked more enjoyable than the old one. Visually very good, all the actors are great and so the locations, but the story was too short, not the film. It was over a 90 minute long and the entire film looked like an introduction. So there were no developments, everything was just like a beginning. That means the sequel could become a great adventure or it should be.\r\n\r\nThe five year old boy Pete, who lost in the wood after the car with his parents met a mishap, is raised by a dragon named Elliot. Now, eleven, meets some people from the nearby town who came with an agenda. It's like he got everything back what he had lost 6 years ago. Followed by misunderstanding and the human interference in the Elliot's enclosure, the chaos unleash and thrilling final act proceeds before the narration concludes in a style.\r\n\r\nThe kid who played Pete looked some kind of related to Sarah Snook, but he was good and so the others. The film was not good as I was expecting. The box office success was not that great comparing with other Disney films. So the sequel is in doubt, yet the story had ended with a wide open. I am sure you will enjoy watching it, because everything was so pleasant, but only a few people would like it at the end. I don't know if you are one, but definitely worth a try.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"58446892925141676400c715","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58446892925141676400c715","movie_id":294272}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Texting, shopping and Ghosting!**\r\n\r\nThis film was different. My bad, I did not quite get the title at first. I misunderstood it. I thought it was like a Shopaholic theme, a person with a shopping addiction. Then what I saw was different, and somewhere in the narration it explains what the title meant.\r\n\r\nThe real challenge watching it is the slow moving storyline. Dull and silent on most of the parts. But the mix of fantasy, like supernatural and regular drama brings interesting fact us to stay with it. Though the most of the film was about texting and shopping. I even thought does it any way connected to Stewart's previous film 'Clouds of Sils Maria'. Because there's something where both the films syncs with.\r\n\r\nDespite being a bit boring film, Kristen Stewart is the reason it is watchable. Her performance was good, but again the mystery about the unexplainable things holds us as well. Definitely a watchable film, but not an entertaining film that you are looking for on a weekend. I'm not sure who is the target audience, but surely less people will think it is a fine film. So I hope you choose it carefully.\r\n\r\n_4\/10_","id":"598ca58a9251411078000815","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/598ca58a9251411078000815","movie_id":340676}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The secret life of being somebody's Pet!**\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw Dominic Monaghan was pretty impressive in 'The Millionaire Tour'. This film was not bad. But it kind of reminds other titles like 'Tusk', 'Eyes of my Mother' et cetera. Only thematically. The screenplay should have been improved by extending more dramatic events. At present, it was simple, though the twists were the saviours. Not the mind blowing twists, but for a small storyline like this, everything justified. I liked how film characters switched nature of their roles while story progressing. That was nicely designed characters for a thriller which added a bit of mystery flavour.\r\n\r\nThe character Seth was really interesting one. Drawing a story out of him lacked depth in the later parts. Especially after the first twist revealed. The second half was unexpected, but also that's where the narration stared to fall off the track. One of the reasons was predictable. Though enjoyable film, until the finale. I thought it was overall a better film than I expected, but the end was not any good. Too clich\u00e9. You can easily spot they are interested in a sequel, so they kept it open. But closed conclusion would have made it a decent film.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"595198eec3a3680d730118bd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/595198eec3a3680d730118bd","movie_id":353979}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Is your cell phone safe to make a transparency?\r\n\r\nUsually the films based on the dinner party associate with either family or the friends reunion and sometimes business related affair. But there's always a reason for such gathering like it might be a wedding, funeral, anniversary, a school reunion, getting a job or promotion, victory celebration et cetera. In this film, it was some long time friends meet which seems its their regular thing to do often. This tale covers one such fine evening to reveal what they actually do. A limited cast and one night event based film that cleverly and cautiously covers sensitive topics of the married life and trust of the friendship.\r\n\r\nIt has been almost a year since my last Italian film and now I'm happy for choosing this. I was not certain that I would like it till I saw it. So I would say same to you that see it first and then judge the product. This is really a good comedy-drama with a dark tone. We all adapted the modern way of life and gadgets makes so easy to accomplish things around us. In that, cell phones might come the first. Carrying it all the time became only next to wearing clothes, surely an artificial\/digital sense of man. It also has some flaws, like it may land you in troubles as it's a part of AI, not human. I think it is easy to forecast a man's future by checking out his phone rather than his horoscope.\r\n\r\nSeven friends, including three married couples and one single man gather for a dinner party. They have been doing it for a very long time and that's where they all can share each others current life affair. Having some laughs and serious discussions, it defines the strength of their relationship. Every occasions won't be the same, there's always a first time for everything. That's how the event comes crashing out.\r\n\r\nWhile the party was going smooth, unexpectedly a game emerges that they all must place their phones on the table to prove they have no secrets from each other. Incoming and outgoing calls, texts, emails, everything must be heard by everyone at the table. What do you think would happen? Before saying anything, just place yourself in that position and do you think you can get away with a clean slate? Obviously tough to answer that, only practical observation would bring the result.\r\n\r\n> \"He's seeing a therapist, not a whore! Come on!\"\r\n\r\nEverytime when there's an alert for an incoming call or message, the atmosphere gets more tense and as a viewer I went blinkless. It is not about what people hid from others, it is the reaction in the room when their secret was exposed. This is when adults become teenagers who try to explain the stuff when their parents find out their secrets. And so the friends become complete strangers. Because friends must back each other in the bad times, but in this scenario, it was totally out of the proportion regarding their action. Okay, if we push away the friendship, then how's the married one should take it. Feels very simple, since everyone involved in something, it has turned out to be a complicated affair.\r\n\r\nLike I said I've seen plenty of similar themed films, but this one was something unique in a simple way. There's a vast difference between what do you witness in the opening compared to how it concludes. A bad mouth can spoil a beautiful occasion, but now it is avoided since people learnt to shut their mouth. Just remember the film 'August: Osage County' and this film was no way close to it as a story, but developed to the next gen, the digital troubles the mankind had set to face. This film revealed how much a cell phone would cause trouble, then think what would happen with the robots of the tomorrow. Surely in 20-30 years from now, a similar film will be made with the bots.\r\n\r\nAt some point, I thought it might be the Italian version of the 'Coherence' for inclusion of lunar eclipse in the plot. I'm not going to say anything about that, you'll get it in your watch. There's no end twist, but it was an unexpected final scene. By then you will understand the meaning of the title. Awesome screenplay and well performed actors, this is one of the best films of the year so far. This is not a sci-fi or a thriller or a visual spectacular, but a smart little drama and I'm sensing that somebody might consider it for a remake. I know everyone won't like as much I did, but I won't end my review without recommending it. If you like talk movies, sure you does enjoy it.\r\n\r\n8.5\/10","id":"5787ddce92514131c70018ab","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5787ddce92514131c70018ab","movie_id":381341}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"The infectiously whimsy and adventurous **Pete\u2019s Dragon** undergoes a polished millennial-style rebirth for today\u2019s kiddies not fortunate enough to be alive when the 1977 live-action animated musical blueprint made its charming, impressionable impact for youngsters of all ages back in the day. The festive and frolicking Disney flourishes are applied to co-writer\/director David Lowery\u2019s re-imagination of an impish boy and his devoted dragon. There is an even balance of refreshing nostalgia and modern-day spryness and magical sentiment that hovers over this engaging family fable remake from the polyester period. Lowery (2013\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t Them Bodies Saints\u201d) and screenwriters Toby Halbrooks and Malcolm Marmorstein pack some vibrant punch of wonderment into this children\u2019s tale of gentle mischievousness. Sure, the simplistic approach to the storytelling feels like a step-by-step progression experienced in a majority of child-friendly escapist entertainment. Still, **Pete\u2019s Dragon** is steady in its gentle precision for homespun high jinks. \r\n\r\nWhether appreciating this Disney classic from four decades ago or relishing in Lowery\u2019s current contemplative spectacle one will agree that the heart and soul of this sweet and uplifting narrative remains true to the main factors involved: the runaway (now orphaned) boy Pete and his trusty creature companion Elliot. In fact, it is just as instrumental that the adult presence in **Pete\u2019s Dragon** make an impacting impression as well because this exposition should cater to the delicate sensibilities in us all whether as a curious tyke or reflective grown-up.\r\n\r\nOrphaned and alone, 10-year old Pete (Oakes Fegley) had become a wild child in the deep woods. What was looking pretty grim for Pete in terms of loneliness, abandonment and despair was soon cured when he ended up befriending a giant green furry high-flying dragon named Elliot. For the most part the imposing Elliot served as Pete\u2019s surrogate parent while ensuring protection and friendship for the parent-less prepubescent. There is no question about the dependency that Pete and his dragon Elliot share in loving dependency. The scenic wooded haven serves as the treasured playground for the playful, nature-loving tandem.\r\n\r\nEnter the father-daughter duo of Mr. Meacham (Robert Redford) and Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard). Both strangely have an eerie connection to Pete\u2019s and Elliot\u2019s existence without realizing it. Meacham had been telling engagingly colorful stories to the local children about a mysterious dragon existing in the Northwest Pacific woods. As for Grace she happens to be employed as a Park Ranger for the site of the mentioned woods her father constantly references in his repetitive stories. Soon Grace will encounter the disheveled Pete who is more than willing to share his adventures of living in the thick woods with his massive dragon buddy Elliot. This all seems rather intriguing to Grace because Pete\u2019s description of Elliot is curiously similar to the fictional monster that Meacham cites to the spellbound youngsters. Whatever the case may be regarding Pete and his personalized plight this is something that Grace must investigate.\r\n\r\nGrace is not the only one who finds the wandering Jungle Book youthful clone intriguing. Both Grace\u2019s fiance Jack (Wes Bentley) and 11-year old Natalie (Oona Laurence from \u201cSouthpaw\u201d) are in awe of Pete as well. In any event, Grace and Natalie are determined to find out what lies beneath the surface with the boy and his behemoth sidekick dragon that recalls Meacham\u2019s exaggerated tall tales.\r\n\r\n**Pete\u2019s Dragon** dutifully follows what amounts to be the on-going formula for escapist children\u2019s storybook gems as recently told on the big screen. The reliable source of pathos and warmth wisdom stems from a vulnerable child in search of belonging especially when trying to locate, recognize, reunite or reminisce about the absence of parents. Thankfully, **Pete\u2019s Dragon** is in formidable company with animated treasures such as _Finding Dory_, _The BFG_, _Stranger Things_ and even the aforementioned _Jungle Book_ that follows such a playbook. The realism behind the idyllic childhood is having that sturdy foundation of family and support especially in the impressionable stages of youthful innocence. Among other things Pete\u2019s Dragon solidifies the magnitude of growing pains and a sense of isolation and quieted despair. This is an important message although embedded in the confines of an innocuous juvenile fantasy.\r\n\r\nThe young Fegley resourcefully carries the breezy heartfelt material on his capable little shoulders as the enchanting Pete. The adorable Laurence is equally effective as Natalie whose bonding with her imaginative partner-in-crime Pete is admirable. Elliot the dragon is nothing more than an overgrown affable beast that would make for an amusing act at a neighborhood children\u2019s birthday party. Both Redford\u2019s Meacham and Howard\u2019s Grace are essential as the older elements bridging the mysteries surrounding the mischievous moptop and his humongous hairball confidante.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to critically slay **Pete\u2019s Dragon** as the thrills and life lessons in resiliency should prove instrumental for the enthusiastic kiddie crowd watching from the sidelines.\r\n\r\n**Pete\u2019s Dragon** (2016)\r\n\r\nWalt Disney Pictures\r\n\r\n1 hr. 30 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Oakes Fegley, Bryce Dallas Howard, Robert Redford, Oona Laurence, Wes Bentley, Karl Urban\r\n\r\nDirected by: David Lowery\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG\r\n\r\nGenre: Children\u2019s Fantasy\/Sci-Fi\/Action and Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n**(c) Frank Ochieng** (2016)","id":"57ae94b0c3a36872780008a2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ae94b0c3a36872780008a2","movie_id":294272}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Looks like there are more scripts based on Hello Ghost circulating in Kollywood these days. In less than a year, we have had three Tamil films which have been inspired from the Korean comedy. First it was Massu Engira Masilamani (May 2015), next we had Om Shanthi Om (October 2015), and now, Peigal Jaakkirathai. We have to thank the directors of these three films for at least trying to make the films tonally different from one another \u2014 a revenge fantasy, an emotional drama and a comedy drama respectively. And we have to hope that perhaps there won't be any more inspirations of the same film.\r\n\r\nThe film's protagonist is Saravanan (the unremarkable Jeeva Rathnam), an orphan, who, we are told, has attempted committing suicide 28 times! But before he enters the scene, the story revolves around Pazhanivel Annachi (Thambi Ramaiah), a big shot whom everyone in the city is scared of (though we are never told how he came to hold such influence). But if there is a chink in Annachi's image, it is his fear of ghosts. This phobia has even made his wife leave him and live with their son in a different part of the city. A doctor advises Annachi to have a man who isn't afraid of death by his side and who better than a guy who has suicidal tendencies? Saravanan starts removing Annachi's fear but has a near-death moment. From then, he realizes that he can see ghosts. And four ghosts follow him to Annachi's house. What do they want and can he get rid of them?\r\n\r\nGiven that we have already seen two versions of the same story, we can't help experience deja vu while watching Peigal Jaakkirathai. The director seems to have left the film to Thambi Ramaiah and the actor makes the film his own. We can see him trying hard to make it funny but luckily, his attempts (he even does a gag where he keeps calling everyone with random names) are at least amusing. And in the second half, the director brings in Rajendran, who, despite being a favourite these days, has very little to do. The leads and their romance is dealt with in a perfunctory manner, and that is actually for the better. The horror moments are cliched (rocking chairs, radio that switches on by itself, loud music and the lot) and the final scene is pure melodrama. But the comedy the works to an extent and it is what keeps us from getting bored. Much of the humour is silly and we do experience a twinge of embarrassment for having laughed at the uninspired jokes \u2014 but that happens only after the film is over.","id":"568a2a63c3a368227b01ed0f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/568a2a63c3a368227b01ed0f","movie_id":371109}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Pencil could have been a thrilling whodunit but it also wants to be a message movie that rails against private educational institutions, and in trying to be both, it fails to be a satisfying film. And to make matters worse, its premise isn't wholly original as well, for it is inspired from the Korean thriller 4th Period Mystery. \r\n\r\nThe film begins promisingly with Nithin (Shariq Hassan), the school's student and the son of a film star, being murdered by an unknown assailant. Then, it goes back by a few months and shows us the various characters who have a motive to kill the boy \u2014 Shiva (GV Prakash), the school topper who is Nithin's bete noire; Maya (Sri Divya), Shiva's crush and a bold girl who rubs him the wrong way; teachers Nandini (Suja Varunee) and Sridhar (Thirumurugan) whose compromising video is in the boy's hands; Anthony Gonsalves (VTV Ganesh), another teacher whom he disrespects; the girl who Nithin is blackmailing; the local boy whom he beats up for hitting on a classmate; and so on. Maya finds Shiva in an incriminating set-up, but decides that he is innocent and together, they decide to track down the murderer before he can leave the school's premises. \r\n\r\nBarring the cliched and unnecessary romantic portions, Mani Nagaraj does a decent job of setting up the mystery in the first half. But the second half is a great let-down. While we expect a tense thriller, what we end up with are amateurish investigative scenes and mood-killing comedy that takes away every ounce of tension in the script. Just because the setting is a school, should the scenes be this juvenile? It is also marred by the choice of the actors who play the school's faculty. TP Gajendran plays the school's principal and his phone's ringtone is Kundrathile Kumaranukku kondattam! Should we say more? \r\n\r\nThe dialogues hitting out at private schools also feel manipulative, especially the climactic monologue, though Abhishek saves it from being a mere rant with his sincere performance. Also, with the hero's character often designated to a secondary role (even during the investigations, it is Sri Divya's Nancy Drew-ish Maya who takes the lead), it is Shariq Hassan (making his debut) who walks away with the film with an arresting performance. The film feels alive whenever he is in the scene, which is why it is a pity that his character dies midway and has to merely be a dead body. Along with him, the film also becomes lifeless.","id":"57381692c3a36864be000b41","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57381692c3a36864be000b41","movie_id":263506}
{"author":"lucabarbosa1","content":"Smoking Guns is a 2017 crime drama about a serial gambler on track to hit a big windfall but now has to keep the betting slip safe to collect the winnings.\r\n\r\nA film like Smoking Guns, also known as A Punters Prayer, has only one thing going for it and if it\u2019s off by even a bit, it falls apart. That\u2019s the characters, which might seem obvious right out of the barrel, but many movies can still get by on visuals and plot. With basically a single room as its setting, and a carousal of oddballs and quirky types swinging through the doors, Smoking Guns thrives on the characters that come and go. It\u2019s not for everyone, but if Londoner black comedies are your thing, and you have even a passing interest in talky guerrilla filmmaking, this one will score big.\r\n\r\nAt the local bookies, a trio of friends spend a Friday afternoon, playing the action, talking big dreams and small chances. They\u2019re led by Jack (Tommy O\u2019Neill), a steady bettor wanting out of the rat race of weekly paychecks and so bets \u00a3250 on a horse to win the treble, which means if it wins all three of its races, would bag him a fortune, though the odds are astronomical against. With him are his pals Yiannis (Andreas Karras), an older guy with a hedge-your-bets attitude, and Ian (Jamie Crew), a wee-little man with a chip on shoulder. When two of the races come in his favor, news begins to spread, and in come some seedy fellows looking to tip the winnings their way, by any means necessary.\r\n\r\nWritten and directed by Savvas D. Michael, Smoking Guns is a chatty film, barely taking a moment to breath as the boys wax philosophical and ponder big and small as a game of wits and luck rules the roost as Jack stands his ground on a single bet that will either save him or end him. Michael starts his story with a jarring moment that sets a terrifying tone, though is cut off by a strip of purposefully amateurish animation and then a slow burn all the way back to the start. Stylistic to a degree, the film clips along on its snappy dialogue and Michael\u2019s sharp direction, both of which give this some real crackle. While it has very little action, the sheer energy of the performances have it bristling from start to finish.\r\n\r\nSmoking Guns\r\nSmoking Guns, 2017 \u00a9 Liontari Pictures\r\nThat begins with O\u2019Neill, who is electrifying throughout, the singular stable mate in the bunch, determined and convinced in his luck and the guiding hand of his newfound faith, twisted as it is. Equally good is Crew, who takes the tropes of the scrappy underling and pumps him full of genuine emotional punch. The film itself does a sublime job of convincing you it\u2019s a comedy until it swings \u2019round like hurricane and knocks flat any and all your expectations, with a truly disturbing and ambiguous end that will leave you debating what happens behind a closed door.\r\n\r\nSmoking Guns is an odd film to be sure, but in the best possible way. Taking its influences to heart, it feels larger than it is and while not everyone is going to be on board with the style choices and rapid-fire pace, it earns its wings easily enough and is well worth a look.","id":"59ba7d63c3a3680d340106ec","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59ba7d63c3a3680d340106ec","movie_id":448988}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Timing is important for comedy, and Valeba Raja, which was launched with the cast of Kanna Laddu Thinna Aasaiya immediately after the success of that film, has been rather unfortunate on even with respect to its release. This much-delayed film has finally hit screens this week but the humour feels dated today. And even if we can offer such an excuse for its datedness, there can be no excuse for the sub-par writing. Even Santhanam isn't the comic force that he was in 2013.\r\n\r\nThe actor plays Dr Valeba Raja (Santhanam), a sought-after psychiatrist, who chooses Karthik (Sethu), a young man who has trouble making choices (he is so indecisive even if it is only choosing between gulab jamun and rasgulla), as his 'patient of the day'. Karthik's current dilemma is this: should he marry Sweety (Nushrat Bharucha), the north Indian girl he has been after for two years, or choose Shaalu (Vishakha Singh), the girl whom his parents have chosen for him and whom he has started getting attracted to?\r\n\r\nRamnath uses this set-up to narrate events that had happened months earlier. It sounds fairly engaging but these scenes are neither comic or dramatic and remain flat. We feel nothing while watching them and that's the trouble here. Even the scenes involving Santhanam are been-there-seen-that. But the main issue is that of the central casting. Sethu is not a charismatic presence and we never warm up to Karthik as much as we should for the film to work. Some bits work \u2014 like the use of scenes from Poove Unakkaga and Amarkalam for the film's climax (which also serve as the mandatory nods to Vijay and Ajith), and the casting of VTV Ganesh in the role of a settu! But beyond that, we remember nothing once we walk out of the theatre.","id":"57036ab3925141625c00084a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57036ab3925141625c00084a","movie_id":280152}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Is it a crime to get inspired by a classic film and try to make a similar film in your own language? Is it a crime to make a film that is a veiled critique of a real-life case? Not really. In fact, director Senthil Kumar's idea of exploiting the set-up of Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men to discuss the case of Perarivalan, one of the accused in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, is an inspired decision. What better way to start a public debate on the issue than by making a provocative film that gives convincing reasons as to why his case deserves a second look?\r\n\r\nBut the problem is that Senthil Kumar doesn't seem to know how to turn this idea into a persuasive film. In fact, his film is the exact opposite \u2014 unconvincing, with writing that makes no sense and execution that is laughable. He begins the film with a pre-credit sequence, an animated one, which shows the journey of our independence (though unnecessary, this is the only portion in the film that is remarkable), before adding that real freedom is only when every man is able to lend his voice against injustice that the nation.\r\n\r\nAnd then we see Velan's mother (Poornima Bhagyaraj) who is in the dock for helping her son assassinate a Gandhian leader. The judge says that he is going to bring a jury and leave the decision of whether she should be hanged like her son or walk free to them. And so we are introduced to the 12 jury members \u2014 a motley bunch from various walks of life who, not for a moment, give the impression that they possess the acumen to debate the issue and come to an agreement. One of the members, a rich woman (Urvashi), has come there on an empty stomach and wants them to quickly arrive at a decision so that she can go and eat! There is even a foreigner who speaks only in chaste Tamil!\r\n\r\nLike in Lumet's film, one man wants them to discuss the case in depth and that man here is Siddharthan (Shanthnu), a philosopher (is that really a job?)! And over the course of the next hour and a half, he tries to convince the others to give the woman a fair chance. But with fellow members like Jhanavi (Muktha Bhanu), who begins to support him just because she likes him, is his job really going to be hard? His real difficulty is in making us endure the film for its relatively short 95-minute running time.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**When the time froze, but not one's growth.**\r\n\r\nThere's nothing left to say about the Korean film industry. I've already praised highlighting all the best stuffs. One thing they lack is the awards winning capability, like perhaps the Oscars. Cinematically and entertainment perspective, they always give a top notch product. Particularly, the kind of emotions they use, is very closely appeals to my culture, probably for the rest of the world as well. All I have heard about this was a fantasy film. Beyond that, it was a little romance, a little emotional and a little thriller.\r\n\r\nThere are a large number of people outside the South Korea follow the Korean films. Though this one is definitely an under-noticed a great piece of work. I don't know this director, but he wrote and made it pretty awesomely. This kind of tale very much suitable for anime. It's going to be just like another 'Your Name'. If they decide to make it with the small changes, I'm absolutely on to it.\r\n\r\nThe title is not really enchanting for a fantasy film. But definitely makes sense on what it narrates. This is a fantasy film, though, since time involved in it, it automatically a small part of science fiction too. They had well covered all the loopholes and flaws. They did not detail out all minute things, but if you think little intelligently, you will get all the answers for your doubts. For instance, how that asthma boy had died.\r\n\r\nFrom a small Korean island town, the story followed a teenage girl, Soo-rin who recently moved in there with her stepfather. She was considered a weirdo in the school for being lonely. Then a boy named Sung-min befriends her and become girlfriend-boyfriend. One day they along with two other boys venturing to the nearby mountain forest, discovered a glowing object. In the next minute, everything has changed. All of them disappeared, except the girl. Now the town is enraged by her little story.\r\n\r\n> \u275dLet me grow to 6ft. Earn $10 dollar before age 30.\u275e\r\n\r\nNobody knows what had happened, including Soo-rin, until a man who approached her telling some strange story. She finds a reason to believe that, but not anyone else. It goes on like they are fighting to tell the truth to the world, but it was beyond reality. Adds more complication every time they try to explain it. Without any options to solve it, where the remaining narration heads and ends were told quite nicely, emotionally.\r\n\r\nThe story was simple, but the details makes is more complex. Easy to follow, there's always an explanation for everything you see. Contents wise, it is a well balanced for children's and the grown- ups viewing. Whenever a film theme involved messing with time, it has to be very clever. Because time naturally does not exist in the universe. It is the human's creation to understand everything's existence. I think they have designed this story with the characters so well. It could be a time travel theme too, if you take it from a different perspective.\r\n\r\nTwo hours long film, but that did not bother me. Because I well merged with the story. The twist came early itself as the storytelling demanded it. But there were many turns in the later parts. Especially the entire second half is less excitement if you are a fantasy film fan. Though it gets tense for every scene, and creates curiosity about the conclusion. Not the best ending, yet very suitable one. What I am impressed with it was how smartly they used the graphics. They did not require higher end. Simple and believable visuals, compared to Hollywood's similar style flicks. One such interesting fact was, they wanted the story to lead the film than the colourful graphics.\r\n\r\nNice performances. The locations were good too. There are some moments that reminds other films. Nothing like it stole from them, though for the similarity in the thematic and the situations. The overall film theme was not out and out fresh. It simply changed a few rules and with the kind of development, it created its own identity. As for me, this is one of the top ten fantasy films of the decade and top ten in all time Korean fantasy film. As I said, if you love this genre, then it is a must see. Highly recommended!\r\n\r\n_9\/10_","id":"5a7701dd0e0a26642a04b267","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a7701dd0e0a26642a04b267","movie_id":382217}

Jayavel (Prabhu) and Keerthy Vasan (Thennavan), the heirs of these families, are expected to take on each other, and thereby safeguard the village's 'tradition'. However, they are actually thick friends, and have no clue about the feud, which has been prevailing for five generations. They leave to Chennai with their respective families in search of a peaceful life, and settle there as neighbours. Jayavel's son Siva (Aari) and Keerthy Vasan's daughter Abhirami (Maya) are brought up together. Interestingly, the two were born on the same day, though Abhi was born just a second before Siva \u2014 one of the reasons for her overbearing attitude towards him. Their parents hope they get married to each other, but the two are often found quarrelling. However, they realise their true feelings for each other when they try to help out their friends, Bhagat Singh (Bala Saravanan) and Sundarambal aka Su (Misha Ghoshal). \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a few disappointed villagers who have been 'missing the action' for a while, come to the city to know the 'status' of rivalry between Jayavel and Keerthy Vasan, and take them back to Sivaganga to settle the issue once for all.

The cinematography by Naga Saravanan deserves appreciation, especially in the scenes shot in the village.

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Some things will never change within the tedious and surprisingly long-running sci-fi\/horror saga **Underworld** film franchise. The vampires will still feature sharp fangs that can pierce a hardened leather sofa with one bite and the werewolves will be hairier than the local women\u2019s wig shop. Of course the curvaceous heroine of this Gothic gumball machine of a flick\u2013_Love & Friendship\u2019s_ Kate Beckinsale\u2013will predictably wear leather-clad attire that will cling to her shapely body tighter than a preschooler hanging on to his mother\u2019s leg because he is scared to enter the classroom for the very first time. What also is expected not to change anytime soon is the sluggish intrigue, overblown supernatural creatures acting more obnoxious than your drunk Uncle Jake wearing a bra at the family cookout and Beckinsale\u2019s womanly warrior Selene acting as the badass bloodsucking babe out to mediate the conflicting forces that persist. Yes folks\u2026you heard correctly that this is the fifth installment of the **Underworld**  universe that sits there and makes its presence known with all the force and feisty relevance of unwanted luggage left at the airport.\r\n\r\nFirst-time feature director Anna Foerster (from TV\u2019s \u201cOutlander\u201d) takes a crack at instilling some frolicking freshness in the turgid, cheesy **Underworld: Blood Wars**\u2013a banal B-movie confection that Dracula would refuse to acknowledge even if there was a free showing at the local blood bank. Relentlessly flat, unimaginative and woefully recycled, **Blood Wars** offers nothing inviting or challenging for its aforementioned fifth time around the block and should have resisted the need to go beyond its 2003 Len Wiseman-directed release nearly fourteen years ago. Nevertheless, the devoted fanboys gave battleground beauty Beckinsale a theatrical movie gig (along with the rising popularity of the vampires\/werewolves craze in cinema) that has lasted for an impressive long time as inexplicable as that sounds. However, lasting power does not necessarily mean a hill of beans with the one-note notion of a former orphaned vampire gal transforming into a beastly butt-kicking wrecking ball as the fatal feuding between the Lycans (a.k.a. \u201clycanthrope\u201d or werewolves) and vampires escalates to a new level of chaos. Sure, Selene is not exactly as convincingly clever or calculating as Aliens\u2019 Ripley (then again who is, right?) but she certainly is cut out of the same generic cloth as _Resident Evil\u2019s_ Alice (for which pre-dates the **Underworld** experience as well as offering a longer string of sequels).\r\n\r\nFoerster assures that **Underworld: Blood Wars** wastes no time in getting to the punchy antics of its silly-minded action sequences\u2013some mired in empty-headed fun while other takes are needlessly monotonous. Screenwriters Cory Goodman and Kyle Ward stock up on the fluffy cliches of this toothless tease of a frivolous fable as the thin plot flies every which way more than Beckinsale\u2019s golden locks during a heated scuffle. Sophomoric dialogue, formulaic confrontations and the dullness of opposing fierce factions set aside **Blood Wars** does make reasonable usage of its lethal leather-wearing lass Selene\/Beckinsale in eye-rolling combat and the CGI visuals are engaging when not looking choppy in some instances. The fact that Selene has to negotiate some compromise for either side does introduce some slight sense of tension amid the roguish warfare and Beckinsale sells this quite accordingly to a certain degree. However, **Blood Wars** will definitely serve as comfort junk food for those legions of followers that have familiarized themselves with Selene\u2019s jolting journey as she maneuvers through the manic mess that involves her blood-thirsty species taking on the hellish hairballs that are the defiant Lycans.\r\n\r\nFor first-time **Underworld** viewers or the casual crowd they will witness an under-cooked, ridiculously trite terror tale of an actioner that is sure to leave **Blood Wars** as nothing more than a false sense of second-hand stimulation. A generic exercise in the making, Foerster\u2019s brooding bombshell in Beckinsale\u2019s Selene is serviceable for a fifth go-around but that is really not saying too much given that the material never seems to revolve her from some of  her past misadventures through the four previous **Underworld** entries. The supporting players\u2013such as Charles Dance\u2019s elder vampire Thomas, Theo James\u2019s David (the male Selene perhaps?), Lara Pulver\u2019s Semira and Tobias Menzies\u2019s Marius\u2013are accomplished performers in their own right but they add little atmosphere to the hackneyed hedonism that toils within this supernatural stupor.\r\n\r\nNo need to put the stake through the heart of these returning vampires and werewolves because they have proven time in and time out over again that the sultry Selene and her creature feature bickering buddies are not budging anytime soon after almost fifteen years of conjuring up surreal nonsense.

That does not mean all her films are good. She has stopped doing good films a while ago. Every time when her films get released, I was hoping for her comeback like the old days, either a pure drama or an action film. No, not this film. It is what, the fifth in the franchise and the feature film debut for the directress of the television series.\r\n\r\nAs always, worth watching for Kate. The story continued, and it focused on the remaining vampires fighting for their survival against their arch-rival, Lycans. That's where the Selene caught between. But this time, it was about looking for her daughter, Eve, who holds the key to the future of these immortals. So the action begins where everybody clashes, racing towards their destination.\r\n\r\nThe first three were the good ones. This and the previous ones were downgraded the decent series. The makers are already working on the sixth. Definitely not expected, after seeing this particular film. But I hope it comes back to the original course with good story, actions, graphics and all. This was simply based on one liner, and the rest of the film leaned towards the stunt sequences. Okay to watch once, but I'm not sure worth of spending 90 minutes for it.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I think it is fairly safe to say that if you did not like any of the other installments in the Underworld movie series then you will not like this one.\r\n\r\nAs usual with these kind of movies it is one where you preferably switch of most higher brain functions before watching and just sit down and enjoy the show. The movie is certainly not a masterpiece when it comes to story and script. Actually the script is, at times, fairly crappy. There are for example a sequence were the Lycans are attacking the stronghold castle of the Vampires and the script writer taught it was a good idea to just let them drive straight into the center of the castle and breach the door before they got challenged. What the f\u2026?\r\n\r\nOn the whole the script is a typical Hollywood B-movie concoction that holds little merit. If this would have been the first movie in the series I think there would never had been a series made at all.\r\n\r\nSo why did I like it then? Well, even if the script is nothing to write home about it is not a total disaster and it serves as an excuse to provide 90 minutes of good entertaining Vampire vs Lycan action. Plain and simple.\r\n\r\nOf course Kate Beckinsale is a good reason for liking the movie as well. Her moving around in her intimidating (and good looking) skintight clothes slashing up Lycans in various creative ways makes up for some of the not so stellar script. I probably pissed of a bunch of feminists there but it is not really like a care about that.\r\n\r\nThe action and the CGI is reasonably well done and another reason to like the movie. Actually, come to think about it, Kate Beckinsale, the action and the CGI is pretty much the reasons I liked this movie.\r\n\r\nThey could have selected a more charismatic bad guy though. For most of the movie I felt Marcus was bland and even a bit dull.\r\n\r\nIt is not the best movie in the series but it does not exactly shame the series either.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The battle for an island.**\r\n\r\nThis is a perfect summer film for the families that produced by the BBC. Based on the children's book of the same name. Frankly, I haven't seen the television nor the film adaptation of this. It looked very fresh to me, so I enjoyed it thoroughly. I'm a big fan of children's films and this one reminded my childhood vacation in the grandparents' rural. Surely everybody, I mean most of us had this kind of adventure, sometimes that ended very seriously.\r\n\r\nThis is mainly about a group of children and their summer adventure, especially sailing in a large lake and exploring an uninhabited island of it. Mrs Walker brings her four children to their grandparents' house in a small English village. The bored kids decide to go sailing on the lake nearby where their father promised to take them one day, but now he's out in the sea far away on the job. Somehow they manage to get permission from the elders and so their adventure begins.\r\n\r\nThey arrive on the island and claim it. But another group who already claimed it challenges them. So their rivalry begins which leads to some great adventures, day and night. How things going to work between them is told in the remaining. Though there are more that takes place alternatively, like the real spy-game of the grown- ups. How these two stories going to meet was revealed with a decent twist. But the thriller parts were compromised since the film is aimed for the little ones.\r\n\r\n> \"I hereby name it Walker Island and claim it for our own.\"\r\n\r\nGreat quality, loved the production. The locations were awesome. Initially I thought this will going to take place in the real Amazon, Brasil, but still I'm satisfied with it. I don't know who is this director, but a well done job. I also don't know whether the story is from the book or just the characters, but expecting a sequel and if possible a film series. I'm not expecting the whole 12 books to be made into films, thought at least a trilogy, since it's a live-action and the kids would grow up fast, they have to hurry up like they did for 'Harry Potter' film series.\r\n\r\nThe story takes place in the summer 1935 and its atmospheres, especially the addition of the spy thing was a smart move as those times were tensed with the early stage of the World War II. Its stretch also gives the adults a reason to watch the film, but sadly that sub-plot was under-used. Anyway, I recommend it to all, since it falls into PG. But there was a scene when the kids decided to go find the source of the fire they saw afar, that part was so edgy. Like that, there are a few more which creates uneasy in the perspective of kids.\r\n\r\nOverall the film looks like a non-magical version of Narnia with four siblings and their exploration turned into an unplanned adventure. Yep, it's not summer yet, off the season, but still I loved it. This is one of the first films to I watch in the 2017, but definitely first children's film. On so many levels, it was a very good film, particularly if you haven't seen the other versions like me and a kid's film fan, you will have a good time. But for the families, as I said earlier, it is not to be missed. It got mixed to positive response from both the film critics and the movie goers, but personally I think it's much better than what they have said. So go for it...\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"587bc56ac3a36849ff0108e9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/587bc56ac3a36849ff0108e9","movie_id":347035}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Two strangers in an unusual circumstance take a weirdest journey.**\r\n\r\nMy initial thought was this is a new version of 'Weekend at Bernie's', but very soon I realised it is not. This film is a bit disgusting. Watching alone makes okay or with the close buddies, but not good for beyond that. I totally appreciate the effort and obviously the fresh idea for a film from the Hollywood, but the film is not a masterpiece or entertaining. Because a plot like this is not worth for a 90 minute stretch. It should have been a short film or the story should have developed to a better one.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of questions regarding the film. The film did not detail everything it showed, so that's the first negative about it. It opened with a young man stranded on a tiny island who tries to commit suicide, but abandons the plan and takes a weirdest ride in the sea seeking land to get rescued by its people. Though he's not alone, a strange young man accompanies him. So it's like theirs journey of self-discovery, but how it all ends is the crucial final segment.\r\n\r\nBoth the young actors were good in theirs very challenging roles, particularly Daniel Radcliffe. The directors too to be praised for managing to pull it off so well. But it was the screenplay that did not deliver as I anticipated. The film was different, but nothing impressive at all, so I think it is good for watching at once. Maybe if I understand or get the answers for my doubts, I might change might stance. For now this is an average film.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"581cf3a6925141359f00119e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/581cf3a6925141359f00119e","movie_id":347031}
{"author":"Jodie","content":"Split was a movie that I was a bit weary to see, I had been bitten by M. Knight before and I wasn't sure if this movie would be worth while. But the trailers looked great and I had always thought James McAvoy was a seriously underrated actor. \r\n\r\nSplit surprised me. I loved this movie. Ann Taylor-Joy was decent in the film and the Dr was great, but McAvoy knocked it out of the park. Being able to portray all these different personalities with no props such as wigs or makeup shows his talent. It was amazing how one personality made you feel uneasy and perplexed and the next had you smiling and feeling like you were really staring at a strange child. Bravo McAvoy.\r\n\r\nThe twist at the end made me love this movie even more. Though I'm not sure if you can really cal it a twist. A \"reveal\" might be the better word for what the audience learns. Whatever you want to cal it, the reveal at the end made me excited to see what's next!\r\n\r\nThe only thing I didn't like about this film was  the unresolved conflict between Ann Taylor-Joy's character at the end of the film. \r\nBesides that, I loved it. Definitely worth watching.","id":"58a85e6d92514156ab009d7c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58a85e6d92514156ab009d7c","movie_id":381288}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"You like to make fun of us, but we are more powerful than you think.\r\n\r\nSplit is written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It stars James McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy, Betty Buckley, Haley Lu-Richardson and Jessica Sula. Music is by West Dylan Thordson and cinematography by Mike Gioulakis.\r\n\r\nThree girls are kidnapped by a man with a diagnosed 23 different personalities. They must try to escape before the apparent emergence of the 24th - known as The Beast...\r\n\r\nWe now know that Split is the second instalment of a trilogy by Shyamalan that began with Unbreakable and is ending with Glass (released 2019). Always proving to be a most divisive director\/writer\/actor, Shyamalan has returned to the sort of noticeable form that had him earmarked in his early days as a director to follow - with the proviso that inevitably this is going to still infuriate some for its handling of the subjects at hand.\r\n\r\nThe plot trajectory is simple enough, girls kidnapped by a patient suffering from multiple personality disorder, as the girls in fear try to escape, a number of his personalities put in an appearance. Which builds up to the finale, which explodes after following on from the suspense and dread atmospherics so beloved by the director. In the mix joining the mental health issue with our main protagonist is a good meaning doctor (naturally), and the spectre of child abuse rears its ugly head. So not a movie to be cheered up by then! While if looking for a detailed and attentive look at the mental health issues to hand you will be disappointed.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a style to the picture in how it draws you into the predicament of the main players, boosted no end by McAvoy on irresistible form. Given licence to chew every scene, he delivers his various characters with great relish and no little amount of skill. Props to for Taylor-Joy, who as the lead kidnappee has deftly blended youthful innocence with resourceful strength (aided by Shyamalan's writing of course). Conversely, Shyamalan is guilty of just making a pic for entertainment purpose, which works as it's a very good creepy thriller with its black humour moments, but the mental health plot devices ensure his gimmicks will not be welcomed by all. 7\/10","id":"5c55a0cf0e0a263ccde133d3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c55a0cf0e0a263ccde133d3","movie_id":381288}
{"author":"meekodev","content":"**Didnt see the review section at first so,I posted on the forums**\r\n\r\nNot a fan of The director since Unbreakable. It was slightly above average but no whee near the quality of The Sixth Sence. I don't know why I keep watching his movies, probably hoping one will be the same extraordinary quality. With all the pre-release buzz I thought this was finally that movie. \r\n\r\nI was so disappointed. I rated it slightly lower than Unbreakable. I don't know exactly where it where it went off the rails, but it never held my attention (and I'm not ADHD- I sit though theee hours of a good bio pic. \r\n\r\nA good part of this was the girls trying asinine ways to escape; at other time we see McAvoy play several personalities half heartily. After all the award talk I expected a much better and diverse McAvoy. Sadly, just like the majority of Night's films he has his actors perform methodically. It actually felt McAlvoy was pushing his talents against the brick wall of what the director wanted.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't the only actor who underplayed the role. So did the doctor and the three teenage girls. First, after all these late night calls for extra appointment why didn't she get upset earlier or pull a personality up (which she has stated she can do) to discover the emergency instead of A casual bye--you-leave when another dominant personality shows up to the appointment.\r\n\r\nI rate this in the same category of Nights's films except the quality Sisth Sense and Devil, which he did not direct and only wrote the original story, \r\n\r\nAs for,the ending, I felt it was a cheap shot. If the point was they are in the same time, the message came across far too,strong. If it is a hitnt to an Unbreakable 2 I'll pass and see another big screen feature.","id":"58b14af09251415b2d009d85","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b14af09251415b2d009d85","movie_id":381288}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Saprk: A Space Fail**\r\n\r\nMy rating could be a little harsh, but, come on, if you have seen it, then you know the film lacks in everything. Firstly, the production was decent, especially for non-Disney, non-Pixar and even for non-Dreamworks and Sony, it is enough. The film was aimed for little kids, so keeping them in mind, it is a better film. Secondly, the characters and its designs were okay. But the story was merely the same dystopian theme. You know, dangerous visionary tries to destroy the planet and the years ago separated family finally unite and brings all the allies together to fight the villain. The end determines the fate of the great battle everyone involved in.\r\n\r\nFor me, it looked more like a television film. Or even better if it has been a television series. Because somewhat it reminds the recent 'Trollhunters'. A boy possesses the secret weapon and trains hard to fight the evil force. Each episode with a different action, adventure, it would have been a wonderful series. Anyway, despite the film failed to impress its viewers, I won't say it is that bad. Watchable film, but there's no fun, only for timepass. Even for the timepass, there are a lot better ones out there. So showing it for only young children might justify, since they can't differentiate between good and bad, except enjoying everything they see.\r\n\r\n_3\/10_","id":"598ca52e925141108e000790","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/598ca52e925141108e000790","movie_id":322487}

I'm gonna skip right over all of that and talk purely about the movie itself.\r\n\r\nAnya Taylor-Joy is good, but McAvoy is what makes Split worthwhile. The heavily touted twist\/reveal was all but a non-event, even to a M. Night alum like myself. Though it is certainly (in my opinion) the best work The Shamhammer has brought out since at least Signs, it's hard to say that its successes rest on his shoulders. Again, it is for McAvoy that we really owe praise, who, with the exception of his role as the lead in Filth, gives his career best performance.\r\n\r\nFinal rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I personally recommend you give it a go.","id":"58986c57c3a368770e008cc9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58986c57c3a368770e008cc9","movie_id":381288}

{"author":"msbreviews","content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nJames McAvoy plays Kevin, a man with a genetic disease which allows him to have multiple personalities. His trusted psychiatrist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), knows 23 of them, but there's one hidden from everyone who desires to dominate over all the others. Compelled by one of his personalities, Kevin abducts three girls, where Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy) becomes their leader to try and escape the \"crazy\" man.\r\n\r\nIs this the return to form by M. Night Shyamalan, who has been struggling for more than a decade to release a major success? Is Split the movie that brings him back to the spotlight?\r\n\r\nOnce again, Shyamalan's storytelling is very original, unconventional and ultimately mind-blowing. Instead of establishing everything the audience needs to know about the characters right at the beginning, he gradually develops them, giving them haunting backstories and spreading parts of it throughout the runtime. That said, this film isn't for everyone. The audience needs to trust Shyamalan and be patient. Really patient. Don't start taking notes about something that you think it's negative because once you reach the third act, everything changes and suddenly it all makes sense. The screenplay is not as twisty as Unbreakable, for example, but it demands absolute attention in order to catch up on all the things that matter (and the ones that don't, as well).\r\n\r\nThe production and editing team have to be congratulated due to their seamless work. From the camera work to the extended one-take sequences, as well as the environment surrounding the characters, everything feels real and looks amazing. The soundtrack ... Let me just say that this element is so, but so much relevant to the conclusion of this movie. I can't really say anything else without spoiling the ending, so I'll leave a note after my rating at the end of the review with a MAJOR SPOILER.\r\n\r\nAs for the cast, I'll start with the man that I honestly think should have received an Oscar nomination: James McAvoy. You know, there's a big difference in portraying a non-fiction character instead of a fiction one: concerning the former, you can't really escape the true nature of the person you are playing, but with the latter, as an actor\/actress, you have to deliver yourself 100% to the role for it to be believable ... And God, does McAvoy deliver! He gives 200% in what could be his best performance to date. Do you think Andy Serkis had problems portraying both Gollum and Sm\u00e9agol at the same time? Well, imagine 7 ... or 8 characters. I lost the count. All in all, James McAvoy, sir, congratulations! You are superb!\r\n\r\nAnya Taylor-Joy is also incredible as Casey! Her character has the most intriguing story of the three girls, and she's the one who assumes the leadership of the group once the kidnap occurs. Her initially unknown past helps her through the traumatic situation, but it's really her rather captivating backstory that grabbed my attention. It's fundamental to the understanding of the ending and Anya does a terrific job. I also want to give a small praise to Betty Buckley for a beautiful and necessary interpretation of Dr. Fletcher, a character that offers the audience some knowledge of Kevin's disease.\r\n\r\nAs for the other two kidnapped girls, well ... They're my main issue with the film since they don\u2019t have a good reason to be there. Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) aren't the main characters, and they don't have that much screen time, but their dialogue still feels extremely forced and filled with a lot of nonsense. The ending of the story might not be as twisty as in other Shyamalan's installments, but I hope that people don't give up to false expectations. The classic Shyamalan's twisty ending isn't a necessary attribute of his movies, but the truth is that the twist is not the one you think it is. Once again, the note at the end of my review will clarify this.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Split is Shyamalan's return to his old early 2000's self. Brilliantly unconventional storytelling, a lot of suspense, some very captivating subplots and a fantastic editing and production team behind him. The soundtrack plays a huge role in this film, as well as James McAvoy, who delivers his career-best performance. Anya Taylor-Joy is also pretty extraordinary, something that can't be said about her fellow friends who portrayed two bland characters. The ending brings the classic twist that makes everything more understandable, and I gotta say ... I love this film, and it is one of 2017's best!\r\n\r\nMAJOR SPOILER BELOW\r\n\r\nAs I said above, the soundtrack plays a huge role in the ending twist. That's because the soundtrack that plays right before the title of the movie appears on the screen, is the same one as in the third act of Unbreakable.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the many clues throughout the film that hint at the idea that Split belongs to Unbreakable's universe. Naturally, after the title shows up, there's a scene with David Dunn (Bruce Willis) that confirms this theory, but these are little details that make Shyamalan into a great director and screenwriter. Also, it's a pity that I've only watched these movies after Shyamalan stating that they were part of an eventual trilogy. Not that I was not surprised at the end of Split, but it did remove that first impact of pure shock in knowing that two films separated by 17 years (in real life) are part of the same universe.\r\n\r\nBoth movies end up falling into the \"superhero\" genre. Unbreakable is the story of our \"hero\" who spent his whole life sad because he wasn't doing \"what he was supposed to do\", and Split is an origin story of our \"villain\". If Glass delivers, this might be one of the best \u201csuperhero\u201d trilogies ever.\r\n\r\nRating: A","id":"5c3f4a040e0a263867908c5f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c3f4a040e0a263867908c5f","movie_id":381288}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The 24th's about to explode!**\r\n\r\nThe much needed break for the director Shyamalan. It has been over a decade since the last time he was lauded like this for his work. On the paper, it was a simple split personality disaster theme, but cinematically clicked so well. Firstly the performance of James McAvoy made this film a very success. I have seen his lots of films, but if I had to choose only one of his great, that's would be easily this one. A straightforward story, no complication to understand, or needed to explain everything it revolves. Then suddenly the final act turned into a different mode. With a twist, all comes to end.\r\n\r\nThe three teenage girls have been kidnapped at the beginning. Following that, the victims do not know the situation, but makes a couple of bad moves, except one girl. As the film progress, many secrets revealed to us, particularly about the kidnapper. It all developed to lead in one direction where an unimaginable thing going to happen. How and what result it brings told in the following parts.\r\n\r\nThe perspective of the story was not really a thing in this. That means it does not take sides, but gives you the option to choose. And most of the viewers would root for the weird girl. It was Anya, and she's having a wonderful career in early stage. Could becomes one of the best if she contributed all her performances in the same pace and intensity. The music was equally awesome. Created the perfect atmosphere along with the visuals.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Uriyadi (Vidiyumvarai Vinmeengalavom in the censor certificate) feels like a less commercial version of Pa Ranjith's Madras \u2014 how that film would have been like if it had not had a star for its lead, and had not spent too much time on the romantic track and songs. It also has some resemblance to Subramaniapuram \u2014 the leads in this film are as hot-blooded as those in Sasikumar's film, and the murders are as chilling. There is also a nod to Ram Gopal Varma's Shiva (here, it involves a bike chain). And yet, this is an original film that works both as an action thriller and as a social commentary. At a time when most filmmakers try to go for a fail-safe approach, debutant Vijay Kumar gives us a violent tale of caste, politics and youth. He boldly gives us a peek into how and why caste outfits turn into political parties. A caste outfit leader proclaims, \"Nammala vittu thaniya ninna yaarum jeikka mudiyathunu kaatanum\". The film is set in the 90s (AR Rahman's songs drift in the background; Simran is the poster girl) in an unspecified small town, but lines like this one reiterate how relevant the film feels. \r\n\r\nThe story revolves around four engineering students who are drifters. When their principal asks them what their aim in life is, one guy says, \"Jolly-a irukkanum\". That is their extent of their dreams, and that is what they intend to do. One night, they fight for an old man from a lower caste to be allowed to dine in the roadside dhaba they frequent. This results in a conflict with members of a caste outfit, but before things get out of hand, the group's leader brokers peace. But this peace is fragile as the boys keep getting into problems \u2014 mostly of their own making and at times, by fate. That the town is heavily divided on caste lines only expedites their destiny. And after a point of time, it becomes a battle for survival for the students. \r\n\r\nThe twists and turns in Uriyadi have us on the edge of our seats for most of the time, and the film keeps going back and forth in time to keep us unsettled. The onscreen violence, just like the film, is raw and real (the somewhat flat visuals even add to this in a rather unintended way). It gives us a jolt \u2014 as it should. There are a couple of nail-bitingly tense stunt sequences \u2014 one involves a killer in the guise of a beggar, and the other, an almost wordless stretch, shows characters being murdered in ruthless fashion. The film, generally, doesn't have a use for length dialogues, but when it does use dialogues, the lines are hard-hitting \u2014 \"Patha vekkara maadhiri patha vecha oru theekuchiyala oru kaataye koluthidalam\". \r\n\r\nThis is a film where there is very little time for romance, but the few minutes that we get are effective and believable. And even though there is friendship, this theme is dealt with in a refreshingly low-key manner, and doesn't get underscored as it does in the films of Samuthirakani and Sasikumar. The climax might seem immoral and unlawful to some, but with its deft handling of a subject that is a double-edged sword, Uriyadi displays a daring that belies its small-budget, first-film credentials, and stakes its claim in the list of the best films of the year.","id":"57553d72c3a3683c900013c4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57553d72c3a3683c900013c4","movie_id":400391}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A con and a cop team up against a notorious crime gang.**\r\n\r\nThis has been done in Hollywood a decade ago, which is now considered as outdated, but Hong Kong and Chinese are doing it now. What I meant was Jackie Chan teaming up with an American star. Though all those films are almost same, like running and chasing and stunts with the comedic sense. Yep, totally boring, nothing new it it, except different locations and the cast. The Russians addition was new, but in the end it became a joke. That's funny to say, because it is a comedy film.\r\n\r\nIf you are familiar with Jackie Chan's Hollywood films, then you already know the 90 per cent of this film and for the rest, you have to watch it. A cop from Hong Kong seeking a revenge for his partner's death, so now he has to find and rescue the American con man who stuck with the Russias gangster for the evidence he needed to put the criminal gang boss behind the bar. The adventurous journey they take across the Mongolia is what the film is based on.\r\n\r\nThis film is specially made for the yuan market, so don't bother if you don't carry yuan in your wallet.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"A couple of Fridays ago, we had Vetri Maaran's Visaaranai, a hard-hitting film that was a damning one for the police force as it shined a light on the brutality that those with power unleash upon the defenseless. For them, Sethupathi should feel like a God-sent PR bonanza from Kollywood \u2014 even if that is entirely incidental \u2014 that acts to restore the public's faith in the force. Right from the title credits, which acts as homage to the men in khakhi (just like how the end credits of Thuppakki paid tribute to our army jawans), the film keeps celebrating cops.\r\n\r\nAnd it also brings back the masala movie cop, a character whose every action we are meant to cheer. Sethupathi (Vijay Sethupathi), an inspector about to be promoted as an assistant commissioner, is tenacious and fearless. A cop is murdered in a place that is under his jurisdiction and so he starts investigating the case. He finds out that the local big shot, Vaathiyar is connected to this killing and goes after him. He even arrests Vaathiyar (Vela Ramamurthy, who is as terrific in this bad guy role as he was as the kind-hearted patriarch in Paayum Puli), but an unforeseen accident involving a gun and a student, puts his career in jeopardy. However, Sethupathi soon realises that this accident has a connection to the case involving the dead cop. Now, he has to play a cat-and-mouse game with Vaathiyar while trying to hold on to his job.\r\n\r\nSethupathi is a Vijay Sethupathi show all the way. This is his first action hero role, and the actor turns on his star wattage to the maximum. Not since Vikram in Saamy has an actor effortlessly displayed that casual arrogance that is needed for a masala movie cop. Like Saamy, Sethupathi is a mix of brains and brawn, someone who can make gangsters tremble by just appearing before them and outthink his foes. Arunkumar shrewdly exploits this to give us one whistle-worthy moment after another. Two scenes, particularly, stand out. One, where he hides his face with a scarf to attack the villain's henchmen, after getting into trouble in an earlier scene when due to a video. In the other one, he relays instructions over phone to his wife (Ramya Nambeesan) and son and protects them from the goons who have broken into their house.\r\n\r\nThe director, who made the sweet-natured Pannaiyarum Padminiyum, goes all out to venerate his hero, and there are times when we begin to think if this unconcealed commercial approach is a response to the box office underperformance of his debut film. He certainly seems to have learnt a lesson from that on one account. The languid storytelling of the former is here replaced with a narration that is spry. And, thanks to his editor Sreekar Prasad and composer Nivas Prasanna's spunky score, he manages to achieve this without resorting to gimmicks like ramped up or hyper-edited shots.\r\n\r\nIf there is a hitch, it is the scenes that are set in Sethupathi's home. They are clearly meant to be fillers between the action scenes, and while the happy nuclear family sub-plot (with cute kids and marital romance) acts a feel-good counterpoint, the scenes become repetitive after a point. The other problem is that while the villain is formidable enough, his henchmen never come across as people who can pose a serious threat to Sethupathi. But, to Arunkumar's credit, there is hardly any lull in the film for us to start thinking about such niggles, and we just go along on this entertaining ride.","id":"56ebecf29251415e59001e30","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56ebecf29251415e59001e30","movie_id":369834}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**An honest cop's confrontation with a ruthless gangster!**\r\n\r\nRecently I reduced watching Indian films, but still hanging around Tamil films. Now and then checking out some parallel films, particularly the Vijay Sethupathi films. Police is a character that donned by all the top stars in Kollywood and saw tremendous success. So when I heard Vijay Sethupathi doing one, I don't want to miss it. Well, it was not a great film, not for the standards of Vijay Sethupathi I've been looking for. Because of little commercialised with traditional Tamil cop film style, including punch dialogues and the way of confronting the bad guy. Yet quite enjoyable.\r\n\r\nSethupathi is an honest cop. Married with two kids. The criminals are scared of him and so people in the department under him. Well, one day he tied up to investigate the death of a police officer. But it begins to take a twist every time he nears to resolve it. Soon a direct confrontation happened between him and the bad guy. And after a series of challenges exchanged between them, finally who would triumph and how it all happen are told in the final quarter.\r\n\r\nThis is the second collaboration between the director and the actor. Not the seen the first film, now I'll give it a try. It also a second collaboration between two lead pair after 'Pizza'. Nice performances by all, including the little ones. The domestic audience might like it better than the outsiders. Because it had all the ingredients they would look for. Even though I thought the villain was the most clich\u00e9d thing ever. Not just in this film, but any Tamil commercial films. For the international merit, it should have been a little better, especially leaving out the music videos would have done a better job. Then the film would have been pushed back to around hundred minutes. But I think it is still worth a watch.\r\n\r\n**6\/10**","id":"5a1ebfc40e0a264ccd07cd7c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a1ebfc40e0a264ccd07cd7c","movie_id":369834}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Not your ordinary night adventure in Seoul.**\r\n\r\nI have mentioned in my review for 'Train to Busan' that it has a prequel, but an anime. This is it, this is the one from the same director. Releasing them in a short time apart has advantages, as well as disadvantages. Like comparison is unavoidable, yet being different format is a big excuse. But both the films going have its fans backing.\r\n\r\nThis is not a high standard anime, but acceptable due to the quality of the narration. Yes the story was good. Like the live-action film, there are many unexpected thing happens. Particularly, you cannot trust anyone in this kind of survival game. It was a slow opening, followed by picking up the pace once the chaos was unleashed and then ended with a nice twist.\r\n\r\nOnce you watch this, you might say it could have made a decent live- action. I thought the same. Prequel or sequel, not bad at all, though it can't be compared to the original. Everything was a one night event, but not entire film takes place at Seoul Station. It all begins there, yet this film as well fail to detail on the source. Like from where it all started. Apart from that, quite an enjoyable anime with a few great tense moments.\r\n\r\nLike any ordinary day, the Seoul Station was calmly shutting down for the day at near midnight. But for the homeless people, it is a roof over their head. One of them discovers that his brother got injured badly, so he seeks help from the authorities nearby. On the other side of the tale, a father who finally discovered his runaway daughter staying with a young man. So the two rides together to find her who went out. Soon they all come to know the people are behaving weirdly. And after realising the serious threat of it, its now running for life. But would they successfully track down what they're looking for is revealed in the final segment.\r\n\r\n> \"If I had a place to go, I would not have stayed at Seoul Station.\"\r\n\r\nAfter watching a very satisfying live-action zombie film, and after learning about this one, I was looking forward to this day. A well made film, particularly after an average initiation, how it developed and ended was excellent. Most of you would enjoy the second half better. Overall, it has a good runtime and the interesting characters.\r\n\r\nThe voice-over looked fine. Since I didn't understand the language, it was not a big deal. Though the visual, I mean the sketches should have been a little better. In some parts, you will know that they used digital backgrounds, perhaps from 3D to 2D, particularly in the running scenes where you won't notice enough. So there should be some negatives and for me it was the connection between these two titles. The two films' timeline overlaps. I mean the final section of this and the opening parts of the other film.\r\n\r\nSince it took place in the night time, most of the people were not aware of what's going on in the streets. As a daybreak follows, more people on the street, big chaos and we know what happened afterwards, especially from the train passengers' perspective. Like I mentioned earlier, not knowing the origins of this sudden outbreak is the disappointment after watching both the films.\r\n\r\nYou might have heard that 'Train to Busan' is set to remake in Hollywood. If you haven't watched that, you should do now and following, this one too. Because of the connection, yet not compulsory as these films do not share much detail. It was just like 'Cloverfield' and '10 Cloverfield Lane'. Keeping update is worth suppose in the future any follow-up film are made. I liked this one, but a little lesser than the original. The other major difference is, watching the zombies (attack) in anime version is a different experience. Maybe you can say less frightening, those who are easy prey for such film. Anyway, worthy film. I would particularly suggest it to those who saw the previous film.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58f1593f9251415536005a17","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58f1593f9251415536005a17","movie_id":389868}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**You can achieve big being what you are.**\r\n\r\nA sports-biography, about an American footballer who came over many obstacles to become a successful player in college level league. Being a fat and youngest in his family, he had to go a long way to become what he wanted to be. This is an inspiring film for sports aspirants. Decently made film by an unknown director with good performances in it.\r\n\r\nWhatever it is, or you call it, for me it is a B movie, a fine one. Neal McDonough was the most recognisable face around and he was the backbone of the film after the lead character. The story was told from his perspective and was a bit emotional film than I thought. I don't know this game at all, but I can know what's going on, particularly hard working people to achieve some big in their life.\r\n\r\nIt is not a popular American film among Americans itself, but if you had heard about it and looking for a confident boost, this will do fine.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A father's desperate attempt for his daughter.**\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'Beyond the Hills'. I have not seen many Romanian films, but a couple of his films, so I had an anticipation and it fulfilled that. If you are familiar with his works, you will love it too as well. It is an Oscar material like 'Toni Erdmann', but Romania had sent a different film. The film had achieved multiple things, including majorly highlighting the social issues and the education system, particularly from the parent's perspective. But it is basically about a father and his desperate attempts for his daughter for her better future. So it is something like 'Fathers & Daughter', but on one particular topic and the on- screen presentation was so realistic without the background score.\r\n\r\nEverything revolved around what the title suggested. A father who is professionally a doctor wants to provide a better education for his daughter. While facing a series of vandalism, his family gets a major shock after an unexpected terrible event. It was just before the daughter's annual exam. So it seems they're all disturbed by it, but the father is still not giving up on his daughter's exam, which requires a better score to get into the best university in the world. Apart from that, his other side of the personal and professional life takes some major turns. The film reveals all his struggles while breaking some moral laws.\r\n\r\n> \u275dSometimes, in life, it's the result that counts.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe tale was told from the father's perspective and that character was seen almost in every frame. A good father knows what's best for his child, but sometimes crossing limits is what they do because of love and care. On the other hand, growing up kids, especially turning eighteen means that's when they actually begin to meet the real world. So basically they want to lose their parents' influence in their life as much as possible like when a baby bird starting to stretch its wings. Those stuffs were not prioritised here, but understandable from the developments we witness.\r\n\r\nFrom the social aspect, the corruption and educational demands, that's especially in the high scoring contest were the deriving plots from the main. The film could have been 10-15 minutes shorter if the father's professional side of the tale was not covered. It looked unnecessary, but fairly the part of the story when a slice of his life was what this film is about. I think not everybody sees the film's intention which is definitely not entertainment, nor inspiration, but kind of fact based on the parents.\r\n\r\nYeah, I would have done almost the same as what the father has done in this. But due to some parallel developments in the main story, he had to face extra pressure from his own family. So unexpected way the narration takes the turn towards the final section. That's disappointing if you had supported the father from the very beginning. But a lesson he had learnt for his approach to deal the affair that he thought is slipping away from his master plan.\r\n\r\nOverall, a very good film, something you will learn how some people plan to deal a difficult stage of their life that's impacted by other surrounding developments. My only, slight disappointment was the crime part of the story which did not meet my expectation, but in most of the case that's how reality would be. So this is for particularly the drama film fans, because coping with the pace requires a little patience.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"591b62fbc3a368423c072bb8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/591b62fbc3a368423c072bb8","movie_id":374458}
{"author":"tmdb16528852","content":"A compelling thriller with an open-ended ending that feels far too easy for what it had going for it.\r\n\r\nNocturnal Animals starts out very strong. It feels reminiscent of Lynch's Lost Highway or Mulholland Dr. The main character lives a luxurious life surrounded by some very striking pieces of art (art pieces which, throughout the story, make things even more thrilling and surreal). She reads her ex-boyfriend's novel which quite honestly makes us feel like we're in a bad dream. The way the novel starts out feels like Michael Haneke's Funny Games. Its opening scene with Aaron Taylor-Johnson so brilliantly builds in tension with his character's mind games. The story however turns into a bit of a tame crime mystery held up with a sort of fun performance from Michael Shannon. The potential to be a very cryptic thriller is there, but decides instead to put all the pieces together for us. As a Lynch fan, this movie made me crave something stranger. I really wanted to be left mystified but instead I got an ending that was kind of obvious.","id":"58d7f346c3a368124f057f92","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58d7f346c3a368124f057f92","movie_id":340666}
{"author":"iheardthatmoviewas","content":"We live in a country where our current presidential candidates fail to compare to our current president. We live in a country where minorities have been a subject to police brutality. We live in a country where you must enter debt by taking out a student loan and you are still not guaranteed a successful future. Are you uncomfortable yet? Comfortability won't be found here or in fashion designer turned director Tom Ford's second featured film Nocturnal Animals. The director forces you to become comfortable with being uncomfortable and the result is the most beautiful disturbingly gripping films of 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> From writer\/director Tom Ford comes a haunting romantic thriller of shocking intimacy and gripping tension that explores the thin lines between love and cruelty, and revenge and redemption. Academy Award nominees Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal star as a divorced couple discovering dark truths about each other and themselves in NOCTURNAL ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nDirector Tom Ford starts the film with a close up of a handful of naked older white females dancing nakedly with bodies society would be disturbed by. Ford does not focuses on just one part of the body but every piece of fat, extra skin, crease, scar, and stretch mark to really push your comfortability. No, Ford is not going for shock value, especially not so early in the film because there will be plenty time for that, but he is being nice of enough to give the audience a disclaimer. A disclaimer that nothing will be more comfortable than the opening sequence and if you couldn't handle that then Nocturnal Animals is going to be one hell of a trip for you. Heck, regardless, Nocturnal Animals is one hell of a trip.\r\n\r\nNocturnal Animals itself contains a double narrative strand which consists of Susan's real life and her bringing the book of her ex-husband to life. Ford does not implement a voiceover to let you know that you are now in the world of the book yet he makes you feel that you are watching another film. Ford pulls off a difficult task in making the audience care about both narratives and you want to believe that both are fictional then the uncomfortability levels begin to raise once again as you are forced to remember that one is indeed reality. Tony & Susan, the 1993 novel that the films was adapted from, unfolds how intimate the act of reading could be as an author could tap into the reader's thoughts, feelings and experience. Tom Ford pulls this same feat but just with the act of watching a film.\r\n\r\nWith his first job being a fashion designer, one would only assume to be blown away by the visuals Tom Ford would create. This is true as various scenes of LA and west Texas are beyond stunning but no one would expect the clash of visuals Ford would create with LA and west Texas. The transition from super cool and grotesque LA to a brutal, violent and revengeful west Texas will once again raise your uncomfortability levels.\r\n\r\nAfter all, this is a revenge film. We learn throughout the film that Susan, who comes from a wealthy family, falls in love with an inspiring author in Jake Gyllenhaal's Tony but would eventually go on to break his art in three different way. First, by telling him to take a step back from his dream of being an author. Secondly, aborting his child. Then, if the first two wasn't enough, she lives him for the handsome and dashing Armie Hammer's Hutton. Susan goes on to live the perfect life with Hutton and 20 years after her divorce with Tony, he decides to quietly place a novel about revenge in her mailbox. We feel Susan's chills as she reads the novel and without ever needing to say a word to her, Susan's perfect little world becomes to crumble\r\n\r\nJake Gyllenhaal and Amy Adams give us exactly what we expect from them. Aaron Taylor-Johnson offers a spine-chilling performance as Ray Marcus and Michael Shannon is fantastic as Bobby Andes. Tom Ford finally takes off his fashion designer hat and puts his fully-fledged director hat on as that was his approach with this film and two narratives. Tom Ford sustains the point that he is not a fashion designer turned director but a full-fledged director as a lesser director would have totally botched this film.","id":"581b44679251412808005716","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/581b44679251412808005716","movie_id":340666}
{"author":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","content":"A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com\r\n\r\nMost moviegoers weren\u2019t clamoring for a follow-up to 2013\u2019s smart magic heist thriller \u201cNow You See Me,\u201d but here\u2019s one of the rare instances where the sequel is actually better than the original. While viewing the first film would be helpful before seeing \u201cNow You See Me 2,\u201d it\u2019s not necessary. Even newbies can follow along with this slick magic show.\r\n\r\nThe Four Horsemen are back, this time fighting the powers that be with even greater illusions. Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt (Woody Harrelson) and Jack (Dave Franco) are now joined by Lula (Lizzy Caplan, a welcome replacement for Isla Fisher as the \u201cgirl Horseman\u201d). Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe) plays a tech nerd who forces the Horsemen to steal a chip so he can control all of the computers in the entire world \u2014 but who is really pulling the curtain? Mark Ruffalo is back as FBI agent and magician Rhodes. Here he still aids the Horsemen (and seeks to find some closure with Thaddeus (Morgan Freeman), a man Rhodes blames for the death of his father). Yes, there\u2019s a lot going on in this convoluted plot, but it is exciting from beginning to end.\r\n\r\nOne of the most enjoyable aspects of the movie is the elevated performances. I love the trend of casting accomplished actors in fun summer movies; I think audiences get a better movie for it. These are talented actors who visibly enjoyed working together; they play off each other with an effortless believability. Their repartee is lively and their visible enthusiasm for their roles (and the film) is contagious and as a result, I was smiling throughout the whole movie. Harrelson will probably be taking some jabs for his partially silly turn (I don\u2019t want to say how because I don\u2019t want to spoil it), but I thought he was ridiculously amusing. No matter how you feel about the film, you have to agree that these characters are a hoot to spend a few hours with.\r\n\r\nAs with the first film, this one is packed full of entertaining twists and fun \u201cgotchas!\u201d A lot of it is, of course, ridiculous, but interspersed throughout the flashy trickery are some truly funny and memorable moments. Most of the stunts are CGI animation but even though they are fake, they\u2019re still pretty damn cool. The big finale may be predictable but that makes it no less fun. I love the all of the misdirection this film includes (it\u2019s the perfect homage to real magicians and tricksters), and it\u2019s done in a witty and skilled fashion. Is this film as clever as it thinks it is? No. But so what? It\u2019s a fun, wild ride.\r\n**\r\nA SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com**","id":"579d0389c3a36837ea00105e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/579d0389c3a36837ea00105e","movie_id":291805}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**RE   \r\nVEN  \r\nGE**\r\n\r\nThis was simply awesome. I meant the story, but the presentation was not my kind. I got the story and I enjoyed it. The performances can't be neglected either. Both the lead, Jake and Amy were the film's highlight. But I also happy for Michale Shannon's Oscars nominee. Based on the novel 'Tony and Susan', but for the film adaptation, the title got inspired by the book that appear in the story. From the director of 'A Single Man' which is his comeback film after a long gap. I would say a good attempt.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a successful art gallery boss who got divorced and remarried to the man whom she was cheating with from her ex. Her decision was in particular influenced by her mother. Now she thinks she's happy, but one day her ex sends a copy of his latest novel that's dedicated in her name. Reading it, she realises the tough time he'd with their separation. Following the end of the book, she encounters an unexpected truth which could affect her life forever.\r\n\r\nA dual layer story. One was fiction and the other one in the real world. But the fictional tale highly influences the main narration and that's what I call the genuine writing. So the credit must go to none other than the original author. I have seen lots of revenge films, even it can be compared to 'Three Colours: White', but the major difference is the sweet revenge. For that alone the film was awesome. The climax was even better. If you understand the narration, you will enjoy it for sure. The filmmaking should have been a bit better.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Norm of the no worth!**\r\n\r\nSurely my review would annoy those who liked it. But the majority of who saw it was felt just like me. It has been 20 years since the first 3D animated feature film came. Not all the films released in this period were great. Some were technically sounded good and some were stories. If you had seen 'Hoodwinked!', you would know how awesome that story was, despite the poor animation production. But this film failed in all the department.\r\n\r\nI recently finished watching the first season of 'Trollhunters' and 'Miraculous Ladybug'. Even the television made products were much better than this film. Small budget, small production house et cetera is not an excuse. Thankfully, this is not the only bad animated feature I've seen so far in my life, but sadly it joins the list of those titles.\r\n\r\nMaybe! The little kids could enjoy it, who does not know to differentiate between good and bad. But for the adults, this is definitely skippable film. The best thing about this film was the message it carried, though, even for an animated film and a fantasy film, not convincing enough. It was kind of very similar to 'Delhi Safari'. In some perspective, I thought it was a remake of that. There are lots of other films similar to this like 'Chole & Theo', 'Happy Feet' and so on that you can try them instead.\r\n\r\n_2\/10_","id":"5951978ec3a3681498013dd1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5951978ec3a3681498013dd1","movie_id":276905}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Not seeing what's coming to them, but overcoming is their task to complete.**\r\n\r\nI never thought a sequel would be made. Now it seems this will going to be an unstoppable franchise, we could expect more, the next one was official, especially after considering how this film fared at the box office. All the main cast returned with the new ones. I think Daniel Radcliffe was good, first time I had impression like that on him after Harry Potter series. So good to see the two legends, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. The rest of the cast was good, but nothing to praise like they have pulled off the impossible. Overall, this is a good follow-up, but not best I was looking for. Though, the writing and direction were decent with some nice Chinese locations.\r\n\r\nThe story follows after some time where the first one ended. After the biggest heist, now they are back with the new public shows. A new member was included, a female to balance with the existing ones. While performing a show, they had to abort it in the middle when the cops raid them. This time they are tricked by some unknown people and land in a foreign territory. In order to escape from there, they had to play what was instructed to them and so they comply with it. When their boss comes to their rescue, the things around them begin to change. So how it all ends was another twist.\r\n\r\nThe film was two hours long, but not bad to hook for that long when pace and the story looked better. I'm not fully satisfied, particularly about the China. I know Hollywood found its second home, but that does not mean they have to add China flavour all the time to just make money in China. They might succeed from it, particularly from earning Yuan, but I'm the not happy, the world is not happy about that. You can make full length China subject film, but this kind of altering script is becoming sick. Because all the major films trying to do the same thing. I disliked this from that perspective. So sorry Hollywood, better luck next time.\r\n\r\n_5.5\/10_","id":"57ed87eb9251414c9a00040c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ed87eb9251414c9a00040c","movie_id":291805}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Realising what's left behind was the home.\r\n\r\nHere comes the most expected adventure in the 'Divergent' series. I always wondered what lies outside the wall. So this sequel takes us to the new land where a fresh development takes place. A few old characters were terminated in order to introduce a bunch of new ones. As a theme, it just looked like 'The Scorch Trial', but of course totally a different setting. \r\n\r\nThe director was retained from the previous installment and I think he did a good job. The concept was too familiar. 'Scorch Trial', 'Catching Fire', 'Aeon Flux', all these films are just like this one. Thankfully, this story was decent. At least better than the previous and weaker than the first. The pace drastically held back due to the split of a book into two films. It has been done in the old days, but the present trend began after 'Deathly Hallows'.\r\n\r\nI was excited to know how big stretch it is going to be as a story wise. Because it looked like the things they've accomplished in one place and looking to explore beyond the boundary. I couldn't predict the story, but I knew what's going to happen in the end of every scene. The dystopian theme was clich\u00e9d, not the storyline. The way it ended is a sign for a big finale to commence in the final film of the series.

They all seeing each other after a long time and they bring their works, issues and everything along.

Because this kind of film is thematically same, but usually screenplay and the comedy parts are derived. If they make those parts right, then it'll meet somewhat viewer's expectation and do better at the box office. A decent cast, though Danny Glover presence was the film's highlight. Well created characters and the executions were not bad either. Surely you would laugh aloud in a few scenes. Bit a long film, but engaging plot.

Nominated for Costume Design, but I expected the Best Actor, Actress, and particularly Original Screenplay and Motion Picture. This amazing spy thriller-drama was directed by Robert Zemeckis of many popular flicks. The best casting in the recent films and visually so good of those 40s atmosphere, like it be the war or the society.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of two spies from different nation who meet in Casablanca for a mission. Pretending to be a newly wed couple, soon they enter the real wedlock. The rest of the tale follows a couple of years later when a big question arises, in that they have to prove their innocence. Failing it could lead them to a serious consequence. So the narration filled with suspense and thriller takes over with a greater pace till the end.\r\n\r\nObviously the film was long, but I did not mind or I could say I did not know how the two hours went on so quickly. Engaging plot kept me my focus on the screen. As we know, all these years the Oscars turned down the best performance recognitions, including this one for Brad.\r\n\r\nBefore going to watch this film, I thought it was another World War II film which might be inspired by the real. But it was not. Takes place in the background of the same war, but this is a spy film. And their personal life and profession, how one another influences is what revealed. Now I don't know when such kind of a great spy thriller I'm going to watch next. I think it is massively underrated, especially stupid film critics and their takes on it was unbelievably wrong.

Hence, **The Divergent Series: Allegiant** is an over-stuffed mechanical continuation of a familiar film franchise trying desperately to fulfill its colorful action-packed whimsy left over by its pumped-up predecessors.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, **Allegiant** is the third episode of the **Divergent** movie series. Of course Veronica Roth is the literary voice responsible for the books on which these films are based. Jokingly, one would probably imagine that both Roth and **Hunger Games** author Suzanne Collins are twin sisters seeing as though their imaginative wells of creativity are similar in style and content. The only difference is that Collins's notable blueprint registered with forceful reception while Roth's wannabe material was like an identical shadow trying to break out in its own shade. \r\n\r\nBasically, **Allegiant** (much like the rest of the YA genre) is a glorified teen soap opera bombarded with awesome ray guns and youthful cynicism aimed at the controlling over-30 Establishment. Distrust and disillusionment is the recurring theme and the penalty for being young, attractive, repressed and rebellious is a cautionary tale for those that want to challenge the sinister Authority. As with **The Hunger Games'** Katniss Everdeen (played by Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence) we are subjected to Divergent diva Tris Pryor (Shailine Woodley) as the feminine firecracker ready to spring into action defeating the aging forces threatening their post- apocalyptic presence. Unfortunately for Woodley's Tris she does not possess the explosive brooding or riveting material and eye-opening challenges that Lawrence's Katniss was blessed with from the get-go. At least one common denominator is clear: both bad-ass babes have totally catchy, cool-sounding names, right?\r\n\r\nThe sluggish plotting in **Allegiant** revisits the enclosed post-apocalyptic Chicago where various \"factions\" of young folks are furiously fighting with one another. The tension is percolating big time as the trapped youthful residents are growing increasingly restless. The disenchanted Tris, along with her studly boyfriend Four (Theo James) and group of rebels, decide to break out of their Chicago-bound doldrums and climb the wall to escape their entrapment. Of course this means crossing over some treacherous terrain to reach a more, idyllic surrounding. The destination, as it turns out, is the comfortable haven for the monitoring overlords spying their every step.\r\n\r\nThankfully, Tris and her bunch stumble upon a picturesque civilization headed by leader David (Emmy-winner Jeff Daniels). The surroundings look idyllic but David is very shady because his agenda is to recruit the pure and precious Tris for his genetic experimentation. With Tris as his main guinea pig the devious David can plan on using his experimental agenda on the underprivileged pretty kids back in the walled-off Chicago. The educated guess is that David most likely would extend the same kind of testing treatment for \"the Fringes\" as well (they are the masses that exist outside the wall of Chicago in less flattering pockets of the region). In any event, Tris represents the ideal vision for his replication of purity and perfection to be transferred to the \"damaged\" souls out there. While Tris is intrigued by the CEO's intention for bettering the impoverished population Four is skeptical about David's focus on his gun-toting honey bunny. \r\n\r\nTo say that **The Divergent Series--Allegiant** is clunky and convoluted even for a showy older kiddie caper is an understatement to say the least. Director Robert Schwentke is basically on auto pilot here as the cameras roll while capturing the drawn out degrees of splashy stunts, showdowns and bombastic special effects flourishes. The silly-minded plot and utter familiarity of the \"Big Brother watching over the young perished pretty people\" feels empty and repetitive at its compelling core. One cannot perceive the transparent concept of **Allegiant** going through the motions without looking at this anemic actioner as a convenient means to bridge the upcoming remaining installments to protect its promising box office clout. So for those looking forward to **Ascendant** please hold your horses because this is what **Allegiant** strives for...to make one salivate over the next due edition to this tiring movie series.  \r\n\r\nSure, **The Divergent Series--Allegiant** and perhaps **Ascendant** will offer more of the same and if this is something that its avid fans do not mind then fine...knock yourselves out to your heart's redundant content.\r\n\r\n**The Divergent Series--Allegiant** (2016)\r\n\r\nLionsgate\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 1 min.\r\n\r\nStarring: Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Naomi Watts, Octavia Spencer, Ray Stevenson, Jeff Daniels, Zoe Kravitz and Miles Teller\r\n\r\nDirected by: Robert Schwentke\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Sci-Fi\/Action & Adventure\/Fantasy\/Romance\r\n\r\nCritic's Rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng 2016","id":"56ef1f14c3a368226e00cadb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56ef1f14c3a368226e00cadb","movie_id":262504}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Alice returns to the wonderland for a new adventure.**\r\n\r\nBased on the nearly 150 years old children's book, and a sequel to the 2010 film. Its quite a long gap for a follow up film, but the original cast has returned and directed by 'The Muppets' famed filmmaker. So, I was not expecting it since I considered the first film an average. All I wanted was a normal live-action 'Alice in Wonderland' films, but I disliked this weird make-ups and large head characters. In that perspective, this one was much better. Still, this is not the best, but definitely a lot better than the previous one.\r\n\r\nA simple adventure story with nice graphics and performances. The Alice returns to the Wonderland for a new adventure where she has to cross the layers of the present, past and future. So in one word, this is a time travel theme in the fantasy genre. Mia Wasikowska ruled it, she was everywhere. She overran all other characters and takes the toughest challenge to achieve impossible.\r\n\r\nNearly a two hour journey into wonderland might make happy for little kids. Because it did not look like a normal fairytale, but very modern. This is not the Disney's best film, so I don't think there will be any more sequel. I want it to be rebooted, but not any time soon, at least a decade of gap needed. So I hope they won't rush and ruin this classic tale like three 'Spiderman' reboots in less than 20 years. Meantime, this film is okay for watching once, though I'm not in favour to recommend it to anybody except little children.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"581cf605925141370f001213","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/581cf605925141370f001213","movie_id":241259}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Navarasa Thilagam is yet another glorification of the wastrel. It has yet another TV personality-turned-actor playing the lead. And, yet another educated heroine character falls for this uneducated, unambitious guy, who proudly proclaims to his friend his only goal in life is to make 16 babies with this girl! If there is an honorary membership to the Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam, this guy will be the top contender for it.\r\n\r\n'Ore deal-u oho-nu life-u' is Moorthy's (Ma Ka Pa Anand) philosophy in life. A school dropout with a bar owner for a father (Ilavarasu), Moorthy wishes to make it big as real estate developer but mostly whiles his time away. And when does try something, his naive attempts only get him into more trouble. He chances upon Chitra (Srushti Dange) at a railway station and instantly realises that he has to marry her. So, with his friend Alangaram (Karunakaran) in tow, he tries to woo the girl. But her father sees through his motives and manages to keep him away. So, he befriends Thirunavukkarasu (Siddharth Vipin), a two-faced ration store employee, who is about to get engaged to Chitra's sister. However, on the day of the engagement, he learns of a family truth and halts the event, and this only angers Chitra's father (Jayaprakash) further. Will he be able to marry the girl of his dreams?\r\n\r\nA derivative film that borrows a lot from the films of Sundar C, Ezhil and Ponram (every scene reminds you of something you might have seen in another film), Navarasa Thilagam is a film that thinks of itself as a comedy while not making an effort to be one. The writing is quite bland (there is zero effort in building up the central romantic track) and the narrative predictable (we even get a hapless 'foreign mapillai'), and it is left to the cast to shore up the film. Ma Ka Pa, to his credit, tries hard to make us believe that he is the low-budget producer's Sivakarthikeyan, but Karunakaran is wasted in the role of a comedy sidekick, with the script never letting the character do anything substantial. The only wisecrack he is allowed is in the scene when the hero tells him his life's ambition. Meanwhile, Siddharth Vipin is once again given a kid-adult fat guy character, and he tries gamely to play the fool, but for how long can we pretend that a fat guy farting or a character reading Sidney Sheldon as Chutney Sheldon is funny?","id":"56ebeccb9251414408001fd5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56ebeccb9251414408001fd5","movie_id":382730}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Watching Natpadhigaaram - 79, you might feel that you have stepped into a time machine and gone back to the 1990s. The film is directed by Ravichandran, whose claim to fame is his debut film, Kannethirey Thondrinal, a late 90s film that, like this one, was also an ode to friendship. We get the staple \u2014 romance, misunderstanding, breakup, accident and a climax that almost ends in an airport!\r\n\r\nThe film gives us two pairs of lovers \u2014 Jeeva (Raj Bharath) and Pooja (Tejaswi), and Aravind (Amzath) and Maha (Reshmi Menon). The four become friends and start hanging out together. However, Jeeva's family mistakes his rapport with Maha for love and fix their match. Individual situations around this time result in the four not being able to contact one another. Jeeva and Maha realise the mistake, but they are unable to explain this to their families, because Maha's father has only recently had a heart attack. Meanwhile, Aravind and Pooja, who do not know of the ground reality, assume that they have been betrayed and decide to cut their ties off with the other two.\r\n\r\nNatpadhigaaram is the kind of film where every conflict will get resolved if only the characters give each other a few minutes to talk and explain things. And the director, too, is aware and even has a character say something to this effect in the climax. If you can buy into this conceit, the film becomes a moderately interesting one. Ravichandran keeps things ambivalent by giving Jeeva and Maha more in common and does the same with Pooja and Aravind. The former is dependent on their families for emotional support in a way the other two aren't. Jeeva is constantly shown standing up for Maha. He picks up a fight with people at the pub when they tease her; when he is dropping her off at her home, he waits until she has reached her gate on; and so on. The same goes for Aravind and Pooja, who both have rich parents and are interested in starting a company together. Their parents see this as being compatible with one another but they aren't attracted to each other in the same way they are to their respective partners.\r\n\r\nThere is something nostalgic in the old-fashioned way that Ravichandran weaves his plot. And the friendship between the four, too, isn't over dramatised. But the problem is that his scenes that show why the leads cannot talk things out are weak. That Aravind and Pooja don't even attempt to give the benefit of doubt to their respective lovers even once feels unconvincing. And after building up the central conflict for almost the entire duration of the second half, the director resolves it too conveniently in a matter of minutes, with the help of a character \u2014 Jeeva's friend \u2014 who, until then, only seemed to be a hanger-on. This character, too, is an element from the films of the 90s. In films of that period, he would be played by a comedian (with his own comedy track). He will have a clearly defined relationship with the hero and when he finally pours his heart out, it would feel plausible. In fact, the director's debut film, too, had this same device. But this isn't the 90s, and the director has to invent something new to serve this purpose. But Ravichandran half-heartedly introduces this 'friend' character in one scene, and has him pop up during the climax in a way that doesn't feel organic. He isn't able to generate tension or make us care enough about whether the friends get together. Even a life-threatening accident to one character, which is desperately introduced to inject some climactic tension, eventually turns into smoke without fire.","id":"56ebeeeb92514143fe002206","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56ebeeeb92514143fe002206","movie_id":388323}

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Even for a horror comedy, the premise of Naayagi feels flimsy. It involves Sanjay (a game Satyam Rajesh), a sleazeball, who decides to take his girlfriend 'conservative' Sandhya (Sushma Raj, decent) to his friend's farmhouse with the intention of sleeping with her, even as he is trying to enter into wedlock with a rich woman. They are diverted to a \"restricted area\" where people have been mysteriously disappearing from for years. The bungalow they move into is haunted by the ghost of Gayathri (Trisha), who aspired to be actress, and has been taking out men who have wronged women. And the duo becomes her target for almost 70 per cent of the film that after a point we begin to feel as if the video is being played on loop. \r\n\r\nThen, we get the flashback. After all, those who have stuck with the film till then deserve to be told why the ghost, for all her powers, doesn't kill the guy right away, right? Ganesh Venkatraman appears in this episode channelling Sathyajith of 16 Vayadhinile (perhaps that's why we see Gayathri often humming Senthoora Poove), but we hardly get any surprise in finding out what had happened then. \r\n\r\nNaayagi seems to have been made targeting the people who made Aranmanai a success (the film's clips are even featured in this one), and the tone (and the tacky makeup and the shoddy visual effects) seems to have been borrowed from that film. But the problem is we never find any of the scenes funny. Even Brahmanandam, who appears in a cameo that doesn't do justice to his comic skills, cannot goad us into laughing. But unfortunately, we are actually tickled only during the scenes where petite Trisha is shown as a scary ghost.","id":"57e8ba1e9251412987019de9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57e8ba1e9251412987019de9","movie_id":363314}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"The high-concept premise of Nambiyaar is filled with promise \u2014 what if a film can give a name and form to a character's id, and let that character run amok? Jim Carrey's Me, Myself & Irene explored a form of this concept (where the lead character had split personality) to greatly enjoyable results. Ganeshaa tries something similar (though, this isn't an 'inspired' film). Here, Ramachandran (Srikanth), an ordinary young man preparing for his IAS exam, gives a name (Nambiyaar) and form (taking features from the people he hates most) to his id, and tries to control it. And it is in this battle between Ramachandran and Nambiyaar (Santhanam), that Saroja (Sunaina) gets caught. \r\n\r\nBut the film is far from enjoyable. The problem is that Ganeshaa wants us to take the actions of Nambiyaar only as humour, but the jokes here make you squirm as they are sexist remarks and ill-mannered actions disguised as comedy. Also, in the second half, even when the onscreen happenings suggest something serious (a drunken Ram beats up his dad and brother in public), the director goes for a comic tone, that is jarring. \r\n\r\nSome of the scenes are amusing, though \u2014 Ram and Saroja being seen together at various places out of sheer coincidence (which her father misconstrues as a romantic relationship), Ram's sister-in-law's every line coming across as if she is acting, and Ram's frequent run-ins with a cop (John Vijay, who gets to play weird yet again). Even the cameos are pleasantly surprising. \r\n\r\nThe film's delayed release is evident at times (in one scene, we see a poster of the 2013 film David), but MS Prabhu's cinematography ensures that the film doesn't feel dated visually. The leads are passable, though Srikanth, at times, tries too hard. Agreed he is playing the id, and has to convey a man's base desires, but most of Santhanam's dialogues are cheap and tasteless. Be it dialogues like 'Sandhegapatta dhaan true love' (justifying Ram's doubting of Saroja's character), 'Silent-a cooperate panna naan violent-a panna maaten' (when Ram tries to molest Saroja), or his description of the character of girls based on how they ride pillion on bikes, and his reasoning that the heroine is in an agitated state because she's wearing a tight bra, they are quite in bad taste. This has got to be his most irritating role till date. And to think that this film was made at a time when he was in good form!","id":"57ba741ac3a3687cf2003af7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ba741ac3a3687cf2003af7","movie_id":280945}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"The first question that pops up after watching Narathan is 'How did this even get made?' Our best guess would be that everyone involved seems to have just listened to the one-line meta premise and thought that they were making something great. The premise isn't without potential, but it needs a script that is water-tight and a director who knows how to execute it. Sadly, Naga Venkatesh's script is childish, and his direction haphazard that we start fidgeting barely moments into the film. \r\n\r\nNakul plays Vishnu, who encounters Maya (Nikesha Patel) on the train. He saves from men who are chasing her but happily doesn't bother to ask why they are after her. His uncle (Radha Ravi) is a producer who has invited director Narathan (Premgi Amaren) for a narration. As Narathan narrates his story, we realise that the same events are happening at the same time in Vishnu's life as well. The director spends the entire first half making almost every character run behind one another. Vishnu and Maya are chased by goons. They are also chased by his uncle's underlings \u2014 a trio of fools, led by MS Bhaskar. Vishnu's friend is somewhere in this mix as is Maya's (who is actually Shwetha) lover. And there is also Sowmya, Vishnu's murai ponnu. There is even a gigantic dog! \r\n\r\nAnd some time into the second half, the director realises that his audience are on the verge of going into a stupor and finally decides to reveal why Maya\/Shwetha is being chased. It involves a money-minded school correspondent (Subbu Panchu) and the film makes some noises about how education has become a business, but by then, we are beyond caring for anything than the end card. There is another revelation \u2014 the story that Narathan has been narrating was actually written by Power Star Srinivasan. And that is perhaps the only time the film makes any sense.","id":"5703680292514162510007df","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5703680292514162510007df","movie_id":330406}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"In the initial phase of his career, Vijay had to bank on his father, SA Chandrasekaran (SAC) to turn him into a hero. Now, it is the turn of the father to piggyback on his son's stardom. Every now and then, Vijay and people and things associated to him are brought up every now and then in the hope that these will get the audience whistling. When the film's other lead tells his name is Vijay Kumar, a kid asks, 'Oh! Namma Vijay a?' In one scene, SAC asks a gangster if he has seen Thuppakki and goes on to recreate a scene from the film to get information. And one character is called Sangeetha, after Vijay's wife, and this girl refers to SAC as 'uncle'. Then, there is also a dialogue where SAC's character boasts, \"Captain, Thalapathy-kellaam training kuduthavan\".\r\n\r\nThe plot revolves around Velusamy (SAC), a 70-year-old ex-military man who becomes a sensation after a video of him beating up goons on a bus goes viral. But, Baby Anaconda (Naan Kadavul Rajendran), the gangster whose men he thrashed, tries to take his revenge by colluding with the assistant commissioner, Sathyamoorthy (MS Bhaskar) and targeting Vijay Kumar (Pa Vijay), the journalist who made Velusamy popular. Can this 'angry, old man' (as the tagline describes him) foil the plan?\r\n\r\nNayyappudai makes it clear that it wants to be a masala movie, with an old man doing things that are usually done by a mass hero. But the problem is that the execution is so clumsy, with no sense of the filmmaking basics. The film feels like someone shot the scenes and then assembled them in a slapdash fashion. And there is uncertainty over every choice \u2014 should Naan Kadvaul Rajendran be treated as a comedian or as a real villain? Should MS Bhaskar be menacing or amusing? And for all its invocations of all things Vijay, SAC's character is mostly seen with a toothpick between his lips, a la Suriya in Anjaan! This confusion exists even with who the director is - is it M Jeevan, who is credited as the cinematographer and director when the film ends, or is it Vijaya Kiran, who is credited as executive director (whatever that means) during the title credits. As for the audience, there is only one decision to make: which is the bigger loss \u2014 the money spent on the ticket or the two hours spent watching the movie?","id":"56ebed93c3a368225100246c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56ebed93c3a368225100246c","movie_id":373908}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A guide to how to get away with a murder!**\r\n\r\nI have never seen the original television series, but I came across and found it interesting to try, only to realise in my watch that it was not what I thought of it.

I was like looking for a proper intro. The introduction of everything, as I'm not familiar with anything out of it. But it did not come, the story just went on and on from the opening itself.

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Well, Britain\u2019s bombastic booze-loving fashion figureheads are back for some familiar naughty fun and frolicking for committed _AbFab_ fans to rejoice. So brace yourself \u201csweetie darlings\u201d as TV-based drunken divas Patsy and Edna make their boisterous and cheeky return to the big screen in the off-kilter and shrewdly amusing **Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie**. \r\n\r\nClearly, ardent followers of the _AbFab_ dipsy duo will embrace the further hazy-minded exploits of Edna Monsoon (Jennifer Saunders) and Edna Stone (Joanna Lumley) as they are given permission at the box office to create more large scale chaos that laid the feisty foundation for their high-wire antics on the boob tube from the early 1990\u2019s.\r\n\r\nThe movie adaptation of **Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie** stems from the highly popular British sitcom originally aired on the BBC network. Saunders, the creative mastermind behind the pop cultural _AbFab_ phenomenon that started out as a French & Saunders (as in Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders) sketch soon found its free-spirited footing as a television series that would repeatedly return into the fold for many years until dismissing production in the summer of 2012. Now four years later Saunders and Lumley are back as the alcohol-sipping, flamboyant fashionistas embroiled in yet another scandalous romp.\r\n\r\nAs loyal and nostalgic _AbFab_ enthusiasts already acknowledge the premise involves the London-based lushes in middle-aged divorcee Edna (\u201cEddy\u201d) and hanger-on Patsy\u2014both curiously successful in the local fashion industry despite their heavy-handed indulgences. Both rough-around-the-edge women are hardened in drinking, chain-smoking, shopping, clubbing, and man-hunting while trying to desperately cling to their youth-oriented recklessness. Somehow Edna and Patsy manage to juggle their high-powered fashion careers with the extreme cartoonish vices that make them rather\u2026er, colorfully erratic.\r\n\r\nOf course the running gag in the off-balance jocularity centered in _AbFab\u2019s_ riotous storm is the sensible yet long-suffering Saffron (Julia Sawalha), Edna\u2019s grounded daughter that had been forced since childhood to keep her protective eye on her self-destructive mother and her smashed cohort Patsy whenever they get into the latest saucy mess that has been initiated by their hilarious hedonism. Often reluctant in totally tolerating Edna\u2019s chaotic whims poor Saffron is forced to be the headstrong \u201cmother figure\u201d to the inebriated woman-child (and her surly boozy buddy Patsy) that is the wacky woman she calls Mom. \r\n\r\nNo doubt that **Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie **will fill the empty void for the demanding comical outlandishness that defines British TV\u2019s beloved foul-mouthed fashion plates. The swinging and sordid sensation that is the tipsy tandem is even more pronounced than ever. Director Mandie Fletcher skillfully fleshes out the over-the-top impishness of the flighty AbFab leading ladies and encourages the fun-loving damage and disarray to unfold as only Saunders\u2019s Edna Monsoon and Lumley\u2019s Patsy Stone can instinctively muster up in inspired insanity. Set against the eye-popping background of exotic locales and basking in splashy and unconventional wardrobes **Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie** dutifully reinforces the intoxicating zaniness that had made Edna and Patsy the celebrated cockeyed cougars within the realm of applauded _AbFab_ fandom.\r\n\r\nIt is still a welcomed revelation to witness the party-hearty maturing misfits revel in animated bad behavior. Indeed, Edna and Patsy are still trying to live the high-life as they frequent various fashion events around town. However, the reality is that Edna is financially strapped as her PR firm has not been profiting richly for her. When your clients only consist of has-been songbirds Lulu and Emma \u201cBaby Spice\u201d Bunton then it is certainly time to hit the panic button. Still, this does not stop Edna and Patsy from making their unruly presence known throughout the fashion scene around London. \r\n\r\nAt one particular fabulous party the mischievousness heightens when Edna accidentally sends supermodel Kate Moss reeling into the Thames. Believed to have perished as the result of this clumsy incident Kate is pronounced dead and Edna is arrested and scrutinized. This, of course, causes a public relations nightmare for Edna, Patsy and Edna\u2019s granddaughter Lola (Indeyarna Donaldson-Holness). The paparazzi (you know\u2026the menacing media hounds known as today\u2019s \u201cvillainous vultures\u201d) are increasingly intrusive to the point that Edna and Patsy flee to the South of France to escape the glitzy backlash.\r\n\r\nAnyone not acquainted with the hovering lunacy in the _AbFab_ universe will probably see this film as an extended TV episode catering exclusively to the show\u2019s devoted fanatics (they would not necessarily be wrong about this assessment). The on-going jokes, sight gags, chippy dialogue and the assembly line of noted cameos throughout **Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie** may be perceived as a stretched-out, tired gimmick. Actually, this \u201creunion\u201d of sorts is a refreshing throwback for the AbFab diehards that viewed the devilishly free-wheeling Edna and Patsy as liberating and truthful broken women in all their comical debauchery. \r\n\r\nThankfully, both Saunders and Lumley have not lost a step in portraying their characters\u2019 juicy narcissism, self-indulgence and sense of entitlement. In fact, **Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie** and its television blueprint from yesteryear serve up an unassuming commentary about aging womanhood and its vulnerability in a progressive, young-minded world. In a global society that visually and psychologically recognizes youth culture and external beauty the raucous tendencies of Edna and Patsy are quite understandable as their detestable tendencies are a way of numbing their unacceptable realities\u2014as older women in denial while afraid to let go of a wild youth-oriented existence now realized as a mere reminiscence. \r\n\r\nPerhaps **Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie\u2019s** 90-minute running time is too excessive for the random high jinks of Saunders\u2019s and Lumley\u2019s titillating teammates. Plus, the aforementioned cameos that include a who\u2019s who from either side of the pond are gleefully stuffed in the plot to help along the off-the-wall, padded proceedings. \r\n\r\nAmong the Hollywood and fashion personalities that turn up for igniting this revisit to _AbFab_ craziness include Emmy-winner Jon Hamm, LuLu, Stella McCartney, Chris Colfer, _Game of Thrones\u2019_ Gwendoline Christie, Jerri Hall, Suki Waterhouse, Barry Humphries, Joan Collins, Mo Gaffney, Dawn French, talk show host Graham Norton, Emma Bunton, Alex Jones\u2014the list of notables seems endless. \r\n\r\nAt least _AbFab_ sycophants (casual or hardcore) can boast that their cherished drinking damsels Edna Monsoon and Patsy Stone are more naturally engaging and stimulating in the satirical cinematic setting of fashion than say the two mediocre movie outings of _Zoolander_ featuring the forced buffoonery and insufferable mugging of Ben Stiller\u2019s Derek Zoolander. \r\n\r\nIn hindsight, let\u2019s stick with the entertaining substance abusing sass of Britain\u2019s delightfully decadent fashion floozies.\r\n\r\n**Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie** (2016)\r\n\r\nFox Searchlight Pictures\/DJ Films\r\n\r\n1 hr. 30 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Jennifer Saunders, Joanna Lumley, Kate Moss, Indeyarna Donaldson-Holness, Julia Swalhala, June Whitfield, Jane Horrocks, Chris Colfer, Kate Moss, Jon Hamm\r\n\r\nDirected by: Mandie Fletcher\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng 2016","id":"5795691192514142390069ec","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5795691192514142390069ec","movie_id":372411}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Director Jake Szymanski\u2019s fictitious siblings Mike and Dave need more than wedding dates in this baseless and brainless raunchy comedy. For starters, it needs to wipe off its monotonous mediocrity as a lame laugher laced with empty-headed vulgarity and cheap chuckles straining for manufactured amusement. The genre regarding raunchy comedies had always had that miss-or-hit gamble about its cockeyed presentation. For the tedious and tepid **Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates** it is safe to say that it will not be on the Mount Rushmore of classic naughty farces in the tradition of _Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Porky\u2019s_ or the _American Pie_ film franchise anytime soon. \r\n\r\nBanally sluggish and lazily crass, **Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates** tries desperately to register its juvenile high-wire impishness as inspired lunacy but the profane randomness of Szymanski\u2019s (along with screenwriters Andrew Jay Coleman and Brendan O\u2019Brien) jiggle-and-giggle romp is about as riotous and inspired as a drippy diaper. Thankfully **Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates** does not entirely sink to the forgettable levels yet of say the earlier released fetid raunchfest Dirty Grandpa (although both films features principal players Zac Efron and Aubrey Plaza in the cast) but that still is not saying much for its feeble defense.\r\n\r\nThe problem with most modern youth-oriented sex farces is that ready-made mentality of delivering shock value debauchery that have no sense of coherence or irreverent purpose to support the so-called funny, bouncy rhythms of the movie is sloppily realized. Instead, filmmakers focus on promoting outrageous and recycled ribaldry without arming the unconventional story with something more serviceable and solid. Essentially Szymanski tosses the stilted zaniness against the wall hoping that anything sticks as proposed hilarity.\r\n\r\nThe Stangle Brothers in Mike (Adam Devine) and Dave (Zac Efron) is a couple of mischievous misfits that attract mayhem whenever possible. They revel in the sordid good times and are proven to be a handful for their exasperated parents Burt and Rosie (Stephen Root and Stephanie Faracy). The only ray of hope concerning Burt\u2019s and Rosie\u2019s success regarding offspring comes in the package of daughter Jeannie (Sugar Lyn Beard). Jeannie is preparing for her upcoming wedding and appears to have something concrete going on in her life more so than her \u201cparty-hearty\u201d bone-headed brothers.  \r\n\r\nAnyhow, Mike and Dave are subjected to the ultimatum set by their frustrated parents to \u201cstraighten up\u201d and grab some semblance of maturity. The source for getting this dim-witted duo to shape up involves their baby sister\u2019s Hawaiian-based wedding. If Mike and Dave were to attend Jeannie\u2019s exotic ceremony they must grab respectable dates otherwise reject the notion of becoming part of their sister\u2019s life-changing, special occasion. One of the puzzling aspects of this toothless plot is to ponder why these sibling screw-ups would seriously care to change their wayward ways by a parental threat of not showing up at their precious sister\u2019s island-based nuptials? Oh please\u2026\r\n\r\nIn any event, Mike and Dave get busy trying to fish for formidable escorts but this proves futile until an Internet ad seeking \u201cnice girls\u201d for a Hawaiian getaway draws considerable attention as loads of women take notice.  As the many female applicants react to Mike\u2019s and Dave\u2019s sensational date to the scenic 50th state for some gorgeous sun and fun there are two tarts in particular that pop out of nowhere in Alice and Tatiana (Anna Kendrick  from \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d and Aubrey Plaza from the aforementioned \u201cDirty Grandpa\u201d).\r\n\r\nAlthough they are stimulating as eye-candy for the brothers to drag to Hawaii both Alice and Tatiana fail the required prerequisite as being goodie two-shoes companions for Mike and Dave. In fact, Alice and Tatiana are quite the opposite but must hide their true nature as bombastic bimbos with acid tongues if they are to take advantage of the golden opportunity to travel to picturesque Hawaii. Predictably, the devious dates fall into their genuine selves as rambunctious chicks\u2026something that Mike and Dave must deal with concerning this clumsy deception by the riff raffish Alice and Tatiana.\r\n\r\nNo doubt that **Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates** intended to be some throwaway chuckle-minded showcase searching for its titillating temperature of off-kilter jocularity. Sadly, this moronic movie is reduced to going through the run-of-the-mill tactics of broad jokes falling flat, lightweight sight gags, silly-minded pratfalls and attractive profanity-spewing undesirables that are somehow supposed to tickle our collective, indiscriminate funnybones. Consequently, everything in this callous concoction of a comedy feels relentlessly artificial, overwrought and forced. \r\n\r\nSure, the off-the-wall characterizations in the main foursome of the Stangle sibs and their tag-along traveling trophies are expected to be a fine hot-mess. Nevertheless, the whole production unintentionally strives to be that same hot-mess but for totally different reasons. Efron, a veteran of a string of painful cockeyed comedies that some of his most ardent female fans might have trouble recalling, channels his familiar wild pretty boy persona from Neighbors\u2026one of the very few flicks worth mentioning on Efron\u2019s flaccid filmography. Devine\u2019s Mike comes off as achingly overbearing as the brother with the showy awkwardness to match the synthetic obnoxiousness.  Kendrick\u2019s Alice does not seem remotely convincing as the phony \u201cdecent date for hire\u201d. At least Plaza\u2019s Tatiana shows some modicum of plausibility as the bad girl grounded in rawness.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that **Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates** could not have added anything fresh or subversive to the trivial table with the noxious material and other regurgitated clich\u00e9s that bombard these notoriously flimsy R-rated spectacles with a pseudo-provocative pulse. It is safe to say that watching the eye-rolling shenanigans of Mike and Dave Spangle on the big screen is enough to call this whole exhausting affair beyond a dating disaster.\r\n\r\n**Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates (2016)**\r\n\r\n20th Century Fox\r\n\r\n1 hr. 38 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Zac Efron, Adam Devine, Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza,Stephen Root, Stephanie Faracy, Sugar Lyn Beard \r\n\r\nDirected by: Jake Szymanski\r\n\r\nMPPA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: * \u00bd stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\nFrank Ochieng \u00a9 2016","id":"578c47c19251413fa4005a21","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/578c47c19251413fa4005a21","movie_id":316023}
{"author":"heartly","content":"Midnight Special is an entertaining Sci-fi flick that ultimately never reaches it's full potential. The father son on the run story is griping and well played with the talent of Michael Shannon who is believable as a father who will do anything to get his gifted son to where he needs to be. Dunst and Edgerton do some fairly solid work also as Altons mother and I believe step father. The dialogue is believable, the action and Sci-fi elements are all well put together. The concept almost ET like is interesting. The CGI is acceptable if not spectacular. The music well scored if not memorable. I personally found this movie felt long at 1h52mins and for some reason I felt the movie should of been set in an earlier time period like the 70s or 80's. These are small personal gripes and you may ask why it does not achieve it's full potential. The answer is simply the way it ends, it felt small or empty. These characters had done so much,  for this child and somehow the movie had left me with zero emotional connection to how the story played out. The father and son connection was the strongest element in the movie and this I felt needed a bigger part in the ending of this film, but for some reason they chose to pull back on this right at the buzzer. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Science fiction as a worthy watch. My final score 3.5 stars.","id":"58cfdbb4c3a36811ce005a39","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58cfdbb4c3a36811ce005a39","movie_id":245703}
{"author":"Gimly","content":"_Miss Peregrine's_ could have done with a little more peculiarity. I understand that the lead is our door into this fantastical world, but a character can be relatable without being downright boring. Not an outright bad movie, but certainly not the one to put Tim Burton back on track.\r\n\r\nEva Green is golden but under-utilised, Sam Jackson can barely talk through his fake teeth, the creature designs are fantastic but pulled off with some very poor CGI. There is a little stop-motion to counter this, but again, it's not used to the degree it should have been. Which is really an apt description for the whole thing. Over an over, _Miss Peregrine's_ hints at a great movie buried somewhere within it, but what we end up with is an ill-paced mess. The only truly engaging character momets of the whole story are dropped as soon as they crop up in favour of the \"Good VS Evil\" rhetoric you've seen a million times before.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._","id":"57ef77e7c3a3683c88001135","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ef77e7c3a3683c88001135","movie_id":283366}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**New school, new beginning and a new set of rules to adapt. What bad could happen.**\r\n\r\nNot good as I expected, either not bad as what the majority those who saw it says. The film was based on the book of the same name and the first one of I think in the nine book series. It tells the story of a middle school boy who transferred to a new school. Having no friends, straight he falls prey to a bully. Beyond that, the principal turns his life in the campus even harder with all his strict rules. His real adventure begins when he starts to break every rule and bring chaos, as well as joys in his schoolmates. From this, how the remaining story shapes are told with a twist.\r\n\r\nThere are similarities with this and many other films, particularly 'Wimpy Kid...'. Those interfering animations resemble that film. It's like a normal protocol in these days children film, so no complaint on that. But I'm very impressed with the quality. This film was too childish. I mean there's nothing wrong for the kids watching it, they will enjoy it. But for the adults, who had seen lots of middle school themed films of the 80s and the 90s, so it might look an average one. A good film for families with young kids. I particularly suggest to the such category audience.\r\n\r\nThe twist was unexpected. It was easy, but I did not go deep to predict that. I think most of you all too fail to see it coming. Particularly in a film like this who would think of it. That was not enough for me to like the overall film. It is entertaining in parts, but an average film from the inside and outside. Even though I hope they would turn the remaining books as well into the films. All these words I wrote in this review because of I'm being a non- target-audience. So if you are a kid or kid's film fan, ignore my saying and watch the film.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"58b0967cc3a368236d00026f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b0967cc3a368236d00026f","movie_id":369883}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The innocent peculiar children versus the monstrous peculiar adults.**\r\n\r\nI thought it should have been a Steven Spielberg film, but he would have compromised on the visually frightening negative characters. Particularly from the little children's angle who are the regular target audience for a theme like this. Even in his recent 'The BFG', you know how the giants were portrayed. So Tim Burton was the right choice and he did his best. But not everybody agrees on that, even I was slightly disappointed. I mean technically it sounded so awesome, but the story was not that impressive. Because of too familiarity, except the peculiar characters.\r\n\r\nIt was based on the young adult book of the same name. The story of a boy named Jake. After his grandfather's murder, he goes to Wales to find the children from an island home about the stories he had heard when he was a little. He discovers they are intentionally stuck in a time loop to avoid their enemies from striking them. But what they feared is about the come true, so now how they plan to defeat after half a century hiding from them is to be told in the rest of the segment.\r\n\r\nAs a children's film fan, I wanted to like it, but not fully satisfied. It was a two hour long film, the first half was an introduction that we saw everything from its trailers and teasers. So I lost interest in those parts, but once the clash between the good and bad had began, the film started to give something new. Again the final battle at the fair should have been designed better. I thought Samuel L. Jackson was not untilised well.\r\n\r\nThe major issue with the film was the narration not trying to take a big step in the story development. Felt like they are aiming for a sequel, so they are avoiding to give out everything in here itself. Similar to the first 'Twilight' film, which was too boring drama. It is almost out of the big screen now and the rating further going to drop. The film critics bashed it, but seems most of the people and film fanatics enjoyed it. I hope they will make 'Hallow City' and I'll be waiting for that.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"585ed423c3a3681a6201304b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/585ed423c3a3681a6201304b","movie_id":283366}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Well one certainly cannot accuse filmmaker Tim Burton from straying away from his trademark bizarre movie-making playbook. Perhaps Burton\u2019s best asset when it comes to his brand of distinctive cinema is to faithfully maintain that solid sense of oddness in the manner for which he presents his randomly spry, off-kilter narratives? There was always this consistent understanding that Burton enthusiastically embraces the whimsical peculiarities of his colorful, cockeyed characterizations. Naturally, the eccentric Burton would be drawn to yet another off-balance project that is right up his weirdly imaginative alley. Hence, in **Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children** the notoriously quirky director is true to form as he presents another delightfully macabre and freakish showcase that will definitely appeal to the darkened nature of the kiddie crowd.\r\n\r\n**Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children** is the big screen adaptation of Ranson Rigg\u2019s popular young adults trilogy. The film is an instant magnet for Burton\u2019s off-the-cuff style and standard of warped whimsy. The Sci-Fi enhanced children\u2019s fantasy is highlighted effectively by visually arousing set decorations, breath-taking CGI special effects, eye-popping costumes and an overall wonderment of interestingly deformed yet capable super-powered youngsters with unusual gifts that define their unique identities. Screenwriter Jane Goldman (\u201cStardust\u201d) dutifully captures the misguided magic of Rigg\u2019s best-selling novel brought to life that is very reminiscent of an atmospheric _Harry Potter-esque_ universe where one can easily detect that stimulating Hogswarts vibe bursting at the seams. The only viable knock on **Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children** is that Burton has explored this twisted territory before thus giving the familiar illusion that he is making the same movie over again but with some updated dressing. Still, the surreal stamp of Burton\u2019s animated movie mindset is enough to recommend the erratically conceived **Miss Peregrine\u2019s** as a frolicking fun-filled fable riddled with perky-minded naughtiness.\r\n\r\nThe construction of **Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children** is a strange brew that brings together the assembled working parts of a previous Burton Gothic-looking spectacle with similar elements meshed in the movie-related mechanics of such ditties including Mary Poppins, the aforementioned _Harry Potter_ film franchise, _Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory_ with a touch of a junior-sized _X-Men_ sentiment attached to the proceedings. Basically, Burton encourages his kooky kind of whirlwind escapism where he wants to transport the audience into a hazy maze of unstable, creepy hedonism embedded in indescribable gaudy chaos. It is no secret that Burton looks to incorporate his known ingredients of strangeness, endearment, gentle terror and slight wackiness. The majestic concoction, for the most part, works on the welcomed senses.\r\n\r\nIn the title role of **Miss Peregrine** is the fetching Penny Dreadful star Eva Green (one of Burton\u2019s featured actresses from his 2012 film \u201cDark Shadows\u201d). The nostalgic backstory of Miss P. and her mixture of rejected orphans is recalled in detail by a Florida-based retiree named Abe Portman (Terrance Stamp) who revels in enlightening his teenage grandson Jake (Asa Butterfield) about the remarkable wonder woman and her special orphanage stationed on a Welsh island. Clearly, Jake thinks highly of his grandfather\u2019s fascinating vintage storytelling but feels like an outsider especially when his own parents think that he is in need of serious counseling. When Jake is not engaged in Abe\u2019s recollections of his old pals from Miss Penegrine\u2019s orphanage (complete with handy black-and-white photographs for proof of his proclamations) he works at the local supermarket in uneventful fashion.\r\n\r\nAs legend has it poor Miss Penegrine\u2019s Victorian orphanage located on the island of Cairnholm was demolished by Nazi bombs that rendered her and the kids vulnerable during World War II. However, we are also informed of the supernatural tendencies of the resilient lady and her \u201cpeculiar children\u201d. For one, Miss Penegrine can turn herself into a\u2026wait for it\u2026penegrine falcon at a moment\u2019s notice. As for the bird beauty\u2019s charges they too possess noteworthy specialties in appearances  and spellbinding prowess as well although not as accepting as Miss P\u2019s accentuated tricks.\r\n\r\nJake had always viewed his grandfather\u2019s accounts of Miss Penegrine and her peculiar children in question as a compelling revelation especially when he was younger. Jake, courtesy of his indifferent folks, saddle him as the caretaker for the ailing Abe. However, when he uncovers his dementia-ridden, dying grandpa Abe babbling endlessly about monsters and everything connected to the Miss Peregrine universe this sparks an immense curiosity about Jake wanting to further explore Abe\u2019s whispered claims of seemingly exaggerations. Jake is convinced that Abe was murdered\u2013no doubt by the so-called monsters\u2013and wants to further the cause by visiting the mysterious European island that planted so many adventurous memories in his grandfather\u2019s childhood back in the early wartime forties. Additionally, the concept of time bubbles known as \u201cloops\u201d figure into the suspense. The loops are a designed invention by Miss Penegrine to keep her endangered wards safe from the period\u2019s on-going harm.\r\n\r\nSince Jake is already in therapy and everyone thinks that the troubled kid has a screw loose in the aftermath of the trauma regarding his deceased beloved grandpa Abe it is suggested that maybe a visit to the Welsh island would put to rest the inner conflict within the young man. So Jake\u2019s father Franklin (Chris O\u2019Dowd) accompanies his son to Cairnholm where he can sort out his lingering angst. Can Jake successfully locate his grandfather\u2019s old-time orphanage and come to his own elusive conclusions? Soon, the modern-day Jake will experience his own time-traveling warp where he will at firsthand encounter the captivating kids that were included in youthful Abe\u2019s existence including the lovely Emma (Ella Punell) that strikes his fancy\u2013the same gal that his grandfather crushed on back in his heyday.\r\n\r\n**Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children** is a jumbled gem that does not quite separate its eerie realm from other Burton-oriented fare that shares the same branding of visual makeup found in entries such as _Beetlejuice_, _Edward Scissorhands_ or _Dark Shadows_. Nevertheless, **Miss Pelegrine\u2019s** is stunning although the half-baked plot bounces aimlessly at will. When Jake is transported back to 1943 and witnesses the peculiar-looking children we are truly in awe of Burton\u2019s tangy taste for the cartoonish craziness. Children that are cursed (or blessed) with head-scratching anomalies not to mention the haunting images of Hollowgast monsters and Green\u2019s fetching but crafty spellbound diva in Miss P all establishes an intriguing off-balance children\u2019s Sci-Fi fantasy that hits more than it misses its nightmarish target.\r\n\r\nBurton assembles some notable names that fill the circus ring surroundings in **Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children**. The explosive Samuel L. Jackson is on board as the villainous Barron looking to feast upon the peculiar kiddies\u2019 eyeballs. Veteran performer Stamp is convincing as the aging Abe whose descriptions of his 40\u2019s-era childhood inspires Butterfield\u2019s Jake to make this disjointed journey into Burton\u2019s devilish and daring vision of eccentricity. Other supporting players include the magnificent Judi Dench\u2019s Miss Avocet, Emmy-winning actress Allison Janney (from TV\u2019s \u201cMom\u201d) as Dr. Golan and Rupert Everett as the resident ornithologist.\r\n\r\nSurely, **Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children** won\u2019t entirely disappoint avid Burton fans as he delivers what amounts to be a safe serving of sideshow cinema ready to please the entertaining palates of gentle grotesque-loving moviegoers everywhere.\r\n\r\n**Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children** (2016)\r\n\r\n20th Century Fox\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 7 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Eva Green, Samuel L.

{"author":"Reno","content":"> A secret road adventure during the dark hours!\r\n\r\nSo the Jeff Nichols and Micahel Shannon saga continues. This is theirs 4th film together in the last nine years and all of them were well accepted. Now they are into sci-fi for this, which is kind of a road movie that resembles hundreds of other films. Only thematically, but in parts it looks different, especially for being too realistic as what the director is famous for. Finally, something is not a comedy or a full of CGI, yet still it is a wonderful sci-fi-drama with some thrill moments.\r\n\r\nIt opened like the midway of the story. We obviously have to wait for a proper explanation to know what's going on, who is the child and where they're taking him. So it all begins with two armed men driving a young kid on the dark hours. Only we know is that they are protecting the boy from the government people, but the film took some time to give a clear picture of the condition. In the meantime, I started my prediction game, but I expected the film to clarify how it all began. It never cared about that part, only moved forward and that's how we're going to get some answers where a few might feel its a let down.\r\n\r\nThe negative of the film is you won't fully understand it, but it is not an incomplete story, just designed that way that leaves for the viewer to add their own perspectives to where the writer left blank spaces. Like I said the people are comparing it with the similar films and I did not care about that, but I disappointed with the conclusion. It was neatly folded, I actually liked it, but it was not fresh, especially it totally mirrors 'Tomorrowland'. Now I know why Warner Bros moved it from last year to this year's release.\r\n\r\nIt might be a coincident because the director who is also the writer has a good reputation, so I believe it is definitely not a steal, just a common creative that we've already seen many films like that. Overall, this film is worth, but might not satisfy the Jeff Nichols fans, because like I said plenty of times before in my reviews, now it the sci-fi era and every filmmaker and film-star want to board on that plane. So it did not spare Jeff Nichols as well.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"57c8b4a4c3a3685be6000b65","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c8b4a4c3a3685be6000b65","movie_id":245703}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Sorry Mike and Dave, it's an Alice and Tatiana's free vacay.**\r\n\r\nI should be honest that I had some good laughs, but not the overall film was impressive. For me it was a chick film, and Anna Kedrick and Aubrey Plaza are the lead actors. I really loved their parts and that's the reason I had no issue watching it, but like usual Zac Efron ruined it. I won't blame him completely, but he and Adam Devine's roles did not deliver as what the title expresses. I mean they get their wedding date, but the title should have been 'Alice and Tatiana Goes for a Free Vacay' or something like that.\r\n\r\nIt was like a 'Brideamaid' kind of film, but there are too many adult jokes. The story was sort of based on the real, and that's just a joke to begin the narration. The advertisement was real, but the remaining story was fictional. From there, how the plot developed was totally makes no sense, but it does not matter because it is a comedy. Especially the initial parts, but later on, it gets better, only the comedy wise. In some way it was not bad, and not good either to recommend to others. So it is nothing more than a decent timepass film, but some people might find it most annoying.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"580e463dc3a36859a40019d4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/580e463dc3a36859a40019d4","movie_id":316023}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A mastress stroke!**\r\n\r\nAnother American politics, why should I care! If you are saying like that, then you are missing out something wonderful. First of all it was not based on any real, except the gun control theme that rocked the US recently. Nor it was adapted from a book. That's really got me. This was a beautiful screenplay and I could not think how flawlessly someone has written just for a film, not for a book. Secondly, in todays world where the voices were raised for the equal rights\/opportunity for women, this film became a great example to head on the right path.\r\n\r\nIt opened with a court scene, then went back to flashback to reveal everything that happened in between period. There's a voting is to take place in the parliament for the introduction of a new bill. The miss Sloane's firm splits over differences and hence two teams fight for one another in the same matter, but to achieve the opposite result. Pursuing the MPs and all other dramatic events takes place, while they are ready to go any length. Then the story comes to an end with a twist with one of them victorious, but a heavy price has to pay it.\r\n\r\nYou might won't like the politics, but this is not one. This is something like the story of an election campaign team. How they work to achieve their goal, particularly keep checking their rivalry. So it was more or less a cat-mouse game kind, but the perspective was not shared equally. The majority of the film was from miss Sloane's angle. Just like from 'Zero Dark Thirty', Chastain has been simply awesome. One of her career best performance for sure. I don't get it how this film had missed the Oscars race. She should have won the best actress award. I might a little late to watch, but I did not miss it. So I hope you too as well not to miss it.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"59bd9166c3a3681b15017d27","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59bd9166c3a3681b15017d27","movie_id":376290}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Before I start I should perhaps mention that, although I consider this a family movie, it is perhaps a bit on the scary side for the youngest member of the family. Anyway, personally I liked the movie and so did my kids. \n\nIt did have time travel in it which I, in general, utterly dislike but it is a Tim Burton movie so it was already a foregone conclusion that it would be a wee bit bizarre anyway and it had Eva Green, which is one of my favorites, in it so that kind of made up for the time travel crap.\n\nThe movie starts of by Jacob watching his grandfather being murdered by some mysterious being that only he can see. Of course everyone believes that he was hallucinating and so off we go with hospitals and shrinks and so on. Finally his parents allow him to travel to the island of Cairnholm in search of the mysterious Miss Peregrine.\n\nFrom their on we wander into the wonderful world of \u201cBurtonesque\u201d bizarreness, fantasy and general weirdness. Naturally Jacob meets Miss Peregrine and her kids. Kids who each have some peculiar talent each more weird than the other.\n\nNaturally there are a some bad guys lurking in the shadows as well. Bad guys intent on destroying Miss Peregrine\u2019s shelter and \u2026 well, let us just say that they are not exactly concerned for the children\u2019s wellbeing. I liked the bad guys. Both in their half human form and their more scary monster form. I especially liked Samuel L. Jackson as Barron, the boss bad guy. He really made an excellent performance.\n\nThe one person I did not like was Jacob\u2019s father. Apart from being a jerk he looked like he was on drugs or sleeping pills throughout the entire movie.\n\nOn the whole this was perhaps not the best of Tim Burtons movies but it was still a good and enjoyable one. Decent special effects. The story worked despite the enormous paradoxes introduced by the time travel stuff. The characters did a fair performance. I did not regret the 2+ hours I spent on watching it.","id":"5a926d95c3a3682502019a06","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a926d95c3a3682502019a06","movie_id":283366}

{"author":"sam_Hamilton","content":"https:\/\/www.60inchcenter.com\/home\/2017\/8\/18\/sam-hamilton-standard-candles\r\n\r\nManufacturing Connections between All Living Things with Sam Hamilton\u2019s Standard Candles\r\n\r\nStandard Candles, a multimedia exhibition by Sam Hamilton, explores the nature of time, sound, composition and relativity, transporting viewers into a visual and auditory space not quite of this era or dimension. Hamilton\u2019s pieces exhibited in Standard Candles are a fusion of many contemporary art forms, combining film and video, sculpture, visual storytelling, sound, montage, and performance art, engendering an exhibit that requires multi-sensory and multi-dimensional involvement. Through continuous loops and montage style video pieces created using manual film (super 8 and 16mm), and sculptures made to look like vinyl albums, Hamilton\u2019s exhibition seems at first glance to be a collection of adjoining rooms filled with random, unrelated pieces. When reviewed more closely, Hamilton\u2019s exhibit seems to be asking us all to be critical of our \u201cobjective assumptions of order and time\u201d, as well as our notions of measuring humanity and likeness (Dykstra, 2017). The pieces in this exhibition work together in a way that transcends the limitations of exhibition design and connects to viewers in a variety of ways, be it sound, memories, dreams, or notions of physically connecting with the natural world. Hamilton asks us to find a collective purpose in seemingly standalone things, while providing us a variety of avenues to explore these connections.\r\n\r\nHamilton\u2019s piece, David Attenborough Presents: The History of Evolution \/ The Evolution of History (2012), a short 2:21 film, depicts Hamilton himself, strangely holding a large stack of heavy books, using them one by one to create a pathway into the distance. Before the last book hits the ground, the loop stops and begins again, resulting in an unsettling feeling due to the perpetual, looping notion of incompleteness. This piece is the first visible when stepping into exhibition, so viewers that feel the need for closure after viewing this loop may continue on to find resolution throughout the remainder of the exhibit.\r\n\r\nThe most time-consuming piece for Hamilton in Standard Candles was derived from Carl Sagan\u2019s famous quote, \u201cIf you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe\u201d. Apple Pie (2016) is a full length feature made up of ten short films (Pluto, Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune) (Dykstra, 2017), where Hamilton playfully sought to satisfy Sagan\u2019s heavy demands for making an apple pie. Nearly an hour and a half in duration, this collection of short films fuses aesthetics from early 3D-style digital animation to avant garde contemporary video clips that could have been made any time in between 1980 and today.\r\n\r\nLooking past the unusual array of costumes (ranging from dreamlike feature-less rainbow suits to culturally-symbolic attire) and predicaments framed in this film, Apple Pie hints at the interconnectedness between all living things through diverse aesthetic, auditory, and compositional implications. The fragmented collage-style composition used in Apple Pie is jarring at first, though with continued viewing becomes more cohesive and sensible. Each short film tells a story of its own that ties into the whole, quite like how the individual pieces of Standard Candles have significance both individually and as a series. Hamilton\u2019s exhibit is laid out sparsely and across multiple spaces, making it difficult to pair pieces that could have functioned more successfully together with closer proximity or greater visual association.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the easily-overlooked connections between Hamilton\u2019s works, the perplexity of each piece encourages deep consideration about their implications and meaning. Because of the lack of consistency in exhibiting his video work (some were projected from floor to near-ceiling while others were displayed on mid-sized flat screen televisions), and the sparse placement of his relatively small album sculptures found on either sides of otherwise blank walls, focus was not drawn to any particular piece, likely to remark on the importance of the exhibition as a whole, and the lack of importance of cohesive display.\r\n\r\nWhile Standard Candles could have been more successfully designed in layout and composition, the integrity of Sam Hamilton\u2019s work cannot simply be disintegrated by imperfect presentation. His use of grainy, flickering film provides a beautiful and unique 1970\u2019s-esque component to his video work that is not easily (or successfully) replicated through today\u2019s digital formats. Hamilton\u2019s multi-methodical storytelling approach offers viewers a variety of ways to experience his work, through documentary, silent, loop and montage film, and handmade sculptures of old albums, each method used to explore different ways in which we interact with and understand the world. His pieces embody peculiar scenarios, ones that seem vaguely familiar yet impossible in the real world. While the comfort of familiarity inspires an immediate connection between viewer and piece, Hamilton introduces a sense of discomfort through techniques like masking facial features, connecting a living, standing body to a tree with cloth, and tossing books in a line like stepping stones.\r\n\r\nThese videos, picturing arbitrary scenes, make a point: that humans connect to things and each other in an infinite amount of ways, whether they have had an alike experience, dream, thought or fear igniting that connection. Hamilton\u2019s work uses these sensory triggers to stimulate these associations and establish meaning that is personal and unique for all who experience his exhibition. The result is a meaningful reflection of the human experience, and a wordless commentary that everything that surrounds us is relevant and connected.","id":"5de9f9ca3faba0001917ceae","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5de9f9ca3faba0001917ceae","movie_id":403010}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"As the title indicates, Appa dwells on the role of fathers \u2014 how they bring up their kids becomes a deciding factor in their children's lives. Like some of his previous films, in this one, too, Samuthirakani touches upon a few socially relevant issues. To start with, there are three fathers \u2014 Dayalan (Samuthirakani), a humanitarian who has high hopes on society, Singaperumal (Thambi Ramaiah), a self-centered person who is concerned only about his ambitions, and Nadunilaiyan (Namo Narayana), a well-calculated man who always prefer to be on 'safe side' in life.\r\n\r\nThe story kicks off when each of them is blessed with a child, and they try to instil their philosophy of life into their respective kids. Dayalan's wife can't digest the fact that the former wants their son, too, to adopt his progressive ideologies. All hell breaks loose when she realises that her husband is planning to make their child Vettreeswaran (Vignesh) a 'good person' than a 'well-educated' man with a white-collar job. On the other hand, Singaperumal is keen on making his son Chakravarthy (Raghav) a doctor, despite a not-so-effective protest from his wife. His principles and insistence on an over-disciplined lifestyle become a nightmare for Chakravarthy. Nadunilaiyan, too, brings up his child Mayilvaganam (Nasath) in a way that he wants him to be \u2014 asking him to stay away from all sort of issues which would lead to an uneasy life. His wife, however, has little say at home. The story focusses more on the relationship between Dayalan and Vettreeswaran, and the father-son episodes are a delight to watch.\r\n\r\nAs all the children grow older and reach their mid-teens, each of them chooses a career \u2014 quite obviously, Vettreeswaran succeeds in pursuing what he likes, thanks to the guidance of his father. Chakravarthy struggles to meet his father's endless expectations. Interestingly, Mayilvaganam manages to put up an impressive show in his area of interest, despite a not-so-common physical problem and discouragements from his father.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Vettreeswaran and Chakravarthy fall for (read infatuation) girls (played by Gabriella and Yuvalakshmi respectively), whom they happen to meet at different situations. Dayalan, who has been successfully maintaining a friendly rapport with all the children, including the girls, becomes a reliable father figure for them. Even as the plot moves at a slow pace, an unexpected tragedy hits them putting one of these lives in danger. Nadunilaiyan feels bad when he realises the mistake he has been doing to his son all these years, while Singaperumal has to pay for his unjust deeds.\r\n\r\nDespite the sluggish narration at a few places and the clumsy making, Appa, for sure, throws light upon a few issues which need to be addressed promptly. Prominent among them is the little-known horrible life students lead in the educational institutions and the manipulation which influential people resort to, for justifying the wrong doings. Samuthirakani excels as an actor again, though this is not one of his best roles. However, as a director, he gets too preachy. Thambi Ramaiah puts up an impressive performance. It is the little boy Nasath who is the attraction of the film, while Vignesh, Raghav and the girls are apt. The music by Ilaiyaraaja hardly contributes to the film, as does Sasikumar's brief appearance.","id":"57ba6a6d92514142fb0026bb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ba6a6d92514142fb0026bb","movie_id":402696}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Curiosity led them to involve in a greater danger.**\r\n\r\nIt was the other Zack Galifianakis film that I watched back to back. 'Mastermind' was a fun crime film based on the true event, but this one was purely fictional action-comedy. Once again the casting looked so good. Particularly Gal Gadot, her involving in it after becoming Wonder Woman is a hype. So anyone to anticipating some great action sequences is normal, but it was average on that section.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is nothing to do with the 2009 film 'The Jonese'. The characters seem quite resembling, like between and about the neighbors, but totally different plot. When a new couple move into a vacant house, the one in the neighborhood suspect there's something going with them. After all the efforts, when they come to know the couple's true identity, they're already involved in their undertaking and now cooperating is the only way out. So how it ends with their entanglement takes the film to its final stage.\r\n\r\nComedy scenes were good. Not that much clich\u00e9d, so one can have a decent fun watching it, especially with a low expectation. Both the lead women were hot, despite not much cleavage in the film. There are some unexpected parts too, but as a comedy, it was much better. And as an action & spy film, it doesn't do much to impress. Overall, a passable film, particularly comedy wise.

I don't know these actors or the director, but that's not the reason I did not enjoy it. The story was average, like it was inspired by the Keanu Reeve's 'John Wick'. I mean, how far a man can go to avenge his pet animal's murder, but here it was a rescue mission. Maybe that's how they got the title, just kidding. A very interesting theme, but not a well written screenplay. This story lacks the clever scenes and dialogues. The comedies were not bad, but I've seen better one in a similar style.\r\n\r\nThe two cousins decide to hangout when one of them is going through the breakup thing with his girlfriend and the other one's family is going on a vacation.

So the mission begins and they pose as the notorious drug dealers and go through many hurdles, but will they succeed is what the film is to reveal in the final act.\r\n\r\nWhen the film posters released, I already lost interest in this. Because those imitating posters of other famous films were totally unimpressive. Beside, those kind of idea is old, not anymore fun and I'm tired of them. This is a below average film, but a decent B movie. The production was top notch, but the film did not deliver with the same standards. The twist was good, in the end, it was very common.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Not a sequel in any way to last year's Darling, Darling 2 is a rather sombre horror film that leaves you unimpressed despite some commendable camera work (Vijay Kartik Kannan) and sound design (M Ravi and Arun-Seenu). It begins promisingly with a young woman possessed by the unknown being branded schizophrenic. The action then cuts to Arvind (Kalaiyarasan) and his friends. Their friend Ram (Rameez Raja), whose look-alike brother Krishna is also part of the gang, had committed suicide a year ago, and the group decides to go on a trip to Valparai for a change of scenery. There, they discover that Arvind has been possessed by the spirit of Ram, who wants to kill him for his betrayal that resulted in Ram getting separated from his lover Ayesha (Maya).\r\n\r\nThe problem with Darling 2 is the matter-of-fact narration of the plot, which, we are told in the end, is inspired by true events, and director Sathish Chandrasekaran forgets to make it fun for the viewer. Neither does the film boast of any noteworthy scares nor does it have any memorable laughs (Ramdas's one-liners hardly make us smile). Even if the intention was to give us a horror film unadulterated by comedy, the film is emotionally empty, despite some half-hearted attempts at milking the friendship angle. The reason why the ghost(s) want to take revenge on Arvind, too, lacks emotional heft. Interestingly, like in this week's other horror release, Hello Naan Pei Pesuren, the ghost(s) take over the body of a living person just for the sake of being with its lover!\r\n\r\nSome of the scenes involving the ghost are scary but the filler portions (mostly involving the friends hanging out together) are quite uninteresting. Repeatedly, the director sets up an intense scene (say, the scene involving Balaji's encounter with the ghost for the first time) only to end it on a downbeat note. In the end, the film starts to resemble a sound and light show that promises a lot but doesn't stay engaging for long.","id":"57036893c3a36822b80007f4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57036893c3a36822b80007f4","movie_id":369936}

My biggest complaint is the way that the movie was made to be about twice as long as necessary.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"The opening minutes of Dharmadurai bring to mind Seenuramasamy's previous released film Neerparavai (the film that he shot after that, Idam Porul Yeval, is still lying in the cans and even gets referenced here). Like the hero of that film, the protagonist of this one, too, is an alcoholic. The first time we see Dharmadurai (Vijay Sethupathi, solid), he is at a local bar, and the director shows us how his oafish behaviour is a constant source of embarrassment to his brothers (each one named after the Pandavas of the Mahabharata), who even plot to harm him grievously to stop him from maligning them further. His mother, Pandiyammal (Radikaa), is the only one who stands up for him, and we get the sense that there is some reason behind Dharmadurai's alcoholism.\r\n\r\nBut the director holds on to that for quite a while, instead choosing to narrate the college days of Dharma. We see his gang of friends, which includes Stella (Srushti Dange) and Subhashini (Tamannaah, who does a commendable job dubbing for herself), and the two pine for him, the former openly, and the latter in silence. Then, there is their saintly professor Dr Kamaraj (Rajesh), who keeps urging them to treat the profession as a service and work in the villages. And finally, we get the reason for Dharma's need to seek solace in alcohol. We are introduced to Anbuselvi (Aishwarya Rajesh), a worker, whom Dharma falls in love with, and we learn how, despite his do-gooder nature, the romance ends in tragedy because of the greed and regressive attitude of his brothers.\r\n\r\nDharmadurai has a great central conflict \u2014 how even a person with good intentions can become a liability for someone else because of those around him \u2014 but Seenuramasamy's resolution of this conflict feels unsatisfactory. The director takes too long to get into the story, and uses a framing device about a bag of cash that Dharmadurai mistakenly takes along with him when he leaves home, which gets his family into trouble. This adds some tension to the initial scenes, but soon, it is side-lined for the campus scenes, which come across as artificial. And the redemption angle is resolved midway into the second half, and we do not have anything else to care for after that. The director fills the remaining time with a less involving sub-plot centred around Dharma and Subha, and brings in the matter of the money again through developments that do not feel organic.\r\n\r\nBut the film does have genuinely affecting moments, and actors like Aishwarya Rajesh (once again typecast as a poor woman), Radikaa (confident), MS Bhaskar (subtle) and Rajesh (fantastic) enhance the ordinary writing in many of the scenes. The repeated stressing of the need for altruism gets tiring at times, but in these cynical times, it does leave you with a warm feeling. There are quite a few moments (like the entire segment involving Anbuselvi) that convey what this director is capable of, but the synthetic sub-plots pull the film down and prevent it from becoming the emotional roller coaster that it should have been.","id":"57ba74c992514143220035d2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ba74c992514143220035d2","movie_id":373587}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Unlimited twists and turns with well kept suspense.**\r\n\r\nThose who were complaining about mainstream films, particularly the non-Indians, the recent time has been in their favour. It was some time since the change has begun, but now the gaps between mainstream and parallel cinema is narrowing. The good news is it's not just Kollywood, but every Indian film industry taking this stride remarkably. Since I'm very attached to Tamil films, my observation says the quality of those film contents were comparable with international standards. Why I'm saying that with confidence is there's a chance this film would be remade elsewhere around the globe.\r\n\r\nSo now you might be curious about this film. It is not a brain teaser. It is simply a mystery, but the developments, especially the film characters never stop till the final. Like the title says, up to 16, the new characters keep coming not giving any space for you to breath. So predicting anything makes so hard. All along the twist and turns, including a couple of them were clich\u00e9d which were needed for a screenplay like this, particularly to divert the viewer's attention from foreseeing upcoming scenes. In a similar, I thought I found a big flaw, but after some time moving ahead further I realised I got it all wrong.\r\n\r\nA middle aged man who recently retired from the police service after an incident that led him to lose one of his legs, recalls a series of events of his final days on the duty with a guest aspiring IPS officer. So going 5 years back when a double murder in the same residential area took place, the investigation kick-starts with bringing-in three suspected youngsters. But later, from different angle of the same incident adds more complication. After joining all the pieces together still they only get different theories, but not truth. That final piece in the puzzle revealed only in the last minute, which deciphered in a style.\r\n\r\n> \u275dKarma is a boomerang. However far you may hurl it... It will bounce back to us.\u275e\r\n\r\nOnce you watch finishing it, you will come to know it was a straight story, but turned into a nonlinear narration. Especially the different characters coming into the frame at different stages of the narration are the most cleverest part. It's good to recall everything you saw to make sure you understood the film. Some people watch such film twice and it is surely not a bad idea. But like I said, it is not a briantwister if you focused enough since the beginning. This is one of the shortest Indian films, so the pace was super fast to cover every detail.\r\n\r\nThe entire film was a flashback. That's the main reason to give preference to only the most needed parts. But from the audience perspective, the story they learn can be viewed from any angle for a different result. I mean, some of us usually choose sides if there's a rivalry in the tale. In this film it was a guessing game surrounding the deaths. Except a very few characters, no one stays for very long which only fuels the mystery further.\r\n\r\nThe best part is there's no lie, like any film character committing one to escape the law. The narration only avoids the full detail which is what makes us tough to crack the nut. Those given false statements never see the light on the progression, which is a big hint you if you are watching it for the first time to stay on the right course to possibly come close to the truth before the film reveals itself.\r\n\r\nIt's the writing and the direction that makes this film great. From Hollywood to French, Korean, we often see good script like this, but in the execution where most of them fails. From the casting and performances to the locations, technical side of the film, even turning it into a good quality product with such budget was remarkably done.\r\n\r\nThis is the director's feature film debut and it is a loud statement of his arrival. Mainstream commercial cinema is a trap with big stars, so I hope he stays in the parallel cinema. Coming back to the film, it is a must see for neo-mystery-thriller fans. One of the best films for non-Indians to try if they haven't seen any Indian films. But anyway, I strongly suggest it to everyone.\r\n\r\n_9\/10_","id":"58f157af92514155190059d2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58f157af92514155190059d2","movie_id":414523}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"There are some films that manage to get away despite seeming underwhelming solely riding on the fact that the post-interval portions are entertaining enough to make you forget the dreariness of the initial scenes. Dhilluku Dhuddu is that kind of film. The director, Rambhala takes too long a time to get his plot moving. He gives a prologue that wouldn't be out of place in a typical horror film, and then cuts to Kumar (Santhanam), a happy-go-lucky middle-class guy. We are made to sit through one of the insipid romantic tracks in recent times. This is made worse by the fact that the heroine seems so out of place while the hero is so tentative in these scenes. \r\n\r\nIt doesn't help that the track is cliched to the core. You see Kumar's lover Kajal (Shanaya) is the daughter of a loan shark (Saurabh Shukla, in a just-for-paycheck role), who just cannot accept this match. So, with the help of a gun-for-hire (Rajendran), he decides to murder Kumar by inviting his entire family to a mansion in a remote hilltop. But what no one realises is that the place is haunted by a powerful ghost. Meanwhile, Kumar believes the ghosts are a mere set-up, thus leading to hilarious situations. \r\n\r\nThe horror scenes convey a promise of scaring us, but Rambhala doesn't reach for a serious tone, probably worrying that the audience who had come in just for the laughs might get turned off. Luckily, Deepak Kumar Padhy's cinematography lends some creepiness to these scenes. \r\n\r\nIt is particularly in the portions where there is a mix-up between real and the make-believe ghosts that Dhilluku Dhuddu resembles the kind of film that its trailers portray it as. There is not much spoof of horror movie cliches as you might expect, but the jokes hit their mark, though we keep wishing they were funnier (especially because this is from the men behind Lollu Sabha). While Karunas and Anandraj, who gets to sport a Hulk Hogan-like look in the earlier scenes, provide able support, Santhanam, who is gaining in confidence with every film as a hero, does his comic shtick of insult and simile-based comedy. But these scenes actually ride mostly on the reception that Rajendran gets in theatres these days, and the actor is, once again, in sparkling form. He does everything to get the laughs, from kissing a henchman on the mouth to even balancing a burning candle on his bald head! Sometimes, all it takes is such silliness to leave people with a sense of being entertained.","id":"57ba6abec3a3687dc90025a4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ba6abec3a3687dc90025a4","movie_id":404711}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**The right house, but an underestimated person!**\r\n\r\nIt's a great comeback for the director after his first film, 'Evil Dead' remake had got a mixed response. This film might feel very familiar to you if you have got a good knowledge of the B movies. It was still a very refreshing and very thrilling. The film was short, because there were none segments wasted, it comes to the point quickly. I mean the event, because the story was a one liner, but the event was what this film based on.\r\n\r\nThree youngsters who rob the houses when the people are out, mark their new target on a blind war veteran. But when it does not go as they have planned, they find trapped inside his house. Struggling to escape from there, they also get so close to what they had come for. Though it becomes a suicidal, and left without any option, what's next for them and the result of their attempt is what becomes the film's conclusion.\r\n\r\nReally a great effort. Almost a one night based theme with the limited cast. The title is not just what the film revolves, it also for us to hold breath while watching it and most probably sitting on the edge of our seat throughout. But I'm very disappointed with many flaws, or maybe you can say those unexplained stuffs. Like the end seems very silly, because there were lots of evidence to prove the film character had committed a crime, but easily got out. Likewise there are many more, but the film does not explain and I believe there are sure reasons behind them.\r\n\r\nThe writers did not care to waste time on those, because they wanted only a thriller, a non-stop one and they got one. Now it is going to be remade in Kollywood and also a sequel was announced. I expected that when I saw the ending. Maybe, a prequel, though sequel seems more interesting idea after what happened in this. Surely one of the best thriller of the year, so make sure you watch it soon.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58446a5cc3a368481300bc33","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58446a5cc3a368481300bc33","movie_id":300669}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Just spit it out whatever comes to your mind!**\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'Sleepwalk with Me', another similar kind of theme, but this time a little bigger that concerns a group of people. The film was focused on the members of an improv troupe called the Commune. They are not the big shots, but everything was going well with their performances. Soon the Commune begins to fall apart when one of the member decides to try on his luck in a bigger platform. Slows the troupe loses its charm and what is its future was told on the later parts.\r\n\r\nI can't say it is overrated, but I did not find it funny or entertaining. The story of the film characters, like how they fall apart and how they try fix it was very interesting. Like it said in the film, the comedies looked funny, but it was not. Honestly, I did not get that improv part. Maybe because that is an American thing, I'm totally not into it, in fact, I came to know it with this film only. For me it is an average film, so I don't know I can suggest it to anybody.

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"RELEASED IN 2016 and directed by Paul Schrader, \u201cDog Eat Dog\u201d chronicles events in the greater Cleveland area when a trio of loser ex-cons (Nicolas Cage, Willem Dafoe & Christopher Matthew Cook) is employed by a Mafioso to abduct the infant of a rival gangster.\r\n \r\nSchrader\u2019s films are often preoccupied with Christian religion and sexual obsession (porn, strip joints, prostitution, nudity, etc.), as verified by \u201cHardcore\u201d (1979), \u201cCat People\u201d (1982) and \u201cAuto Focus\u201d (2002). You can expect the same with \u201cDog Eat Dog\u201d except that it mixes black amusement with its urban drama, sleaze and crime thrills. \r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s brutal, funny, ugly and quirky, but with a spiritual thread underneath it all. Think 90\u2019s crime drama\/thrillers like \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d (1994), \u201cMojave Moon\u201d (1996) and \u201cThe Way of the Gun\u201d (2000).

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Knock knock! Oops, I just knocked twice!**\r\n\r\nSurprised to see some people actually liked it. If you have seen plenty of horrors, then this is nothing special. Just an average flick. The only plus point was, it was from Britain. If it was made in Hollywood, I would have bashed it from all the angles. Because there's no excuse like it was based on some book. So when someone writes, for a film, we expect something fresh, not refresh or repetition.\r\n\r\nIt was a common platform. That's about a local legend. When a teen couple set to test one of the stories they have heard, it puts them in an extreme position. Later the girl joins her mother who had just returned to the town to win her back. Now they both try to escape from the supernatural threat. How much they succeed and the rest of the tale follows with a twist before the end.\r\n\r\nThe same initiation, build up and conclusion as any horror film. Watchable film, but not any good. They even hinted about a sequel during the end, which I think never should go ahead, after seeing how ordinary this film was. Horror is the least average rated genre from collection and this is no surprise to join those low rating club. I don't know, that you might decently like it or maybe not, but I'm not suggesting or say ignore it.\r\n\r\n_4\/10_","id":"59dbe9dc925141252c062b8a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59dbe9dc925141252c062b8a","movie_id":420245}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"There are several contemporary horror showcases that could certainly benefit from co-writer\/director Fede Alvarez\u2019s (\u201cEvil Dead\u201d) edgy home invasion thriller **Don\u2019t Breathe**. For starters, Alvarez taps into the suggestive elements of tension without the overextended need to go overboard. The chills and thrills seem almost organic and unassuming. Sure, there appears to be a simplistic approach to an otherwise conventional premise of a house break-in at the hands of opportunistic thugs. Nevertheless, **Don\u2019t Breathe** captures the claustrophobic spirit of its inherent creepiness with stylish cruelty and cleverness.\r\n\r\nInevitably, **Don\u2019t Breathe** may inspire cinematic comparisons to the 2002 David Fincher-directed vehicle _Panic Room_. Understandably the theme is somewhat recognizable to movie audiences as ominous strangers invading your domestic private space is a recipe for paranoia and persecution. However, **Don\u2019t Breathe** takes this precarious situation to a whole new scare tactic level of horrific proportions. Consequently, the executed violence and terror-driven tempo is definitely worthy of its suspense-driven objectives. **Don\u2019t Breathe** is a macabre masterpiece in the making that sets the standard for a current-day stillborn and repetitive horror genre that thrives on pressure cooker predictability.\r\n\r\nThe set-up for **Don\u2019t Breathe** is quite ambitious and challenging thus forming an interesting spin on the home robbery scenario. The sordid story centers around three upstart small-time crooks making the rounds of thievery in the suburban surroundings of Detroit. Rocky (Jane Levy) and her two male companions Money and Alex (Daniel Zovatto and Dylan Minnette) are able to carry off their home invasion scamming courtesy of Alex\u2019s connections to a home security firm owned by his father (where there is all kinds of access information to private residences and local businesses).\r\n\r\nAlex\u2019s stipulation, however, is that these home invasion robberies need to be less flashy without drawing too much attention. Plus, all the stolen items confiscated much not be too expensive otherwise their illegal activities will be exposed much sooner than later. Unfortunately lovebirds Rocky and Money do not see eye-to-eye with Alex\u2019s brand of careful and cautious home-robbing philosophy. In fact, the romantic couple wants to reach for the sky and steal as much stuff possible to make their dreams of living on East Street an immediate reality. So what will it take for Alex to get on the same page as Rocky and Money in terms of all of them benefiting on a big score without suffering the dire consequences?\r\n\r\nThe consensus is reached among the law-breaking trio that their next target for viable riches is in the form of a blinded Iraqi war veteran (Stephen Lang). The word is that the personally troubled and sightless ex-military man is about to be awarded a whopping three-hundred thousand dollar cash settlement involving the wrongful death of his beloved young daughter. So the home invasion task seems quite self-explanatory to the young heist-happy hooligans as committing theft against a seemingly vulnerable blind man emotionally and psychologically down in the dumps should be a piece of cake so to speak. Well, Rocky and her two boytoys were sadly mistaken if they thought that they could take sole advantage of this savvy yet disturbed disabled war vet with visions of sorrow and sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe realization that the home-invading crew has picked a tricky trap of a house to pillage while underestimating the capabilities of its handicapped owner seems like poetic justice. In fact, the irony of the criminal threesome trying to escape the boarded-up dark and dingy household makes them look like the victimized three blind mice at the mercy of a crazed trigger-happy, sight-deprived ex-soldier that can see all too well that his cherished castle and belongings are being jeopardized by these punkish intrusive violators. Strangely, the audience is left wondering whether or not they should root for the blinded bombshell protecting his homestead of secrets or the clueless crooks that talked themselves into this caustic cat-and-mouse game of gloom-and-doom.\r\n\r\n**Don\u2019t Breathe** is uncharacteristically compelling for a horror showcase because it relies on genuine scary jolts and jumps\u2026or at least the anticipation of the jolts and jumps that have convincing dramatic weight behind the build up of intensity. Alvarez crafts an arousing narrative that brilliantly displays the mounting nervousness that awaits. Lang\u2019s belligerent blind man patrols every spacing and crevice in the darkness with the will of a rabid dog in heat as he points his explosive firearms at the slightest movements of his trapped guinea pigs in despair. Creatively nerve-racking and nauseous, **Don\u2019t Breathe** makes dutiful usage of its instinctual delivery of shock value as this potent pot-boiler never settles for any sense of false or mechanically manufactured hedonism. The haunting aura that exists in **Don\u2019t Breathe** is gasping in visceral authenticity.\r\n\r\nAs the menacing misfit saddled by wartime mortar fire blindness but blessed with tactical tenacity drenched in borderline villainy, Lang\u2019s portrayal as the sightless hunter tracking down his vulnerable prey in his tortured domestic playground is solidly digestible. His inner madness was already established by personalized heartbreak but the arrival of his uninvited guests devilishly unleashed more demons within his off-kilter psyche. The moving targets at the other end of the deranged blind man\u2019s intimidating gun are thoroughly convincing as the harried catalysts for their sightless tormentor\u2019s frustration and escalating rage. Levy\u2019s Rocky, Zovatto\u2019s Money and Minnette\u2019s Alex are plausible as the frightened specimens caught in the maniacal maze of their aggressor\u2019s clutches.\r\n\r\nThe very thought of a psychotic blind man enforcing his brand of warped justice on the youthfully sighted self-indulgent saps is deliciously manipulative and wonderfully inventive. The creepy corners concerning the backlash blackness in **Don\u2019t Breathe** is explored with grand naughtiness and the atmospheric vibes certainly will not disappoint in this percolating peek-a-boo primer.\r\n\r\n**Don\u2019t Breathe** (2016)\r\n\r\nGhost House Pictures\/Screen Gems\/Stage 6 Films\/Good Universe\r\n\r\n1 hr. 28 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Jane Levy, Stephen Lang, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto, Emma Bercovici, Franciska Torocsik\r\n\r\nDirected and Co-Written by: Fede Alvarez\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s Rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016","id":"57c3427ec3a3680cc50010e8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c3427ec3a3680cc50010e8","movie_id":300669}

{"author":"iheardthatmoviewas","content":"With each new Marvel film one could expect the studio to push the limits of what a superhero film should consist of. Films such as Captain America: Winter Solider, Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man all consisted of elements that we have never seen within a superhero film before. Now, Marvel Studios attempts to push the envelop once more by leaving the world of high tech armors and super soldiers and entering the mystical world of magic. Leading this charge is Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Stephen Strange and hopefully he could answer why there is this strange mystical feeling that we have seen this all before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> From Marvel comes \u201cDoctor Strange,\u201d the story of world-famous neurosurgeon Dr. Stephen Strange whose life changes forever after a horrific car accident robs him of the use of his hands. When traditional medicine fails him, he is forced to look for healing, and hope, in an unlikely place\u2014a mysterious enclave known as Kamar-Taj. He quickly learns that this is not just a center for healing but also the front line of a battle against unseen dark forces bent on destroying our reality. Before long Strange\u2014armed with newly acquired magical powers\u2014is forced to choose whether to return to his life of fortune and status or leave it all behind to defend the world as the most powerful sorcerer in existence.\r\n\r\nI am going to start off the review by discussing the only strong positive thing that came out of Doctor Strange and its by far the visuals. Beautiful vibrant colors pop at you throughout the film, the costume design is beyond extravagant and the framing is spot on. Doctor Strange and his fellow Sorcerers Supremes powers aren't fully on display until they enter the Mirror Dimension and my god, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner would hate this place. As they are men of science, they would hate that all rules of physics are thrown out the window as our Sorcerers Supremes are capable of breaking buildings apart and reforming to however they please. It is hard to not reference Inception but no one here is dreaming, these visuals are being created by the hand of mystical men and they use it to their power.\r\n\r\nIn all honestly, pushing the envelope when it comes to visuals was not a difficult task at all. Heck, if they didn't I would have been extremely disappointed as it was an obvious opportunity to take advantage of since we are dealing with magic. I am still extremely disappointed regardless as director Scott Derrickson completely missed another obvious opportunity to push the envelope this time in regards of character development.\r\n\r\nDoctor Stephen Strange is very much like a Tony Stark and other superheroes we have seen in films before as he is arrogant, egoistical and full of it. After Strange's accident in which he suffered extreme nerve damage to both hands, he dishes out every penny to his name to repair his hands in hopes he could continue his career as neurosurgeon. Every attempt fails and Strange becomes desperate enough to head to Nepal and finds himself under the guidance of Tilda Swinton's The Ancient One. Learning a whole new concept in the mystic arts forces Strange to reshape his way of thinking but Scott Derrickson does not let this have Strange reshape who he is as a person as well.\r\n\r\nDoctor Strange should have found himself being more like a Steve Rogers towards the end of the film as learning the mystic arts and his accident alone should have broken his ego. But instead everything still comes easy to him as he masters magic with ease with very little tension. He has a couple hiccups in the beginning but once The Ancient One puts him under her wing it is smooth sailing and Strange is stealing texts, wielding powerful weapons and defeating Supremes with decades of training with ease.\r\n\r\nYou cannot say that Strange was destined for the mystic arts and that is why everything came so easy for him. Strange is only learning the mystic arts due to circumstance. If he doesn't get into an accident, which happened to him due to being careless, he doesn't find himself in Nepal. Harry Potter was destined for magic, not Strange. Strange fails to grow as a character because he continues to be proven right and no consequences seem to happen due to his actions.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to get into the character development of our supporting characters Benedict Wong's Wong and Chiwetel Ejiofor's Mordo as I would utterly spoil the film for you. All I would say though is that they were both mishandled and deserved better developments. It is a shame too because Wong and Ejiofor are superb actors but wasting talent is something Marvel Studios is used to.\r\n\r\nWhen will Marvel Studios get a villain right?  With Mads Mikkelsen playing our lead villain, Kaecilius, I thought we might finally get a cinematic Marvel villain that is on par to Killgrave and Kingpin over at Marvel's television department. Ultimately, Kaecilius and Doctor Strange end up fighting due to the most silliest cliche: being at the wrong place at the wrong time. The two individuals meet at the New York Sanctum Sanctorum in which Strange accidentally gets blown in to. Kaecilius is there to kill the protector and Sanctum Sanctorum itself and has no knowledge of who Strange is. In fact, he honestly believes Strange's name is in fact \"Mister Doctor.\" Still learning his craft, Strange is capable of putting up a better fight than the protector who should be a matter. I mean, he is a protector after all. There are no stakes for Strange, strange.\r\n\r\nVisually appealing could only get you so far as Doctor Strange fails to focus on the development of their characters that they made so appealing to the eye. Doctor Strange will become a huge asset to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and lets hope we see the rest of Strange's development when he casts his next spell. There is so much untapped potential in Strange's character, we just haven't seen the best of him yet.","id":"581bbdbbc3a36805c60001f1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/581bbdbbc3a36805c60001f1","movie_id":284052}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"Though the core events may not be anything new for the MCU, particularly in so far as its origin stories go (Stephen Strange's A-to-B is virtually identical to Tony Stark's in the first _Iron Man_ film) the psychedelic filter through which we experience these events is entirely fresh!\r\n\r\nNot all of the humour lands, and in fact sometimes actually detracts from the story.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"It is actually quite some time since I watched Doctor Strange but somehow the movie must have slipped between the cracks since I appear to have forgotten to review it. So I am about to remedy that now. To put it in simple terms: This is an excellent movie. It is a wonderful display of magical fireworks with a decent enough story to keep it together.\r\n\r\nI have to confess that I have not really read many of the comics containing Doctor Strange so it is a bit difficult for me to comment on the aspect of the film versus the comics. From the little that I have read I got the impression that the comic book version of Doctor Strange was a wee bit more dark, serious and mature. This movie starts from the beginning of his career though so I guess there is some justification for the less mature Doctor Strange in the movie.\r\n\r\nDoctor Strange is a skilled neurosurgeon but a bit of an asshole. Actually more than \u201ca bit\u201d. He gets involved in a accident, that he pretty much causes himself due to his arrogance. Fast forward to the interesting chapter were we get to see Doctor Strange being, reluctantly, admitted into a scruffy looking monastery on the other side of the planet. That is when the fun starts. Doctor Strange is in for a ride. Slowly Doctor Strange gets knocked into him that magic exists and he is expected to practice it.\r\n\r\nThe time at the monastery, or perhaps we should call it a school, leads to a few funny episodes and I do like the head monk\u2019s bantering with Strange and the way she does things. Talk about getting thrown into the deep end of the swimmingpool first. Strange\u2019s continued arrogance and immaturity is a bit annoying from time to time though. That has to be said.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of super heroes if there are no bad guys around. So after Strange having trained for a while, and mostly failed miserably, the bad guys starts to crash the party. So no more pretty living room magic for Strange. It is time to go head to head with some serious competition. Unfortunately, for a good chunk of the first fights Strange mostly falls on his arse. They are still cool and beautiful to watch though.\r\n\r\nSlowly Strange starts to get to grip with this whole magic thing and he also starts to shed some of that arrogance of his and take some responsibility. About time since the despicable bad guy are, of course, working towards freeing the real BIG bad guy, father of all evil and mother of everything else bad you can think of. Time for a showdown.\r\n\r\nAs the fighting escalates so does the user of special effects and personally I though the special effects were both beautiful and spectacular. I really liked them.\r\n\r\nI am not sure Cumberbatch would have been my first choice for Doctor Strange though. To me he do not really project the image of the wise and skilled Wizard I expected. He is not bad though. The only other person that stood out for me was the chief monk and The Ancient One which I also quite liked. The rest of the characters, well to me they mostly lived in the shadows of these two, even though they were in general likable and sometimes fun.\r\n\r\nThere were a few rather hilarious parts where Strange has to reveal the truth about what he stepped in to his former girlfriend. I have a soft spot for the surprise moments in both movies and books.\r\n\r\nI rather not get started on time travel since I generally hate it as a story element since it almost always leads to paradoxes or is simply so poorly done that it is blatantly obvious that someone tried to cover up for a lazy and shoddy story. However I guess I have to mention that screwing around with time is an important part of the plot in this movie. Luckily it is done in such a way that it do not, in my opinion, negatively impact the movie. Actually, to my surprise, it is used in a rather cool way.\r\n\r\nSo, bottom line, a movie I liked quite a lot. 5 out 5 stars kind worth of liking.","id":"58ee26d992514168700096e9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ee26d992514168700096e9","movie_id":284052}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**When a science person was the chosen one in the spiritual world!**\r\n\r\nYou would have not expected it from this director if you had seen his previous films. This was based on the Marvel comics that I haven't touched. So basically I had high expectation to witness another side of Marvel universe with another set of (super)heroes. And surprisingly, it was very entertaining, nothing like other Marvel's heroes\/story, except the possession of superpower to fight evil forces.\r\n\r\nFirstly, Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead in a Marvel film, I did not think it would work. All I knew is he was a great sidekick, but that image has changed here. He was wonderful, definitely I'll be looking forward to its sequel as they had confirmed at the end. The theme wise, it is similar to most of the superhero tales, but some new concepts were added to it, I mean the superpower and that's what made it so unique.\r\n\r\nJust like 'Thor', this film as well had taken the spiritual believes only for the basic platform. The rest of the developments are the clear mix of fantasy (illusion) and science. So it means the film is for theists and atheists. I am one of those who did not like 'Inception', which I think an ordinary action film with multiple layers. But this one was so awesome and it is for the people like me who think 'Inception' failed.\r\n\r\nVisually spectacular. I regret missing it out in digital 3D. Its Academy Awards nominee in the category of Best VFX tells the story. There will be a tough contest, even I'm up for 'Jungle Book', but I won't be sad if this wins. The success story of Marvel continues. Not everybody reads comic books, but film goers are the majority. So adaptations like this are people like me. Let them keep coming, I love this format better. This film is not just for the youngsters, but old, families, as well as kids can enjoy, so I hope you won't miss it.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"58b34248c3a36852a300af85","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b34248c3a36852a300af85","movie_id":284052}
{"author":"Kalim432","content":"I will begin this by saying I was hyped about this film since it was announced because I was always attracted to magic and the supernatural and Doctor Strange is one of my favorite Marvel superheroes.\r\n PLOT:A simple enough story,a brilliant surgeon's journey from the peak of his career to a ruined man,incapacitated due to an accident.Losing all his money in an attempt to heal his hands,he finds out about a mysterious healer in a place called Kamar-Taj.With his last dollars, he gets a one-way ticket to Nepal to find this place and is introduced like so into a whole new world.He has an affinity for what he discovers to be called \"The Mystic Arts\".He learns and develops quickly but is thrown into a fight with the one who would become his first nemesis, Kaelcilius,too soon.He is almost killed but with the help of his ex-fianc\u00e9e,Dr. Christine Palmer(who operates on him) he is saved and returns to the Sanctum Sanctorum.He tries to stop Kaelcilius but needs to be rescued again by his teacher,who is killed and leaves him with a valuable lesson.To finally defeated the Zealots he bargains with their boss,catching him into a time loop for all eternity if he does not call his servants off and sets everything right.In the end his ex-friend and mentor,Mordo goes on a quest of finding himself and ends up becoming a sorcerer murderer. \r\nCharacters: \r\n1)Dr.Stephen Strange:Benedict portrays him amazingly and is always on point with the character.I liked his journey and how he changed and grew to see that he is just a tiny bit of an infinite multiverse.He was pretty good using magic and I hope he will develop quicker to the Sorcerer Supreme. \r\n2)The Ancient One:My favorite character in the movie.She is a wise teacher,has the best quotes,best battle scenes,best entrances and an amazing battle costume.I loved how even she was aware that for higher goals she needed to cross the line and do things she teaches against and also isn't proud of. \r\n3)Kaelcilius:A tragedy of love brought him to Kamar-Taj where he ascended to the rank of master.Tired of following The Ancient One and still haunted by the death of his loved he seeks to stop time,to give his new teacher,Dormammu our world.Mads was amazing in the role,his whole ideology of time as the enemy of humans and them longing for eternity is interesting and really on point.He briefly achieved his goal,a shame he became a mindless one. \r\n4)Karl Mordo:Another prominent student,who doesn't ask questions,doesn't contradict and is pretty adamant about trust and has lots of issues with bending the rules.He was very disappointing and boring and his only interesting feat was that he became a villain. \r\n5)Wong:Decent but underused character,he will surely be seen a lot in the later movies as Strange's right hand. \r\nMagic:We are introduced to magic as an energy harnessed from various dimensions to create things of need,to conjure spells.An interesting take on such a vague but intriguing subject. \r\nPost-Credit Scenes:\r\n 1)Thor scene:takes place in 2017 with Thor asking our Doctor(has gloves,seems more powerful,informed) for help to find his father,trapped on Earth.He accepts with the condition that they would leave our realm as soon as they are reunited. \r\n2)Mordo scene:He went on a quest of getting rid of all the sorcerers of Earth. \r\nOverall:A very decent movie with amazing special effects and super acting.A must see.","id":"58ab3bdec3a36849fe0001bd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ab3bdec3a36849fe0001bd","movie_id":284052}

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"All continues to be well in the Marvel Comics Universe as the film adaptation of another mischievous and majestic superhero from Stan Lee\u2019s printed page empire emerges and reigns supreme on the big screen. The latest cure from the Marvel movie bag of explosive tricks is the entry of the dazzling and decorative **Doctor Strange**. Armed with a collection of notable performers, a convincing colorful scope of visual vibrancy and a hearty touch of spiritual and reflective potency the spellbinding **Doctor Strange** is an engaging and oddly sophisticated action-oriented comic book fantasy adding imaginative flavor to the typical escapist gem from the Marvel stable of powered personalities.\r\n\r\nSome may argue that **Doctor Strange** is merely another conveyor belt cinematic comics confection that follows a safe and similar makeup that constitutes the obligatory Marvel Comics movie foundation\u2013excitable weirdness, overly splashes of wayward whimsy, copious characterizations attached to their brand of eccentric grandeur and larger-than-life gestures of dark and devious exploits grounded in the basic landscape of good versus evil. Listen, sometimes traveling down the conventional path of constructed and adventurous Marvel-made spectacles is not necessarily a bad thing to consider. After all, the well-known and more popular superhero icons such as _Spider-Man_, _The Incredible Hulk_, _Iron Man_, _The Avengers_, and _The X-Men_ for instance seem to benefit nicely from the anticipated formula that routinely delivers the entertaining goods for its avid core of fanboys. So why not wipe off the seemingly obscure and underrated **Doctor Strange** and provide the same kind of popcorn-pulsating mystique for blockbuster cinema?\r\n\r\n**Doctor Strange** started out as a comic book creation in 1963 by Steve Ditko and Stan Lee. Director Scott Derrickson (\u201cParadise Lost\u201d, \u201cThe Exorcism of Emily Rose\u201d, \u201cSinister\u201d, \u201cDeliver Us From Evil\u201d) does an admirable job in giving shades of bizarre brilliance and magical manipulation to an unconventional Marvel comic book character hardly known for his capacity to translate his mystical mastery to celluloid with compelling curiosity. Derrickson, known primarily for his creative juices in the realm of horror fantasies, confidently serves up the off-kilter and hypnotic appeal of Dr. Stephen Strange as embodied by accomplished English actor Benedict Cumberbatch (\u201cBlack Mass\u201d, \u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d, \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d). Interestingly, Derrickson and his handful of screenwriters craft **Doctor Strange** with a mind-blowing measurement of restraint and inquisitiveness. Indeed, **Doctor Strange** echoes its contemporary Marvel-established movies with predictable pluckiness to a certain extent but what is appreciated more is the uniqueness of the film\u2019s ability to emphasize a cerebral superhero that is cut out of a different kind of creative cloth which feels quite distinctive from other brooding Marvel mavericks. Cumberbatch\u2013mastering a rather effective American-accented sorcerer with skill\u2013has injected a degree of inventive nobility and refinement that uplifts this calculating comic-book fantasy.\r\n\r\nCumberbatch\u2019s egotistical Stephen Strange is an incredibly gifted neurosurgeon. His hands are truly miraculous tools of his medical trade and he takes pride in his abilities to treat the critical patients that have tremendous hope courtesy of his therapeutic capabilities. In a nutshell, Strange outshines his other surgical competitors because he is able to give to his patients on the operating table something other doctors cannot instantly muster up. However, cruel fate strikes its ugly head when Strange suffers the usage of his precious hands as a result of a horrific car wreck. The nerves in his hands are destroyed and the non-functioning of his limbs is an awful reminder that his surgical talents are something of the immediate past.\r\n\r\nAs Strange delves into self-pity and surfacing depression he cannot see just how supportive his fellow physician Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdam) is toward him. Clearly, Christine is in love with the alienating medical moper but Strange simply does not realize the extent of her affections because he is too busy sulking about his misfortune. The only factor that gets a promising rise out of Strange is his recent acknowledgement of the Tibetan community where there is a Kamar-Taj temple rumored to restore ailing body parts destined to make an individual \u201cwhole\u201d and \u201ccomplete\u201d once again. Naturally, Strange wants to bypass the tedious and lengthy therapy sessions for a chance to experience the miracle of his once-amazing operating digits now ravaged by severe nerve damage.\r\n\r\nThe main source behind the Kamar-Taj temple\u2019s heralded existence is The Ancient One (played by Tilda Swinton). She is instrumental in teaching the fundamentals of a selected Eastern mysticism that teaches the special concentration of healing the wounded and wasting human body when scientific medical practices fail to do so. Soon, Strange\u2019s affiliation with The Ancient One and her mystical minions has more than a transfixing effect on gaining control of his ailing hands as he gains indescribable powers through the inner strength of mind and soul. Now, Dr. Strange can generate his own alternating state of philosophical wizardry that dictates shaping time and space dimensions. Strange\u2019s out-of-body experiences supersede all his previous physical impairments as a force to be reckoned with at large. Whether observing Strange\u2019s Cloak of Levitation methods or witnessing his supernatural prowess on the mean streets against wickedness Doctor Strange spins a wild and weird web of action-packed surrealism that is a welcomed addition to Marvel Comics\u2019 showcasing of super-heroic protective cads feisty in flaws and frivolity.\r\n\r\nCumberbatch is mesmerizing as the self-absorbed genius Strange who perhaps is the best complex Marvel-related protagonist since Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s flippant Tony Stark\/Iron Man. The combination of heightened arrogance and high-brow self-doubt and vulnerability tactically works as Cumberbatch sells this portrayal solidly. Although Swinton\u2019s The Ancient One is an intriguing enigma in her own right one must question why the absence of an Asian actor not considered for this particular role may have some scratching their heads in indignation? McAdam\u2019s love interest Christine amounts to only being an afterthought not just in the eyes of her object of affection Strange but to the audience as well.\r\n\r\nThankfully, the other supporting players contribute marvelously to the festivities. Oscar nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor (Cumberbatch\u2019s co-star from the Academy Award-winning \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d) plays fellow sorcerer Mordo while Benedict Wong assumes the duty as another one of The Ancient One\u2019s followers who guards the school\u2019s sacred scriptures. Mads Mikkelsen is devilishly received as Kaecilius, the former disciple of The Ancient One gone rogue whose agenda in releasing an ominous demon Dormammu to the world will test the will of Doc Strange\u2019s newfound mystical techniques and tactics.\r\n\r\nNo doubt that **Doctor Strange** is an impeccably surging superhero fable laced with stunning aesthetics and a richly robust score by Michael Giachinno. The high caliber of talent associated with this spry comic book actioner definitely ensures another superhero film franchise-in-the-making as Cumberbatch\u2019s introspective doc administers his **Strange** dosage of Marvel movie-making medicine for the ages.\r\n\r\n**Doctor Strange** (2016)\r\n\r\nWalt Disney Pictures\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 10 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Benedict Cumberbatch, Tilda Swinton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mads Mikkelsen, Rachel McAdam, Benedict Wong, Benjamin Bratt\r\n\r\nDirected by: Scott Derrickson\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction & Fantasy\/Action & Adventures\/Comic Book Fable\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** 1\/2 (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016","id":"581e7bad9251410a0e01146e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/581e7bad9251410a0e01146e","movie_id":284052}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**People come together for a reason, but stay together for no reason.**\r\n\r\nAccording to me this film was silently made. I mean we only anticipate big production films and current famous director, actors' films, particularly the science fiction and superhero films as they are the trend now. The promotion begins from the day it was announced. So I did not realise when this one started to come to exist. But when I did come to know, all I know was it is an Eddie Murphy's film and I should give it a try. Because I felt like I haven't seen him for a decade.\r\n\r\nAfter watching it, I totally stunned and asked myself is this the same Eddie we used to enjoy his comedies? Yep, but no. I mean the guy was the same, but I saw completely a new of him as an actor. He definitely chose a best script and this is the break he was looking for all these years. Initially Samuel L. Jackson was considered for the lead role, later replaced by him. I won't be surprised if he gets the Oscar nomination for the role he played. I don't care whether it is for a lead or supporting role, but I'll be very happy for the nod. And I also won't care if he wins or not, but this film and his role will remain special to me forever.\r\n\r\nSo what this film is about? It was the story of Charlie Brooks, a woman who recalls her memories of the life she spent together with a man called Church since she was a ten year old. It all begins when one day after waking up in the morning to find a stranger in her kitchen, Then she learns that he's their new cook assigned by her mother's ex-boyfriend. She initially hates him, but it does not remain the same way when time passes by. That's what this tale is going to reveal how far he remain in her family to help her ill mother. All the following events very beautifully told.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm surprised the most was, it is not based on any book. Thanks for that, because usually the book fans attack such move. Like they usually say the adaptation to the screen is ruined the original material. Anyway, I'm film guy, I like books turned into the films, because I'm lazy to read them. But it was inspired by the real friendship, that's what the opening statement says. Which was actually from the writer's real life, though I believe many parts were altered and the new stuffs included. I'm sure I won't find another film like this any time soon, so maybe I would re-watch it.\r\n\r\n> \"It's an awful feeling to love someone so much that you absolutely hate them for leaving you.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been a very long time since I have given a maximum score for a film. When I started to watch it, I did not think it would be the one, but it deserved that honour. The main reason was to I love it, it has no clich\u00e9s, I mean almost 90 per cent free from them. The first thing was, I though it is a food film and then it turned that down with only required amount of those contents keeping in its narration. Followed by I thought it could turn into a romance, but once again that theme as well sidelined to focus on the different event, I mean the series of events.\r\n\r\nSo now you might be confused what I am blabbering. Actually, this is the story of a ten year old girl till she reach her middle age and during that period of time, about a man who entered her life and stayed very close despite each other never revealed their personal life. Her school graduate and college days, followed by many events of her personal life as similar to the Mr. Church's life events at the same time, the film only concentrated the unusual relationship between them. So there's nothing wrong to call it another version of 'Driving Miss Daisy'. In fact, it was made by the same director.\r\n\r\nLike I said, Eddie Murphy nailed his part. I hope he does more serious films like this and according to his age. I think this is what Adam Sandler should follow as well. The entire story was told from the Charlie's perspective that payed by the young sensation Britt Robertson. She was good as the Eddie, but her character was not designed to highlight the film, instead her character highlights Eddie's Mr. Church. She only reveals what she saw with her own eyes about the person she respects, despite it all began with a simple dislike. Beside she never had a father, never knew who her father was, so the Mr. Church takes that place conveniently without their's knowledge.\r\n\r\nA heartwarming drama for the whole family. I did not find any obscene parts. It is now in my all time favourites list. The length was perfect and the pace was excellent. There's no major twist, like that stuns you at the final stage, but there were many small twists and turns all along. The film critics got all wrong, like usual, they proved they got no brain. This is a inspiring film. You will learn how to respect people around us, who respect us. Like cooking, books, caring for each other, privacy, many fine topics were covered. So watching it with the youngsters and kids might boost their moral attitude. So I feel it is a perfect weekend family film. Highly, strongly recommended.\r\n\r\n_10\/10_","id":"584465a09251416a7400c1fe","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/584465a09251416a7400c1fe","movie_id":374461}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**An ex-con back on his feet for his daughter!**\r\n\r\nI did not find this French film any special. This is an English language film, because they have targeted the American market. Many similar Hollywood flicks were already made, so it is just a different actors and the locations. But the actings were good and some of the scenes were nicely composed. This is a book based film about an ex- con, when he comes to know his daughter is in a real trouble, he does everything he can to protect her. So it is like a running and chasing kind of theme, but how they come out it is the remaining film.\r\n\r\nMel Gibson was great. I felt like I haven't seen him for ages, I mean this kind of performance gives the impression that he's back. Though the film was not that great, for an entertainment it will do okay. It is a short film than usual action-thrillers. So you won't have trouble in pace, no proper developments, like the characters or the story, it only moves forward so quickly. I think the end was good, only if they are not planning for a sequel. But that part was not clear, so there's no surprise if they make another film. I say watch it for Gibson and for entertainment.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"581cf58ec3a3681e640012a8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/581cf58ec3a3681e640012a8","movie_id":309886}

The remaining parts focused on how he struggles to come back, while recovering from the serious injury.\r\n\r\nThe biggest advantage was the cast. I particularly liked Miles Teller in the lead role. His recent rise in the Hollywood was phenomenal and this one is his another must watch film. Even the supporting cast and roles were awesome. If you are a boxing\/sports film fan, you will love it. But there is sufficient drama in the tale to build an impressive storyline.\r\n\r\nFeels like it is under-appreciated, and being a Hollywood film, the recognition was too poor. In the coming days, years, it will reach the largest audience coverage. From this film, the director is the one who gained big. Surely he should make use of its success to his next films.

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Classic story with good guy (well, good might be stretching it), in this case the father, trying to save chick from the bad guys. The bad guys are of course totally dislikeable murderous thugs with a distinctly below average intelligence.\r\n\r\nMel Gibson plays the role of ex-con, caring father and kick-ass protector of his daughter quite well. He pretty much makes this movie which is a roller-coaster action ride. As with most of this type of action flicks the story and script is fairly mediocre. His old and not very trustworthy friend for example was not really adding any value and his actions was soooo predictable.\r\n\r\nThe thugs, although certainly projecting the required amount of \u201cdespicable bad-guy-ness\u201d, were really nothing more than that. Stupid, stupid and more stupid. How they even manage to track John and Lydia down all the time is really beyond me.\r\n\r\nWith that said it was a enjoyable movie.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The history repeats, and so the story in some sequel films!**\r\n\r\nThis is the third film is the 'Blair Witch' film series, but the second film from the story perspective. Anyway, I haven't seen the other sequel, you do not have to be familiar with that to follow this one. So I saw it, but what I thought is, basically this film is exactly same as the first film. Just the characters and timeline changed, that's all.\r\n\r\nThey had nothing much of choice, so the story was repeated with the modern equipments. A new set of people, including a brother of one of those went missing two decades ago, heads to the same woods to investigate. But soon they all begin to witness strange, horrifying events.

The today's generation might enjoy it better, but if you are like above 30 and already saw the original, this will be an average or trash. So young people should watch it.

{"author":"iheardthatmoviewas","content":"The boxing sports genre has been very generic for a while. Two months ago The Weinstein Company released Hands of Stone (the biopic of Roberto Duran) which I thought was a run of the mill boxing film. It was a comeback story that was dull and shallow. Now we have Open Road Films rushing to the Oscar season with Bleed For This starring Miles Teller as Vinny Pazienza which should be his shot of getting that Oscar glory you know he wants. Since J.K Simmons\u2019 hauntingly powerful performance in Whiplash blew Teller out of the water he deserves a biopic like this. If Whiplash couldn\u2019t put him on the awards map, maybe a vehicle like this would.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> The inspirational story of World Champion Boxer Vinny Pazienza who, after a near-fatal car crash, which left him not knowing if he'd ever walk again, made one of sports most incredible comebacks.\r\n\r\nAll boxing films are seeming like the same nowadays \u201c give me another chance,\u201d \u201cone more shot.\u201d Writer\/Director Ben Younger attempts to have this biopic be different from others. From the beginning, you see how Vinny is a hot shot wild card. They show his flaws in less than the first 10 minutes. It goes straight into his loss and the introduction of other people vital to his career and his life especially his family. The film shows how important Vinny's home means to him. Every time Vinny is boxing on TV, you see his mom in another room praying and smoking to her jesus glass figurines because of her religious views against violence yet she still calls out to her family who are in the living room to see if he's winning or not.\r\n\r\nIf you ever wanted to see Miles Teller as a boxer with a Rhode Island accent, then this is the film for you. Granted he looks more like Jerry Ferrara, he truly does a good job in his lead role as Vinny Pazienza. His voice is very similar to the real boxer. What is good about Vinny to follow as a character is that not only \u201che\u2019s a fighter,\u201d but he\u2019s not arrogant. What makes Pazienza much more of a genuine character his near death accident and his way to recovery. Most boxing films center on the boxer\u2019s win-loss-win storyline but this is a real accident that more depressing. Even after this man\u2019s near death experience and when he wakes he still wants to box. It's the scenes where Vinny is wearing the HALO attempting to train that displays Teller\u2019s dedication to the role. He got built more than you\u2019ve ever seen him before. Younger does a great job capturing the fire and the spirit of Pazienza making him a likable person with Teller\u2019s performance doing him great justice.\r\nAs much as Miles Teller does a great job he is at times outshines by one of the many faces of Aaron Eckhart. When he\u2019s introduced, you have no idea it\u2019s him. It doesn\u2019t even sound like him it doesn\u2019t even look like him. This year we are getting the many faces of Aaron Eckhart from Sully and now this. He\u2019s more than your average boxing trainer with a known past but he\u2019s also his friend. He puts on this New York accent and a majority of times deliver some of the best lines. But whenever he\u2019s sharing the screen with Teller there is some amazing chemistry on screen. It may not as strong as B. Jordan and Stallone in Creed, but their relationship is very strong. One of the best scenes of the film is the recreation of Vinny\u2019s training videos with his HALO.\r\n\r\nThe film does, in fact, follow some boxing cliches with numerous training montages and elements within its story. Not that its much of an issue, but the boxing aren\u2019t all that great. The film is more centered on his comeback to boxing than boxing itself With several boxing sequences a lot of shots are out of the ring focusing on the reaction of the audience.\r\nIn some cases, this film could be sort of a sequel to Hands of Stone. It features the fight between Duran and Paz towards the end of the film. Yet since we had two boxing films featuring Roberto Duran, I\u2019m personally disappointed the film doesn\u2019t have Edgar Ramirez reprising his role. Hands of Stone didn\u2019t feature the Vinny Paz fight (for obvious purposes) yet this one does so\u2026.couldn't get Ramirez? I guess the Boxing Cinematic Universe would never happen.\r\n\r\nBleed For This is a relatively solid biopic with fine performances from Miles Teller and Aaron Eckhart and a great screenplay from writer\/director Ben Younger.","id":"581bbde99251410cb000041f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/581bbde99251410cb000041f","movie_id":332979}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"When _The Blair Witch Project_ burst upon the cinematic scene in 1999 it was an unspeakable breath of fresh air because it deviated away from the conventional creepers that marched to the same old boo-enhanced beat. Sure, _The Blair Witch Project_ certainly was not blessed with the most creative screenplay nor could anybody definitively state that the acting was convincing to the point of no return. Nevertheless, the genuine shocks were ideally realized due to the execution of this little indie terror tale that managed to sell a morbid mystique that translated into a gory goldmine at the box office. Hence, _The Blair Witch Project_ became an unlikely sensation trending around its distinctive flair for what has become the ubiquitous and overused found footage genre nowadays.\r\n\r\nIndeed, _The Blair Witch Project_ sparked a creepy curiosity and gave birth to a unique movement in horror flicks where it managed to formulate a whole refreshing perspective to digesting frightfests based on the art of eerie suggestion through the power of promotion. Of course the \u201cpromotion\u201d in this case presented a group of periled young people (the typical expendable guinea pigs in this kind of cinema) armed with cameras as they explored the Maryland-based woods that would end up creating a speculative frenzy about what remained through the lens of shaky images as these sitting ducks ran for dear life. Thus, the atmospheric vibes and presumed doom of these wandering targets in the woods captured a whole welcoming imagination to the manner in which little imaginative horror gems could rival the big-budgeted spook spectacles coming out of the Hollywood machine.\r\n\r\nNaturally, _The Blair Witch Project_ (as most horror-based original blueprints) was enthusiastic to capitalize on its big screen impact but not without the amount of success it originally generated the first time around. Some may recall the tepid sequel in 2000\u2019s _Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2_ that left a dull mark for those that were stimulated by the amazing first installment. Now it would take a 16-year gap to wipe off the nostalgic dust of a boorish _Blair_ outing for another entry in the pale and anemic imitation **Blair Witch**. Unfortunately, director Adam Wingard (\u201cYou\u2019re Next\u201d, \u201cThe Guest\u201d) has no absolute vision or hearty energy to channel **Blair Witch** into a scary showcase worthy of its own garish identity. Wingard and screenwriter Simon Barrett merely conjure up a shadowy copycat of _The Blair Witch Project\u2019s_ goose-bumpy reputation as **Blair Witch** is rendered a listless retread. Look, there is nothing wrong with attempting to recycle the spirit of an unassuming ground-breaking horror fable that gave considerable forethought to how movie-going fans viewed scary movies in general. Still, there is a time and place for gloom-and-doom experimentation in the heart of the wicked-minded woods that worked its magic prior to the millennium age of movie-making. However, 17-plus years later there is no excuse for **Blair Witch** to be lame and lazy in its artificial scares given its continuation to carry on _The Blair Witch Project\u2019s_ haunting bloodline.\r\n\r\n**Blair Witch\u2019s** premise centers on the special bond of a brother-sister duo\u2026or shall we say brother-missing sister duo. James (James Allen McCune) wants to look into the 20-year disappearance of his sister Heather who vanished in the Black Hills Forest. James is almost certain that Heather is alive and well. Furthermore, he contends that perhaps Heather is an instrumental part of the Blair Witch legend that exists. So James sets out to investigate his sister\u2019s whereabouts but not without his entourage joining him.\r\n\r\nAmong James\u2019s friends that journey into the deep woods are Lisa (Callie Hernandez), boyfriend-girlfriend team Peter and Ashley (Brandon Scott and Corbin Reid) not to mention a couple of tour guides in Lane and Talia (Wes Robinson and Valorie Curry). In particular, Lisa has another reason to go trekking through the fearsome forest with James and company\u2013she needs to bring along her camera and record her adventures for a film school project. And so James and his crew foolishly set out to chase the notion of survivalist Heather as Lisa concentrates on her agenda to helm a documentary-style thesis for her film-making studies. Soon, the telegraphed chaos ensues for which **Blair Witch** fanatics are accustomed to by now. The serving of the repetitive shaky cam, the so-called spontaneous hysterics and nerve-racking aura of the surrounding woods comes off as a hammy, inconsequential effect. The chills and thrills are relentlessly watered-down. Plus, **Blair Witch** does not effectively utilize its low-budgeted charm to convey the mounting tension\u2026at least to the degree that made the original edition more appealing in its small scare toxicity.\r\n\r\nRoutinely, **Blair Witch** is manufactured with all the creativity and originality of a haunted house\u2019s creaky door searching to be lubricated. There is nary any genuine shocks or jolts that register with an impacting punch. The recipe for **Blair Witch** is a shameless by-the-dots regurgitation of the aforementioned 1999 trail-blazing woodsy terrain-terror treat. The film gets off to a rather clumsy start spotlighting lapses of silly-minded fodder to compliment the toothless scares. Sadly, the gradual build-up is relentlessly standard and morphs into typical cheesy slasher fare with an obligatory methodical pick-off of the scattering youthful prey. The only positive take that **Blair Witch** wears with a badge of honor is its advantageous usage of technological upgrading (both demonstrated on screen based on the characters\u2019 sophisticated equipment in the storyline and the behind the scenes shoot). In being a louder and flashier production does not automatically constitute **Blair Witch** as a well-received found footage horror show. In fact, Wingard\u2019s twitchy narrative fails despite the applied modern-day filming flourishes. In hindsight, transparent scares just does not cut it anymore in the realm of the horror universe.\r\n\r\nStructurally redundant as it travels down the familiar wooden path, Wingard does have high regard for the reminiscences of _The Blair Witch Project\u2019s_ legacy but it is too bad that he could not emphasize his cinematic appreciation more soundly in this woefully flaccid, forest-bound frightener.\r\n\r\n**Blair Witch** (2016)\r\n\r\nVertigo Entertainment\r\n\r\n1 hr. 29 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: James Allen McCune, Callie Hernandez, Brandon Scott, Valorie Curry, Wes Robinson, Corbin Reid\r\n\r\nDirected by: Adam Wingard\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: * 1\/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016","id":"57df2c999251413d68009bbd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57df2c999251413d68009bbd","movie_id":351211}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Given that it stars Shiva and Power Star Srinivasan, you might think that Adra Machan Visilu is a comedy, but the film is actually more of a drama \u2014 one that would have seen out-of-date even 20 years ago, because of how it is narrated. The irony is that the film does have something to say, especially in this age of mindless fan wars on social media, but the director has an archaic sense of filmmaking, and turns this into a painful film to sit through. The plot revolves around Sekar (Shiva), Ahmed (Arun Balaji) and Babu (Sentrayan) who are diehard fans of Power Star (Power Star). Sekar falls in love with Devi (Naina Sarkar) and to show the girl's father that he can be responsible, he, along his two buddies, decides to distribute his idol's film. But the film is a disaster and the three face heavy losses. They approach the star to compensate them, but he just ignores them. So, they decide to teach him a lesson. \r\n\r\nThere are dialogues that constantly take a dig at Rajinikanth (from the distributors demanding compensation to a director narrating a scene involving a snake that goes into the heroine's bathroom) and Thiraivannan seems to believe that using a few contemporary instances will make his film topical as well. But given how shoddily the film is made with no sense of pacing or continuity, these lines only feel like a desperate attempt to strum up some publicity. The director keeps jumping from one scene to the other in such a random fashion that you never get involved in the story. His attempts at comedy is also cringe-worthy, and the characterisation of Mansoor Ali Khan, as a money-minded doctor who cannot keep his hands off his nurses, is in bad taste. Even Shiva, who can be wonderful at deadpanning, is given with very little to do.

{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Adida Melam begins with a little boy being sent to prison for murder. The action cuts to a few years later and we are introduced to Saravanan (Abhay Krishna), a wedding planner, who lives with his mom (Urvashi) and uncle (Mayilsamy). His path crosses with that of Devaki (Abhinaya), who lies to him and uses him to get her friend married off in secret. Saravanan suffers a huge financial loss and Devaki tells him that she will repay his loans if he can stop her wedding to Manohar. He agrees but when Manohar offers him more money, he decides to let the wedding proceed. And on the eve of the wedding, he learns that Manohar \u2014 who is the little boy we were shown in the beginning \u2014 is planning to have his revenge on Devaki and so, to stop the event, he kidnaps her!\r\n\r\nThe tone of Adida Melam is wildly inconsistent, swinging from melodrama to comedy, at times even in the same scene. A crucial character suffers a heart attack, a girl is cunningly sold off to a pimp, a supporting character turns into a murderer, a woman immolates herself, but if you have to go by the last half an hour, the film wants us to treat it only as a comedy. The jokes are rather silly, but the moments involving Urvashi, who realises the childishness of the material and plays to the gallery, work. But the director is hardly able to present a coherent narrative. Scenes just abruptly end or begin with no link in-between, and technically, the film feels amateurish. Even short films today have better cinematography and sound mixing. Thankfully, the film doesn't take itself seriously, and the only reason why we stay till the end is to find out how far the director can take the ridiculousness to.","id":"57036c24c3a36822bd0009e9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57036c24c3a36822bd0009e9","movie_id":391429}
{"author":"sitenoise","content":"A story we've seen from Japan a thousand times: Pretty girl transfer student from Tokyo to Hicksville falls for the brooding bad boy in class. It treats this middle school romance as if it's a little more mature than it is. What sets it apart are some of the directorial choices in editing and sound.\r\n\r\nThere are some over-the-top drama moments that would kill the film if they weren't normalized by the weirdness of the overall. Almost every scene in the film is accompanied by a different piece of music. Some good, some not so good, but they all act strongly, not in the background, in shaping the emotion of the scene. And the director uses the emotion, or intensity, of the music to shape her film editing. It's not subtle, and I don't think I've seen anything like it before--at least to the extent that the whole film follows this pattern, scene after scene.\r\n\r\n_Drowning Love_ doesn't seem to care much about being a film as much as being a Live Action adaptation of a manga (which I haven't read). The director (I learned after the fact and it made perfect sense) is a 20-something young woman. It's like \"Hey! One of us actually did this instead of some pervy old man!\" and may explain some of the music video\/video game aspects of the presentation.\r\n\r\nThere's one big problem with it. Well, two. The first is: it doesn't really make sense. The second is: it starts off as a typical teen romance (_shojo_, I think they're called), then an attempted\/aborted rape happens which kicks up the intensity--until it gets lost. And that's the problem. This middle school girl almost gets raped, and two minutes later in the film it's forgotten or downplayed by everyone until the end where it's brought back up for the finale. There's also a \"sensitive boy\" friend who gets tossed off the film after doing his little duty. The adults in the film are just place holders who look out of place in the film--basically the way they must look to most middle school kids. Kudos for that.\r\n\r\n**Nana Komatsu** of _World of Kanako_ fame stars. She's got a certain set of chops. A fancy boy-idol, who dyed his hair blond for the role, plays broody boy. They have chemistry, and I enjoyed Nana's complexity in dealing with broody boy. He treats her like a dog and she's determined to get to a place where he will be a whimpering puppy. And tells him as much. I enjoy the way the Japanese use middle school students to act out a **Doomed Lovers** play. You look at the players--they're young, there's no sex. They seem innocent, but are given dialog that betrays a wisdom and experience beyond their years.\r\n\r\nNot recommending it to anyone who isn't already interested in these kinds of movies. But this one is a little different and could offer something of interest because of the out-of-the-box way it's constructed. I think the ending is supposed to be big and meaningful but it didn't make any sense to me. It's not a film that meanders around and then offers an emotional payoff at the end. It just spirals off.","id":"59a9c087c3a368505d000842","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59a9c087c3a368505d000842","movie_id":410220}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The women's perspective, about the women's troubles!**\r\n\r\nIt seems like a sequel to the recent film 'Fathers & Daughters'. But it was not and the narration had multiple layers. The stories of mothers and daughters, about their relationship and other related things. A feature film directional debut for the television filmmakers. Based on no book, but an original screenplay. The problem was the confusing narration, all the characters, too many of them stuffed together. Even the editing was not that convincing, though the actors were really good.\r\n\r\nA hard hitting, women oriented film as the title hints. Takes time to feel comfortable, but worth a wait. Focused on topics like pregnancy and other troubles in life, but all are concerned between women. So it's not a romance, but at the end, it ends as one. There are men too, though they doesn't count, hence no big names of the male actors. There's no big issue with the film, except it looks like neither theatrical or television film, but comes between them.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Knowing it's a research, the mistake is emotionally attached to the subject!**\r\n\r\nA nicely made sci-fi-thriller, but the entire storyline was built on a very familiar plot. You can find it similarities with 'Splice', 'Uncanny' and 'Ex Machina', but I think overall not a bad attempt. I did not get impressed, so do most of the people who saw those films, especially the end scene. Though it is entertaining, particularly when it turns into an action mode.\r\n\r\nThe corporate that invested in a research sends an investigator named Lee after the project was met with a small accident. During an interview, the chaos unleashes and the lab started to fall apart. The survivours does not know who to trust, but decides to save their subject. What really follows after that will be totally unexpected and another twist before the final credits.\r\n\r\nKnowing it's a research, the mistake is emotionally attached to the subject. That's what all the similar topic films reveal. Then what's the point of doing such test, being doctor, studied psychology. For a film plot, they wanted to use the human sentiments and errors. Otherwise, science does not really deal like what was shown in this film.\r\n\r\nFrom a new director, with the decent actors, particularly Kate Mara's best in an action avatar. I liked the Anya in the film 'The Witch' and this is another good performance by her in the title role. Felt like it is a short film, because the pace was so good, even though the story was a one-liner. Minimal cast film and takes place in a remote place secret research lab. A film not for everyone, but not bad for once viewing.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"5851b92292514146c900945d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5851b92292514146c900945d","movie_id":377264}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**They just wanted to buy a new camera, but the journey has changed their lives forever.**\r\n\r\nThere's a big difference between B movie and Indie films, which sometimes people are confused with. This one is both of them. If Indie films are good, it will be easily recognised widely. Mainly because of attending film fests. But that's not the same case for B movies. This category films usually made with a low budget, and second tier actors, filmmakers. So the production quality makes all the difference and fall into not fit for even airing on the television. Hence, most of the time ends up direct-to-video. Even though with such tight circumstance, there are some enjoyable B movies out there. We just have not come across it.\r\n\r\nYou can do a quick research on this that this is not even known to a fraction per cent of regular film goers. I found it accidentally and as usual, I took my chances. Now I feel I have made a right choice. This is nothing new. The same old road movie, the same old message. One of the main roles would have been so perfect for Greta Gerwig to play. But anyway, this actress who I have never seen before had done a nice job too. There are some recognisable faces in it as well, like Lyndsy Fonseca and Eric Roberts.\r\n\r\nDespite familiarity and predictability, the film was enjoyable. It had some good moments, as well as overwhelmed by adult comedies. This is the story of Claire who is in her 20s with a tender heart, but raised by an Agoraphobic mother. So she has no social skills, that changes one day when she befriends Danielle whose camera she had broken. The road trip begins to get a new camera. They set to travel another town which actually becomes a life changing event in their life.\r\n\r\n> \u275dIt's not our responsibility to suffer the consequences of our actions, but rather celebrate them.\u275e\r\n\r\nFor a such film, the writing to direction, performances, locations, all were very much acceptable. But there was a moment during the last quarter, which served as a twist in the tale, for that I said 'not that'. Because I was not expecting the narration to end up with that cheap twist, since I'd enjoyed so far of the film. That line was so typical. Anyway, that's how the story goes and characters were designed. So no big deal, since it is not a mainstream film to criticise heavily for having no creativity. Though I'm wondering how film critics would react to a film like this.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I thought it was a Christian film. Because of an innocent character like Claire, and Danielle, a daughter pastoral. Then the following events were totally surprised me. Gay sub-theme, sex jokes, the narration did not shy away to exploit them. Like I always say, if you are aware of what kind of film you are watching, the risk you are taking, and expecting it accordingly, then there will be no such thing called disappointment. Despite it is not a must see film, I would say why won't you give it a try! You might not go to add it to your favourite list, at least there's a chance that you might get entertained.\r\n\r\n_6.5\/10_","id":"5a7703de925141059a0450cf","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a7703de925141059a0450cf","movie_id":352280}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**What if the experts are wrong! And how it affects the common man!**\r\n\r\nJodie Foster did wonderfully as a captain of the ship. She could have acted in it, instead concentrate only on the direction, so that opportunity went to Julia Robers. With George Clooney onboard for one of the main roles, this was one of the best team to work together, as well the film was very enjoyable. So better than what I thought of it and I feel I should have given a better rating. But one thing is for sure that it was made for the people to have a good time, not for the critics morons.\r\n\r\nA real time narration, takes place in one normal morning is a newsroom studio where the financial expert Lee Gates, going to give his advice to the investor where to put their money. But the show suddenly got hit by an intruder when he takes the host as a hostage. He demands some answers from him regarding what he'd said a week ago in the same show, which led him to lose all his money. With this kind of complication how its going to conclude was nicely told with some edgy scenes towards the end.\r\n\r\nBoth, Clooney and Julia was good, but it was Jack O'Connell who hand upper hand. He has done some great films lately and now this, I hope he continues his good work. It was inspired by the real glitch that saw in the stock market, but altered to suit the cinematic, especially turning it into a crime-thriller with some powerful characters to deal such an interesting situation made big differences in its success.\r\n\r\nThe writing was good, because, it was kind of realistic like what a common man do and his intentions are when he can't understand the terms the experts speak or give the reason for the loss. So there are some pauses like 'what next' kind of stuffs that intentionally did. Despite a serious thriller, there are some funs. Whom you're going to cheer is up to you, but it keeps your head up all the time with its fine pace and developments. This is not the best among you find from this year, but surely a good watch if your purpose is entertainment or timepass,\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"57d3091cc3a3681ff7000797","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57d3091cc3a3681ff7000797","movie_id":303858}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> Mothers and their responsibilities despite struggling through.\r\n\r\nI heard Garry Marshall has died a couple of weeks ago, so I decided to watch it rather sooner. He was a good director, one of the rare kind to focus on the women subjects and multi-starrer. I loved films such as 'Overboard', 'Valentine's Day', 'Pretty Woman', 'Frankie and Johnny' and many more. His films definitely not for everyone, but certain kinds of viewers would enjoy them and so did I.\r\n\r\nThis is the final movie in the Special Day trilogy. I certainly adored 'Valentine's Day', but the next film 'New Year's Eve' was pretty bad and this third film comes between those two. The story was okay, but nothing looked seriously compelling. The best parts were the actors, theirs present and performances makes it watchable. What Jason Sudeikis is doing in the 'Mother's Day' poster is the first thing I wanted to be answered.\r\n\r\nThe story opens a week or so early to the mother's day and focuses on the various mothers who are all has connections somewhere. Being the mother and their responsibilities were this film's purpose. Though I anticipated a bit emotional or the strong message, but it ended as an ordinary film. Surely a decent timepass film, but it had its chances to be a better one and it never untilised that opportunity well. A few people might like it, but most won't. Overall a feel good film, despite whatever your rating going to be at the end of the watch.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"57a3706c9251410a5f002ddc","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57a3706c9251410a5f002ddc","movie_id":353069}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Very intentional film, but could not deliver!**\r\n\r\nThere are lots of similarities with other films, maybe not directly. In todays world, it became practice to give kids (and sometimes for women) their own version of what meant for only grownups. So there's no use whining about that. Because those who does might not be the target audience. This is I think purely for kids, otherwise it would have not got bold PG, but like usual for any film, I gave it a try. Even though it's not original, somewhat I enjoyed watching it.\r\n\r\nThe story was in usual pattern that opened with an intro, then moving to unleash the long trapped ancient creatures into the human society. One becomes friend with it and a few starting to hunt it with the rest are as the neutral or unaware of it. There's nothing unpredictable in it. And so the tale comes to halt with a finale where maximum push was given, but overall it fails to impress on the average expectation.\r\n\r\nGood title, good idea, even the graphics were not bad, but not good enough stunts with okay performances. I feel it could have become a good television series than the film. So they should scrap the idea if they have one for a sequel and instead make a shift to television. Other than what I thought, this is a good entertainer for little kids. So it should be watched by them more than their counterparts.\r\n\r\n_5\u00bd\/10_","id":"5901237ec3a36810c6002dc8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5901237ec3a36810c6002dc8","movie_id":262841}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Girl finds out the true identity of her people.**\r\n\r\nOkay, I shocked when I heard this film did not get the Oscars nod, except for a song. Now I have seen the film and I come to know why. This is a one liner, but developed into a longer version Except the initial parts, this film is like a limited cast\/character film. Most of the film takes place in the sea sailing around fighting evil force to break the curse. But at the end, you would feel this kind of story is not worth for a feature film. It looks a perfect short animation theme.\r\n\r\nDisney never disappoints its fans, well, for me. So I enjoyed it, it was fun and entertaining, but too simple. The characters were cute, this is a wonderful film for kids and some grownups would too enjoy it. But this is not for all, unlike most of the Disney animations are. Dwayne's voice lending for one of the lead characters was good, but the girl steals the show. Especially if you are a kid and\/or a girl.\r\n\r\nThe best film since 'Lilo & Stitch' on the similar theme about Pacific islands' people. But it reminded me 'Whale Rider'. Overall, I think the story should have been improved a bit, in particular by including a few more characters at least for the partial appearances. This is not the best animation of the year, also definitely the bad one to skip. If your purpose of the watch is entertainment\/timepass, it is good at that.\r\n\r\n_6\u00bd\/10_","id":"58b340cfc3a368525400b1bd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b340cfc3a368525400b1bd","movie_id":277834}

Because I could not find a single white or any other race people, even in the background.\r\n\r\nThe happy parts are, it is surprisingly a very interesting theme. I loved the storyline. The three phases of a man's life. How things around us can influence to build a personality. Sometimes in a good sense, but according to this film, there are some dramatic turns. Though the end was very simple, but I liked the first episode. It had potential to be a message film, but the later parts turned differently. Most importantly realistic narrative.\r\n\r\nMore like it is about the life cycle. Feels like a short and suburban version of 'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring'. All the actors were so good. The screenplay was adapted from a book. Looks like it's a breakthrough for the director. I hope he keeps up the momentum and gives us the best products in the future.

{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Following in your film-making father\u2019s footsteps can be perceived either as a credible career choice or an inevitable curse. So the question is put forth to **Morgan** first-time director Luke Scott as he oversees this kinetic but overly familiar choppy and saggy sci-fi horror-thriller.  Of course Luke is the son of famed _Alien_ and _Blade Runner_ movie mastermind Ridley Scott\u2013the co-producer of his offspring\u2019s muddled and mediocre futuristic feature.\r\n\r\nSure, the young Scott incorporates some of the elder Scott\u2019s cinematic flourishes but for the most part **Morgan** toys around with interesting philosophical concepts and perceptions but fails to make any of these adventurous ingredients gel with any lingering forethought beyond the identity of a probing and generic genetics-oriented melodrama.\r\n\r\nIndeed, **Morgan** has its moments of energetic lapses but the tension is telegraphed from miles away. There is something superficial about the manufactured dilemma in **Morgan** that simply misses the mark in mustering any legitimate skepticism about artificial intelligent ingenues gone roguish. The continued genre of artificial human beings\u2013male or female\u2013seems like a fascinating fable to tap into the mind of humanistic arrogance and progression. With past showcases as Michael Crichton\u2019s _Westworld_ or Steven Spielberg\u2019s _A.I._ one can see the preoccupation with revisiting this film phenom topic especially in the age of millennium movie-making. Unfortunately, the arrival of the mediocre **Morgan** does not quite follow a glorious path in this cinematic tradition.\r\n\r\nThe center of attention in this lucrative experimentation of artificial life forms involves a \u201cgirl\u201d named Morgan (Anya Taylor-Joy). The construction of Morgan is quite ambitious as she is composed of synthetic DNA while placed physically in the body of a wild-child acting teenager. Morgan has the mentality (and physicality) of 5-year old lab-grown specimen kid and we get to check out her so-called psychological malfunctioning when she aggressively attacks Dr. Kathy Grieff (Academy Award nominee Jennifer Jason Leigh, \u201cThe Hateful Eight\u201d) in her claustrophobic room. When Morgan tragically stabs Dr. Grieff in the eyeball we are bluntly hit over the head with the brutal hinting that this little hoodie-wearing dangerous diva is a walking disastrous time-bomb waiting to happen among the opportunistic human lab technician capitalists that invented her caustic existence.\r\n\r\nEnter Lee Weathers (Kate Mara). Corporate risk analyst consultant Lee is sent by her profitable employer to the remote testing lab where Morgan was conceived to obviously oversee their expensive investment in the artificially crafted feminine pet project that now is showing telling signs of defiance and disobedience. The uncontrollable Morgan is an unhinged handful to contain and the lab staff at the facility are scattering about to contain the selective damage done by her destructive hands. In general, the massive and deep-wooded compound that houses Morgan and the various doctors, lab techs, researchers and business associates that come in unison for the sake of human technological tampering is a sinister setting to say the least.\r\n\r\nMorgan is downright deadly and not a techno-tart to tangle with at will. As Dr. Kathy continues to nurse her severe eye-related wounds inflicted by the haunting human-like honeybun with indescribable speed and strength the other facility caretakers realize that the brooding Morgan may in fact be too much to handle for the self-appointed brilliant scientific minds that gave her questionable life. Among the brainy bunch that are trying to lasso the unpredictable tiny terror is Morgan\u2019s main creator in the Nervous Ned-like persona of geeky Dr. Simon Ziegler (Toby Jones). Dr. Lui Cheng (Michelle Yeoh from \u201cMechanic: Resurrection\u201d) is not new to the controversial rodeo where humanoid experimentation is concerned (resulting in Lui\u2019s former colleague\u2019s tragic fates). Married doctors in Brenda and Darren Finch (Vinette Robinson and Chris Sullivan) hold some glossy parental fondness for the hostile teen-experiment-in-turmoil. Dr. Amy Menser (\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d star Rose Leslie) has eerily taken some head-scratching \u201cfancy\u201d to the youthful Morgan that goes beyond inappropriate means. Rounding out the colorful group that cater to the facility functioning (and Morgan\u2019s every step of chaos) is Lee\u2019s tour guide Ted (Michael Yare) and cooking guru Skip Vronsky (Boyd Holbrook).\r\n\r\n**Morgan** has some tension-filled wallop that resonates occasionally but the draggy drama never quite stimulates to the point of presenting Taylor-Joy\u2019s lab-table vixen as nothing more that a brutish brat with a temper. The thought of Taylor-Joy\u2019s minor-aged monster being unleashed on an unsuspecting world must have looked intriguing on the creative drawing board. However, being a pesky thorn in the side of misguided scientific minds does not exactly spell tasty devastation on society as a whole. In fact, we find ourselves cheering for the maligned Morgan to knock off these myopic medical duds to get some guilty pleasure relief from this lethal but lumbering horror sideshow.\r\n\r\nOwens\u2019s labored script is never challenging enough to buy into the cynicism of the profitable propaganda involving artificial intelligence at the expense of human curiosities.** Morgan** routinely dips into the blank coldness of hollow despair with only Taylor-Joy\u2019s random naughtiness as the reliant stimulant. Mara\u2019s Lee Weathers is surprisingly effective as the truth-seeking corporate drone out to uncover the mysteries of Morgan and the pricey lab compound that needs to prove its usefulness to her inquiring organization. Paul Giamatti pops up as the only sensible soul diagnosing the unwound Morgan as a potential toxic teen to the world environment.\r\n\r\nThere is some slickness and saucy sentiments to the uneven **Morgan** but it channels nothing dynamically distinctive from other considerable fare that competently tapped into this theme with more profoundly in-depth pizzazz and promise. Morgan may be a super-powered enigma and the hard-nosed Lee Weathers wants this frenzied freak show deactivated and put out of her misery. This is rather funny because the true troubleshooters that need deactivation are the **Morgan**-made manipulators (both on screen and off screen) that should return to the lukewarm lab room.\r\n\r\n**Morgan** (2016)\r\n\r\nScott Free Films\r\n\r\n1 hr. 32 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Kate Mara, Anya Taylor-Joy, Toby Jones, Rose Leslie, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Paul Giamatti, Michelle Yeoh, Rose Leslie, Vinette Robinson, Chris Sullivan, Boyd Holbrook, Michael Yare\r\n\r\nDirected by: Luke Scott\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror & Science Fiction\/Fantasy & Technology\/Artificial Intelligence Drama\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016","id":"57cbc91bc3a3680a17001590","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57cbc91bc3a3680a17001590","movie_id":377264}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**To redefine the life and to discover the love.**\r\n\r\nFrom the British director of 'Fish Tank' fame, this is another a young struggling girl's story. Being brought up in a low income and abusive family, and because of that trying to redefine the life. Not about heading the wrong way like drugs and other related stuffs. So this is the story of an older teen girl named Star who flees the home to find her new life and love. It all begins when she meets a youngster in a supermarket and since then she followed him everywhere. Actually the film focused to tell a gang of youth who are door to door magazine subscription dealers. They travel all over the country and have all kinds of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nIn order to stay in the group, Star has to prove her worth. She reserves her spot, but working on her own way. I always feared the narration might go to take a nasty twist. There came a couple scenes near to that, but compromised not to change the mood of the storytelling. Because it seems the writer was interested to reveal a girl try to achieve two goals. After coming to know one of it was staged, how she contemplates the other one crafted carefully. Not to forget, her fate, the future depends on it, since she's not well qualified to go out in the world to do whatever she wants.\r\n\r\nSo I think it was a decent film with a decent message. If you know the director, you would know what her films talk about. Unlike 'Fish Tank', this is about an American girl. The influence of lifestyle, culture, almost everything related to youngsters covered. The lead actress was good. It was not Shia Labeouf's film, but in a supporting role, he did his best. There are a few others I knew, but they did not get big part. The only issue with it was the length. If you are okay with it, especially for a slow drama, then the film is enjoyable. 'American Honey' is like 'American Money', one of the ways people try to make their 'American Dream' come to true. This film is exclusively for drama genre fans.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"587a9c36c3a36847e8007c84","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/587a9c36c3a36847e8007c84","movie_id":340485}

In a small rural America, where farmers are surrendering to death for unable to pay back the loans, a 11 year old girl is not disturbed by the adult's way of life. Her best friend, a chicken named Happy, roam all over surrounding places. One day she finds a man trapped in her silo. They two becomes friends and help each others needs. But the girl never knew there's a complication behind meeting him. And when that breaks loose, drastically things changes and brings an end to the narration with a twist.\r\n\r\nThe storyline was good, but kind of reminds 'Pan's Labyrinth'. This was more a thriller than a fantasy, yet a few scenes defines it could be influenced by fable as the title say. It had a philosophical touch too. The timeline of the tale was 1980s and in the eyes of adult, it is a perfect thriller that focused on the farmers' issue. But, since the story was narrated from the eyes of a kid, that's where magical perspective blooms. So the mix of both these things makes the film very special.\r\n\r\n> -xX] Important people don't have to say they're important. [Xx-\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the film's drawback, the curves of the storytelling, the scenes were not smoothened enough. I mean the ideas were awesome, but small-small thing had hard time to get away with a perfect blend. For example, the girl could have broken the door\/lock from the outside or given foods and other items through the window, instead of climbing up. But the major parts of the film had nothing wrong and can be enjoyed. What it all says is the rookie mistake, but surely the filmmaker has talent and hoping her next one would be a top notch.\r\n\r\nThe little girl was very impressive. It reminds many big stars of the present who once did such a wonderful film as a child artist. So I wish her future to be great. She was all over the film, the rest of the cast had little scope, but they all did good as well. Predicting the story is not hard, but there's always one thing bothers is that the doubt between reality and fiction. You know it's not usual for one to find a man trapped in a silo. It has to be one way or the other as I've said. For that, you have to wait till the commencement of the third act. Because sometimes, the could be the film's greatest twist.\r\n\r\nAs I've said, it was not a perfect thriller. Nor ignorable! Most of the scene seems intentional, because they were initiated in the early stage like an intro, only in the latter half, once again, they were brought into the narration with the following consequences. How such things were used to complete the storytelling was well planned design. On this, don't believe the film critics. Me either, if you are not a film fanatic. But all I say is, it is not a bad film as you see on the internet. Those who takes chances and appreciates small scale films should try it. But generally, I recommend it to all!\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5a7714f2925141059c044683","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a7714f2925141059c044683","movie_id":381064}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**About a father who never gave up on his daughter!**\r\n\r\nThe book was from the 90s and the story is about the 60s. Narrated from the father's perspective, that's what I think did not work in this film. This is where a film and the book does not synch. Because books are always very detail when it describes a person. In the films, they are just a simple visual where viewers have to focus on those details to have a perfect impression like the book. So I totally point out to the writer who did not quite transformed the point of the storytelling.\r\n\r\nIt is not the parents to decide what their kids want to be. The film opened with a couple ready to get married, arguing with their elders about something. Soon it forwards to a few years where their relationship with their daughter seems not good. Further, they become more distant and completely lose her for the unrest in the society and the nation. But father never gives up. His love and care for her leads the way and what comes later is even more disturbing before it all ends.\r\n\r\nIt was Ewan McGregor's directional debut. I don't think he would try it again, not any time soon. But I would appreciate his quality of filmmaking. He only needs a better writer and the screenplay. I also think, he should not direct himself. I never considered him a best actor. I yet to see his performance. The film was not strong enough, if you are from outside the United States. Because what they call this 60s revolution was more a misunderstood by the young people. Particularly that religious thing, they were misled and spoiled their lives. So, instead of focusing that, the film centred on a father-daughter relationship. That is why it was a decent film. Otherwise I would have rated even wrose.\r\n\r\n_5.5\/10_","id":"59fe1265925141470c022afa","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59fe1265925141470c022afa","movie_id":326285}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"The Tamil version of the Hindi film Nil Battey Sannata, Amma Kanakku is a feel-good drama \u2014 the kind of film that leaves you with a warm, fuzzy feeling \u2014 despite dealing with an important subject: the need to have an ambition in life. It is a well-intentioned film that largely avoids the heavy-handed melodrama that such 'message movies' tend to go for, only succumbing to this pitfall towards the end. \r\n\r\nThe story revolves around Shanthi (Amala Paul), a single mother who works as a maid and does other odd jobs to make a living and raise her teenaged daughter Abinaya (Yuvalakshmi, adequate). But the girl has preconceived notions on life. She believes that just like a doctor's child growing up to become a doctor, she would grow up to become a maid. She isn't interested in academics because of this attitude of hers. Her worried mother, who wants a better future for her, decides to change her way of thinking by enrolling in the Abi's own class as a student. Does this ploy of Shanthi work? \r\n\r\nWhat works in Amma Kanakku is how Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari treats incidents in a low-key manner even while never trivialising the conflict in this tale. In the very little time she takes to establish Shanthi's and Abi's characters, we get to know where the two stand. For all her short-sightedness and adamant attitude, we understand why Abi doesn't have a dream in her life. She is living in a world where becoming a driver or a peon in a government office are considered achievements. At the same time, we see Shanthi working for the kind-hearted Dr Nandini (Revathi, lending heft to a lightweight role with her 'veteran actress' stature), and she has seen the kind of life that good education and aspirations can lead to, and realise why she wants her daughter to dream big. \r\n\r\nAshwiny's narration is also fleet-footed in the first half, with an undercurrent of humour running throughout the scenes. And in Ranganathan (Samuthirakani), Abi's school principal, we clearly see the kind of tone that the director is going for. From the improbable situations (like Shanthi's visit to a collector's residence) to Samuthirakani's slapstick performance, there is a lot of whimsy in this tale. This is even more evident in Ilaiyaraaja's score which wouldn't have been out of place in a silent film. \r\n\r\nBut even here, there are times when you can sense the presence of a director, be it in the performances or in the production design, that robs the film of spontaneity. Even with Amala Paul, who emotes well and holds the film together, we keep wishing that she had dubbed for herself. Her voice has been provided by Uma, whose modulation here is so close to what she did for Ritika Singh in Irudhi Suttru that it is somewhat jarring as the latter film (and performance) is still fresh in our memory. \r\n\r\nAnd some time into the second half, the tone begins to change and the film starts resembling the kind of film that one might picture in their minds when they hear of such a subject. Things start turning overtly emotional, and by the time we get to the climax, the dialogues start resembling fortune cookie quotes (eg: Un kanavu niravera un nambikkaidhaan kaaranam). It is only the panache in the filmmaking that stops the film from crumbling.","id":"57ba6863c3a3687d490025e3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ba6863c3a3687d490025e3","movie_id":391105}
{"author":"Toxic Fletch","content":"Beneath its wanton gross-out factor is an actually funny horror comedy.\r\n\r\nI turned this movie off after 20 minutes and really didn't want to continue. Forcing myself to watch it further, it actually improved, and considerably.\r\n\r\nThe plot of this basically is a janitor in a hospital has a date with a girl in the morgue. She's dead of course and died of radiation exposure resulting in him getting some super-STD, turning into a zombie, seeking out vaginal blood, and infecting several others. Along comes a group of high schoolers on their way to a beach weekend and pulling over at a roadside hotel in the town to stay over the night. But they didn't plan on the horny dead making an appearance.\r\n\r\nAn experiment in excessive gross-out this movie is, but as disgusting as it is, it is actually well scripted, well lit for a nighttime movie and briskly paced. It is funny, though some of that humor is off-color and offensive.\r\n\r\nI give it a 6\/10, but do bring your own vomit bag, or more preferably a bucket.\r\n\r\n**Toxic Fletch**","id":"590e47809251414edb014324","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/590e47809251414edb014324","movie_id":362227}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**We learn from our mistakes, but some people from a supernatural accident!**\r\n\r\nSo another switching body and soul theme, but not as bad as it looks. The problem is, it was so ordinary story, like the writers were never serious about making it big. That is the first thing what this film compromised. That makes it the quality of a television film. I mean the production quality was amazing, including all the graphics parts, but the plot was not developed to greater heights. So falls short to entertain its viewers, especially if you had seen films like 'Fluke' and others. The younger kids might like it, but this film was made keeping in the mind all the ages. So surely anybody can watch this, but the joy is limited.\r\n\r\nVery sad to know it was made by 'Men in Black' director. For his capability, this is a silly film. I don't know the reason, maybe he was tricked and the only way out is making this film. Whatever, his presence was what made this film so rich in the technical side. This is the story of a successful businessman who is a proud owner of the tallest building in the northern hemisphere. There's no respect by him for his employees and he totally neglected his family, particularly his young daughter. But one fateful day, his soul gets trapped in a cat and from there, how he's going to make it back is what told with his great struggles.\r\n\r\nI would say the cast was decent and so the screenplay, but the CGI cat was awesome, almost flawless for such a small film like this. The story and its events were not explained in details for us like how it had all happened like its logic. Since we are familiar with this type of films, they skipped most important segments and went directly to the story to develop which is actually the struggles like fighting back to break the curse than shaping up it with a neat story. So in my viewpoint, it is okay for watching once. This is a comedy, but you would hardly laugh. Yet much better than those real comedies from the recent times.\r\n_\r\n6\/10_","id":"581cf9449251416611000080","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/581cf9449251416611000080","movie_id":322240}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Is it safe to assume that the flea-bitten feline fantasy **Nine Lives** has completely gone to the dogs? Do not let this cockeyed kiddie comedy fool you because despite its intentional cuteness involving a self-deprecating, wise-cracking wealthy businessman-turned-hedonistic hairball may be appealing to the Romper Room crowd **Nine Lives** has all the comical chops of juggling chunky kitty litter. Charmless, insipid and trivial, this juvenile clawed and clumsy caper showcasing cheesy-minded whimsy about a hybrid self-absorbed big bucks blowhard\/adorable pesky pussycat and the lead little gal enjoying the mystical mayhem at large may lower the IQs for the tot-friendly audience it looks to cater to with cheap, cloying chuckles.\r\n\r\nPerhaps ragging on a fetid fluff fable as **Nine Lives** is probably as blasphemous as kicking a twitchy-nosed bunny in its precious tummy. The question remains, however, if the bunny initially deserved that harsh kick? It boggles the mind as to what notable names are attached to this toothless, ticklish project. Director Barry Sonnenfeld, the heralded puppeteer behind hits such as _Men in Black_ and _Get Shorty_, inexplicably tries to breathe loony life into this stillborn catty concoction of recycled sight gags, and sugary sentimentality. Still, the manufactured roguishness and obviousness of the lightweight high jinks will have one pawing for something more, er\u2026purrrrr-cisely appetizing. In addition to Sonnenfeld\u2019s mediocre directorial efforts behind the camera, the real curiosity is how two-time Oscar winner Kevin Spacey signed on the dotted line to partake in this catnip-laced catastrophe. Amazingly, **Nine Lives** not only boasts one Academy Award winner in the aforementioned Spacey but two with the inclusion of the ubiquitous off-the-wall Christopher Walken. The only true sympathetic victim subjected to this tepid tail-wagging tease is the helpless cat forced to carry this Disney-esque dud on its poor furry shoulders.\r\n\r\nNoticeably, **Nine Lives** tries to be slick in tackling (or loosely exploiting) the current phenomenon of two separate entities: the popularity of the countless infectious YouTube online cat videos that aim to soothingly please the masses and the satirical profiling of controversial 2016 American presidential hopeful Donald J. Trump (through Spacey\u2019s callous characterization). Granted **Nine Lives** has its occasional brushes with welcomed impishness but for the most part this nutty narrative pussyfoots around in a total lackluster whimper.\r\n\r\nSpacey plays a megalomaniac multi-millionaire New York City-based real estate developer named Tom Brand whose specialty in spouting stylish skyscrapers within his congested urban landscape keeps him hungry for more success and business-minded progression. The problem is that Brand\u2019s workload often interferes with spending quality time (or any time for that matter) with second wife Lara (Jennifer Garner in a throwaway role) and impressionable daughter Rebecca (Malina Weissman). Clearly, Brand\u2019s neglect of his loved ones is inexcusable but the boorish tycoon does care for his offspring Rebecca although his tendency to stomp on his employees and rivals comes second nature for him. Nevertheless, Brand wants to ensure that his Rebecca receives a special upcoming 11th birthday gift to remember. After all, she is Daddy\u2019s little princess.\r\n\r\nRebecca happens to be an insane cat lover. Tom, on the other hand, cannot stomach the four-legged cuddly critters. So Brand has no choice but to satisfy his darling\u2019s wishes as he bites the bullet and visits a questionable pet store operated by creepy Felix Perkins (a seemingly disinterested Christopher Walken). Brand dutifully purchases a striking-looking tomcat named Mr. Fuzzypants for Rebecca to relish as her prized present. Suddenly through a convoluted \u201caccident\u201d criminally wealthy Tom Brand becomes comatose. Additionally, he is transported inside the hairy-coated body of Mr. Fuzzypants. And there you have it\u2013Rebecca\u2019s ultimate wish for the ideal birthday gift as having her absent Daddy Dearest Tom and beloved pet cat Mr. Fuzzypants rolled into a 2-for-1 sale package for her to treasure.\r\n\r\nAside from the predictable puns, lame and cutesy dialogue and by-the-numbers sophomoric bits **Nine Lives** drags and feels as relentlessly ragged as a victimized toy mouse at the mercy of an inner city neighborhood feral tabby. Painfully witless and wooden there is not much for the on-screen participants to do in this flea collar farce other than to play second fiddle to the synthetic exploits of the Spacey-voiced CGI domesticated bushy-tailed beast. Sure, it is easy to dismiss **Nine Lives** as mindless entertainment for the indiscriminate rug rats looking for child-like escapism. The youngsters (or oldsters for that matter) are better off chuckling at the mini funny feline features on the Internet as opposed to tolerating this fledgling fantasy about profit-making papas becoming humbled by the outer-body experience of a playfully turbulent tomcat in order to appreciate what his true and genuine riches are at hand\u2013the foundation of family. It is actually a rather nice message to promote for the kids but it is woefully undermined by the forgettable goofiness that persists in this comedic cat-box.\r\n\r\nSpacey\u2019s Trump-inspired business-minded blowhard Brand is something that could have been rejoiced in another forum if it was not lazily trapped inside this pointless kid-friendly spectacle. The iconic presence of Walken as the resident eccentric cat whisperer is wasted and forgettable. The ones you truly feel sorry for in this merry-minded mess is the doomed duo of Weissman\u2019s Rebecca and her cat cohort Mr. Fuzzypants as they try to capture the childish spirit. Sadly the adult participants in **Nine Lives** need to have their SAG cards revoked. Not since 1993\u2019s _Look Who\u2019s Talking Now_ has voiceover critters been so relentlessly annoying.\r\n\r\nThe 87-minute **Nine Lives** feels like it equally drained the single life out of Mr. Fuzzypants and more important\u2013the movie ticket buyers.\r\n\r\n**Nine Lives** (2016)\r\n\r\nEuropaCorp\r\n\r\n1 hr. 27 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Garner, Christopher Walken, Malina Weissman, Teddy Sears, Talitha Bateman, Mark Consuelos, Robbie Amell, Cheryl Hines\r\n\r\nDirected by: Barry Sonnenfeld\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy\/Fantasy & Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: * 1\/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016","id":"57b125c2c3a368141c00246f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57b125c2c3a368141c00246f","movie_id":322240}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Two warring groups in a village, romance that blossoms between the youngsters in these groups, and a happy ending! Before you say 'Yawn!', here's the news. Mapla Singam is actually not bad. The film seems to have been cut from the same cloth as films like Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam. Sivakarthikeyan has made a career out of these films, and Vemal's attempts have largely gone unnoticed. Perhaps this one could do the magic.\r\n\r\nYou could call these films LCD (Least Common Denominator) films. They are projects that are kicked off with no greater ambition than to act as a mild diversion to the audience, especially the rural ones, for two hours. You get comedy, family drama, romance and even notional action scenes, but what works in these films' favour is that they don't take themselves seriously. That is why the antagonist is also never presented as a serious threat to the hero. Think Samuthirakani in Rajini Murugan. Here, this role goes to Ramdas. He is Mahesh Babu (didn't we say the antagonists in these films are never scary?), the head of one of these groups, while the other group is headed by Sevuga Pandian (Radha Ravi). Pandian's clan has been the chairman of the village for many years. Anbu (Vemal), his brother's son, is his right hand man, and acts as a mediator in all kinds of disputes, particularly those involving lovers. Now, Sevuga Pandian's daughter, Vinothini is in love with Sathish, who belongs to the other group. And Anbu, who goes to warn the youngster, falls for his sister, Sailaja, a lawyer!\r\n\r\nWhen Mapla Singam begins, with a collector (Pandiarajan) trying to make peace between the rival groups, things don't look promising. We are then introduced to Anbu and his gang of friends, which includes a foreigner (Adam Greig). He keeps commenting on the absurdity of the villagers' beliefs (Sevuga Pandian, for example, constantly keeps telling people to not educate their daughters) and his comments serve as the voice of reason. Nothing much happens in the first half, but the film manages to find a tone that is amusing to an extent; even when things seem to be getting formulaic, it doesn't bore you to death.\r\n\r\nThe resolution to the interval conflict is nicely done. We are told Vinothini and Sathish have eloped, but the second half shows what actually happened, and we smile at how the film has managed to surpass our opinion of it. Refreshingly, the film doesn't treat its female lead condescendingly as just someone who adds glam to the proceedings, like say Sakalakala Vallavan (the new one). In fact, it makes her character even more formidable than the hero. In fact, there is a sub-plot involving a local election as in that film, and Anjali is a candidate here as well. And the climax is quite low-key and we get an inexplicable satisfaction when exiting the theatre. Think we are over-selling the film? No, just bear in mind this is an LCD film... always!","id":"57036b7b925141625f00084f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57036b7b925141625f00084f","movie_id":345454}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Tell me the horse story!\r\n\r\nManhattan Night is directed by Brian DeCubellis and DeCubellis adapts the screenplay from the novel Manhattan Nocturn written by Colin Harrison. It stars Adrien Brody, Yvonne Strahovski, Jennifer Beals, Campbell Scott, Linda Lavin and Steven Berkoff. Music is by Joel Douek and cinematography is by David Tumblety.\r\n\r\nA New York journalist finds himself in a web of intrigue and passion when a woman asks him to investigate the mysterious death of her film director husband.\r\n\r\nHow wonderful to find that in this day and age there are still film makers willing to push film noir in its neo form up front and central. Of course the trick is knowing your staple requirements of what would be termed \"pure noir\", and of course noir in colour form is never going to be accepted in some quarters (understandably so). So approaching Manhattan Night to hopefully view a simple murder mystery thriller is likely to end in disappointment, for this beats a true noir heart and an understanding of that film making style and its narrative barbs should, hopefully, aid the viewing experience.\r\n\r\nInstantly we are served a classic era slice of noirvana as Brody's journalist Porter Wren starts narrating where he is at for story origin. Soon enough a sultry babe in the form of Strahovski's femme fatale enters the fray. Tumblety establishes that under wise direction we are in the realm of neo-noir photographic compliance, the pronounced primaries will continue to be a feature as the NYC locales bristling with beauty and lurking danger. All while Douek lays out a jazzy blues musical score that's knowingly complicit as a seamy character.\r\n\r\nDeCubellis has filled out his play with stock noir characters. The happily married man - a good father, giving in to temptation, the femme with a painful back story - which is compounded by a husband who is into psychotic love. The rich wealthy man damaged physically to the point of crushing his masculinity,\r\nand his hired goons who like their work way too much. Into the mix is the murder mystery, incriminating video footage, some family peril and a whole lot of eroticism. Welcome to Noirville!\r\n\r\nIt's not all dandy film making though. DeCubellis is guilty of letting Berkoff way overact in the first half of his character's story, but this is off set later in the film as Berkoff reins it in and gives us something more subtle and touching. The director\/writer also gives us an ending that doesn't have the courage to really beat a black heart, which is annoying since the pic has been set up previously as such. Yet there's so much to admire here, so much so it would be nice to see DeCubellis stay in this zone and take Tumblety with him. 8\/10","id":"5bf186a40e0a26265e06664c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bf186a40e0a26265e06664c","movie_id":311667}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A new kid on the block with the superpower.**\r\n\r\nI am not saying the film was terrible, but the timing was bad. There are loads of great sci-fi films were made recently and still coming out. So to compete with them, they have to go through alteration, even if they loose the origins of their film's theme concept. This story is same as many similar themed flicks. For me, it looked like a mini Superman film, but made for kids.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about it was, keeping everything simple. And then the pace, which actually somewhat saved the film. I hooked to it from the beginning till the conclusion, but familiarity is what killed my interest and entertainment. The characters were okay, not developed well enough. But keeping young audience in mind, it does good. Because going deep is unnecessary stretch.\r\n\r\nThe story of a high school boy who transferred back to a small town where has born. As he begins to hear a lot about his father from the local people, he becomes motivated to know more about him. But one day when something goes wrong, the next day he wakes up with great power. Not knowing how to handle it, he befriends with an unusual creature and together they fight those who are after them.\r\n\r\nInitially I thought it was related to 'Real Steel', but realised only while watching it it is completely different. From the director of 'Sorority Row', I think he did nothing wrong. Those who watch less films would enjoy it better. Visually okay, with all those graphics. Since it is PG13, I would say the target audience is the little ones. So from their perspective, it is acceptable.

So despite it was received so well from all the quarters, I kept my expectations low. The initial parts were okay, but its only during the final stage I begin to like it more. Especially the Casey's performance. I have seen him in many great films, in the big roles, but I think this one is his best, particularly from the positive perspective of the character he had played. Looks like the decade belongs to Affleck brothers. They have given great performances recently and acted in the great films that will be remembered for a long time.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of the Lee, a man who works as a janitor. One day he receives a call that his brother had passed away as he was suffering from the illness for a some time. Since his brother got divorced, all the responsibility comes under his belt, including his teenage son. Now those two struggles to join the force, but somehow manages all. Meanwhile, till the conclusion, the Lee's life before that point were disclosed to us, like how he struggled in his own life before coming to end in the current situation.\r\n\r\nI could be wrong, but Casey Affleck's going to win the Oscars for his performance. Andrew Garfield is the other guy standing between his chance. I'll be happy whoever wins between them. I like Michelle Williams, but her Oscars nominee is meaningless. What, she appeared for 10-15 minutes in the entire narration which can be tagged as a guest appearance than a full fledged role. This is a fine drama, one of the year's best, deserved all the Oscars nod it got. Surely worth a watch and I recommend it.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"58b0985792514174ed000b9c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b0985792514174ed000b9c","movie_id":334541}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"'It's difficult to narrate some love stories... We have tried' \u2014 This statement is what opens Maalai Nerathu Mayakkam, Gitanjali Selvaraghavan's debut film. Working from a script written by her husband, Selvaraghavan, the director has given us a film that, like most Selvaraghavan films, explores an aspect of romance that mainstream cinema finds queasy to talk about.\r\n\r\nThe film begins with Manoja (Wamiqa) being wooed by her one-time boyfriend Tarun (Sharran) and flashes back to narrate her life with Prabhu (Balakrishnan). He is, again, like most Selvaraghavan heroes, an introvert, who doesn't know how to behave with women. But as fate would have it, he gets married to Manoja \u2014 her cancer-stricken mother pretty much blackmails her to agree to this. But, on their wedding night itself, Manoja makes it apparent to him that she's least interested in being a wife to him. Earlier on, we see Prabhu's friends pull his leg saying that given that his life's decisions are taken by his dad (Azhagamperumal), he is going to end up with an 'ooru side ponnu'. But, it is Prabhu who is the 'traditional' one in this couple \u2014 he listens to Manmadha Rasa, asks for sambar rice in an Italian restaurant and when Manoja asks him about his previous girlfriends, says, 'Ellaame en wifekaaga-nu serthu vechurundhen'.\r\n\r\nSo, initially, when Manoja doesn't reciprocate his love, he thinks that she is being haughty (her boyfriends popping up now and then don't help), but later realises that she is put off by his lack of sophistication and his judgemental attitude. The manner in which they warm up to each other is beautifully brought out (of course, there is conveniently an illness that facilitates this change of heart), and just when we expect things to become alright, he rapes her under the influence of alcohol and she attempts suicide. She survives and even though Prabhu expresses regret and seeks her forgiveness, Manoja divorces him \u2014 he did commit the heinous act. They drift apart but cannot erase the memories of the other from their lives. But, can Manoja find it in herself to forgive Prabhu and fall in love with him as she had once hoped to?\r\n\r\nGiven that he is the writer, it's no surprise that the fingerprint of Selvaraghavan is all too evident in Maalai Nerathu Mayakkam. The leads look and behave in the manner the leads in those films looked. Prabhu has the hangdog expression and the whiny voice of the hero of 7\/G, Rainbow Colony, while Manoja is that typical Selvaraghavan heroine with sad eyes and a bold attitude. And what's a Selvaraghavan film without stalking? Given that the film begins with the hero and the heroine getting married, you might think there will not be such scenes, but the stalking happens \u2014 at a much later time in the movie. Even visually, Gitanjali seems to have gone for colours that are a trademark in his films (the frames are filled with shades of blue and red).\r\n\r\nWe can also sense the touches of a woman director. This is more pronounced in the scenes when we see the female characters interacting with each other. The dialogues are candid \u2014 Manoja's mother, who is perplexed when he daughter opts to divorce Prabhu, who seems to be a decent fellow, asks her, 'Vera maadhiri sex venum-nu ketana?'; in a later scene, a female character describes Prabhu as 'Idhellaam namma kaala suthara case' \u2014 but the bluntness of these statements are balanced by the delicate way in which these scenes are staged. And there is a tempering of the male gaze; if Tarun comes across as a boyfriend who is after Manoja for sex, this is balanced with another boyfriend \u2014 Manas, who understands her character and plays a huge role in Prabhu realising why Manoja doesn't like him. Even the bar song doesn't feel crass.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, the film feels less than the sum of its parts. The main reason for this is how conveniently the patch-up happens between Manoja and Prabhu. We never feel her trauma as much as we should and given that their reunion is a foregone conclusion, some degree of predictability enters the plot. The scenes set in Munnar feel exaggerated, and we wish Gitanjali had found some other way to have these two characters have the frank talk that they have in the film's climax. Even this moment is somewhat marred when Prabhu attempts to kill himself to make Manoja forget the rape \u2014 isn't that only going to add guilt to the shame she is already experiencing?","id":"568a29c7c3a36828f5020a7f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/568a29c7c3a36828f5020a7f","movie_id":370711}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Going by his three films so far (Kutti Puli, Komban and Maruthu), it is evident that Muthaiah has a skill for capturing rural areas with a rawness and staging action scenes that make us feel every bone-crunching punch and slice of a sickle. His plots, which are recycled tropes of many masala films, have been the weak links in his films and he compensates this with his unabashed use of violence and melodrama, thus ensuring that his films have something to satisfy youngsters and the family crowd. And his heroes are daring men, who possess inhuman strength and ferocity. In Maruthu, people refer to the hero, Maruthu (Vishal) as \"inathula singam, gunathula puli\" (as if this wasn't enough, the guy sports tattoos of lions on his arms and tigers on his chest). And he makes his introduction when the villain, Rolex Pandian (RK Suresh, who gets another menacing villain role after Thaarai Thappattai), \"Aniyayam panna saami avatharam eduppara?\" \r\n\r\nMaruthu is a sort-of coolie at the local market. His world revolves around his appatha (Kulappulli Leela) and sidekick Kokkarako (Soori, funny to an extent). Rolex Pandian, meanwhile, is a ruffian who is hoping to move to the next level \u2014 politics, with help from the local bigwig Bayilvan (Radha Ravi). To do this, he must first eliminate Bakkiyam (Sri Divya), the daughter of Silambam Maariamma, a woman whom he had hacked to death. But, Maruthu's appatha has her own reasons for not letting this happen. \r\n\r\nIn Maruthu, Muthaiah combines a couple of angles from his previous films and presents them as a whole, new film. In the place of the father-in-law in Komban, here, we have the grandmother. In the place of the intrepid hero's mother in Kutti Puli, here, we have the heroine's mother. And he sprinkles some comedy and romance (which is so generic) to lighten the mood now and then. \r\n\r\nThe film also feels overlong, and characters and their relationships are so broadly sketched that Muthaiah doesn't make us care for these characters as much as we should. Take for instance Maruthu's affection towards his grandmother. We are given a flashback to show why she matters to him, but when they are together, we never sense their closeness. One reason for this is the casting. This is the kind of paati role that we have seen earlier in Dhool, but Kulappulli Leela, though she looks the part, tries to make up for her unfamiliarity with the language (the lip-sync is quite terrible) by going for exaggerated expressions. We keep thinking how the late Manorama would have aced these scenes. \r\n\r\nWhat keeps us engaged is the way in which the director withholds information in the first half and reveals them gradually in the second. Once we begin to understand the characters' motivations (like, why did Maruthu's grandmother want him to fall in love with Bakkiyam), we become a bit more invested in the outcome of the story. And there is an assuredness in how Muthaiah narrates this formulaic tale that keeps us from getting bored.","id":"57453c6992514153e50010e4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57453c6992514153e50010e4","movie_id":371429}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Man tends to do crazy stuffs for a woman, but stealing $17m is too crazy.**\r\n\r\nThe film reminded me 'Pain & Gain', only for inspiring from the real and being the comedy flicks. Other than that there's nothing in common between them. I have been expecting a lot from Zack since 'The Hangover', but it was always the near missed opportunities. I'm not saying this was his much needed breakthrough, but quite enjoyable film.\r\n\r\nAn honest man who worked long enough as a guard for a bank, was approached by his ex colleague and her men with an offer. Since he was madly in love with her, he could not say no to it, despite he already got engaged to another woman. As planned the heist goes on and once it was done, he was ditched and ratted out. Now on the run, how he responds to it and the following events decides his fate.\r\n\r\nNot a great comedy nor a heist film, but it had its moments. The casting was good and it was Zack's show. The rest of them were not into that much, except in the final act. Jason Sudeikis was a bonus. His appearance added more fun. Now I know why Jim Carrey opted out. Owen Wilson's part was not good enough in such a small role, he did good though.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**On the edge of society, colours from brush strokes shined!**\r\n\r\nWhat is this film! Totally unheard! It's here now, so I watched it like I do for any film. But was not expecting anything. That was my advantage. It's a biopic, about an artist, not a famous one like medieval European painters. But a well known in her native. So now the world to know about her through this flick. That's what I love about films. Sometimes it's not about the famous people, but somewhere in a small place who quietly succeeded that inspires millions if they learn about that. So the films and books do that job well.\r\n\r\nAn Irish-Canadian co production. I think it has a real shot at the Oscars. Definitely for Sally Hawkins. In my opinion, she has already won that award, despite there are other good performances in this year. But if they snub this film, then as I consider like usual, the Oscars is pointless. Coming to the title, it should have been 'Maud'. Because nobody uses that word in the film. Anyway, 'Mudie' makes a good sound to pronounce, similar to Charlie, instead of Charles (Chaplin).\r\n\r\nFor now, this is an under-noticed film. As always, one of the reasons is, it's not an American or a British film. Then not made by a commercially well known filmmaker and cast. But this film never meant for commercial gain. It just tells the truth. A true story of an artist who lived not only on the edge of the society, humanity as well. Because when I saw this film, I could not tell the tale from what period. My guess was the late 19th century, then surprised as the story progressed to learn the real timeline. That tells she lived a life of at least a century ago of her time.\r\n\r\n> -xX] Some people don't like it if you are different. [Xx-\r\n\r\nNot a story of a high society woman. This kind of people can be found in every corner of the earth. They are somewhat discarded in the society for being different. But they too wants a normal life like everybody else. In such instance, this story happens. Maud is an orphan living with her aunt, after her brother ditched her. With no social skills, her future is not so bright. But it all changes one day when she decides to become a live-in maid to a grumpy fish seller.\r\n\r\nInitially, they find it not workable, then as the time goes by, they find each other. Following that, recognition of her paintings in the local community and spreading across, she sees some success in an unexpected path. But that's not the end of the tale. Seems happily ever after is so distant to them. A twist brings another unexpected derive in the narration. The heart rendering side of the story. From there how the remaining film would shape up before the conclusion were told.\r\n\r\nSeems everything was perfect for this film. Nice casting. I think that's the best thing happened for this. Both Sally and Ethan were amazing. Like Sally, Ethan too deserves an Oscars for his so perfect supporting role. As for the director, I think it will remain one of her best work, despite she could do good films like this in the future. This is one of the great films about the artists. Very inspiring, as well as a tearjerker, if you are a soft hearted.\r\n\r\nLow cost film, but well shot. I loved the locations. Then the dialogues. So simple and convincing. This is this year's 'Mr. Turner'. A must see film for grown ups. It got nominated for several categories in the Canadian top film awards and expected to win most of them. I hope in the coming days, it gets its due, I mean the wide recognition. Highly recommended by my side!

{"author":"lasttimeisaw","content":"American dramatist Kenneth Lonergan\u2019s third feature, after his career has been punishingly stalled by the ill-fated MARGARET (2011), made in 2005 as a much-anticipated follow-up to his sterling debut YOU CAN COUNT ON ME (2000), then embroiled in the lawsuit purgatory with the film\u2019s producers and only would be permitted for a limited release 6 years after, MANCHESTER BY THE SEA impacts as a resounding comeback and it is as good as you can get while toiling away with thumping grief and inconsolable guilt. \r\n\r\nLee Chandler (Affleck), a building janitor in Boston, he is the dour and withdrawn everyman type who distances himself from rest of the world and occasionally courts unwarranted bar brawl to unleash the smothering anger, so routinely the film will slowly mine into his profoundly buried tale-of-woe which would explain how he has fetched up to the current walking-dead state, and in this case, it is a helluva calamity, the most heart-rending accident could ever happen to a parent, and he has no one but himself to answer for. Receiving the news that his brother Joe (Chandler) died in a sudden heart attack, brings Lee back to his hometown, the titular Manchester-by-the-Sea where flashback adroitly interleaves into the narrative to refresh Lee\u2019s memory (edited with pellucid correlations with what he experiences now) where the concealed secret incubates, and would eventually unfolds in the murky, snow night accompanied by Tomaso Albinoni and Remo Giazotto\u2019s ADAGIO IN G MINOR, a sublime sequence transmits a synesthetic frisson which can knock dead its armchair viewers. \r\n\r\nIn Joe\u2019s will, he names Lee to be the guardian of his son, the 16-year-old high-school jock Patrick (Hedges), which takes Lee aback, a resultant, seemingly life-affirming uncle-nephew bonding process takes its spin sensibly on veracity and wrestles with both Patrick\u2019s suppressed grievance toward his father\u2019s demise (Lee\u2019s heart condition has been long diagnosed, so that it is more like a time-bomb ticking situation), and Lee\u2019s attempt to re-settle in the town on the face of aghast memories and unrelieved penitence, in a pivotal scene, when Lee\u2019s ex-wife Randi (Williams) pleads him for forgiveness and reconciliation after she has been finally capable of moving on to form a new family and embrace a new life, but feels obliged to proffer some extrication for him too, but things are different for the culpable party, not everyone can make peace with the past, however rational it might sound, some pain can be alleviated through time but other stays, thus one must brave himself to live with it for the rest of his life, that is the affirming life-philosophy Lonergan tries to pass on to his audience through studiously delving into the realistic double-bind based on an \u00fcber-dramatic back-bone, which appears to be an abiding mythos in all his three directorial works to date. \r\n\r\nCasey Affleck finds his footing in inhabiting Lee with a simmering intensity underneath his alternatively inscrutable\/apathetic\/distraught veneer, a performance is so aptly up his alley (a combo of hang-dog frustration and whimpering elocution) and to call it the performance of the year wouldn\u2019t be such a stretch. Michelle Williams, shoe-horned in a peripheral role, but manifests herself as a sniveling and imploring scene-stealer just in one scene, she dangles us with immense curiosity about how her character has gone through the catastrophe, but essentially this film is Lee\u2019s story.  Lucas Hedges gets a windfall for being cast in a plum role and nominated for an Oscar, which could be a double-edged sword for the future of his budding career, but as credible and affecting as his portrayal is, the credit should mostly given for Lonergan\u2019s well-rounded script of a rather bratty teenager; also Kyle Chandler is virtually next-in-line for a renaissance on the big screen after starring a string of high-caliber Oscar-baits, from ARGO, ZERO DARK THIRTY (both in 2012), to THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013), CAROL (2015) and now this, all in small roles but his presence looms larger each time. \r\n\r\nThe cinematography is bracingly crisp and un-showy, a modest production design and an unobtrusive score borrows many classical pieces, MANCHESTER BY THE CITY is a contemplative continuation in the aftermath of a latter-day Greek tragedy, which elevates Lonergan\u2019s status as one of the most outstanding cinematic story-teller currently from USA soil, and one can bet, co-producer Matt Damon must secretly rue the day that he couldn\u2019t commit himself to Casey's role which would have earned him a coveted Oscar statuette as an actor, and in hindsight, his preference to star in Zhang Yimou\u2019s Chinese monster fantasy THE GREAT WALL (2016) now looks like a dumb decision.","id":"58a306f19251415387007359","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58a306f19251415387007359","movie_id":334541}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Ending up solving mysteries between two people risking his own family.**\r\n\r\nThe film was based on the book named 'Manhattan Nocturne'. Excellently made film, it's the director's first feature film as well. He did not get the top actors, but these actors were the good ones. Adrien Brody and Yvonne Strahovski were amazing their respective roles. It was not a detective story, but very close to being one. So if you love crime-mysteries, then you should try this. The tone of the film makes very interesting. It's not about the question of story prediction, but how cleverly it was advanced like the characters were transformed compared to the opening and the conclusion.\r\n\r\nSome films open strongly, but ends poorly. In this case, the opening was average, but ended on a high. The main reason is the middle parts, keeping all contents together and developing some suspense with a couple of quick twists made this film to reach the expectation made by its viewers. It was a tale of a recently famed reporter finds an affair with a young widow, despite he's married with a child. Soon, he discovers some mysterious men are watching him, who threatening his family as well. How he gets out of that trouble by finding reasons behind it is what the rest of the film narrates.\r\n\r\nIt looked a lot like a television film. Not because of the production quality, actually the production was top class, but the story and its narration felt kind of like a mini-series type. I don't know how many books are there, but I want this to continue, at least as a television film series. One of the best of its kind, I almost liked everything about the film. But I still feel I underrated it, at the end I'm satisfied with what I gave. Definitely, I recommend it.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58013b12925141300c000ad2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58013b12925141300c000ad2","movie_id":311667}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Courtroom dramas have become a rarity in Kollywood these days and Manithan, a remake of the Bollywood film Jolly LLB, is a welcome relief in this age of ghosts and guns. The film with a hit-and-run and then the action cuts to Sakthi (Udhayanidhi, convincing), a struggling young lawyer in Pollachi. He is in love with Priya (Hansika, OK-ish) and to convince her father, who's also a lawyer, that he is worthy of her, moves to Chennai to practice at the high court. But he continues to get a break until he files a public interest litigation seeking to reopen the case of Rahul Dewan, the scion of a wealthy family, who was behind the wheel during the hit-and-run that kicked off the film.\r\n\r\nSoon the film turns into a battle of wits between Sakthi and Dewan's high-profile lawyer Adhiseshan (Prakash Raj), who is corrupt, commanding and also chummy with the judges. There is a fine twist early in the case that is genuinely shocking for both Sakthi and us, the audience. Initially, Sakthi, whose motive behind the PIL was to get into the media spotlight and increase his business prospects, thinks he hasn't lost anything despite having become a pawn in another man's game. But thanks to Priya and Moorthy Annan (Sangili Murugan), the elderly canteen owner on the court premises who has his own axe to grind against Adiseshan, he develops a moral centre and decides to fight for what is right. But can he stand up against Adhiseshan's deviousness and win this battle?\r\n\r\nGiven that its source was a well-written drama, it would have been a surprise only if Manithan had not worked. But as he showed in Endrendrum Punnagai, Ahmed is a steady hand when it comes to handling light-hearted scenes and he takes care of the film's momentum. And in Prakash Raj and Radha Ravi, he has two seasoned actors who can elevate even a standard scene with their histrionics. While Prakash Raj chews the scenery with gusto (given that the character is more a caricature, the over-the-top performance feels just right), Radha Ravi does a fine job playing the superbly-written character of the genial judge handling the case (Saurabh Shukla who had played this character in the original won the National Award for Best Supporting Actor) and walks away with the acting honours. Some of the dialogues are bang on target and make you want to cheer: Uniform potavangale kaineetum podhu sattaye illama irukkaravanga enna seiyya mudiyum. Santhosh Narayanan's uplifting score and Madhi's elegant visuals are also a plus.\r\n\r\nBut things get less interesting during the time the director spends on the romantic track between Sakthi and Priya. The decision to not localise the accused's family is also baffling; not only do the filmmakers retain the same north Indian names, but the patriarch is also played by the same actor who played the character in the original \u2014 Mohan Agashe. And the director overdoes some of the emotional scenes that make the film feel slightly manipulative. Still, the crowd-pleasing climax of the powerful being held accountable for their wrongs, ensures that we leave up with a sense of optimism.","id":"573816cb925141155f002ee7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/573816cb925141155f002ee7","movie_id":391276}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Rivalry, that's where sometimes it all begins.**\r\n\r\nI don't know why this film has not been watched by many. This is a good film, a good French gay film. Like many reviewers had already mentioned, this is not your typical gay theme. It would have been better if you had tried it without knowing what kind of story is this. Anyway, I mentioned it, but it is not a spoiler if you thought so. It would have landed at you in one way or the other while learning about the film.\r\n\r\nIt was more a drama than the romance. But everything has to have a nicer initiation. So, that's how the film characters take the shape. Only those important characters like the main two and another 2-3 were the all focus. The narration clearly ignores everything else to put the story straight, despite it was not about the straight guys.\r\n\r\nThe tale was told from the perspective of Damien, a new boy moved into the small foothill town with his doctor mother and while his father serving in the army in an away tour. Sometimes, the perspective takes neural to accomplish the other aspect of the story. An unexpected rivalry begins between Damien and his classmate, Thomas, a loner who lives up in the hills in a farmland.\r\n\r\nAs the film progresses, their fight intensifies. But there comes a time to compromise when the developments around them forces them to do so. It's the turning point for them, yet they're not in the mood to shake hands. You could say what comes henceforth, but that's where you might go wrong. This tale breaks the stereotypes and brings a fresh perspective on homosexuality. Although not fully unpredictable narration.\r\n\r\n> \u275dI don't know if I'm into guys or just you.\u275e\r\n\r\nBesides, the places where the film shot was magnificent. Takes place in different seasons, and each time the story well exploited the region to blend with the emotions, fierce and other moods in the drama. The two boys were good. Because of the type of their role, the film looks slow in some parts. But overall gets better with its upcoming scene.\r\n\r\nThe first two acts were nothing but the boys and their struggle to get over with their conflict. More like the random acts of normal reaction to such incidents. Only if it had tough guys on both the ends. But where it all leads were well planned that you may slightly disappoint with it. Like I was aware of a couple of things from the story, and it indeed that's how it turned out at the latter part. Otherwise, there's no complaint about it.\r\n\r\nDespite I enjoyed watching it, not the film that I wanted. I blame my anticipation for having such opinion. I was looking for more and more things to happen, whereas the narration was riding in the simplest manner. Especially the last half an hour brought the best out of it. Yeah, you could say it ended strongly and probably a turning point for the audience to change their stance if they were not happy so far.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is worth watching for being a different for such concept, and that's because of the writing. Secondly the cinematography, direction, including the actors made it a better flick. But personally I was not happy about failing to come to the point in the early section. It recovered, almost at very late. And then it ended better. But still I agree it was a perfect portrayal of the older teenagers and their confusing sexuality. The contents were realistic while the film stayed true to cinematic. I hope people watch it with low expectation and patience.\r\n_\r\n7\/10_","id":"59aca066c3a3682cc8038d80","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59aca066c3a3682cc8038d80","movie_id":377154}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A door to unleash the miracles!**\r\n\r\nI did not expect another 'Narnia' here. But I knew once learning about the plot and seeing the film poster that I might feel the familiarity. Most of the fantasy themes revolve in a similar fashion, especially those about stepping into an alternate world. So basically it is a cliche than any other way around we think.\r\n\r\nAs for children's perspective which this film was aimed for, there's nothing to whine about. Surely they would enjoy watching it. But us being the grown-ups, we must give up the adultness, if we want to have a good time with it. This is a harmless film in anyway and has to have in its way than ours.\r\n\r\nI can defend it if I want to, but the point is the grown ups should stop the way they look at such film and reject them like it was made for them or forced to see it. For me it was only just an above average. The attempt was great. The film originally based on the book of the same name. Colourful visuals, particularly in those required parts. But the depth was missing. The story was very simple. There were no big adventures or goes deep into the characters. But at the end, it all feels it had went through a lot. Every detail, the twist, all falls into a line.\r\n\r\nIt was about a mother and her young son, Lukasz. They seem a little joyous family. On one morning while driving to the school, an accident happens. Leaving Lukasz fractured knee, but his mother in coma. Then his old school aunt comes in and takes him back to her place as she has a business to take care. Not knowing what would happen to his mother, while wandering around, Lukasz enters an alternate dimension. It was fun in the initial, but then a trouble follows him. Now with the help of his new friends, he has to fight back the dark force threatening to take over his world.\r\n\r\n> -xX] It does not look curable. I reckon she's done for. [Xx-\r\n\r\nThe visuals were not impressive. But then it does not matter if you get the twist correctly. Overall an acceptable quality for sure. The twist was decent, but it could be a surprising one of the kids. From all, the antagonist was really something to be scared of. I mean for the little one. Yes, the bad guys were terrifying. Something that you see in horror films. Graphics or make-ups, whatever it was, they have done a nice job. But surely the little kids would be frightened of it. I mean like below 7. That's what the parents should be careful of.\r\n\r\nI'm sure these youngsters are the fresh faces, but they were good. The filmmakers too did their parts very well. Since I haven't read the book I can't compare. Though looks it was not a bad adaptation. I did not see it digital 3D, that experience would have been another level. But it depends whether you favour that technology or not. The west has already given up on it, except for the mega projects. But in the east, the trend still remains. So I think it would have been nice to watch in 3 dimensions. Because such film somewhat relies on that kind of format.\r\n\r\nThis is a Polish film and see it as the same way. Comparing it with Hollywood is what downgrades. Polish film industry is not as rich as Hollywood to stand to equal. But in its capacity, it had given a decent film. I respect that and expect the same from you as well, if you want to see it. Believe me, if this same film was made in Hollywood, even I would have said it's a poor film. That's the big difference here.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this little Polish fantasy. I don't know it is a book series, but I'm happy with one-off. Not a bad idea to reveal previous accounts in a prequel. Either way it works for me. And finally, this is definitely a worthy film. In my personal opinion, it was much better than 'Fantastic Beasts', excluding production difference. Now you decide!\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5a772916c3a36859cf044db5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a772916c3a36859cf044db5","movie_id":425722}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**It all begins with the butterflies!**\r\n\r\nPeople think it is a horror, but it was a fantasy-horror. According to the director, it is a supernatural theme. You may ask what's the big deal, but if you watch the film you will get, particularly the conclusion twist. It was a decent film with a good cast. It marks the return of the wonder boy Jacob Tremblay, after a tremendous performance debut from the Oscar nominated film 'Room'. Once again, he was brilliant, but due to the different theme, it might not be recognisation on a big scale. The main narration was led by Kate Bosworth, really worth mentioning her role as she was excellent like never before in the lead.\r\n\r\nWhen a young couple lose their son, they adopt an eight year old boy, Cody. It's a new start for them, as well as for the boy, but after a few days later they come to know the boy has some kind of supernatural power. So they begin to use him for their own gain and neglect him on the other ground. But it won't stay long that way, as one day a dreadful event happens, followed many similar. The remaining narration is to tell us how they're going to fix it, but the real question is, is it possible to solve.\r\n\r\nIt's a better film than what the rating states. But the issue was it is kind of improvised version of 'Oculus'. And it is not too scary or the too soft narration, but the kind of ending it had, it should have been targeted the families and children with more leaning on the fantasy stuffs. I think the horror concept brought in just to attract the adult crowds. Overall, it can be watched by everyone and that excludes little kids. For me the ending part made me consider it a good film. Because I believe everyone had such misunderstanding, growing up at that stage of the life, so did I.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"57d30c68925141549000089b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57d30c68925141549000089b","movie_id":301804}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Yuletide log slips from the fire to ignite the Xmas horror movie sub-genre.\r\n\r\nLets have it right, the 1\/10 reviews are from hardcore horror fans who just didn't get the horror experience they was looking for. That's understandable, it's one of the toughest genres to please given the broadness available, but what of those who go in blind who are just after a bit of chilly yuletide nastiness?\r\n\r\nDirector Chris Peckover and his co-writer Zack Khan have given not just the Xmas horror film genre a shot in the arm, but also put a clever spin on the home invasion formula - the latter of which a formula that grew stale a long time ago. Now I can't vouch for trailers etc, so if folk have been misled then it's tough turkey at yuletide, but going in fresh without expectation levels - to just rock up for a viewing purely because it's an Xmas horror pic, then the rewards are plenty.\r\n\r\nThe makers make a move early to lay down a marker that all is not as it seems, and from there the surprises continue to flow with disturbing glee. We could argue it's in bad taste in this day and age as the fear of youth grows ever more acute, maybe? But it's a nice rug pull and the momentum never lets up right to the devilish resolution. Job done for me. Implausible probabilities and ridiculous actions in a horror film? Surely not... \r\n\r\nThis is funny in a dark way, cheekily troubling in its choice of protagonists to propel the piece, and it's nicely performed by the youthful cast. It's no Black Christmas or any other of those blood soaked Crimble horrors, this has a glint in its eye and amen to that. 7\/10","id":"5c239678c3a3687001ef2a13","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c239678c3a3687001ef2a13","movie_id":406994}

{"author":"Reno","content":"> To start a business and carried away by its success.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of the Oscar nominated film 'The Broken Circle Breakdown', about two brothers who joins hand to start a new business and what follows is how they carried out by its success. This is not an enjoyable film, but still worth a watch. Because the film theme was the highlight, that focused how people can change when their efforts on something makes to reach its target. This is not for everyone, but youngsters in their 20s, 30s should check it out. It is an inspiring story to start a business of their own, but also warns strongly about the consequences of the outcome.\r\n\r\nThere is no major story in it to keep expanding every now and then, just evolves around two brothers and other characters surrounding them. From their plan for a new business to its preparation to making it real and then finally triumph. Besides this, their friends and families are covered to reveal how it affects them all once the money starts to flow in. How the drugs, sex and wild party, all the unexpected bad habits bring bad reputation within their circle is the point of the film. Till one of the brothers realise it and take an appropriate step to curb it, but that does really happen is what the film's climax discloses.\r\n\r\n> \"All people are born innocent but most don't stay that way.\"\r\n\r\nIt did not look like a film with twist and turns. Especially no villains or the terrible things like that related to the crime world to change the course of the story after reaching a certain point. The first thing we think hearing a film about the bar is the gangster theme. But this is different, the nicer side of what had seen so far on that theme. No guns, no gang fights, but the rest of the things had its share like in a real world. When those things come into effect, that's where this story takes a twist.\r\n\r\nJust within its limit, it covered some important events like the advantage and disadvantages for being the night club owners. For example, such club needs internal security and trusted employees. That's how this film filled the void to drag for as long as 2 hours. That was my concern. It was too long to watch a film that does not have any entertaining elements. So remember that it's not a comedy, romance, crime or a thriller, just a drama and for some people it might be too boring drama.\r\n\r\nThis film is a good lesson to learn without experiencing our own when one knowingly or without knowingly diverts himself to a wrong path. The film had some great performances too, but it is not for having a good time. It is hard to say who's the audience for it, because it is a simple story, but complicated theme with one end loud music, drugs and all, and the other side family, friends et cetera. Overall, not a bad film to view once.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"57a378c19251417c5700349f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57a378c19251417c5700349f","movie_id":330697}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The world tour, observation and the report card.**\r\n\r\nWhen I first heard about this, I thought what is this overrated actor doing here when the National Geographic decided to deliver an important message. The world would listen to the stars like Brad Pitt, Spielberg or the James Cameroon. Then I thought if he has the loudest voice in the American, then he's the right person to do the job for his nation. Because literally UN is the US.\r\n\r\nIt all began with his little speech at the 2016 Oscars. Then I did not realise, but after watching this, everything makes sense. Anyway, he was average, he just toured the world and did what asked for, the rest of the job done by the film crew, but the film and its message certainly not neglactable. So my appreciation goes to the writer, director and the production house.\r\n\r\nOkay, let's talk about the film. It is not just an important film, but a very, very important film. So they made sure it to easily accessible by everyone around the world in different platform. Some people are encouraged when they watch films like this, but soon after they go to their regular thing. We do not need that kind of attitude here, because it is already late and we can't reverse the damages that's already been done, though it can be prevented from happening further. Like I said in my 'Racing Extiction' review, a small contribution by everyone matters a lot.\r\n\r\nThe actor who is appointed as the United Nations 'Messenger of Peace' is set to travel the world for three years to observe and collect the information about the impact of man made global warming. Actually, he never asked any genuine question to whom he's interviewing for this documentary, like they are maybe the experts, scientists or the leaders around the world. But the goal was covered, even if it was a small amount. Because the first thing you have to understand about this film is, unlike any similar climate change documentaries, this did not try hard to give a complete picture on its topic. It was just an observation and its report kind of film by an actor who was chosen by the UN.\r\n\r\n> \"If you consider this vastness of this universe, this planet earth is just a small boat. If this boat is sinking, then I think we will have to all sink together.\"\r\n\r\nAt some point, this film was beyond that. We had seen all the debates in the previous documentaries, but the perspectives were different with the same message, I mean the warning. Because it does not stop here, if we does not change and the message is going to be very louder and louder every time. What the actor saw through his own eyes on his journey were the separate incidents\/disasters from different parts of the world what we had seen in a single film like '2012'. And who knows, that kind of collapse might go to happen as well in a near future if we don't act today.\r\n\r\nThe common line from all these documentaries are 'the global warming is real and it's happening right now'. But to whom it is said? For every person, the citizens of the earth, including you and me. I liked what in this film they pointed out, that the leaders listens people who voted them. Because they say only what we wanted to listen. So if we pressure them, they will fall in line. And this thing is badly needed to come to effect in the United States. If the America change their attitude, so the world would, because that's what had followed in the 21st century. But it seems they are lagging behind compared to the Baltic countries who are going fossil fuel- free nations.\r\n\r\nThis film's title referred as from the bible, like Noah's ark story. So do we need one if the polar ices completely meltdown? The answers is a big YES. Like the one that we saw in the film '2012'. Not for the whole world, but for those poor little island inhabitants. The continent's coast locals will relocate to inland. The fun part is the islanders did nothing big to suffer this, but those who did are going to be kind of safe in the mainland.\r\n\r\nEvery living organism, either in the land or in the ocean has the right to live just like us. So we must look from their perspective as well, because we're controlling the earth, not they are. We decide the earth's fate and it should be a good one, keeping in mind humanity's future as well.\r\n\r\nThis film has done its job, it's now on us to act. Don't think it is the government or the corporate's job, we all have our part to contribute and yes, it is so tiny, but the result will be enormous when we saw it together with everyone's contribution. Just watching a film like this is no use, we need to educate around us, especially for those has no opportunity to watch them or unable to understand them. This is a must see film and try to share the disc with your friends and colleagues. Because keeping it in your blu-ray\/DVD case safe forever is no use. 'Before the Flood' is present, there won't be a sequel called 'After the Flood', because we might not here to make one.\r\n\r\n_9\/10_","id":"585ea214c3a3681a680117cd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/585ea214c3a3681a680117cd","movie_id":410718}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**They've grown up together and later turned up to each other.**\r\n\r\nI had seen the old film and I liked that. So remake means we expect nothing less than a visual spectacular and this film had them at its best, including many more great features, but the real stars are missing. It was a let down without any notable performances. Besides, the idea of upgrading the story was good, though not everyone going to like that. Particularly the one who loved the old film or the versions.\r\n\r\nThe length is justified. For the kind of story the film narrates, the pace was very good. So for me this is not a bad flick, but just some key features missing like I said the star value. For the first timers, like today's generation, this film might work, but for the others most probably not. And the end was disappointing, because it felt like watching a Disney film that made for children and families.\r\n\r\nI think the director of 'Wanted' did his job as it required. Definitely not an unnecessary remake, but should have been careful in the historic events. Overall, it fell short of depth. You won't feel emotions and\/or the character's struggle. In the end it became just an entertainment product and if you expect beyond that, you are only responsible for that. So good luck with the watch if you are yet to give it a try.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"5851a1399251416f6301b085","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5851a1399251416f6301b085","movie_id":271969}
{"author":"TopKek","content":"Last time I watched the Ben-Hur with Charlton Heston the thought did not cross my mind that perhaps the world needed another version of the story directed by the guy who brought us Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and that weird movie where they make bullets bend.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the Heston version is one of my favorite movies. I saw it when I was 8 and two times when I was about 20. I love it and quote it all the time.\r\n\r\nBut this is not a review of that version because (surprise!) it is not that version. This is a review of the 2016 version and I don't feel it is fair to give this movie a bad rating simply because it was an unnecessary remake. In case you are wondering, this is the sixth version of Ben-Hur.\r\n\r\nThe story follows Judah Ben-Hur, a Jewish prince in Jerusalem at the time of Christ, and his adopted Roman brother Massala. They love each other but they get in the middle of an attempted assassination on a Roman leader and wind up on opposing sides. They both feel they are in the right, get in a very sticky situation, and thus begins an 5 year journey of survival, revenge, forgiveness.\r\n\r\nI liked the movie. The chariot race was thrilling. I was worried about it because the trailer showed a scene which an obvious CGI horse running through the stands. To my delight that was the only part that really used a CGI horse (that I could tell, anyway). The rest of the race was intense even though I already knew how it was going to end.\r\n\r\nThe movie focuses very heavily on the relationship between Massala and Judah as well as Massala and the rest of the Hur family. Massala's intentions and actions were understandable and he wasn't just some evil man who betrayed his family.\r\n\r\nThe main actors and actresses do a good (not great) job. I felt Morgan Freeman may have phoned it in a little, but he delivered one of my favorite lines of the movie. My favorite actors were the slave drivers on the galley along with the drummer. They have small roles but I loved them.\r\n\r\nI didn't care for the Jesus scenes though. He is a hard character to portray, and I just didn't like it when he spoke. I'm probably picky, but I would have preferred to hear him speak in King James English or not at all (like in the Heston version). I just felt something was off with the scenes and they could have been more powerful.\r\n\r\nOverall, I felt it was a pretty good movie that succeeds in many aspects chiefly with the themes of revenge\/forgiveness and delivers one exciting race. It's not perfect but a good movie overall.","id":"5809dd6dc3a368147c00107e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5809dd6dc3a368147c00107e","movie_id":271969}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"The holidays are approaching as we prepare to reach the end of the year but director\/co-writer Chris Peckover wants to beat the chaotic Christmas rush by offering some creepy coal in his cinematic stockings\u2013most notably a merry-minded macabre middle finger to the Yuletide season in the charmingly twisted and creatively corrosive suburban home invasion horror thriller **Better Watch Out**. \r\n\r\nPeckover, whose darkened delve into the timely and topical political bonfire known as illegal immigration in 2010\u2019s disturbing and noteworthy _Undocumented_, delivers a diabolical ditty that resonates gleefully in subversive wit, sick-minded jingle hell fraught and turns upside down the tired conventional creepfest genre into an edgy, hair-raising horrific hoot armed with the favorably kind of rancid camp and rollicking recklessness that makes for an insatiable sick-minded satire. Indeed, one needs to raise their mug of tasty eggnog to celebrate the seasonal Christmas fear in the demented yet oddly inspired and viciously wired **Better Watch Out**. \r\n\r\nSure, **Better Watch Out** generously borrows from a number of films in the kiddie-imperiled, home invasion showcases that we have seen over time and time again. However, Peckover\u2019s sense of go-for-broke adventurous direction, a flippantly smart and energetic script, convincing off-the-wall but solid and disciplined performances and the nail-biting, naughty-minded nuttiness that runs amok in this 85-minute perverse, hedonistic home-bound torture chamber is genuinely realized. Although Watch appears to seemingly have an American pedigree in its cockeyed presentation of sweater-wearing Yanks nestled before an open fire on a scenic winter evening it is worth noting that **Better Watch Out** is a co-Australian production (most of the film was shot on location in Sydney) so some Aussie presence is definitely permeates in this eerie but insidiously cheeky domestic dire drama.\r\n\r\nCleverly, **Better Watch Out** (incidentally also known as _Safe Neighborhood_) somehow seems to elevate the impishly comical yet caustically slash-and-dash sub-genre to a whole new fresh level of appreciation whether offering a cynical spin on the cliched babysitter-in-charge yarn or poking biting fun at the hidden dysfunction of the privileged living in the pricey bubble of manicured lawns and gaudy, expansive homes in milquetoast Middle America. Interestingly, Peckover shares his generosity of sacrilege in using the spiritual aura of the Christmas landscape to skew the undercurrent idealism of cozy co-existence in the realm of protective picket fences and precocious yet insecure youngsters that are forced to battle this week\u2019s bombastic boogeyman that dares to interrupt their unappreciated lap of luxury.\r\n\r\n**Better Watch Out** should not be too concerned whether or not Santa is coming to town but in the case of the Satan-esque home intruders that want to sadistically spread some holiday jeer\u2026well folks that is another story entirely. The outgoing parents Robert and Deandra Lerner (TV veteran Patrick Warburton and Virginia Madsen) must leave their 12-year old son Luke (Levi Miller, \u201cPan\u201d) in the care of a babysitter in their absence. This suits Luke just fine because the babysitter in question happens to be his targeted object of affection going on so many years and counting. Luke\u2019s crush for his caretaker is immense and he feels fortunate enough to take advantage of her company while hoping to score some major points with her heart. After all, Luke is not a baby\u2013he\u2019ll be thirteen in a matter of weeks so his desired dreamgirl should accept him easier being a year older, right? Keep on dreaming, Lukester.\r\n\r\nThe vivacious Ashley (Olivia Dejonge, _The Visit_) is the recipient of Luke\u2019s innocent lust. The question remains: when can the eager Luke seal the deal and let his babysitting beauty know about his romantic feelings for her? Well, one must give Luke credit for trying to sway the older titillating teen to consider his lovey-dovey overtures towards her. Naturally Ashley finds all this rather awkward and amusing. However, as Luke\u2019s hopes for charming the socks off of Ashley go south there are other factors that are ruining his efforts to score with the treasured blonde babysitter. The distractions become gradually intrusive and overbearing. Random phone calls are deemed disturbing then finally there is sinister static occurring in and out of the house.  Before the dust settles with the dangerous distractions transpiring left and right the ultimate heinous happenings reaches its creepy climax as actual intruders are now front and center. Hence, the panicky Ashley must step up to the plate and protect her charge Luke and herself from these menacing misfits invading the Lerners\u2019 home. Does the babysitting bombshell have what it takes to be resourceful and defend these criminal cretins from bringing harm to the exposed household?\r\n\r\nIt would not be beneficial to elaborate further on the percolating plot in **Better Watch Out** for the violation of giving away too much that constitutes spoiling this film\u2019s twists and turns of eye-winking surprises and developments. However, one can certainly give glowing credit to the production crew and performers that collaborate and create an absurdist atmosphere of holiday-themed anarchy thus giving Watch a delicious devilish streak in its wild and whacked-out colorful violence. Peckover and co-writer Zach Kahn create this deliriously spunky acidic project laced with intentions of outwitting its audience trying to follow the dots of the off-the-cuff mayhem. Granted that the majority of unimaginative and faceless conveyor belt creep shows released from Hollywood\u2019s predictable playground is typical fright-light farces that more times than not insult if not properly engage the viewers. **Better Watch Out** challenges the masses with its promising fatalistic frivolity and rollicking ridicule as it mocks as much as salutes the twitchy-based goose-bump cinema it is aping with noted sardonic affection.\r\n\r\nAussie actress Dejonge, sporting a rather authentic American accent, is enjoyable as the feisty Ashley whose conviction to serve and protect the livelihood of her junior-sized puppy love pal from hellish harm is a marvel to experience. Dejonge\u2019s Ashley is not some scream queen airhead and grips the over-sized butcher knife in some some jittery scenes with all the conviction that does not suggest a dimwitted damsel-in-distress. Miller is relatable as the coming-of-age dweeb kid whose hormones snap, crackle and pop more than a super-sized bowl of Rice Krispies.  Still, one cannot blame the love-struck lad especially if you had Dejonge\u2019s hot-blooded teen tart guarding your safety from unknown forces on a blanketed snowy day in Anywhere, USA. Besides, Luke thinks of himself as Ashley\u2019s protector.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**We know him as Dhoni, but this is the tale of Mahi.**\r\n\r\nUsually Indian film fans are divided according to the regions. Because if you turn any corner in that country, there's another film industry, another English alphabet replaced to rhyme with Hollywood. They have got their own bunch of actors, filmmakers and films. They might be divided over films and film productions, but they always united when it comes to cricket.\r\n\r\nRemember one and a half decade ago an Indian film about the same sport made into the Oscars, but did not win. This film was based on the life of one of the greatest Indian and world cricket player. So length into breadth of the India, it was a highly anticipated sport-biographical film. India has a long history of cricket. It was brought into the country by the British nearly half a millennium ago. It is called a gentlemen's game, which means only rich and royal people can play.\r\n\r\nSo in India, cricket was always been a game highly influenced in big cities. Players from those places are high in demand till recently. Talents from second and third tier cities never been noticed. But some player made it because of political and other sort of influence. That's changed forever when Mehendra Singh Dhoni's success inspired millions of people. Made youngsters to take bat and ball believing someday they can play for their state or in the national team.\r\n\r\nIf you are an Indian, I'm sure you had heard many things about him, his difficult path to stardom. There's nothing much difference in the life journeys of his and Shivaji Rao Gaekwad. They both were ticket sellers\/collectors. Struggled through to initiate their profession, but in a different field. Now they're superstars.\r\n\r\nIn Indian films, it's only recently the trend had started in biopics. For a cricketer, it is an ideal initiation. Remember Sachin Tendulkar's documentary film is due to release in this summer, but it is an international project. It can't be neglected because of his hardcore fans, not just in India, but across the world. He had retired a while ago, but still fans chant his name during the recent games.\r\n\r\nI know this director, since one of his films was remade as 'Someone Like You'. Bollywood films are always very stylish, but slips away while depicting realism of India, Indian society and culture. That's where I lost interest in them. I watched it for MS, since he plays\/played for my team CSK who is known as Thala.\r\n\r\nSeems funny, some of the lines that translated into Tamil. But culture wise, it is understandable. A boy was born on the 7th of July '81, but soon the narration shifts focus on his childhood in the late 80s. A fine football goalkeeper, but changed his sport after an unexpected offer. Extremely interested in batting, but his opportunity was being a wicket keeper.\r\n\r\n>\u275dYou won't face the same ball always in your life. You've to play on your merit and just hang in there. The scoreboard will keep ticking along.\u275e\r\n\r\nWhen he enters his teenage, he had learnt to play his own method. Particularly in batting which is the least given privilege to him by his coach. Supportive parents, but from above that, the great friends gang, he had with him at all the good and bad times. The first half is all about the cricket. In fact the whole film was about him and the cricket, the rest of his life was not concentrated enough. I mean on other stuffs, except the romance that takes off during the beginning of the second half. So basically that's where you will come to know this guy is a man with feelings and emotions like you and me.\r\n\r\nWe all knew him as a cricketer, a great cricketer to say. Since his romance parts come into play, for a brief moment the sport was set aside. A love story kick starts. All those who believed he's a superhuman, will come to realise after witnessing Bollywood style of romance, which is basically how happens in real India. He's not an emotion showing type, especially in public or during the game. But there's a scene in the film and when it appears, that's really heartbreaks. No offense, but it looked Sakshi demanded a proposal than expecting it to come her way naturally.\r\n\r\nThe three hours is too long for a film, but for this film I felt they had left out many things with short scenes\/events, otherwise it would have gone past the four hour mark or even higher. So two part film would have made it a better product, but I'm happy for it to be a single film.\r\n\r\nI was bothered about the songs, but they smartly merged them with the storytelling. Particularly commercial films can't afford to lose the blue print of Indian cinema, since songs are the free television commercial, to popularise the film prior to its release. All the actors were great. The lead actor was at his best, especially when it comes to the technics in the games to match the Dhoni's style of play. Most of the locations are the actual locations, including the school, grounds and house(s). I think it was a good move.\r\n\r\nThe film was not entirely true. They have changed the events to suit the cinematic. A man's 30 years of life journey to put into a 3 hour film, it has to be done and they did it neatly in Indian style. Some people are complaining about this and that, but that's understandable if you understand the concept of filmmaking, particularly money making film.\r\n\r\nOnly the first two acts were very gripping. The final act was predictable, if you are an ardent cricket follower. Because you know everything on field about this man which is what covered in those parts. And the rest of the film was like behind the scenes of a film called his life. This is a wonder film, and I know the majority of the Indians won't miss it or had already watched it. But for the outsiders, this is not a bad flick, even if you don't know the sport or the player. Worth a try, otherwise definitely recommended.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"58b344a7c3a368527d00a10a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58b344a7c3a368527d00a10a","movie_id":388333}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**No matter what, the bad past always hunts you down!**\r\n\r\nLike everybody, I was anticipating 'The Raid 3', instead I got this one. Iko Uwais is not just a rising star, he is making Indonesian films internationally recognised. But seems as fast he's rising, as fast he's sinking. The reason is heavily relied on martial arts. In real life, he himself an artist too. But taking into the account like from Tony Jaa, and Hong Kong, Chinese film industries. That's a one generation thing. To keep the industry on the float in the long term, it takes good stories and performances, alongside good production.\r\n\r\n'The Raid' duology was good, but not lucky anymore. Basically, this is the same pattern with different characters and situations compared to those two titles. The stunt fans might enjoy it, but what terribly lacked in this film was the a good story. The majority of the film goers, including film critics believe in that. Hence it did not deliver as expected. By the way, this is a generation of CGI film like 'Mad Max: Fury Road'. Yet some kids from the 90s still love to see a pure martial art films.\r\n\r\nIt is an action packed film. A gangster theme. The day when a notorious gangster leader named Lee escapes the prison, a young man was found unconscious on the beach, then he was treated by an aspiring young doctor. Lee finds out about this amnesiac man and sends his finest men to retrieve him. But nothing goes as planned. The confrontation between them slowly restores his lost memory. Defeating all the fighters, he's set for the final standoff against Lee which will bring an end to the narration.\r\n\r\n> \u275dYou saved me before. I need you to save me one more time.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe production was good, though the performances were ordinary. Because all the focus were the action sequences. At least I expected decent dialogues. It was a weird romance platform, a sub-genre. Romance can blossom anywhere, anytime, but weakly developed to believe it the least. Not the best martial art film too. There were some twists in the narration, but none were surprising enough. The film would have achieved a better result if it had done well in the stunt parts. I'm sure there will be some people who would like it or liked it. I usually like martial art films, but not this one, not my cup of tea.\r\n\r\nSometimes the opening does not matter if the rest of the tale recovers well. Very clich\u00e9d initiation, but it did not get better. Especially the conclusion was a big let down. The entire film was leaned on Iko's role. Also the character Lee was too much hyped. In between them, the rest of the cast was discarded. Overall, I don't think they have missed an opportunity in here, because I felt nothing were designed so well to be a decent film at any level. From familiarity to the predictability, the storytelling never had the upper hand to get better. Some people think it is worth watching at least once, but according to me not. All I would say is it's your call.\r\n\r\n_4.5\/10_","id":"5a77011692514105a9042f1f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a77011692514105a9042f1f","movie_id":403605}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Early bird gets the worm.**\r\n\r\nFrom the British director of 'Starred Up' fame, it was like another 'The Place Beyond the Pines'. Feels like a modern western kind, because of where this story takes place, I mean Texas. There's no digital world like phones, computers et cetera, just an old fashioned storytelling. This is the story of two brothers and their series of bank robbery job. They are doing it for a reason, but on the other end, two cops make their effort to find who they are and nab them red handed. So when they meet, that's where the story gets to its end part.\r\n\r\nIt has a strong opening, then slows down. Actually, it was approached like a classic crime film, which mean no high-tech. The story was a one liner, but the events in that story were extended. A simple screenplay, yet very effective presented on the screen. Of course the story ends with this film, but feels like there's more. It is very unlikely, though I'm thinking of a sequel.\r\n\r\nThe people will remember this film for Ben Foster and Chris Pine. One of the best duo on the screen. Easily one of the best films of the year, but just it is a different theme and genre. I watched it not knowing the meaning of the title, and then I googled it. It is nothing like a must see, but I believe that you might regret if you miss it or delay your watch. So I suggest you make a right choice.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"58446c9792514166ba00c2f1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58446c9792514166ba00c2f1","movie_id":338766}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"Hello Naan Pei Pesuren (HNPP) is a ghost movie but director Baskar is more interested in mining laughs than scares, and somehow, this approach actually benefits the film. The fact that HNPP manages to click even though horror comedies have become quite common these days should tell you how effective the comedy is.\r\n\r\nBaskar briskly sets things up. Amudhan (Vaibhav), a small-time thief, starts wooing Kavitha (Aishwarya Rajesh), who, not knowing his vocation, offers to help him. They fall in love and Amudhan even manages to impress her brother (VTV Ganesh), who runs a saavu kuthu dance school! Meanwhile, Amudhan takes home a mobile that he finds in an accident spot. It is only during the night he realises that he has brought trouble home \u2014 for the accident victim's ghost now resides in the phone. What does she want?\r\n\r\nIf HNPP succeeds, the credit should mainly go to VTV Ganesh, who is hilarious in his character who is all false bravado. The director also exploits the shiftiness in Vaibhav's appearance to good effect. He also peppers the dialogues with double entendre that are actually fun. A flashback is imaginatively narrated with a song. And Yogi Babu gets a couple of comic scenes (one of which involves him lip-syncing to Aashiqui 2's Tum Hi Ho) in the earlier portions, though his character disappears after a while.\r\n\r\nThe humour doesn't always work, though. There is an unfunny segment involving Singam Puli, who tries to do a Mottai Rajendran in this scene, which feels like a poor version of the Ghost Gopal Varma track from Darling. The kuthu school portions are quite silly. There is a scrappy feel to the visuals, which is quite a surprise given that the film has been shot by Gopi Amarnath, who also shot the sleek Pizza. Yes, the setting of the film is a lower middle-class neighbourhood, but should the visuals look this flat? The two female leads are also just functional. The reason for the ghost's presence is also flimsy, and almost feels like the director thought of it just because ghosts need a motive. Still, the steady stream of laughs helps us overlook these issues, and keep the film from turning into a bore.","id":"5703684a925141625f0007df","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5703684a925141625f0007df","movie_id":369823}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**In the world of medical revolution.**\r\n\r\nBased on the novel of the same name, this French film was unique in many ways. Firstly, it was an awareness film. An awareness about the organ donations. In this medical revolution world, all we need is a little support. A support to our own species who are suffering. Not to waste our precious organs after the death. But it's not all about the deaths, the natural death. There are many reasons for death to happen, but not always the organs are the reason. So it can be transplanted to live on in another body, giving a chance of life. Sometimes, there were sentiments involved. Not because of the love and care shown to those particular persons by their family and friends, but because of unexpected event puts them into such position, where they all can only hope for something miracle.\r\n\r\nIt was like hundred minute long film, but for every 10-15 minutes, it changes focus from people to places and situations. So there's no one particular character the film to follow entirely. All were pieces of the individual's story that in a way connected. This surely a much need film. Because of the story design, especially being organ transplant\/donation related theme, they wanted to avoid the emotions as much as possible. Since it's always happy at one side and sad on the other, which might discourage the idea of what this film trying to highlight.\r\n\r\nA teenager who met with an accident in now treated in the hospital. But it is not a good news for his beloved ones. Literally, he's dead, though kept alive by machines. This is not those kind of coma, we have had seen in the films. The parents have to make a quick decision about what the doctors had suggested to them that is to donate the organs to whom needed them most. On the other side of the tale, a middle aged woman with heart trouble has her own opinion about heart transplant. But she needs to be there for her two young sons. In the meantime, with all the developments, the narration heads to the final segment, where tense moments arise till the final scene.\r\n\r\n> \u275dMaybe my time has come. My heart will stop. That's nature.\u275e\r\n\r\nI'm surprised that recently I've watched tons of films directed by women. It's really a good sign. Because stories from women's perspective can flourish in the coming generation, similar to the equal rights revolution happed a century ago in the western world. Considering that, it was a bit late to pick up the pace in filmdom. Not all the directresses make romantic or commercial chic films. Take Kathryn Bigelow as an example, she makes lots better men films than many male filmmakers today. This one was a gender neutral films. I've never seen other flicks from this maker, but seems she's young and very potential, that I want her to make a big entry into Hollywood as well.\r\n\r\nThe details in the film were astonishing. I usually not good at bloods. I avoid hospitals till it becomes a must. What I saw in the final quarter of the film was totally something. Like something I watched in a health channel. Of course it was staged, but very realistic presentation or you could say the demonstration was breathtaking. A few weeks ago in one of my reviews I've mentioned a doctor turned director made a film about his former profession. That was a simple rural based drama. The outside struggle. But this one, take us to the deep into the doctors' the other side of the world. I meant the surgery. I have seen many films like this, but none of them were edgy as this one. A perfect ending for such a film too.\r\n\r\nSo, the film might be a bit under-rated, but it was a much better film than many of the recent ones. It might be under-noticed, but that's because of lack of interest in such themed film among common people. Definitely not because of anything defect in the film. The critics have given thumbs up, so do I. But remember that the film has a story, not entirely about what mostly I've mentioned in most of other paragraphs. So expect less from it and be patience for its slow narration. There's nothing like what I've enjoyed you would enjoy it too. Just give it a try, it is totally worth.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"59fe1dcec3a36868350255d3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59fe1dcec3a36868350255d3","movie_id":383807}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**A coming-of-age from Iceland.**\r\n\r\nThe initial impression was not very good. Made me uneasy to watch. Because there were some inhumane shots. They all looked so real. So I thought I would going to hate this film. But I did not. It was only in the opening, like a small black spot in something beautiful. Soon the scenario had changed. Jumped into tail two friends, their activities. That's understandable to show us their bond and what to expect in the latter parts.\r\n\r\nThis is a children's film, but teenager's. So like at their age, it's desperate to learn about the opposite sex attraction. Most of the time it won't be pleasant. The teens have their own way to explore it. So the film was focused on their take on the sexuality. Come-of-age theme where the majority revolved around friendship. Definitely a good awareness film, but very intentional storytelling. Especially the twist and the conclusion. For me it was intentional, because I've seen plenty of similar films. But I don't think you and others would think that way as well. Kind of easy to guess how it all turns out at the end, but when you see them in pictures, the experience is different.\r\n\r\nIn a small remote town of Iceland, it's about a time for two teen friends to find out their sexuality. Their families have issues, but nothing stopping them to wandering around everyday, hanging out with the girls, doing stuff like anyone of their age would do. When one of their small mischievous events is taken seriously by their parents, the things begin to change forth. They are not same anymore. The long standing friendship is tested now. But how the story ends was conveniently told.\r\n\r\n> -xX] No makeup! We look gay enough already. [Xx-\r\n\r\nThis is a gay themed film, though not right from the beginning or too deeply dived to narrate the tale from that angle. But like usual, it highlighted how still in some places the word gay is still a sin. All you can learn about it from the kid's perspective, how they are sidelined among their ages. You could say that they were yet to learn the meaning of it, but the case is not the same with their elders too. Not focused enough on the adult characters, yet the film reveals their society is not open enough for all kinds.\r\n\r\nI have seen a lot such awareness film about LGBT, this is another that tells about the Iceland's version of discrimination. Totally respect the film and filmmaking, because it's made with a good intention. Though like I have mentioned, the opening was not pleasant. Opened with a brutal tone which did not stay that way henceforth. Being an animal and a nature lover, I could not stand for it. Other than that, there's no reason to dislike the flick. In some way, that was a step taken in the transformation of the characters. That's what it's all about, the meaning of coming-of-age, is not it!\r\n\r\nWell, for a such theme, the actors usually are fresh faces. So they all performance so good. It was a directional debut for the filmmaker as well. Awesomely written and made. Won many film festivel awards. I particularly loved the countryside scenic. Just same as what I've seen from the Kiwi films that set in the rural areas. As much as they focused on the story, it had very pleasant backgrounds that synced so beautifully with what it had narrated for us. It had been in my watchlist. We put films into that list when something interesting element triggers. So now I'm happy to scratch it off. Mission accomplished! It surely stood to the expectation and so do I now recommend it for others as well.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5a7729c292514105a3046734","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a7729c292514105a3046734","movie_id":350060}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"A rainy night. A missing dead body. An adulterer husband. A damsel-in-distress lover. A no-nonsense cop. These are the elements that AMR Ramesh uses to set up Oru Melliya Kodu, a whodunit that manages to kick up a certain amount of intrigue and eeriness before unconvincingly pulling off a twist ending.\r\n\r\nThough the pre-release buzz around Oru Melliya Kodu has revolved around it being inspired by the Sunanda Pushkar murder case, the actual inspiration \u2014 which is sadly unacknowledged \u2014 is a Spanish film titled El Cupero (The Body). Maaya (Manisha Koirala, looking too old and tired), an ultra-rich biotech entrepreneur, has been found dead, but before a post mortem can be performed, the body goes missing from the morgue. In the middle of the night. In pouring rains. Meanwhile, oblivious to all this, Maaya's husband, Akshay (Shaam, convincing) is busy romancing Bhoomi (Aqsa Bhatt, passable). Enter Shakthi Vel (Arjun, effective), a cop who has been asked to handle the case. He brings in Akshay for interrogation, and the young man, with his reticent behaviour, soon finds himself as the prime suspect.\r\n\r\nFor more than an hour into Oru Melliya Kodu, AMR Ramesh manages to keep the suspense surrounding the missing body intact. Is it really Akshay who has killed his wife and stolen her body? Is Maaya staging the entire episode to get back at her unfaithful husband? Is it Bhoomi who might be playing her own game? Or, has Maaya returned as a ghost to take revenge against Askhay and Bhoomi? What does Shakthi Vel got to do with this mystery? He makes us ask all these questions as he moves from one scene to the next, all the while holding his cards close to his chest. The cinematography is also full of weird, unsettling angles and frames and we even get a gritty gross-out scene that nods at Danny Boyle's Trainspotting as Akshay eats an incriminating piece of evidence after trying to flush it out in the loo.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we are given glimpses into Maaya's life when she was alive. How she and Akshay, who is younger to her, became a couple, how did Akshay fall for Bhoomi and so on. These characters are presented in a way that shows us what each one is capable of.\r\n\r\nBut after a point, the tension starts to dissipate (not just because of the unnecessary songs), and by the time we come to the reveal \u2014 a twist that arrives without any bit of foreshadowing to make it seem well-earned \u2014 we feel kind of cheated. Worse, the film starts to come across as a PSA against drunken driving. It is a pity that the film fails to cross that melliya kodu between being 'not boring' and 'compelling enough'.","id":"57ba6a99c3a368189e003cde","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57ba6a99c3a368189e003cde","movie_id":404720}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"In the raucous and woefully wretched **Dirty Grandpa** director Dan Mazer's lazy and lethargic laugher gives a whole new meaning to the term \"gag comedy\" with the emphasis on the word gag. One might want to upchuck at this mindless ragtag romp that desperately tries too hard to reel in the obnoxious chuckles. Undoubtedly toothless, unimaginative, and aimlessly insipid the degenerative **Dirty Grandpa** has all the cheeky charm and hilarity as a waxy floor in an arthritic nursing home patient's dim lit room.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the questionable punchline to this foolish and crass joke-of-a-movie is why a prestigious performer of Oscar-winner Robert DeNiro's caliber doing such silly and offensive sludge as the flatulent farce **Dirty Grandpa** in the first place? Sure, DeNiro has done his share of hit-and-miss comedies in his career as well as some dramas that were lackluster and forgettable. It is true...even the great cinematic icons can gravitate to the usual duds from time to time. However, watching the intense and revered seventy-something veteran DeNiro wallow in this madcap mess is utterly inexcusable. What even possessed DeNiro to appear in such a diaper rash of a juvenile comedy? Did he lose a bet or was challenged to a dare of some awful kind?\r\n\r\nAs for DeNiro's co-star in ex-Disney Channel dreamboat star Zac Efron one can not be hardly surprised that the big screen boytoy as popped up in this train wreck of a treat seeing as though Efron's past film choices have not been what one might call consistently stellar in his film career thus far. Let's face it...**Dirty Grandpa** was begging for a tongue-lashing and rightfully so. Unless you are an uncontrollable hormonal teen with a locker room mentality attached to your blank psyche then one might find the witless **Dirty Grandpa** a bombastic bore that could not clean up its noxious act even if it ran through several durable car washes.  \r\n\r\nScreenwriter John Phillips wants to present DeNiro's crusty curmudgeon Dick Kelly as a walking wrecking ball with no filter whatsoever. In fact, DeNiro's Dick Kelly is a tragic figure that could be misunderstood by some and mistrusted by others. It appears that Dick Kelly is the cursed clown with the wounded soul--no doubt Phillips's ridiculed target for the inside satirical look at aging hardcore has-beens that rail against a world they no longer recognize and allowed to pass them by in the process. **Dirty Grandpa** could have been a dark and impish commentary on maturing quiet rage with snarling senior citizen Dick Kelly's ignorance serving as a red button for panic. Unfortunately for the throwaway **Dirty Grampa** it is not clever or calculating enough to realize its potential as a subversive chuckler while simple resting its guffaws on cheap-minded edgy banality. \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, recent widower Dick Kelly wants to unwind in the aftermath of his wife's passing and head down to Florida where he and his late beloved bride spent their treasured days near their summer home. This means enlisting the assistance of his grandson Jason (Zac Efron) to accompany him to the Sunshine State so that Dick can get loose and wild. \r\n\r\nDick, a retired military man, is not a Golden-Aged Boy Scout by any means. He is indeed a Dirty Grandpa based on his persona as a bombastic bastard of a character. Dick is a proud-minded racist, misogynist and homophobe...and these are his good qualities! Dick is indignant as he incredulously wonders why he cannot utter the N-word and does not miss a beat when drooling over the bouncy babes that could easily pass for his granddaughters. And Dick has his \"gaydar\" gander up when confronted with \"swishy guys\" in his presence. Also, there is no shame whenever Dick feels free to...um, pleasure himself regardless of whether Jason is in the vicinity or not. Dick, to say the least, is a tool in the worst way. \r\n\r\nNaturally, **Dirty Grandpa** eagerly wants to throw into the sordid mix other wacked-out characterizations to add to the clumsy raunchfest. Both Mazer and Phillips get their junk food jollies in presenting supporting players that gleefully reinforce all the staged nuttiness at hand. There is a curious slutty siren (Aubrey Plaza from TV's \"Parks and Recreation\") that wants to \"do the naughty\" with Dick to satisfy her fetish for pleasuring old geezers. And then there is Jason's galpal (Julianne Hough) that seriously needs a stick removed from her no-nonsense butt before she ties the knot. Of course this dumb display tosses a couple of collegiate cut-ups (Michael Hudson and Jake Picking) and Jason's cousin Nick (Adam Pally)--a disabled \"Dick\" wannabe.\r\n\r\nSo **Dirty Grandpa** marches to its wacky beat without realizing how much of a Grade-A stinker this insufferable session of comatose comedy this shoddy showcase really is at heart? Breezy bathroom-related humor, recycled masturbation giggles, bubbly bimbos and slap-happy drug use high-jinks--all befitting whatever odious overtones this needless and fetid funny fable managed to pull off.\r\n\r\nFor DeNiro and company **Dirty Grandpa** may have been a quick and profitable payday but for the rest of us the payoff was mere chump change.\r\n\r\n**Dirty Grandpa** (2016)\r\n\r\n1 hr. 42 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Robert DeNiro, Zac Efron, Zoey Deutch, Aubrey Plaza, Julianne Hough, Jason Mantzoukas, Jake Picking, Michael Hudson, Mo Collins, Dermot Mulrooney\r\n\r\nDirected by: Dan Mazer\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: * star (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng","id":"56a7b3b8c3a36828c1001577","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56a7b3b8c3a36828c1001577","movie_id":291870}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> The usual, nothing innovative about it!\r\n\r\nEverything I wrote was just my personal opinion, definitely not intended to offend anybody. This should have been one of the best comedies of the year, but now it belongs to one of the worst. I recommend 'Grandma' instead this which I felt a much better comedy.\r\n\r\nAt this age, Robert De Niro was unbelievably awesome, though his character needed a good support from another and that's where as usual Zac failed to deliver his part. I would have preferred someone like Taylor Lautner who's desperate for a breakthrough than the Zac who ruins always.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay was from the 'blacklist', knowing this they should have been more careful while casting for it. The story was okay, because it was not meant for one of the greatest films of all time. It was sort of a weekend getaway or the bachelor party theme, but the film gives its original reason and then those developed plots were too familiar if you have seen plenty of teen films, in the party theme.\r\n\r\nIt's supposed to make us laugh, but there are lots of outdated humours tried in the unusual route to narrate them. The grandfather-grandson combo was an excellent idea, the main plot revolves around them and it should have remained that way, but the undetermined romance was an interruption. Or they should have developed a decent romance track for a better balance in the genre.\r\n\r\nAt least it would have been all right if it was a teen film. Many of those who appeared in it were actually too old to represent the roles given to them. That's fine too, because films are fake, everything is make-up and performance, but none were at their best except De Niro and Aubrey Plaza. It is definitely a film to skip, that's my opinion, but they're a few who are defending it, so be careful that I'm not always right and they're not always wrong if you want to choose it.\r\n\r\n3\/10","id":"5752e1b69251416bb7000014","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5752e1b69251416bb7000014","movie_id":291870}
{"author":"timesofindia","content":"How do you introduce an incestuous romantic comedy, an action thriller with a twist, a ghost comedy, and a tale within a tale? Aviyal answers it with Shameer Sultan's wacky prelude that has an actor talking. It is only when it ends that we realise that he has been preparing us for what is to follow. \r\n\r\nSruthi Bedam has a storyline that if attempted in a mainstream film today will have one organisation or the other protesting. A young man is attracted to the guest who has come to his home. She is a looker and is only a year older to him, though there is a hitch \u2014 she is his chithi (aunt)! Director Mohit Mehra treats this Balachander-ish plot as a comedy. There is a friend character, who advices the hero how wooing the woman is wrong even as he subtly eggs on the smitten guy with voyeuristic delight. The way Mehra keeps us guessing about the motives of woman adds to the suspense. \r\n\r\nIn Lokesh Kanakaraj's Kalam, a filmmaker and his friends go after a pickpocket and his cronies, who have stolen from them a CD and pen drive containing their short film. What starts off as a low-key thriller turns into an action film (with the action being choreographed against an Aiyappa song!). There is a twist as well, and it is pulled off commendably. \r\n\r\nTwo friends go on a trip to Rameswaram with the ashes of their dead friend. That is the premise of Kanneer Anjali, which is somewhat a rambling film, with hot-or-miss humour. The tale takes a turn when the duo (or, should we say trio?) gets acquainted with a drug smuggler en route, but Guru Smaran's film lacks the tautness of the other films. The acting, too, feels amateurish. \r\n\r\nBut the anthology ends on a high with Alphonse Putharen's Eli, which seems to have been made prior to his Neram days. Bobby Simhaa and Nivin Pauly play the leads here as well, and even their appearances are similar to what was in that film. A gangster narrates a story and we get the actions that happen in both these stories, interrupted often by the noise from a (unseen) couple's lovemaking. It is visually splendid and shows why Putharen has come to be one of the most exciting filmmakers today. \r\n\r\nPlot-wise, the shorts in Aviyal are streets ahead of those that formed the first edition, Bench Talkies. They are daring, wacky and fresh. A couple of these films even manage to transcend the made-for-TV visual style of shorts. It will be interesting to see what Karthik Subbaraj (who is one the project's backers) and co serve us next.","id":"56ebef1b9251415e62001f5c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56ebef1b9251415e62001f5c","movie_id":388322}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Two cops with the same motive, dealing it differently.**\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the first film a couple of years ago, I did not think they would make a sequel. It looked kind of a one-off film, but I'm very happy for this and I'm sure there will be another one. There's no mention of 'part 2' in the title, so people might end up watching this without knowing there's one before this. But it's good to name a film according to the plot\/story. Those who saw the original will be familiar with the characters and the story narration, so they will know what to and how much to expect.\r\n\r\nThis is my first film of the 2017. I don't believe in such sentiments, but I think its a great start and hoping to watch many more good ones. Now coming to the film plot, it continued from the previous. After the successful first assignment as a detective, Jay Swan is sent to another small mining town to deal with a missing person case. Seems no ones are happy on his arrival, including the local cop. But his doubts about how the powerful people misusing their power makes a cop named Josh to act instantly.\r\n\r\nAlmost 2 hour long film, narrated with a slow pace. Thus far of the tale are developed steadily. Since the Josh gets into investigating, the people with illegal business starts to feel the heat. Meanwhile, Jay learns a few things about his people from an old local indigenous man. Josh and Jay, they both make a progress, which leads to a step away to solve the multiple cases. The final quarter turns into an action film and leaves a big open to the story to continue.\r\n\r\n> \"And they follow the same god. Money god.\"\r\n\r\nThat's what I disliked. Being a long film and not able to finish it off properly makes it fall behind quite a bit long distance from the original film. But I still enjoyed it. Those locations were well used to tell the story. In fact, it kind of reminded me another detective film 'Jesse Stone'. The opening scene from this as well, kind of similar, like being drunk while arriving in a new town. Unlike that film, this is not a television film and high quality film from all the aspect. It is also considered one of the best Aussie film of the year. So if you are a film fanatic, you should not miss it.\r\n\r\nDirected by the same director and once again he managed the multiple tasks, like handling camera, editing, music and script. Predictable story, but it's not about the story, it's how the story was presented. The actors did help with that part to accomplish what the filmmaker wanted. Aaron Pederson was awesome, and now he's one of my favourites from down under. I hope like all the Aussie actors, he would also get a chance to work in Hollywood projects.\r\n\r\nThe case was not detailed for us. We learn Jay is working to find the missing girl, but no flashbacks or any other kind of revelations. At some point it gives out the result in a simple, but heart wrecking way. It's more a realistic in revelation going forward than giving hints for the viewers to make predictions. Like I said, it's not as good as the first film, that's only because of the ending. I'm also not sure the same story would continue in the next part.\r\n\r\nThe way it concluded might not be complete, but it is something different than the usual solution in a cop film. So you have to accept the fact than complaining it. Other than that, I'm sure it is one of the best detective films. The films, both the installments were not internationally recognised so well, but it definitely deserves that honour. It might take years people come to know, though I hope you would check it out after reading this review, only if you haven't seen it yet.

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The summer of YES!**\r\n\r\nIt was just like the British film 'Kids in Love' I'd seen prior to this. Explored only on a comedic side. Four friends who have been the ideal kids, after a few years later on one summer, before heading to the college, they have decided to accomplish everything they had missed in their life so far. So it's a time to blend in with what their kind do, but not as easy as it seems. Sometimes everything goes out of their proportion and some of them struggle at beginning itself. Overall, how their summer ends, in that, what they had gained and lost was told.\r\n\r\nWritten and directed by a newcomer. Really very good try. Good comedies and well performed actors. The four lead characters were unique. The story around them was nicely built. But not they all were equally balanced. Most of the focus was on Nicolas Braun and then Zoey. I kind of felt the scenes were intentionally done, but worth an attempt. Slightly predictable film, which was like any Hollywood teenage flick. At a time a few things stretch beyond our anticipation. Might not be the best teen flick, though worth a watch.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"597e0d94c3a36853dd018437","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/597e0d94c3a36853dd018437","movie_id":352186}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Sometimes, 'fightback' is the only option.**\r\n\r\nThis film quite reminded me the Korean film I saw a few years ago called 'Grandma Gangsters'. That film was about a vacation, though money involves and here it was about the pension. That's a serious thing, could have been another 'I, Daniel Blake', but that's not how it goes. A very interesting and comical take on the pension crisis. What could the old people can do about it? Well, that's the point, they use an opportunity that comes their way to tackle the issue.\r\n\r\nI love films involving aged people. Not for amusement, but to see them struggle, emotionally I break down. Only those on the realistic portrayals. This title looked okay, but when I read the synopsis, I desperately wanted to see it. I knew it was a comedy, so I did not expect greater, except some good laughs. It did delivered, but I felt a few scenes were very unrealistic, even for a cinematic. Like the ending was not convincing enough. Though the rest of the film was fine.\r\n\r\nThe story centres on the character Arthur played by Bernard Hill, which I first time noticed his character, particularly being in the lead since as Theodon, the King of Rohan from 'The Lord of the Rings'. So, like any film, it all begins with a simple introduction of his life and people around him. Unlike his friends, he is much able to do the stuffs at his age. Some way or the other, they are all depending on him, including his wife. Then one day he comes to know that he's not eligible anymore for his pension benefits. After thinking a lot, the heartbroken Arthur decides to take an extreme step. So begins his new adventure, and the following, his gang joins him.\r\n\r\n> \u275dThey may take our pensions, but they will never take our lives.\u275e\r\n\r\nDoes it not sound cool! Brilliant performances by all. For a theme like this, the characters have to be fit which is a stereotype that this film breaks. But there were some sacrifices like the screenplay was altered to balance between the physically weak characters and the contents that's usually fast and furious and sometimes rough handling requires. It all worked though.\r\n\r\nA crime film, yet there's no violence or the action sequences. Involves some nervous scenes and like I said earlier, the end twist should have been better. Considering how everything was developed, that was not a bad ending at all, especially keeping in mind audience point of view of what they would be expecting. It was not entirely about the old guys. The cops have a small part, including one of them was old who leads the robbery case.\r\n\r\nAt some point, it looked like 'Bonnie and Clyde', which was mentioned in the storyline as well. Like a cat-and-mouse game, the events in the tale stretches as much as it can possible, providing entertainment for us. The narration could have ended in very early, though the cops were not all Sherlocks. Everything in the interest of the film to develop in the right way with little silly and more funny.\r\n\r\nNot an average film or a classic. Made with a decent budget and the fine casting, I think the film is good to try once, but I suggest not to anticipate like any outstanding heist films you have seen in your life. Learn about the film, like its storyline and its characters. If you do that you will understand its limitations, except less fun while watching the film.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59430b719251417fb0013543","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59430b719251417fb0013543","movie_id":395482}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> A fight among the gods, for the Egyptian empire.\r\n\r\nI like this director, but this is not his best work. I think the Hollywood fed up with Greek stuffs, now they're looking at the ancient Egypt. Where's the next stop? India? This film was not a bad idea. I liked the story, a mission based concept, but I did not like the CGI. Visually, it was okay, though those CGI characters felt like they're from sci-fi. I think they inspired by the ancient Egyptian arts. Other than that, this film is enjoyable.\r\n\r\nAt least I knew about Greek deities, I learnt a few words and names about Egypt mythology through this. Gerard Butler in a negative shade was good and the other actors too decent. I was not interested in this film, but now somewhat I enjoyed it, that mean they should stop it here, no sequel please.\r\n\r\nI had no issue with the casting, it is a marketing strategy. You can't just put a new foreign face in front of the camera and make money out of it. Cinema itself means fake display. Age, skin, death, everything is fake. So people must learn to accept it similar to when a black, Malaysian or Indonesian man says he's a mooslim, but genetically he's not, just converted to.\r\n\r\nWell composed stunt sequences, especially bloods with liquid gold, totally got the PG13. Least expected film of the year, but got entertained better. It got the mixed response and mostly negative feedback from the critics, but who knows you might have a good time like I did. So you could try it if you want in your free time, because it is not worth to spend your valuable time.\r\n\r\n6\/10","id":"5787bfe692514131c7000e9a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5787bfe692514131c7000e9a","movie_id":205584}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"When the credits rolled after having watched this movie with my kids I was perplexed. I knew this movie had not received very great ratings and I had heard rumors that some people had even labelled it the worst movie of the year. However, I had liked watching the movie\u2026a lot!\r\n\r\nSure, the script is predictable and certainly wont win any prices for best script anywhere. The acting is adequate but no more. But it is a fun fantasy adventure movie, a simple adventure \/ action fantasy roller-coaster. Plenty of fairly cool special effects. Some humor, some romance. It is also fairly devoid of politically correct preaching, whining, mentally unstable and self destructive \u201cheroes\u201d and all that crap. In short it is the kind of movie I like.\r\n\r\nI actually looked up the movies page on Wikipedia and it was pretty much full of nonsense and whining about how the movie was not \u201cethnically correct\u201d. What the f\u2026? It is a bloody fantasy adventure movie for Christ sake! It is meant to entertain! Who the hell cares about whether the actors are native Egyptians or something else? Well, I guess Eskimos would look a bit funny in those roles but otherwise\u2026\r\n\r\nYes it does take quite a few liberties with Egyptian mythology but again, it is a fantasy movie guys! And Egyptian mythology, like any other mythology, goods etc, is nothing but fantasy and story telling from the start so just live with it. To me they stayed true enough to the core of the mythology and I would actually give the director and script writers bonus points for actually depicting the earth as flat as was the predominant belief in those times. Those scenes with Ra dragging the sun and the flat Earth was quite beautiful actually.\r\n\r\nThe rating on IMDb is also on the low side but of those that took the effort to write a review most seems to be quite positive. The mostly negative ones are, of course, the so called \u201ccritics\u201d. No surprise there.\r\n\r\nIt is sad to see how a, in my opinion a quite entertaining, movie can be so sabotaged by a bunch of, again in my opinion, loud mouthed, ignorant, intolerant, fanatical SJWs who seems to believe that a movie cannot be allowed to just entertain but has to carry a political message, their political message.\r\n\r\nI would recommend anyone into fantasy and adventure movies to check this one out if you should stumble upon it. I certainly do not regret adding it to my collection.","id":"5b559a59c3a3685c85014359","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b559a59c3a3685c85014359","movie_id":205584}
{"author":"CyrusPK","content":"Fantasy is very difficult to get right in films.  Audience resistance is quite high, especially when it involves characters with difficult-to-remember names or diverse place names.   Relating to a fantasy world of beasts and magic is often tricky for audiences who may prefer grounded, realistic drama.  There are exceptions though \u2013 the worlds of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings captured public imaginations and the complex mass of stories and themes in Game of Thrones also attracted an audience.\r\nThis fear of fantasy seems to have informed a slightly tentative approach in the writing and direction of Gods of Egypt.  There are plenty of fantastic creatures present ranging from giant, vicious snake like creatures to Minotaurs in all but name, and an array of Egyptian gods.  However, there has been avoidance of any of the cod Shakespearean dialogue that often permeates works of this type and an emphasis more upon realistic dialogue.  This creates a needless tension between the intensity of the innovative visuals and the prosaic words dropping from the actors, a tension that is never resolved as the linear story progresses forwards but never upwards.\r\nThe pleasures with this film arise mostly from the intensity of the visual experience.  Every environment has been precisely designed, full of colour and dimension, looking very different from the landscapes seen in past films based on myth and history.  The benefit of this is that there is always something to attract the eye, from great sky barges to rainbow lit waterfalls and massive monuments.  Like all Alex Proyas\u2019 films the visual ideas add weight and substance that the scripting sometimes fails to.\r\nIt is however that narrative which brings the film down with a series of very deliberate events extrapolated in excessive detail, burdened by actors who at times look deathly uncomfortable in their roles.  Only Geoffrey Rush, in a small but notable part, really excels with so many of the others not able to bring life to the dialogue as they intone in front of ever present green screens.\r\nIn the end it is a pity that such a wonderfully conceived world at the visual level could not have been combined with a compelling story and acting.","id":"5b18db479251414bcd0039d2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b18db479251414bcd0039d2","movie_id":205584}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**The road to the life changing course.**\r\n\r\nThe coming-of-age road adventure based on the book of the same name. From the director of 'Soul Kitchen'. It was like any other similar themed teen flick, has all the same formulas, but what makes it special is it is being a German film. I'm not saying it is new for German film, but definitely not every year flooded with such plenty of flicks like in the Hollywood. Besides, there are other major differences, as it is culture, mindset of the kids and the type of adventure.\r\n\r\nThe original title name is the name of one of the main film characters. But the story was observed from another character who has been with him all along. Opened with some road accident and soon the flashback follows to reveal what happened till that point of the film. For me the story did not impress, it was how everything was presented on the screen. It was a 90 minute film, and straight to the point kind of narration. Which means the pace was never compromised.\r\n\r\nIt tells the story of two teenage boys how they have spent their summer. After not invited to the birthday party to whom he has a crush on, Maik decides to go an unexpected road trip with his new, weird friend. A lifetime journey. Being a teenager and taking a such ride unwraps his mind as he was only living in the small world so far. Which particularly points out his one sided romance. At the end of his adventure where stands and the aftermath of everything was briefly disclosed.\r\n\r\n> \u275dSomeone just needs to scratch in some letters, then it will be 'Atomic Crisis of 2016'.\u275e\r\n\r\nThe 'road movie' has been just a concept, but the stories created around it was very nice. Like many mini episodes, whenever they encounter the new people, the new places. At its halfway through, the third character was introduced. It was one of the best improvement. At first it was not intentional, but going further it becomes. Might not close to the real life, but makes such impression that's not too far from the reality. On how some people slipped away from the actual world and the contact with its people. Obviously with the reason, that does not reveal to us because of not to make any further complication in the storytelling.\r\n\r\nThe overall best thing about the film was not digging anything so in detail. Everything about the film was a rough cut. Except the opening parts in the school where the plot was initiated. It was more of an introduction than the initiation. And the remaining film was a transformation from something what we knew its state of condition (of the main character) to the ultimate goal (which was not expected).\r\n\r\nIt drags the gay topic, but throw away immediately. Similarly a few other topics as well. Yeah, the film was fun, as it told from the teenager's perspective, not the entire film to be considered very seriously. Though there some parts make sense and inspires, despite done\/committed on the contrary. When it comes to the cast, it was flawless performances. Both the lead boys were awesome. The odd combination worked out well. But it was not that odd, while narrating the story.\r\n\r\nThe Maik reminded me the Wiley Wiggins from 'Dazed and Confused'. The film was not predictable, but the path it has taken was. If I say the film was excellent, that does not mean all of you would enjoy it. Surely teenagers, and children film fans would, but those who are familiar with this kind might find nothing new in it. For them it does not matter, it is an American or a German film. That does not mean it's not worth a watch. So try it, despite you are going to like it or not in the later.\r\n\r\n_7.5\/10_","id":"597e11029251415d6101bfa3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/597e11029251415d6101bfa3","movie_id":384664}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Treasure hunt meets the wall street!**\r\n\r\nLoosely based on the real. It's both a treasure hunt film, and a wall street tale. The great mix of two made it a fine film. Wall street based films always fascinates the grown-ups. So do this film. Matthew McConaughey playing in one of two main role, I thought it should have been called 'Fool's Gold 2'. You will know why I said that once you watch it, or maybe you know it already. But the end twist was something different, changed everything.\r\n\r\nThe man who inherited the family business of mining, is now in the crisis of losing everything. His final move is to join the hand with another man struggling as same as he is. They both pull off successfully the initial hiccup. And after a long struggle, seems they had hit a bullseye. The lives have changed forever or is it! Another trouble follows them, following, the story reaches the end with a twist.\r\n\r\nAt first, I thought it was like in the line of 'There Will Be Blood'. As the narration progresses, the gear changed between the two worlds. One being in the US and then in Indonesian Jungle. I thought the end should have been little more detail, but it still worked fine.An underrated film for sure. If it was a DiCaprio film, it would have been highly praised.\r\n\r\nActually, I liked it. Well written screenplay and performances. Matthew McConaughey was awesome. We talk about actor like Johnny Depp for playing roles in awesome costumes, but this guy turned the roles to reality. It's either 'Dallas Buyer's Club' or this or any others. He deserves well respect more the big names right now. Thousand times better than accidental actor, DiCaprio.\r\n\r\nEdgar Ramirez was also good. Bryce Dallas Howard had an important role as well. Overall, This is one of the films not to miss from the 2016 calender. It could have been a box office bomb, but definitely will be recognised as the time pass by. I would surely suggest it to anybody.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"59fe2395c3a36868930267a2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59fe2395c3a36868930267a2","movie_id":334524}

{"author":"Linda Robinson","content":"I was determined to see this movie on opening day. Female cast, Paul Feig (a Michiganian who included a Michigan line in the film), a couple fistfuls of ridiculousity on social media. When the movie started, I was one-eyeing the screen. Waiting for it. Oh oh. Fart joke. Oh oh. Kristen Wiig still can't make her eyes look interested. Then Charles Dance shows up with his serious comic tongue stuck in his cheek to admonish Prof. Gilbert that if she is serious about tenure, she needs to find a more prestigious university recommendation. \"More prestigious? Than Princeton?\" Now I know the deadpan eye comic genius of Wiig, too. From that point on, I was in love with the story. Katie Dippold cowrote the film. She has a bit part as the real estate agent showing the team the 1984 movie's fire station to rent. I want more of her screenwriting. The dialogue is witty, sharp, real. While I liked the 1984 Ghostbusters, it's a buddy movie. Dudes in the treehouse with no girls allowed spelled wrong nailed to the door. Smug, chirpy, guybonics. Venkman electrocuting rivals in the lab: using paranormal research to get dates. Annie Potts drooling over Spengler. Sigourney Weaver in a diaphanous dress, draped on a parapet waiting for the Gatekeeper. The sore spots in 1984 are sprayed away in 2016 without gender disrespect. Gilbert gets to drool over the pretty doofus administrative assistant. When you see this movie, watch all the credits. Chris Hemsworth is a clearly confident actor - he dives pelvis-first into the Kevin role, and it's hilarious. I'm still searching for the creator of the titles and end credits. Excellent art. The poster? Not so much. Hemsworth needs to be behind the four leads. Geez. Casting hit a lick with Kate McKinnon as Holzmann. She is fantastic bringing Harold Ramis' genius back to life. Leslie Jones as Patty: so good, and she has some of the juiciest lines, delivered with haute sass. There are really well-placed cameos by 1984's cast, including birthing one of the movie's best lines \"safety lights are for dudes.\" 2016 Ghostbusters is a great fun movie, and I'll watch it more than once again. One of the brilliant visuals that I was thrilled with - the stream from the proton packs tied up the ghosts. Wrapped, pinned, contained lassoed. Genius analogy for what to do with obsolete stereotype. There's a lassoed line in the film while the Ghostbusters are reading the internet reaction to their first catch. \"Ain't no bitches gonna catch no ghosts.\" Yeah. Watch this.","id":"578a69c5c3a36866a800203f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/578a69c5c3a36866a800203f","movie_id":43074}

In the 2016 North American wish to either redo every successful film ever made and present every conceivable variant in the process, for what could be deemed the lack of any possible originality of ideas, I still tried to enter this with an open mind, and see this as if the two films from the 80's (which I enjoyed very much the one time I saw each of them) had never existed. I should state I saw this in 3D (which I hardly ever do), with my lady and our respective sons.\r\n\r\nI felt that it was quite funny and that the special effects were excellent. Next to 'Avatar', the use of 3D was the best I have ever seen. It's a popcorn flick well-worth seeing. Though I haven't seen any other movies by Feig or starring McCarthy, it made me want to go back and give them a shot at some time in the near future. There was something for everyone--both my lady and I enjoyed it very much--and the boys, three and thirteen years-old respectively, loved it as well.

{"author":"in_the_crease","content":"As a male nerd who grew up in the 1980's watching both original movies and the cartoon, running around with my toy proton pack and catching imaginary ghosts in my basement, I should be of the demographic complaining about how this ruins my childhood or that a cast of all women is just a stunt in the name of political correctness, or whatever their issue is. But the truth is, I REALLY enjoyed this movie. \r\n\r\nThe four female leads were absolutely hilarious--especially Kate McKinnon who steals every scene she is in. The other three characters have more growth, more of a story arc, and are more fleshed out as people in general. But McKinnon makes the most out of the available material and creates a very fun and memorable character.\r\n\r\nThe comedy of the 2016 version, while equally effective, is completely different from the dry humor of the original. The absence of Dan Aykroyd's and Harold Ramis's ludicrously funny lines delivered with a straight face, and the deadpan humor of Bill Murray has been switched out with a more over-the-top and in-your-face style of humor. It's not as subtle. Ghostbusters (1984) made me chuckle; Ghostbusters (2016) made me laugh out loud.\r\n\r\nWhile a lot of the original's comedy came from the ghosts themselves, i.e. that they're funny instead of legitimately scary, the new version reverses that. There is some very creepy imagery involving things like old timey parade balloons, ghosts pushing against mirrors, and other things that seemed inspired by American Horror Story. Plus, there were some good jump scares, boo moments, that actually caught me off guard. \r\n\r\nMuch like a guitar amp out of Spinal Tap, this film turns both the scares and the comedy up to 11 with great results. \r\n\r\nI haven't had this much fun at a movie in a long time. The trailer is NOT a valid way to judge this film. The trailer seemed to splice together all the ineffective moments and jokes of the film. But those were the exceptions and not the rule. The rule here is fun, entertainment, laughs, and the occasional scare. When the film works, it works remarkably.\r\n\r\nThe only real misstep was Chris Hemsworth's character. While the gender role reversal of the hot blonde ditz secretary was brilliant and long overdue in a mainstream summer movie, he was just too dumb to be believable. The character of Kevin belonged in a cartoon and not a legitimate movie. \r\n\r\nThe best line in the movie references Jaws and Annie Potts' cameo made me cheer. \r\n\r\nHowever...\r\n\r\nIf you've already decided you hate this movie without even seeing it, you probably won't like it. That's how these things usually work. But, if you have an open mind and are reserving judgement, I suggest you see it. You will be pleasantly surprised.","id":"58d2ac829251411faa000c49","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58d2ac829251411faa000c49","movie_id":43074}

{"author":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","content":"A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s an arbitrary sense of nostalgia that unfairly permeates audience perceptions of the new female-centric \u201cGhostbusters\u201d reboot. I love the original 1984 film too; I wore out my VHS cassette when I was a kid and I\u2019ve probably seen the movie dozens of times, including special theatrical re-releases and anniversary screenings. It\u2019s almost as if all of this animosity is seen as a badge of honor for \u2018serious movie fans.\u2019\r\n\r\nAll of this badmouthing is truly unwarranted, especially if you actually go back and rewatch the original. Sure, the movie has comedy legend Bill Murray, the hilarious Rick Moranis, and memorable performances from Harold Ramis, Sigourney Weaver and Dan Aykroyd. It introduced us to the characters we all still love decades later, and made lines like \u201ctell him about the Twinkie\u201d a permanent part of movie nerd vocabulary. But to all the haters I say this: you are being very, very unfair. The 1980s era film has a lot of boring sequences and lags quite a bit, and as is the case with many movies, sometimes our nostalgia creates pretty thick rose colored glasses. We tend to only remember the good in our childhood favorites.\r\n\r\nPut aside your bias: the new \u201cGhostbusters\u201d honors the legacy of the original, is a fun retelling of the classic story, and it does not disappoint. THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY! THIS MOVIE IS ACTUALLY GOOD!\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of minor hiccups along the way (as with most comedies, not every joke sticks, and the ghastly Missy Elliott \/ Fall Out Boy remake of the already awful Ray Parker Jr. song \u201cGhostbusters\u201d makes an unwelcome appearance), but overall the movie is a success. At first it may feel weird to see women Ghostbusters but any skepticism will quickly fade (there\u2019s a new generation of young girls who will undoubtedly be inspired by these characters).\r\n\r\nWhen estranged childhood friends and paranormal enthusiasts Erin (Kristen Wiig) and Abby (Melissa McCarthy) reunite, sparks are rekindled and they decide to get back to their ghost chasing roots. The smartypants duo is joined by weirdo nuclear engineer Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon) and subway worker Patty (Leslie Jones). When Manhattan starts to experience boatloads of specter activity, the friends get started on some good old fashioned poltergeist hunting.\r\n\r\nA big part of why this movie works is the comedic talent of these women; their chemistry is evident and they play well off each other, and the positive themes of loyalty and friendship never once feel fake. All of the actors are proficient at physical comedy and all have impeccable timing. This movie is very funny and the jokes had (and kept) me laughing from the beginning (there\u2019s a particularly hilarious sequence at a heavy metal concert that\u2019s worth the price of admission).\r\n\r\nRounding out the amusing performances is Chris Hemsworth as Kevin, a completely clueless stud muffin who is hired as the women\u2019s receptionist solely based on his beefcake good looks. This feminist spin on the dumb secretary stereotype is exactly the type of lampoon I was hoping for here. In fact, the film doesn\u2019t shy away from all of the lady haters either: there are lots of self-referential bits that directly address all of the critics (my favorite being Holtzmann\u2019s \u2018One of the Boys\u2018 t-shirt). Girl power!\r\n\r\nFans of the original will also appreciate several in-jokes and references, and there\u2019s a long line of fun cameos (which I won\u2019t spoil here: just keep your eyes open and be sure to stay through the end credits)! The special effects have been given a serious upgrade as well: these ghosts look real, feel real, and are appropriately scary-yet-funny. When the ladies first fired up their proton packs, I began cheering internally.\r\n\r\n\u201cGhostbusters\u201d is exactly what a summer movie is supposed to be. It\u2019s big in scope, it\u2019s full of hearty laughs, it\u2019s filled with terrific performances from all of the leads, it\u2019s stuffed with stunning special effects, and it\u2019s something the entire family can enjoy. All of you naysayers really need to lighten up because this is a really, really fun movie.\r\n\r\n**A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com**","id":"579d0343c3a3683870001101","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/579d0343c3a3683870001101","movie_id":43074}
{"author":"Frank Ochieng","content":"Filmmaker Paul Feig's **Ghostbusters** reboot pretty much followed the characteristic aspects of his previous films (\"Bridesmaids\", \"The Heat\", \"Spy\") all incorporating a self-awareness of female-oriented friendship and the estrogen-driven escapades rooted in inspired goofiness. So given this familiar foundation of Feig's big screen blueprint one would expect that his creative input into the continued Ghostbusters franchise for the millennium moviegoers would result in the heralded hype his film project is now enjoying at large. Sure, the feminine-charged **Ghostbusters** seemed like a radical concept and would obviously trigger the nostalgic sentiments (and comparisons) of the classic 80's comedy spearheaded by beloved on-screen paranormal hucksters Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson. Nevertheless, singer Ray Parker Jr.'s lyrical catchphrase \"Who you gonna call?\" within the Ghostbusters theme song needs to be addressed accordingly. The answer: the handlers behind the original **Ghostbusters** film that could uplift the disjointed high jinks and synthetic silliness of Feig's current comedic ghostly she-power schlockfest.\r\n\r\nIt is only natural that **Ghostbusters** had high expectations for Sony Pictures to perform well given the aggressive marketing tactics, early release of the Ghostbusters movie trailer (which was heavily panned online) and the aforementioned cinematic legacy of the original film's fanatical following and reputation. However, this third installation of **Ghostbusters** feels curiously flat and strained in its stillborn witticism. The creep factor borders on campy and cheesy (although this effectively worked for Ivan Reitman's 32-year old spook-ridden farce in the eighties) for which in today's cinematic circle is inexcusable due to the edgier and challenging special effects that could have played up the whimsy and wonderment of this breezy, bubble-gum colored romp with seemingly low-grade spark and sizzle.\r\n\r\nFeig's interpretation of the **Ghostbusters** universe could have been fresh and favorable especially with the colorful casting of his capable four female principals in the Emmy-winning and Oscar-nominated Melissa McCarthy along with Saturday Night Live personalities Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones. Unfortunately for these noted funny ladies they were saddled (or slimmed if you will) by a transparent script almost as invisible as the pesky ghosts they are trying to pacify. The recycled by-the-numbers hilarity and hysteria does not make this brand of ghost-busting quite distinguishing. Chemistry-wise, the Ghostbuster gals seem to revel in the collective merry-minded mischievousness and genuinely try to bring energy and outrageous antics to this flaccid frightfest. Still, the mixture of Ghostbusters' gooey gumption with a dash of egghead feisty femininity never seems to translate into anything beyond the tired gimmick of promoting another excuse to tap into yesteryear's profitable fun and frolic that made the wise-cracking Murray and his klutzy cohorts so amusing and welcomed in their rollicking ghostly gem from the Reagan-era.\r\n\r\nQuite frankly the notion that **Ghostbusters** is unfairly being knocked for its misogynistic overtones fueled by bias Internet-based fanboys not accepting that nerdy womanly scientists cannot fill the shoes of their revered male counterparts from the previous two predecessors is somewhat misleading. Sure, the decision to cast an all-female **Ghostbusters** team turned some curious heads but for the most part many thought this to be rather intriguing and experimental. The actual disdain can be pinpointed to the fact that Feig's flimsy boo-spewing fable is grounded in cliched and forced chuckles, weak-kneed jokes and gags, lazy writing and uninspired visual neon lighting techniques that look like a cheapened explosion from a vintage late 70's New York discotheque.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, **Ghostbusters** wallows in mediocrity and fails to capture the acquired giddiness and imagination so pronounced in the prior entertaining installments. Even if the original actors in Murray, Aykroyd, the late Ramis and Hudson had decided to reprise their roles under Feig's problematic production the results would be the same--an aimless reboot without any definitive bite or backbone for a cobbled comedy that is slight and stretched thin to its toothless core. Amazingly, **Ghostbusters** cannot decide if it should remain faithful to its humble roots (it does help trivially that iconic Ghostbuster notables make scattered cameos--sans Rick Moranis--including that glorified scene-stealer in the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man as well as hot dog gulper Slimer) or venture off into something resembling its own goofy identity and distinction. Either way the third time around simply meanders in over-produced, noisy emptiness.\r\n\r\nThe so-called plot in **Ghostbusters** focuses on college professor Erin Gilbert (Wiig presumably in the Murray\/Dr. Peter Venkman role) and her fascination with ghost activities that end up costing her an academic career in the process. Specifically, Erin's controversial book that she wrote along with co-author Abby Yates (McCarthy) served as the basis for her firing. Abby's obsession with ghosts still has her invested with this spirit phenomenon that she researches defiantly with her kooky associate Jillian Holtzman (McKinnon) in tow. Eventually, it would take the trio's status of joblessness (not to mention a run-in with a slim-spewing ghost that loves soaking humans with its sticky green goo) to collaborate on going into business as paranormal exterminators out to showcase their expertise in \"busting ghosts\".\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, there is something brewing in the twisted mind of supernatural-loving freak Rowan North (Neil Casey). After all, he is the lost soul responsible for unleashing the onslaught of riff-raffish apparitions upon New York City courtesy of his miserable, lonely existence. Now it is up to Erin, Abby and Jillian to eliminate Rowan's sinister agenda and eradicate the spooky pests that he has manipulated to cause the city-wide panic. As Internet sensational darlings, the Ghostbusters are committed to step up to the plate as the sassy saviors they were meant to be since going into the ghost-busting industry.\r\n\r\nThe later arrival of street-wise transit worker Patty Tolan (Jones) completes the Ghostbusters' quartet. Patty, whose run in with one of the slimy ghosts in the subway tunnel was pivotal to joining the three scientists, has something to offer the ghost-chasing brainiacs--a.) her knowledge of the city's whereabouts and b.) her funeral director uncle's hearse that serves as the official transportation for the Ghostbusters.\r\n\r\nOverall, the third outing regarding this toothless entry **Ghostbusters** notoriously lacks the robust impishness and rapport of the male character counterparts that were devilishly drawn together and cemented by Murray's droll humor. Here, the ladies come off as bland and indifferent--at least for the Paul McCartney and John Lennon of the team in Wiig's Erin Gilbert and McCarthy's Abby Yates. McKinnon's Jillian Holtzman is the only truly spry Ghostbuster who is credible as an off-kilter genius ditz with off-the-wall likability. Some may gravitate towards Jones's stereotypical brassy black chick with the brash quips and animated overreactions. Although Jones brings in the high-wire urbanized smirks in contrast to her quieter, geekier counterparts it is cringe-worthy watching her play an over-the-top, towering, mouthy cultural exaggeration that is woefully embarrassing for the sake of this dismissive. hedonistic hoot.\r\n\r\nIronically it is the hunky Chris Hemsworth that fares decently as the handsome himbo Kevin, the dim-witted **Ghostbusters'** male assistant that serves as the doltish eye candy for the cerebral lasses, particularly for the smitten Erin. Another SNL alum, Cecily Strong, checks in as the menacing mouthpiece from the Mayor's office that tries to discredit the popular ghost-busting technicians as \"sad, thrill-seeking women\".\r\n\r\nFeig, serving as both the film's director and co-screenwriter (along with \"The Heat\" scriber Katie Dippold) has no cohesive vision for the listless **Ghostbusters** and could have used some critical pointers in studying the proven anatomy of what made Reitman's nostalgic vehicle so engaging that still thrives after three decades since coming into the movie audience's consciousness. From the lame and limping laughs dipped in cartoonish crudeness (i.e. a male ghost gets a rousing jolt to his \"junk\" courtesy of his heroic ghost-busting detractors) to musical acts Fall Out Boy's\/Missy Elliott's relentlessly unrecognizable, erratic and choppy remake of the aforementioned Parker's infectious **Ghostbusters'** theme song in this regurgitated comedy that has no excuse for catering to a lackluster rebirth while die hard and casual fans patiently waited for a festive follow-up from Murray and crew for thirty-plus years.\r\n\r\nTo randomly quote a classic **Ghostbusters'** lyrical line: \"I ain't afraid of no ghosts\". This may be the case but one should be very afraid of this heavy-handed banal boofest for wasting their time, anticipation and consideration.\r\n\r\n**Ghostbusters (2016)**\r\n\r\nSony Pictures\r\n\r\n1 hr. 44 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones, Kate McKinnon, Chris Hemsworth, Neil Casey, Cecily Strong, Charles Dance, Michael Kenneth Williams, Matt Walsh, Ed Begley, Jr.\r\n\r\nDirected and Co-Written by: Paul Feig\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy\/Supernatural\/Science Fiction\/Action and Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n--Frank Ochieng (c) 2016","id":"5789be5892514163c4000747","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5789be5892514163c4000747","movie_id":43074}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"This movie was a huge disappointment! The only positive thing I can say about\u00a0it\u00a0is that the special effects where not half bad. The movie itself was childish, unfunny, unintelligent and generally really bad.\r\n\r\nSome reviews giving this movie 9 or 10 stars (which is just ludicrous)\u00a0are saying that people cannot handle the feminism in the movie. What feminism? Replacing the original actors with women is not feminism as far as I am concerned and anyway, if you care about such things should it not have been two women and two men to be politically correct? Also, the supposedly intelligent women in this movie behave in a typical old-fashioned Hollywood stereotype of women way. They are mostly downright silly. If I were a feminist I would actually have been insulted by this movie.\r\n\r\nThen we have the male clerk that is dummer than a piece of rock. If someone had stacked four\u00a0supposedly intelligent\u00a0men and a single blond bimbo that is totally devoid of any trace of intelligence\u00a0together in a movie the social justice warriors would have cried foul\u00a0so loud that you could hear it across the planet. But since it is four women and a stupid male it is okay (not really). It is even feminism according to some people. What a load of bollocks.\r\n\r\nThere is actually a story in the movie although it is well hidden under the silly jokes and silly behavior. It is paper thin and rather silly in itself but it could have worked if the rest of the movie was up to snuff but sadly it is not.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote above the only good thing about this movie is the special effects. The few scenes that I actually enjoyed was during the big shoot out at the end which had some cool moments. I especially liked when Jillian pulls a pair of pistols out of her Ghostbuster suit and goes on a ghost killing spray.\r\n\r\nApart from that this movie is best forgotten.","id":"586641c99251412b8402c5a3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/586641c99251412b8402c5a3","movie_id":43074}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Home is where all the memories preserved.**\r\n\r\nI have to start the review by mentioning the recent year Russian film 'Durak', also known as 'The Fool' in English. In the same year, another similar themed Russian film, 'Leviathan' got nominated for the Oscars. What those both films highlighted were not just the corruptions, but the threats the common people face. Raising voice for good against evil is still a distant for such potential country. Here comes the Brazilian version. This is not on the same level. I meant the intensity of the event, how all folds. Nevertheless, the same core issue in a different continent.\r\n\r\nThis film met with several controversies. One of them omitted it from the Oscars race. But the film was received well from all the quarters. I did not find any issue. I thought it became unfortunate victim, especially, could be because of the developers and their connection with the corrupt powerful men. It's neither a masterpiece. I just consider it a good film. A message film. But not for everyone. Particularly, it is good for grownups viewing for the reason I'll going mention later.\r\n\r\nThe story of the 65 year old Clara. Her life has been successful being a music critic. Now a widow, and all her children settled down. It opened on her birthday where all the friends and family gathered to celebrate the occasion. Living alone in a small and beautiful beach view apartment. But the thing is she's the last one who still in that old building. Everyone had left it when the developers decided to demolish it and build a modern one. She's fighting to save the heritage. All her memories lie in there. But the developers have a different plan to force her out, and that's the remaining film to unfold how and other following developments.\r\n\r\n> \u275dSo when you like it, it's 'vintage'. If you don't like it, it's 'old'. Right?\u275e\r\n\r\nThe opening scene was a slight offbeat. Because right away it does not reveal who is the person of the film. Besides, some of the odd scenes in the middle would raise some eyebrows. Those were not actually the full fledged scenes, but glimpses that goes back to like the 70s or something. The idea of those parts were not properly understandable, but I think it is about missing those good times. The lone fighter concept was inspiring. At one point, when everybody around her thought that she's making an unnecessary scene out of it, she was firm on her decision and did what has to be done.\r\n\r\nThis was one of those films I did not like it on the spot. But slowly captivated. Once it's focus was fixed on one particular character, the rest of the tale set forward on what it wanted to tell us. As I understood it, it was not exactly about corruption, except a part of it was. It was the fight for ones right. A fight to save the past. On the other hand, the people from her opposite are ready to take extreme steps to defeat her. That's where it gets into the controversy. The controversy of those stupid tricks used to achieve the goal. This kind of a film coming from Brasil is really wonderful to educate poor knowledge people who easily become victims in a similar fashion.\r\n\r\nIt was a French-Brasil collaboration film. I'm reviewing it after a couple of days of my watch. Because I wanted to think about it for a while, scene by scene. The more I recall, the more I'm starting to like it. So I advise same to you as well that don't come to any conclusion just after you have watched. Because it could not be what you have heard about it. My only issue was the runtime. The 150 minutes were a too long. But manageable if you watch regularly, such slow films.\r\n\r\nWell written, directed and acted. Even the location was ideal. But they could have avoided the those sex scenes which I earlier labelled them as odd scenes. There were too many, even camera pans out from somewhere far away in the bush. Kind of unrelated. I am not against such an idea, as human daily life filled with those. But when the theme was seriously pivoting on a serious issue, these came as distraction. Why I'm pointing out that strongly is that a fine film like this should be for all ages, even for teenagers. It missed that opportunity. Otherwise and still a nice drama film to recommend the adults.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"59fe1d56c3a3686853025031","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/59fe1d56c3a3686853025031","movie_id":377273}
