Their problems come from their past lives - and are less easy to remedy. Despite the efforts of different charities to move people into homes, the streets are often where they feel safe and what they know best.  In this moving documentary, Woolcock gives the seen-but-unheard residents of London's streets a voice.","poster_path":null,"popularity":0.757,"id_imdb":"tt1851034"}

Most likely it is the view of others which delimits our own identity, as a young divorced mother named Julieta convinces herself. This evening is like any other: her two young sons are roughhousing in their cramped apartment. They whoop and shout while their mother makes desperately futile attempts at the computer to concentrate on writing a report for work. Feeling intense pressure, Julieta tries to quiet the conflict but finds it difficult without a partner to help. The tense situation changes unexpectedly when her two-year-old falls and hurts himself. In this story of a mother suspected of hurting her own child, the movie investigates themes of motherhood, guilt, duty, the role of men and women, fathers and mothers","poster_path":"\/hzwxXtf72bgajNHRZrrWPlfhJSX.jpg","popularity":0.904,"id_imdb":"tt1576452"}
