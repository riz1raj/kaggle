Memories of a Forgotten War is an experimental take on that behemoth of a hole in history: a hybrid between documentary and fiction, a weaving of stories in which stylised historical recreations, interview attempts with unwitting present-day US citizens (one of them wondering in all seriousness whether the war was fought over rice- eating preferences!), oral history and animation all have their place.","poster_path":null,"popularity":0.6,"id_imdb":"tt0810083"}

In this go around, Josiane Balasko and Nathalie Baye play the incorrigible Eddie and Patsy, who leave no impulse unenacted and no lust unsated -- be it for sex or the latest in designer clothing. Waking up from a night of drunken debauchery, the two dip right into a feast of champagne and caviar, much to the irritation of Eddie's elegant mother and her resentful daughter. As Eddie stretches an appalling pair of leopard-print leotards (complete with matching shoes, purse, and hat) over her massive rear end, she and Patsy learn of a handsome young Rollerblading delivery boy who quickly becomes the object of their lust. This film was screened at the 2001 Toronto Film Festival.","poster_path":"\/ysp3coAxHr4plG6wkIlYdNHAFx7.jpg","popularity":3.4,"id_imdb":"tt0271945"}
