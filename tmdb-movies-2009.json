Four prisoners are about to be released after serving 20 years as political detainees. About to return to society, they grapple with complications that have developed in their absence: new towns, new ideologies but most of all, new family dynamics. Questions arise as to what extent their political dissidence was worth their separations from families and the losses their loved ones have endured. While some stand fast to their choices, others look to turn a new page...  Made in 2009, the film is yet to be released in Syria, despite being a production ostensibly supported by the regime. The film, while reflecting a short era of reconciliation and reduced censorship attempted by Bashar Al Assad, remains highly relevant today for its treatments of forced loyalty signatures, arbitrary judgements, and systematic torture.","poster_path":null,"popularity":0.6,"id_imdb":"tt1556046"}

While her predisposition towards the ephemeral is often grounded in the physical world, as a feature length film, Craneway Event solicits an experience of duration that transcends the materiality of space. Craneway Event is the grand beauty and scale of empty industrial space, the delicacy of light, time and air, and the eloquence and subtlety of movement in the visionary work of Merce Cunningham.","poster_path":null,"popularity":0.6,"id_imdb":"tt4899120"}

With the advent of new drilling technologies, oil companies from far and wide are descending on small rural towns across America with men and machinery in tow. Director Noah Hutton takes us to the town of Stanley (population 1300), sitting atop the largest oil discovery in the history of the North American continent, and captures the change wrought by the unprecedented boom. Through revealing interviews and breathtaking imagery of the northern plains, Crude Independence is a rumination on the future of small town America-a tale of change at the hands of the global energy market and America's unyielding thirst for oil.","poster_path":null,"popularity":0.6,"id_imdb":"tt1326205"}
