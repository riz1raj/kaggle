I've seen part 4 just because everyone's watching it and surprisingly I liked it. I was even surprised to find out that Bryan O'Conner (Paul Walker) was a policeman. Haha!\r\n\r\nSo here I am, watching the fifth installment. Justine wanted to watch it badly and since I have nothing to do, I decided to accompany her. She was on leave the whole week and she just got back from Palawan. So before watching the movie, the 2 of us had dinner at Jack's Loft. I told her that we should buy tickets first but because we were lazy we forgot about it. When it was an hour before the movie, we were surprised. Sold out. Well, nearly sold out. There were like less than 10 seats. So we still went in line and luckily got seats even if the seats were bad and we were seated separately from each other. \r\n\r\nI liked this movie. Although it was very unrealistic. (Hello? Where's the government of Rio?) I like how The Rock was there. I like him. I don't like Vin Diesl. I don't understand a word coming out of his mouth.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Out of adversity comes triumph.\r\n\r\nFrom the Ashes is written and directed by James Erskine and narrated by Tom Hardy. It takes a look at the England v Australia Test Cricket Series in 1981.\r\n\r\n\"I think I'll bring the Gorilla on at the far end\"\r\n\r\nFrom the Ashes is essential viewing for cricket fans, whoever they support in the world. It showcases not just the considerable talents of England's greatest all rounder, Ian Botham, but also why the game of cricket is so loved by those who stand proud to be counted as fans. The documentary, however, is not just concerned with the sport of cricket, it's very aware of the impact that a country's sports stars can have on the nation.\r\n\r\nBrearley was Botham's Spock to his Kirk.\r\n\r\nThe 1981 Ashes series was played to the backdrop of social discord as Thatcher's government oversaw strikes, riots and unemployment carnage. Britain was falling to its knees, and as the England cricket team, with their figurehead Botham misfiring and under fire in the press, fell behind to a cock-a-hoop Australia, apathy ruled and the crowds did dwindle. Leeds in mid July and England, the cricket team, were spiralling towards a certain defeat, but cometh the hour, cometh the men (Botham and Bob Willis), out of darkness comes light, the miracle of Headingly not only transformed a sporting series that England would amazingly win, it put the smile back on the faces of a working class Britain that had forgotten to do so.\r\n\r\nFull of insightful input by the key Australians of that series (characters supreme they be as well), Erskine is not all about flag waving for Britannia, in fact a post script on the next Ashes series ensures we know about how Australian captain Kim Hughes (a beautiful and correct batsman himself) also came out of that cricket darkness. There's anecdotes, rivalries and revelations aplenty, while a soundtrack boasting the likes of The Clash, Ten Pole Tudour, The Specials, The Police, New Order and Squeeze sets the tone perfectly. The sound mix and editing is top draw as well (love those sound bites of a dramatic cricket incident played to a photographic still that says it all), and Hardy's narration proves he is heir apparent to Brian Blessed's crown!\r\n\r\nMany other sports have participants these days that fail to realise just how their efforts can lift a nation, make them feel good in times of struggle, to play for what is on your chest and not what is in your wallet. From the Ashes at its core is about that, it's an ode to being all that you can be, to inspire, even if it happens to be only briefly. 9\/10","id":"5424b4e9c3a36808800045b7","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5424b4e9c3a36808800045b7","movie_id":69224}

However, after the vampire finally reveals himself so that Charlie\u2019s girlfriend and mother starts to believe him things starts to pick up pace a bit. Unfortunately a lot of the movie is still somewhat mediocre. There are the usual frustrating moments, which Hollywood seems to believe must be in every movie, where Charlie just stupidly stands and stares wasting time, drops his weapon etc. etc.\n\nThe special effects are okayish but never great.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"You spin me right round baby right round like a record baby.\r\n\r\nHee, no surprise to find great division among horror fanatics, whatever the film or franchise, hot debate - even furious anger - can be found. FD5 has unsurprisingly garnered mixed reactions, but even allowing for the fact that as an idea it's a series that can't get better, part 5 is a considerable step up from the very poor part 4. It also boasts a neat trick of the tail, where some ingenuity is used to bring the series full circle, with a glint in the eye and a bloody tongue in the cheek.\r\n\r\nOnce again the opening and closing credit sequences are superb, doffing its cap to what is undoubtedly a very popular horror franchise. The disaster that underpins the formula is one of the best to be staged, a mighty bridge collapse that terrifies and thrills in equal measure. Then of course it's same old same old, which you would think anyone venturing into watch would expect anyway. Acting is as usual mixed, but the deaths are up to the ingenious standard set throughout all the other films, and then a narrative twist at the finale arrives to seal the deal for a rollicking good time. We even get a welcome return of Tony Todd - Bonus! If it proves to be the final Final Destination then it's a fitting closure, because there is thought here. Anyone taking on another will have to come up with a whole new idea to appease the horror hordes.\r\n\r\nEnough Now. 7.5\/10","id":"55be240e9251413e490046ab","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/55be240e9251413e490046ab","movie_id":55779}
{"author":"Wuchak","content":"***One of the best of the franchise, if not THE best***\r\n\r\nThe first \"Final Destination\" movie in 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, an invisible spirit. A group of people, mostly youths, escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying the kids who cheated Death in various creative ways, usually an unlikely chain of events. The opening tragedy in the first film was a plane crash, in the second a highway pile-up, in the third a rollercoaster mishap, in the fourth a racetrack calamity. In this fifth and most recent film (2011) it\u2019s a spectacular bridge collapse and it\u2019s probably the best opening tragedy of the franchise.\r\n\r\nAll of the movies in the series tell the same basic story with different characters and minor nuances; all of them are of the same high quality of technical filmmaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on your preference for cast members and the death sequences (and the locations). Other than these factors they're all basically the same.\r\n\r\n\"Final Destination 5\" features Nicholas D'Agosto as the main protagonist with Emma Bell as his blonde girlfriend. Tom Cruise lookalike, Miles Fisher, is also on hand while Ellen Wroe plays the gymnast. Meanwhile Tony Todd returns as the creepy coroner who seems to know more about the situation than he should.\r\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s true that you know exactly how this film will play out if you've seen the first four installments, or any of them, there are some highlights beyond the females. For one, this movie has a superb score and soundtrack, at least on par with the previous installment. Aside from featuring the most thrilling opening tragedy, there are several creative death scenes involving a gymnast accident, an Asian spa, eye surgery, a factory mishap and a restaurant altercation. This entry also throws in a unique twist that I\u2019m not going to give away (but if you\u2019ve seen the trailer you already know what it is). There\u2019s an additional surprise at the end, which nicely wraps up the five-movie franchise.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 92 minutes and, like the first three films, was shot in the Vancouver area (the fourth film was shot in the East).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+","id":"5bef7d3c0e0a2626630288e3","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bef7d3c0e0a2626630288e3","movie_id":55779}

{"author":"Kenneth Axel Carlsson","content":"The russians have placed a mole within the Circus (who is the british intelligence service, by the way). George Smiley (Gary Oldman), having been fired from the Circus, has now been rehired (secretly) to find the mole. He assembles his small team and begins to look into the matters. The possibilities are plenty, Percy (Toby Jones), Esterhase (David Dencik), Roy Bland (Ciaran Hinds) and Bill Haydon (Colin Firth). His old friend, Control (John Hurt), even suspected George himself of being the mole.\r\n\r\nThis movie is directed by a personal favorite of mine, Tomas Alfredson, who also created the vampire movie, _Let the Right One In_ (Lad den rette komme ind), as well as the amazing, _Four Shades of Brown_ (fire nuancer af brun). He is a master of creating a dark and mysterious atmosphere, and does exactly that in this movie. The pace is slow, the music is scarce and the colours are old and faded, perfect for a spy movie such as this.\r\n\r\nWatching this movie is like watching a puzzle being carefully put together in front of you. It takes time to get it just right, and you have to look carefully at all the pieces. Good things takes time, and this movie understands that. The viewer has to watch carefully, because it constantly goes from the present and into the past. People who have died, are resurrected in the memories of the past, to help us construct the final image.\r\n\r\n_Last words... this movie will not appeal to everyone, it requires the viewer to be active, watch carefully, and to appreciate the slow narrative. I will gladly admit that I have tried watching this movie three times before I finally succeeded in watching all of it. I am not normally a fan of these sort of movies, but I can always appreciate spectacular acting, and the craftmanship of a truly great director, and so, this movie becomes so much more than just a spy movie. It becomes a movie about people living on the edge of a war, trying to survive, trying to find the one threat that might break down the wall and destroy the british empire._","id":"549c8224c3a3682f190043ba","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/549c8224c3a3682f190043ba","movie_id":49517}

{"author":"LastCaress1972","content":"Transformers: Dark of the Moon. 154 minutes long, so Wiki tells me (although whilst watching it it felt as though it flew by in a mere, ooh, fourteen hours or so?). 154 minutes. And I was lost, bored and checking my watch before the fourth minute. So I shall attempt to review a movie I have only just seen but about which I know almost nothing, and about which I care considerably less than that. The following will be far less a coherent review than a disjointed mess. Well, fine. Seems perfectly apt.\r\n\r\nSo, years ago, the old Autobot leader Sentinel Prime crashed into the moon along with some teleporter doowacky - made up of hundreds of \"pillars\" - that only he can control. The Decepticons swiped almost all the pillars but left Sentinel there. On a routine military... um... I'm not sure; Jolly Boy's Outing? Optimus Prime gets into a fracas with Decepticon Shockwave and finds a couple of these pillars. He then throws a strop 'cos the humans knew about this bit of Cybertron kit but never told him, but now they're more than happy to, I suppose. Um. So Optimus rocks up to the moon and finds Sentinel Prime and revives him. Turns out this is what the Decepticons wanted; only Optimus could revive him and only Sentinel can work the teleporter doowacky (the \"Bridge\"). So now they're after Sentinel. But OH NOES, Sentinel has decided that the Autobots are fighting a lost cause, so he's throwing in with the Decepticons anyway. Cue lots of deeply confusing and tedious \"Tranny-Slapping\" as I have just dubbed the Transformer skirmishes as Megatron, Sentinel and the baddies try to use the Bridge to... um, pull their faraway home of Cybertron to Earth? Or turn Earth into Cybertron? Or something.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Sam Witwicky* (Shia LaBeouf, even more punchable than usual, which by his standards is quite something) is not just a useless nerd this time around, he's also a whingeing **** who wants a) international acclaim and credit (other than the medal awarded him by the president of course!) for his part in saving the world twice even though nobody knows that that's what he's done, and b) a 40-hour job. Anything really; Trolley-dolly at Asda\/Walmart will be fine. Despite all this he seems to have effortlessly brushed off Megan Fox and continued to punch way, way above his weight with his new squeeze, Rosie DoubleBarrelled-Surname: English, impossibly attractive, permanently dressed for all occasions - work, play, sleep, dragging her ****hole across the carpet like a worm-ridden doggie - like a $200-an-hour prostitute, and, incredibly, at least 40% stupider even than Ms. Fox, who as we know is marginally less alert and responsive than a squeezed tube of Anusol. How does Sam fit in to the so-called \"plot\"? Who knows. Double-Barrelled's smarmy, supercar-distributing walking hard-on of a boss turns out to be a Decepticon bitch (Deceptibitch?), and... oh, Christ knows. Alls I DO know is that this time around, Frances McDormand and John Malkovich have joined John Turturro in shilling for dollars like a ****-flashing strumpet. \"Me so shaaaameless.\" \"Me overact LONG time!\" \"Me so shaaaameless.\" Sucky-f*cky, five million dollar?\r\n\r\nFrom the very first second to the very last, the whole thing is needlessly convoluted, comically unfeasible - even within its own logic, such as that is - and most crucially, lifeforce-sappingly dull. Just like the other two movies, and of course just like the Transformers themselves. At one point, maybe two-thirds in (or maybe seven weeks in, who knows?), the angsty, poignant strains of a generic rock ballad signalled the arrival of a \"sad\" scene. On-screen, people crouched and clasped their heads in anguish, weeping and hugging in amongst considerable swathes of burning scenery and unspecifiable wreckage. I'm not sure why this bit was to be considered sad or poignant; perhaps the entire cast simultaneously realised they were in a Transformers movie.\r\n\r\nAwful, awful. As bad as anything Bay has ever shat out during his spiteful, cynical, moviegoer-hating and barely-disguised subterfuge as a \"film director\".","id":"5207afb2760ee3630b248db5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5207afb2760ee3630b248db5","movie_id":38356}

I found this to be an excellent documentary following ordinary people trying to reach the summit.\r\n\r\nI was led to watch 40 Days at Base Camp by Amazon Prime video, with one of those \"Because you watched\" this scenarios. This is a  low key entry of the genre of Everest mountaineering films. I say low key because this its not follow famous or star mountaineers, and it doesn't rely upon a tragedy or scandal to hold its viewers.\r\n\r\nInstead the program follows a few groups of amateur climbers as they pursue their goal of reaching the top of Everest. One of the climbers was making the attempt despite, or perhaps because of, his condition of having an ostomy. A condition that I coincidentally share, so that made it a bit more interesting for me.\r\n\r\nThe program lasts under an hour, which doesn't seem long enough to present a full, well-rounded picture of the efforts of these climbers, but I felt that they did a great job of covering many issues involved in going for the summit, both from each team's perspective and for several individuals on those teams.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Berserker \u2013 Berserker.\r\n\r\n\r\nKevin Smith breaks away from his comedic roots to direct and write this religious\/political\/bigot baiter that lurches from Hostel type madness into a siege of the damned. Starring Melissa Leo, Michael Parks, John Goodman, Michael Angarano, Kerry Bishe and Nicholas Braun, story finds Parks heading up a Christian cult that lures horny youngsters to their place of worship on the promise of sex with an older woman. Of course once the lads get there it\u2019s not long before the truth of the lure is revealed and we are treated to hate spiel by sermon and some unpleasantness from the production code edition of the torture porn play book. \r\n\r\nRed State is an infuriating movie in many ways, but it is never dull and it always remains challenging, even if some of Smith\u2019s sermonising agendas lack cohesion entering the final third of the piece. In fact there are three tonal shifts that don\u2019t make an altogether appetising whole, Smith straining to bridge the gap between satire and horror \u2013 cum \u2013 thriller. And sadly the climax to all the damaged threads is very anti-climatic. On the major plus side is a cast doing fine work, headed by Goodman, Leo and Parks, the latter getting to play lead dog for a change. It\u2019s impressively shot by Dave Klein and Smith shows flickers of there being a good director in the mix. \r\n\r\nPoor box office and bad reviews upon release inevitably got it tarnished as a bad film.

{"author":"CRCulver","content":"The rise of the internet in the 1990s suddenly gave people the ability to talk and form communities about all kinds of weird niche hobbies and mysteries that, as isolated individuals, they previously had to muse over in silence. One of these, I remember, was the \"Toynbee Tiles\", linoleum squares left on the streets of Philadelphia over these years that contained the cryptic message \"Toynbee idea in Kubrick's 2001 Resurrect dead on planet Jupiter\". (It's an odd American analogue to the mysterious man in Australia who used to go around scrawling \"Eternity\" everywhere.) The Toynbee tile maker was obviously a nutter, but in spite of much speculation among enthusiasts who would upload photos of tile sightings and try to riddle out the message, his or her identity remained a mystery... until this 2011 documentary film.\r\n\r\nRESURRECT DEAD tracks the work of an investigative team of nerds as they put together the pieces of Toynbee sightings from the late 1970s to the present, ultimately identifying the tile maker with an overwhelming degree of accuracy. These are Justin Duerr, the main face of the film, along with Colin Smith and Steve Weinik. Justin Duerr strikes this viewer as hella autistic, and his consuming interest in collecting Toynbee tile information and social awkwardness fills every frame. (And am I the only one who thinks that his jerky mannerisms and obsession resemble cinema auteur Wes Anderson?) But Duerr is also an artist, and he's so curious about the Toynbee tile maker because he recognizes in the man, mentally ill though the tiler might be, a fellow artist and creative individual.\r\n\r\nThe Toynbee tiler wasn't just leaving tiles. For a time in the 1980s, he would drive around Philadelphia broadcasting his theories over pirate radio. In the middle portion of RESURRECT DEAD, the trio of investigators make contact with radio enthusiasts who prove to have had some limited contact with the tiler back in the day. As the film ends, they have traced the tile maker to a Philadelphia address that belongs to a paranoid recluse. He refuses to answer the door, but his neighbours provide key information, like the fact that his car has a hole in the floorboard, presumably to drop the tiles surreptitiously. The decision to name this recluse might upset some viewers, but besides that single knock on the door and a mailed letter, the filmmakers don't try to intrude on his life, and they decide to just let him be, basking in the satisfaction that they've solved the mystery.\r\n\r\nI was intrigued by the tiles when I first came across the Toynbee tile community on the early web, around 1995 or so, and though I was never an obsessive like these filmmakers, the idea of the Toynbee tiles remained in the back of my mind as a quirky mystery over the years. While I was happy to discover that everything is now clear, I was disappointed by this documentary film. Its 90-minute length has a lot of filler, like dumb slow-motion replays of the group looking stunned as they learn key facts. Justin Duerr's narration to the camera is chock-a-block with \"like\", \"uh...\", \"so...\", \"you know...\" -- could he have not thought more clearly what he was going to say for his own film?\r\n\r\nUltimately, I commend these investigators for their achievement, but anyone curious about the Toynbee tiles should just read the bare facts as laid out in 5 minutes' reading of press coverage of the investigation, or on everyone's favourite online encyclopedia. Sitting through an hour and a half of this doc just feels like wasted time.","id":"5b72ec2ac3a36818881ab322","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b72ec2ac3a36818881ab322","movie_id":54358}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"No splitting this Atom, it has got a rock solid heart.\r\n\r\nReal Steel is directed by Shawn Levy and collectively adapted to the screen by John Gatins, Dan Gilroy and Jeremy Leven from a Richard Matheson short story called Steel. It stars Hugh Jackman, Dakota Goyo, Evangeline Lilly, Anthony Mackie, Kevin Durand, Hope Davis and James Rebhorn. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Mauro Fiore.\r\n\r\nSet in the near future, robot boxing is a big crowd pulling sport. After a struggling robot operator is introduced to an 11-year-old son he has never known, they stumble upon a discarded robot at a junk yard....\r\n\r\nWe can all moan about the mimicry of an idea and the clich\u00e9s that dominate Real Steel, but you really got to hand it to the makers for what they have achieved. They have crafted a family film that's very much perfect in this day and age. The story is one that any adult Sylvester Stallone fan can acknowledge and appreciate, the human heartbeat pleasingly steady, while the premise of big colourful robots beating the crap out of each other delights youngsters and us adults who are still young at heart. Film pretty much does what any other film of this type does, lays on the syrup in the last quarter where second chances and family strife come thundering through the plotting. Undeniably it's hugely derivative, events are joystick operated to get an emotional response from a family audience, while product placement reins and the script often sags under the weight of unoriginality. But it does uplift the spirit and getting to the end is easy since it's so much berserker fun. Yes it's the robot Atom, the people's champion, yes it's David vS Goliath and yes! It's Balboa vS Creed. Nothing wrong with that really.\r\n\r\nThe cast don't really have to offer up much beyond being adequate within the context of the material, though a muscular Jackman finds good paternal chemistry with young Goyo. In fact Goyo is pleasingly not annoying, always a bonus is that. Inevitably the robots are the stars, they're a triumph of design and visual effects and a sight for sore eyes, while Levy has a good handle on staging the fight sequences - even when cribbing from Balboa. The near future look is terrific as well, with Fiore's colour photography very appealing. Coining in over $290 million at the worldwide box office (over \u00a3180 million in profit), Real Steel found the family audience it was looking for, proving once again that there is a market for simple and effective popcorn carnage. It's not high art or intelligently scripted, but was anyone seriously thinking that was going to be the case here? If you want brains with this premise then seek out Twilight Zone episode \"Steel\", starring the excellent Lee Marvin, otherwise just sit back and enjoy the ride and let the botty bots and human interest raise the pulse and gladden the heart respectively. 7\/10\r\n\r\nHome format release is a sparkling print, extras are annoyingly short but the blooper reel is fun, we get a stunt deconstruction, and we learn about the influence a certain Mr. Spielberg had on the production.","id":"5d42d1b795c0af0014d9128d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d42d1b795c0af0014d9128d","movie_id":39254}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"The Council Estate Western.\r\n\r\nWild Bill is directed by Dexter Fletcher who also co-writes the screenplay with Danny King. It stars Charlie Creed-Miles, Will Poulter, Liz White, Sammy Williams, Charlotte Spencer, Leo Gregory, Neil Maskell and Iwan Rheon. Music is by Christian Henson and cinematography by George Richmond.\r\n\r\nWild Bill Hayward (Creed-Miles) is just out of prison after serving eight years. Heading home he finds his two sons Dean (Poulter) and Jimmy (Williams) fending for themselves after their mother abandoned them. Bill hadn't planned on hanging around, but if he doesn't then the boys will be taken into care. More pressing is that the local drug runners have got young Jimmy working for them, Bill might just have to take his parental responsibilities to another level and justify his Wild reputation.\r\n\r\nSplendid piece of British grit and wit, Wild Bill follows in the traditions of films directed by British actors, who for their debut directing assignment impressed with the ability to grab the attention and no loosen the grip. Fletcher has done a bang up job here, managing to turn what could have been a standard dysfunctional family melodrama into something more meaningful, engaging and suspenseful.\r\n\r\nStory is set to the backdrop of working class London, where the building of the Olympic stadium serves as a beacon of hope in the distance, while our principal characters struggle through a world of grimy flats, empty pubs, dirty caf\u00e9s and drug infested council estates.\r\n\r\nThe narrative operates on two fronts, Bill (Miles superb) is trying to keep on the straight and narrow, as he candidly observes, if his dog craps on the pavement he will get 18 months back in prison! But as he tries to build a relationship with his two sons, especially the older and more colder Dean, circumstances are drawing him back into the violent world he desperately wants to leave behind. It's this angle that gives the film its suspense, as viewers we are wondering if Bill can achieve his goals, will he get a break, will the family become one unit?\r\n\r\nElsewhere the film operates as a coming of age story, where Dean has had to grow up real fast to look after his younger brother, even taking on employment at the age of 15 to provide for Jimmy and himself. Then there is matters of the heart, as he is strongly attracted to local girl Steph (Spencer), this aspect is very well handled by Fletcher, who gets the excellent Poulter to deftly portray those early nerves when Cupid starts to draw back its bow, the tentative fumblings of young love easily identifiable to us all.\r\n\r\nPic is full of familiar British faces, most of them just stopping by in cameos to lend friendly support to Fletcher's project. They all offer a reassuring presence to proceedings, adding further weight to what is damn fine debut picture. Sometimes violent, often heart warming and tender, and very laugh out loud funny, Wild Bill is a winner. 9\/10","id":"532cc9fb9251413a81000469","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/532cc9fb9251413a81000469","movie_id":86593}

{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"On IMDb, X-Men: First Class has garnered the highest rating of all films in the X-Men franchise so far. Given the fact that this film features only a few of the familiar characters of the previous films, portrayed by different, younger actors, and the complete absence of Wolverine, the (current) rating of 8.1 somewhat surprised me. That was before I had seen it...\r\n\r\nBeing a pretty big X-Men fan myself, I was excited to see this, regardless of plot or characters. However, I was also a little wary of what to expect, for the reasons stated above. I suspect that anybody reading this might feel the same way. But rest assured, any doubts were quickly dispelled no later than the opening scene. First Class starts off very well, with the exact same opening scene as the first X-Men, featuring a young Erik Lehnsherr being separated from his parents in a Nazi concentration camp. What follows after this familiar story is something completely new and particularly dark and brutal. I won't give away any important plot lines, but suffice it to say there won't be a single person left wondering why Magneto is so resentful of \"normal\" people. This event also sets the tone for the rest of the film, and, to a great extent, explains why First Class is such a success: this film is all about character. Whereas all the other films were mostly about cool superheroes and special effects, First Class is all about character development and the history of those who would later become Professor X and Magneto. This concept might have failed big time if it wasn't for the superb screenplay. I take my hat off to whoever managed to incorporate every little, but crucial, character and storyline and made it flow together so beautifully. Literally everything comes together in this film, everything you might have wondered (why is Xavier paralyzed?) is given a credible and fitting explanation. \r\n\r\nAnother real strength of FC is its cast. Everybody in this film is right where they should be. Kevin Bacon is the perfect villain (but we already knew that\u2026), James McAvoy not only looks, but sounds and moves like the young Charles Xavier would. Jennifer Lawrence is a convincing, young (and believe it or not, insecure) Mystique. All other characters are perfectly cast as well, humans and mutants alike. However, I feel that most credit is due to Michael Fassbender, an actor I am now ashamed to say I had never even heard of before. The way he portrays the 30-something Erik Lehnsherr\/Magneto is stunning. His entire physique, down to every little twitch in his face, truly captivates all the pain and agony Erik has had to endure throughout his life. It makes you sympathize with Magneto and understand why he is the way he is. Whereas the \"old\" Magneto was little more than a bitter old man who despised Homo sapiens for undisclosed reasons (with no discredit to Ian McKellen intended here), Michael Fassbender does something I thought was almost impossible in a superhero flick: he gives Magneto a soul.\r\n\r\nIn case I might have given the impression that X-Men: First Class is no more than some wishy-washy character drama, don't worry. There are plenty of awesome action sequences and special effects to keep the more adrenaline-pumped movie-goer satisfied. And before I forget: there are two small, but awesome cameo appearances which I know you will enjoy\u2026 \r\n\r\nFinally, a small note on parental guidance: I was absolutely baffled to see that half of the audience consisted of parents with small children. Like I said before, this is not just another cool superhero movie. X-Men: First Class features elements which are quite dark and graphic, and especially the scenes portraying Nazi brutality are not intended for a young audience. Personally, I would say 14 is the appropriate minimum age. \r\n\r\nWith all that said, I would recommend this film to anyone, even to those of you who aren't X-Men fans. It doesn't happen very often that I can't find a single flaw in a film, but I guess this is just one of those rare cases. Great directing, great acting, great everything. Period.\r\n_(July 2011)_","id":"58ac565ac3a36849ea0134ec","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ac565ac3a36849ea0134ec","movie_id":49538}

The human characters are only shown in silhouette while the backgrounds can be quite colorful.\r\n\r\nThe fairy tales themselves are rather enjoyable and memorable. They could (mostly) be told to your children at bedtime or around a campfire. Despite only seeing silhouettes, you are still drawn into the story. My only complaint is that there was no proper ending to the film at large involving the 3 people developing each story. Instead the film ends with the final fairy tale, albeit during the credits they try to explain a supposed flaw in the last story.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see this (French) film in the United States, it is available for purchase or rent through all the major streaming retailers.

{"author":"furious_iz","content":"A slow burn of a film about the reality of love, marriage, insecurity and the grass being greener on the other side of the fence.\r\n\r\nWritten and directed by Sarah Polley, this film tells the story of Margot, an ostensibly happily married woman who's eye begins to wander when she meets the charming artist\/rikshaw driver across the street.\r\n\r\nMargot is excellently played by Michelle Williams.  She is an interesting mix of quietly confident, insecure, unfulfilled dreamer who doesn't know what she wants from her life.  Her husband Lou is played by Seth Rogen in an understated dramatic performance, even if his character is a little thin and 2 dimensional at times.  The new love interest Daniel is played by Luke Kirby, and he's kind of the male version of the manic pixie dream girl, except he's all confidence, charm, smouldering intensity and artistic earthiness.  Just don't ask how he can pay his rent pulling rikshaws for a living.  He's an unrealistic dream character that is there to serve as a distraction and make Margot question her marriage.\r\n\r\nThe film really is all about Margot, and she is great character.  She really feels like an actual person, slightly annoying at times, well intentioned, good at embarrassing herself and generally not able to cope with a life that lacks any purpose.  Her relationship with Lou feels real when dealing with the minutiae of day to day life.  They have silly couple games and favourite ways of annoying each other.  Sadly Lou's obtuse nature doesn't feel realistic all of the time.  Margot is needy and Lou doesn't know how to deal with that neediness, so he just focuses on the task at hand.  They've been married for 5 years, and it can't be just now that Margot's neediness has surfaced, so his inability to even connect with her or console her is one of the few parts of the film that feels unrealistic.  Maybe we're supposed to think this neediness is a new thing that has sprung up since Margot has become tempted, but that doesn't ring true to me.\r\n\r\nThe other true star of this film is the city of Toronto.  Polley makes it look vibrant and colourful and a place I would like to see for myself.\r\n\r\nThis film isn't for everyone.  It has some shortcomings that can't be ignored, and some of the subject matter might irritate people.  But where it fails a bit on an intellectual level it makes up for on an emotional level and an artistic level.  It really is a beautifully shot film, that deserves a watch if you enjoy romantic dramas.\r\n\r\n7\/10","id":"5a6f93469251413757003480","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a6f93469251413757003480","movie_id":86555}

{"author":"LastCaress1972","content":"Finally got around to The Cabin in the Woods. 8\/10, great fun. A Joss Whedon-(co)written (also co-written and directed by Drew Goddard, who wrote Cloverfield) take on an old horror staple in which 5 stereotypical teenagers (an academic, a jock, a stoner, a slut and a \"nice\" girl) venture out into the woods for a dirty weekend. It's no spoiler to say that these unfortunate young na\u00effs appear to have been cherry-picked and are being heavily monitored all the way into the woods by some very (very) high-tech manner of... what? Government agency? It's with these fellows that we visit first, before we ever meet our protagonists; two middle-aged, white collar I.T. types, a little brow-beaten by what appears to be a fairly monotonous job (although it really ****ing isn't) but full of typical office cameraderie and essentially confident in their own competence and that of the numerous other departments that make up this rather large-scale operation. Whoever is watching our heroes\/heroines, they're big-time. So, what's happening? To say more would be to start giving things away, but those kids are very deliberate archetypes, placed in a very deliberately typical horror scenario. Because it's an American film set in America, it's called The Cabin in the Woods as is befitting the conventions of God-knows-how-many American horror flicks. Were it a J-Horror set in Tokyo, it would be called The Freaky Long-Haired Schoolgirl Ghost, an assertion ably illustrated in the film itself to great and rather humourous effect.\r\n\r\nDecent performances all-round, even the deliberately irritating characters are kind-of likeable. A pre-Thor Chris Hemsworth is particularly good as is Richard Jenkins (Nathaniel \"The Dead Patriarch\" Fisher from Six Feet Under). It threw me a bit, this film, because in purposely not looking too deeply at what it was about prior to seeing it, I mistakenly thought I was about to watch a seriously scary and effective horror, and this isn't the case at all. It's a slick product with what looks like a decent budget as you'd expect from a Joss Whedon project (in case you've been under a rock somewhere, he of Buffy\/Angel and latterly of The Avengers fame) and it's loaded with nods to other horror literary and cinematic classics (The Evil Dead, Hellraiser, The Strangers and HP Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos are all fairly explicitly referenced), but it's not especially gory, it's intentionally funny more often than it's intentionally scary and it's a real thrill-ride, a slice of fun. It's not quite there, but it's a damn site closer to \"Horror-Comedy\" than it is to balls-out \"Horror\". It's not perfect by a long way - it instills bags of concerned curiosity in the viewer, but provokes almost zero real tension whatsoever. And late-on a special effects extravaganza treads clumsily into Night at the Museum-for-grown-ups territory. But it remains a great way to spend a couple of hours.","id":"5207b394760ee3630522e11f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5207b394760ee3630522e11f","movie_id":22970}

{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"I just watched The Help, almost immediately after finishing the book. Now, when comparing The Film to The Book it was based on (generally speaking), one major rule of thumb almost always applies: The Book is better. The Help is no exception.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, with the novel still so fresh in the back of my mind, separating my mind from the book in order to enjoy the film was an almost impossible task. No matter how hard you try, you just can't quit comparing the two, nitpicking every detail and being frustrated with everything they changed. Nevertheless, I was still able to enjoy the film for what it was, though I am glad that I possessed full knowledge of the actual story.\r\n\r\nThe Help tells the story of black domestic servants in 1960's Jackson, Mississippi. It focuses on white Miss Eugenia 'Skeeter' Phelan, and her efforts to give a voice to black maids by writing their stories from their perspective and thus giving them an opportunity to be heard for the first time in their lives. Among the black women, Aibileen and Minny are the two key characters.\r\n\r\nSo let's just get the \"bad\" stuff out of the way. One of the elements in the novel that I enjoyed the most was the incredibly delicate bond of trust and understanding that builds up (over an extensive period of time) between Aibileen and Skeeter. It really does take Skeeter a long time before she finally wins Aibileen over and convinces her to share her deepest feelings with a white woman. In the film, this process felt rather rushed, like Aibileen just woke up the next morning and decided to do it. What bothers me about this is not just the fact that (oh, clich\u00e9) it was \"better\" in the book, but mostly because the film forgets to underline WHY it took so long. Not only is it much more clearly explained in writing that these black women face an incredible danger in divulging their true feelings about the white women they work for, the film also fails to capture the palpable tension and sense of urgency of the book. These women aren't just risking their jobs, they are risking their lives, AND the lives of their loved ones. They're in danger just for being seen talking to a white lady. I found this to be a rather big flaw of the film.\r\n\r\nThe film also lacks a lot of the character development I was hoping for. Quite a few character changes were made, so that in the film they all just kind of appear out of nowhere, and more or less seem to go about their business without \u2013 again \u2013 the big \"why\" of it all. One of the most underexposed characters was a woman named Celia Foote, who is a poor white trash girl who married way out of her league \u2013 and because of it, has to face the constant disgrace and condescension from the other stuck-up, \"sophisticated\" white ladies. Celia is just the sweetest, loveliest person in the entire story, and her relationship with her maid Minny is heart warming. The fact that they barely included this in the film is a real shame.\r\n\r\nOK \u2013 if I keep comparing the film to the book, this review will never reach its end. Obviously, there is a lot more I could (and certainly want to) say, but it's not really relevant to the effectiveness of this review. So, moving on.\r\n\r\nAt least they got the actors right! Each and every one of them was cast spot-on to their character. Emma Stone is wonderful as Skeeter \u2013capturing her youthful daring and naivet\u00e9 perfectly. There's also something about her voice and attitude that make it clear that this girl is different from her snooty bridge club peers. Viola Davis is the perfect Aibileen \u2013 all I kept thinking was, damn, she should have gotten that Oscar. Her performance is very moving and heartfelt. Octavia Spencer did actually win an Oscar for her role as Minny, and it was well deserved. She is exactly as I imagined Minny to be \u2013 sassy, smart-mouthed and with an attitude that could render any white woman speechless, even if it means losing her job a dozen times. Celia Foote is played by Jessica Chastain, and I fear I'm at risk of doubling over in superlatives to describe how perfect she was, so I'll just leave it at this.\r\n\r\nThe Evil Witch in this story is Hilly Holbrook, played by Bryce Dallas Howard. I'm not sure how big of a compliment it is to say that she is very good at playing a snide, cunning racist \u2013 so let's just say she is a very good actress. Another actress worth mentioning is Allison Janney, who plays the role of Skeeter's mother. Though she is not quite like I imagined her the way she was in the book (there we go again...), I always enjoy her performances very much and this one's no exception. Oh, and Sissy Spacek plays Hilly's mother, and she is a delight to watch. I got the feeling that the director extended her role to a little more than what it was in the book, just to give her more screen time. I don't blame him.\r\n\r\nOverall, the film is properly paced and reasonably well-constructed, though some creative liberties are taken here and there considering the timeline. In comparison to the book, it is a little disappointing, but I can't think of a single book-to-film adaptation where this wasn't the case.\r\n\r\nI still rate The Help 8 out of 10, because I think it is an important story to be told and the performances are stellar, but if you have a little more patience, I strongly recommend reading the book instead.\r\n_(March 2013)_","id":"58ac50f49251415900014d1d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ac50f49251415900014d1d","movie_id":50014}

I had read a few of the magazines as a kid and I think I might even have had a Green Hornet toy car. A masked hero with a martial arts expert and mechanical genius as his side kick and a really cool car. Not one of those ridiculous wimpy ones but a real old-fashioned American car having a large V8 engine with the proper sound and everything. So what could go wrong?\r\n\r\nWell a lot! Half way through the movie I was wondering how bloody stupid the producer really thought the audience was. The bad guy was a total joke. Completely wacko in a very stupid way. Not fun at all. But the worst thing was that the hero, played by Seth Rogen, was even more stupid. He was nothing but a dumbass, loudmouthed, idiot throughout the entire movie. Even when he wasn\u2019t directly screwing up just the fact that he was in the scene and opened his mouth was enough to ruin it.\r\n\r\nAnd what about these ridiculous slow motion scenes with the targets flashing red just before some action taking place? The guys where not supposed to have real superpowers so stop making it look like they had for Christ sake! Seth Rogen had a part in writing the script as well and that was probably a huge mistake. Scripts should be left to professionals and not wannabe comedians.","id":"5a75ec4e925141059c03394b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a75ec4e925141059c03394b","movie_id":40805}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"There's no place on earth people understand loneliness better than here.\r\n\r\nThe Awakening is directed by Nick Murphy and Murphy co-writes the screenplay with Stephen Volk. It stars Rebecca Hall, Dominic West, Imelda Staunton, Isaac Hempstead Wright, Shaun Dooley and Joseph Mawle. Music is by Daniel Pemberton and cinematography by Eduard Grau.\r\n\r\nBritain, post World War 1, and Florence Cathcart (Hall) makes a living as an exposer of charlatan spiritualists, a debunker of ghost sightings. When she receives a request from school master Robert Mallory (West) to investigate the supernatural events at a remote boarding school for boys, she is suitably intrigued to take on the assignment...\r\n\r\nIt comes as no surprise to find that numerous reviews for The Awakening make reference to ghost story films that were made previously. The Woman in Black released a year later would suffer the same fate, charges of it not bringing nothing new to the table etc. A ghost story set in a big mansion or remote educational\/correctional establishment is what it is, and will continue to be so, all fans of such spooky fare ask is that it does it well and maybe add some adult themes into the bargain. The Awakening does these in spades.\r\n\r\nThe concept of a disbeliever in ghosts having their belief system tested to the full is not new, but it's a great concept and one with longevity assured. Here, boosted by a terrific performance from Hall, the screenplay consistently keeps you guessing. The possibilities of real or faked are constant as the director pumps up the creep factor, whilst he simultaneously crafts a number of genuine shock sequences - including one of the best doll house scenes put to film! This really has all the requisite jolts and atmospheric creeps for a period spooker.\r\n\r\nIt's not until the final quarter when the screenplay begins to unravel its mystery, a finale that has proved both ambiguous and divisive. The ambiguity factor is a little baffling since everything is made clear in a nicely staged scene, and this is something which the director has gone on record to state as well. As for the divisive side of things? That's a blight for this sub-genre of horror. It's convoluted! Contrived! It has been done before they cry! These are true to be sure, and without doubt there's a leap of faith required to not get annoyed, but it garners a reaction and has done its ghost story essence very well indeed.\r\n\r\nBeautifully photographed, scored and performed by the leads to boot, this is for sure one for fans of period spookers with brains. 7.5\/10","id":"561b68e79251415a670002f5","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/561b68e79251415a670002f5","movie_id":77949}

Is it showcasing some nifty set pieces, some nifty set design and some bonkers escapism? Well the answer is yes to all of those.

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"The Mechanic is unable to fix its mechanically mundane plot. \u201cAmat Victoria Curran - Victory Loves Preparation\u201d. Foreshadowing words engraved on the glossy barrel of Sutherland\u2019s powerful pistol. Euphemism aside, West presents a remake of the Bronson-led action thriller that coincidentally features no vehicle mendings. That\u2019s because, for those of you who aren\u2019t subjugated to criminal organisations (hopefully all of you...), \u201cmechanic\u201d is slang for hitman. Despite Statham being bald and able to glue a fake tattoo of a barcode on that shiny cranium for a \u201cpropa laugh!\u201d, unfortunately West was unable to title the feature \u201cHitman\u201d. And so, he grabbed a wrench and proceeded into remake territory.\r\n\r\nFor what it\u2019s worth, this is one of his more moderately tolerable features from the past decade. \u201cMechanic\u201d Arthur Bishop is assigned the task of assassinating his mentor, subsequently taking his troubled son into training as a well-intentioned gesture. Naturally, Statham is slaying men in his wake with any object his eyes glisten towards, most notably a suitcase handle in this one. It\u2019s clumsily edited, instantly forgettable and rarely hones in on the \u201cmaking hits look like accidents\u201d speciality. Expositional narration throughout, one or two plot twists that uphold no kinetic energy whatsoever and an incredible waste of Sutherland. Not to mention another \u201cmechanic\u201d having a weakness to young boys and small dogs. The two just don\u2019t relate.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the film works when it\u2019s divulging into the life of McKenna\u2019s self-tortured son Steve, portrayed by the enigmatic, under-appreciated and consistent Foster. A reckless individual succumbed to illegal substances and a sleazy lifestyle to suppress his negligent upbringing. Undergoing cathartic vengeance in a bid to soothe the soul. His internal suffering forces his character to be the human component in what is otherwise a mechanical action thriller, packed full of explosions and rapid gunfire. It\u2019s a battle of professionalism between the experienced Arthur and the inexperienced Steve, making for a surprisingly well-executed duel of wits.\r\n\r\nThe actual assassinations themselves were simple, although somewhat unimaginative, yet realistic. A few questionable moments, including a dumbfounded man glancing over at the tiniest of nuts (calm your mind...) that fell out of a grating, but nothing too outlandish. The utilisation of Schubert\u2019s legendary piece Trio No. 2 in E-flat Major was revelatory, I must confess.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, The Mechanic is your standard Statham affair. Powered by a sensational supporting performance but weighed down by a mundane plot. Functional if immediately forgettable.","id":"5e206c56f04d0100150fd20d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e206c56f04d0100150fd20d","movie_id":27582}

This is the reason I was not interested in this. Usually biopics are made to inspire the viewers, but there are negative films as well and this is one of those. Actually, it was not about the Saddam or his politics or his family, except Uday. So it was told from the perspective of Latif. How he suffered and fought back was the film focused on.\r\n\r\nAfter watching it so delay, I think I was wrong about it. The film is for adults, but the thing is it reveals lots of dark secrets of Uday's lifestyle. Sadly the film did not cover much of the Saddam Hussein's events. The Kiwi filmmaker did his best. Dominic Cooper's performance in the dual role was the highlight. That should be the reason to watch this, because you know like me, people are turning it away once they read whose story is this.

{"author":"photodd","content":"A new documentary about childhood immunizations, \u201cThe Greater Good,\u201d could intensify debate around the potential dangers of vaccines. The film, which premiered Saturday at the Dallas International Film Festival, aims to create \u201ca rational discussion\u201d about vaccine safety, according to producer and co-director Chris Pilaro, who worked previously as a producer on such Sundance documentaries as \u201cBlue Vinyl\u201d and \u201cEverything\u2019s Cool.\u201d\r\n\r\nPilaro immediately rejects the notion that \u201cThe Greater Good\u201d might be labeled \u201canti-vaccine.\u201d \u201cThe media has said that if you \u2018question\u2019 [the current status quo] you are anti-vaccine. But all of the doctors, researchers and scientists in our film are pro-vaccine. You should not be considered anti-vaccine to question the safety of any pharmaceutical product.\u201d\r\n\r\nMany experts have debunked some of the questions about vaccine safety. Early this year, an article and editorial published in the British Medical Journal said that an influential but now-discredited study that provoked fears around the globe that childhood vaccinations caused autism was based largely on falsified data.\r\n\r\nThe film includes interviews with strong current vaccine advocates, such as Dr. Paul Offit (Director of the Vaccine Education Center at The Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia), Dr. Norman W. Baylor (Director of the FDA\u2019s Office of Vaccines Research and Review), and Dr. Melinda Wharton (Deputy Director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases).\r\n\r\nBut their voices are far outnumbered by those calling for further oversight of vaccinations, such as Dr. Bob Sears (author of \u201cThe Vaccine Book\u201d), and Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center, as well as families who claim to be victims of vaccine injuries. The film focuses on three such emotional stories: of a teenage girl whose life deteriorated after taking the HPV vaccine; a boy who developed autism subsequent to being vaccinated; and a family whose infant died shortly after being vaccinated.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe feel we have given voice to a population that isn\u2019t regularly represented in the media,\u201d says Pilaro, defending the choice of subjects. \u201cWe also did contact a number of families with children who had been injured by vaccine-preventable diseases, but none of them would film with us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe goal was not to scare people away from vaccinations,\u201d Pilaro continues. \u201cWe need to have the ability to ask these hard questions without being shunned.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Greater Good\u201d is currently seeking a deal for broadcast or theatrical distribution. It plays next at the Arizona International Film Festival on April 12.\r\n\r\nBy Anthony Kaufman\r\n\r\nThe Wall Street Journal.","id":"4ff15dce19c29519b6005529","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/4ff15dce19c29519b6005529","movie_id":117876}

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"When Jason Statham is good he is very good. In this movie I think he is very good as the silent, deadly killer for hire. It is a straightforward killer\/action\/thriller. The story is nothing new but it is a well working story which is nicely executed.\r\n\r\nThe story is, as I wrote above, not very original. Killer for hire finds out that his next target is his mentor and friend. As the professional he is he executes the job anyway but later discoverers that not all is as is should be. Time for revenge. A simple, straightforward and well working story.\r\n\r\nThings are complicated a bit by Bishop taking his friend\u2019s son under his wings. Of course he wants to walk in his fathers footsteps. He is inexperienced but also undisciplined. Something that, not surprisingly, is causing problems.\r\n\r\nI do like that Bishop stays a no bullshit hardass killer throughout the entire movie. No whining or silly emotional outbreaks or breakdowns. I also like the unemotional, silent and deadly impression of a professional assassin the he radiates.\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few fairly well done action scenes in the movie ranging from silent assassinations to the obligatory blow things up scenes. The parts where Bishop and Steves goes after the big bad guy is quite well done with some quite cool stunts without being over the top.\r\n\r\nThe ending was probably the only thing in the movie that was a bit unexpected. Unexpected in a good way that is. I quite liked the little surprise there.\r\n\r\nOverall I as well as my son liked this movie quite a lot.

{"author":"Sheldon Nylander","content":"\"The Call of Cthulhu\" by the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society was an absolutely sublime film. Making it a black-and-white silent film to appear as though it were made in the '20s-'30s was a stroke of genius, and the film stays very close to the source material without being boring. So when it was announced that they were doing a follow-up film, adapting Lovecraft \"The Whisperer in Darkness,\" I was beside myself with joy to the point of being giddy.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" fails to live up to the high water mark left by \"The Call of Cthulhu.\" Instead of a silent film, this one is done more in the style of a '50s black-and-white horror film. While I don't take issue with the style they chose, they still make some very odd choices that left me feeling a little cold and at times saying, \"Huh?\"\r\n\r\nSo, where does the problem arise? I started to wonder if I remembered the original story correctly. Then realized that I had. They not only make adjustments to the story, but treat the story as only acts one and two, creating a completely original third act. While I understand the adaptation aspect of movies and am more tolerant than many seem to be because I understand that a direct one-to-one translation of most literary works to the screen would, well, suck, the change in tone in the third act is enough to give the audience whiplash. The final act goes straight into traditional horror and action that seems like something more out of the Call of Cthulhu RPG as opposed to the slow-burning weird fiction of the unknowable that Lovecraft is most well known for.\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with one of the most inconsistent movies I've seen in recent memory. The tonal change is so drastic that it's clear the different parts of the film were written in two completely disparate time periods. As such, this film is kind of a let down after \"The Call of Cthulhu.\" I strongly recommend seeing that one over \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" and only recommend this one for hardcore Lovecraft fans.","id":"5dcbd2a4e263bb00136fff19","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5dcbd2a4e263bb00136fff19","movie_id":87178}

The Dead Inside is a complex story of a young couple going through seemingly normal problems until the problems become surreal and supernatural . Often the hallmark of a great film is it's ability to blur the lines of classification. The problem is, in this film they aren't very blurry. It is, at times, a musical, at others a horror, sometimes a comedy and a serious drama at others. Where it goes wrong is it seems to delve too far into each area for too long making it confusing as to what the overall feeling the audience is supposed to have. I noticed the director was also the editor and I think that may be what is the biggest problem with this film. It just starts to drag on and on. The musical scenes are pretty good and the dialouge is good too, it's the seemingly endless scenes of people sitting and staring into the mirror or at the computer or at nothing. Good to great music, nice camera work (but has a very video look at times), good script, good lyrics and good acting (though not the best singing voices) just needs some serious editing.","id":"511eda69760ee35c1c035d58","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/511eda69760ee35c1c035d58","movie_id":145099}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**An ordinary cop, enjoying his single life, gets into a real cop business!**\r\n\r\nI won't say it is an overrated film, but it simply did not work for me. The same director who had made 'Calvary' directed this one as well with Brendon Gleeson in the lead, but that was an earlier project to this one. I loved that film, not this one, though I consider it an average, because I did not find it bad. The theme was very familiar, and too much wasted scenes with the slow narration spoiled my mood. There's no clear perspective of the storytelling, just it concentrated on a small town cop and his single life, and rarely he fights the crime.\r\n\r\nWhen an FBI agent comes looking for some international drug dealers, a cop in a small Irish town braced to assist the American officer. Though he never cared to involve in it. He follows his usual lifestyle, enjoying every moment of his life. After a woman comes asking to find his cop husband gone missing, he now gets into the action. How serious he makes progress in the case and its result is the rest of the film to disclose.\r\n\r\nIt's not as funny as I anticipated. But watchable film for its quality narration. The actors were just okay. The characters were really weak, particularly the villains. They occasionally appear and gone for forever, and then there comes the final battle. Did not sync well between them and the cop, especially what they were fighting for, other than they are. Especially the FBI agent played by Don Cheadle casting was worthless. For a fine theme like this, the plot should have developed with at least a couple of twists and maybe a grand action sequence. It does not matter though, at least engaging plot needed, but failed on that part. Sorry to say that I'm not in favour of it to suggest it to anybody, though you might it better than me.\r\n\r\n_5\/10_","id":"5835de39925141691b01a90b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5835de39925141691b01a90b","movie_id":67913}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Hvem g\u00e5r det?\r\n\r\nThe Thing is directed by Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. and adapted to screenplay by Eric Heisserer. It's based on the novel \"Who Goes There?\" by John W. Campbell and is a prequel to \"John Carpenter's The Thing\" from 1982. It stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Joel Edgerton, Ulrich Thomsen, Eric Christian Olsen and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Music is by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Michel Abramowicz.\r\n\r\nAntartica, 1982, and scientist Kate Lloyd is requested to investigate something strange at a Norwegian base station. By accident the Norwegians have discovered what appears to be an alien craft frozen beneath the ice. Their thoughts prove to be correct and they are rightly celebrating a magnificent discovery, particularly as there appears to also be a frozen being in the ice. But it's not long before everyone at the base begins to regret unearthing the being...\r\n\r\nNo serious John Carpenter fan wanted this film, it wasn't needed or required. His 1982 film is an awesome slice of sci-fi horror, a remake itself of a very good film, \"The Thing from Another World\" (Howard Hawks 1951), Carpenter flipped the scenario around from Hawks' movie to great effect. Paranoia and creeping dread blended with amazing beasties to make for what many feel is one of the ultimate sci-fi horror movies going. So why remake it then? Well, we are told by Heijningen Jr and his team that this is a prequel to Carpenter's movie, asking the big questions such as just what happened at the Norwegian base station before Kurt Russell's manly mob got there? Making this a sort of filling in the blanks session. Not a bad idea at all is that, something good to work from, even if we know from the beginning of Carpenter's movie just how many Norwegian's survived!\r\n\r\nNow the problem here is that it may be a prequel, and attention to detail in scenes linking both films together is rather ace, but it's devoid of freshness, the makers pretty much following the exact same formula of Carpenter's film. Cue a group of scientist types getting spooked by something ghastly stalking them, cue one by one them getting offed in grizzly ways by an assimilating menace and cue paranoia and suspicion. They even put in the test sequence from 82, only with a metal slant instead of blood, while the creatures are the same only bigger in body horror terms and budget. Instead of Kurt Russell's mighty machismo, we get Winstead's spunky lady (she's the one without the face fuzz here), but it's the same old same old routine, only for the \"Scott Pilgrim\" crowd. When all is said and done, this is pretty much a remake of a far far better film.\r\n\r\nYet for all that is annoying and unadventurous about it, it's still a bunch of fun, the director is capable in having us wonder what is around the corner, utilising the cramped interiors for maximum fret. The various creatures born out of the Thing itself are monstrous, especially the two headed one which we see horrifically birthed, and even though the CGI is there, with some of it poor, much of it is blended with practical work and the human actors to stop it from being \"all\" about the effects. It's also nice to report that there is undeniably love and respect for the 82 cut. Leading cast performances are efficient, but Winstead is just too young and looks out of place, she does not, however, fail for lack of effort to make her thinly written part work. Bonus is the Norwegian actors adding some intense character dynamics to the plotting. Beltrami's score nods appreciatively to Morricone's original, and on Blu-ray Abramowicz's steely coloured photography really pings out of the screen.\r\n\r\nIn an alternative universe where there is no John Carpenter film, this would be a well regarded entry into the creature feature stable. With enough shocks and squirmy screams delivered for the genre eager crowd. But unless you are someone who hasn't seen Carpenter's superior movie, then this will feel like a shallow imitation, just like, ironically enough, one of The Thing's assimilated humans. A generous 7\/10 from me because I did have fun watching in the privacy of my own home with the lights off. Other Carpenter fans, though, are most likely to start rating from my 7 and work backwards I feel...","id":"5d929a9fc0348b002c3f6f73","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d929a9fc0348b002c3f6f73","movie_id":60935}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Generic Cat and Mouse Thriller.\r\n \r\nWhen young doctor Juliet Dermer (Hilary Swank) moves into a spacious New York apartment, she can\u2019t believe her luck. More so as she is attracted to her landlord, Max (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). However, something isn\u2019t quite right with the apartment and Juliet soon comes to regret having ever moved in.\r\n \r\nThere has been a number of similar thrillers over the years, the type where a humble home is turned into a nightmare by the presence of some psychopath. The Resident, in spite of some lovely technical touches, sits comfortably on auto-pilot and hopes that is enough to seal the thriller deal. Sadly it isn\u2019t!\r\n \r\nDirector Antii Jokinen and his co-writers Robert Orr and Erin Cressida Wilson have forgot to add twists and shocks to their picture. Things are further compounded by the fact that Morgan\u2019s villain (it\u2019s signposted a mile away) is about as scary as a puppy letting out its first bark.\r\n \r\nSwank gives it a good go as the woman in peril, while Christopher Lee is a reassuring presence even if he is utterly set up as a token character. The sexual violation angle feels like a lame attempt to put some horror into a standard thriller set up, while the script is wooden and kills what chance of suspense there briefly was.\r\n \r\nSome impressive cinematography and camera techniques keep it interesting to the eyes at least, but this is a waste of acting talent and a waste of time for those looking for something to chill the blood.

{"author":"Gimly","content":"**A long format review from 2011**\r\n\r\nSo, Thor has only been out for a week and a half, and already it\u2019s grossed $100 million! Pretty fucking good considering it hasn\u2019t even been released in America yet, where like, every movie ever makes most of its money. As you may have guessed, yes, I did finally get around to seeing le Thor, hence the delay in my review of The Incredible Hulk. But know what? Fuck you man! I just watched fucking Thor!!\r\n\r\nSo in case you couldn\u2019t guess, I was rather damn impressed with it all. Why? Well boys and girls, strap your tolerance boots on, this one could get long.\r\n\r\nThe Computer Graphics were some of the best I\u2019ve ever seen. Now I\u2019m not one to believe that CGI is the sort of thing that could make or break a film, but having it be this fantastic goes quite a ways to helping out. I also was unfortunate in my having to watch it in 3D, and yet it was worth it. This is a pretty big statement from me. I despise 3D\u2026 I even walked out of the cinema not feeling nauseous. A tad headache-y sure, but that was it. So congrats Thor.\r\n\r\nThe comic relief was powerful. In that \u201cfunny but not silly\u201d kind of way. I mean, it\u2019s all a bit silly, but it would have been so easy to fall into the cheesy trap with this film. The writing team and director Kenneth Branagh (The Boat that Rocked, Sleuth, Hamlet) did a fantastic job of keeping the audience engaged  and not descending too far into shameless, lame, self-parody.\r\n\r\nThe characters of the film were written almost as strongly as they were in Iron Man 1 & 2, not quite, but they did have quite a number more to work through, so they couldn\u2019t work with everyone as well as they did with Tony Stark and Pepper Potts. They also managed to totally pull off an American movie with romance and comedy, in a way that totally avoided those awful American Romantic Comedies (my least favourite genre in the history of ever).\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s this whole thing where Thor comes from another world. Which was after all really the only way you could bring a God into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has been so grounded in reality. And I\u2019ll tell you, Asgard (Thor\u2019s home planet) was fucking great. They pulled off this crazy similarities in appearance between family members on Asgard, despite the fact that none of the actors are related. You may disagree with me on inspection of posters and whatnot, but after seeing the movie, you\u2019ll get what I mean. Also the actors they got to play the younger Loki and Thor were eerily believable. Like, to an actually kind of scary point. I wonder if any of it was fake\u2026 The Frost Giant homeworld of Jotunheim is also visually stunning.\r\n\r\nThe sound effects were very confronting. I couldn\u2019t really figure out if I though this was a good or a bad thing\u2026 It\u2019ll be interesting to rewatch on DVD, and see if it was only so crazy because of the speakers in the theatre. Thor may have lacked the wholeness as a film felt by Iron Man 1 & 2, or The Incredible Hulk, but it was perfect as a lead up to The Avengers, which, now that it\u2019s all set in stone, is really kind of needed. With Thor more than the other heroes it\u2019s the most important, because there was really no way to humanise that sort of character, he\u2019s just so outlandish that you really need an entire film just to ground him in this world they\u2019re developing.\r\n\r\nBut all of the things I\u2019ve had to say about the film were basically leading up to this one big thing; the cast! The cast was incredible, not only did they manage to snag a total of THREE of my favourite underrated actors ever, one of them just so happened to my favourite actor in the whole wide world, Ray Stevenson!\r\n\r\nWe have Australian (fuck yes Australia!) Chris Hemsworth (Home and Away [Hey! We all have to start somewhere, right?], A Perfect Getaway, Ca$h, Cabin in the Woods) playing Thor, Natalie Portman (Black Swan, V For Vendetta) playing Thor\u2019s love interest; Jane Foster (lots of people have started having a problem with Natalie Portman nowadays, but I still love her), Anthony Hopkins (The Rite, The Wolfman, Beowulf, Red Dragon, Hannibal, The Silence of the Lambs [Yes, this is the same guy who played Hannibal Lecter. I fucking know, right!?] Bram Stroker\u2019s Dracula) as Thor\u2019s father; Odin, Stellan Skarsgard (King Arthur, Exorcist: The Beginning, Beowulf & Grendel, the Pirates of the Caribbean series, Angels & Demons) as Dr. Erik Selvig; Jane Foster\u2019s mentor, Ray Stevenson (Rome, King Arthur, Outpost, Punisher: War Zone, The Book of Eli) as Thor\u2019s friend, and member of the Warriors Three (above); Volstagg, Jeremy Renner (S.W.A.T., The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, 28 Weeks Later, The Hurt Locker, The Town) as Hawkeye; the S.H.I.E.L.D. sharpshooter, and Samuel L. Jackson (The Exorcist III, Jurassic Park, Jackie Brown, Shaft, Pulp Fiction, the Star Wars prequel trilogy, S.W.A.T., Snakes on a Plane, 1408,  Cleaner, The Spirit, Inglourious Basterds) as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director; General Nick Fury\u2026 And those are just the actors I already adore.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve now also grown quite attached to Tom Hiddleston (Wallander) who plays Loki, Thor\u2019s brother, and the main antagonist, as well as Joshua Dallas (Doctor Who and The Descent Part II) who plays another of the Warriors Three (above), and Kat Dennings (Nick and Norah\u2019s Infinite Playlist and Defendor) who plays D\u2019arcy Lewis; Jane Foster\u2019s friend and colleague.\r\n\r\nAs I always like to say, I watched this film in a theatre (Belcompton, shit, uh, Belconnen, Hoyts to be specific). I really think this film has lasting value, but it\u2019s important to note that I almost always feel a film is enhanced when watched on the big screen, especially with Action films, effects films, epic films and franchise films. Thor happens to be all of those things. I was especially excited waiting for the post-credits scene to come up in that huge cinema. So please take into consideration that I reviewed this on the silver screen, if you happen to be watching it on DVD or BluRay or some such. Because you better of not fucking downloaded it!!

{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"I am amazed by how many people on IMDb that have given this movie 8, 9 and even 10 stars. It\u2019s perhaps not the worst movie I\u2019ve seen but it is in no way worth that kind of rating.\r\n\r\nThe good part of the movie is Liam Neeson who makes an enjoyable performance with the script that he was given. He is pretty much the reason that I gave it as much as 4 IMDb stars. The rest of the film is just plain wrong.\r\n\r\nMy first impression is, god this director likes film grain! Now this is a matter of taste of course but I don\u2019t like when movies have artificially been made to look like they were filmed on old and crappy film. It has its places but it didn\u2019t add anything here.\r\n\r\nThe film starts off with a plane crash which is not done very good. Neither in terms of special effects nor in terms of realism.\r\n\r\nThe lack of realism, unfortunately, continues throughout the movie. The behavior of the wolves is utterly unnatural and unrealistic. I can live with this if it\u2019s a horror movie or some other fantasy movie but this is not supposed to be that. The actual footage of the wolves is rather mediocre as well.\r\n\r\nThen there is this so called experienced hunter and \u201cwolf expert\u201d. Leaving the crash site is a dubious decision to say the least. Then we got the jumping of cliffs with a flimsy home made rope instead of just walking a bit further to get down not to mention making ammunition go off by poking wooden sticks at it, what the f\u2026? In addition the guy knows nothing about wolves, or any other wild animal for that matter.\r\n\r\nJust to add to this not so enjoyable experience, the film has an utterly lousy ending.","id":"5b3716209251413c6603809b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b3716209251413c6603809b","movie_id":75174}
{"author":"TheTenth","content":"3 couples : Raj (Bobby Deol) and Sanjana (Sonam Kapoor), Vikram (Irrfan Khan) and Shivani (Rimi Sen), Yogi (Sunil Shetty) and Maya (Celina Jaitly)lead peaceful lives, but Maya is suspicious of her husband having an affair. She decides to hire a private investigator to find the truth. She goes to Kishan, both successful, cunning and easily trusted. He soon finds that when Yogi is about to be discovered by his wife, both his friends come to the rescue, which targets them for investigation. Soon he understands that the three cheat on their wives. Saddened by Sanjana's deep grief, he decides to teach them a lesson.\r\n\r\nAnees Basmee is very well known for his Bollywood comedies, very often about marital problems, in the French tradition of French theater author Vaudeville (his name was used for the genre later). I usually only mildly like his movies, but this one is more cunning in making the cheating husbands ridiculous and guilty. The first part is more of Kishand trying to find proof of the guilt of the three, then it's more revenge of the wives for their husband's disloyalty.\r\n\r\nWhat's great in this one is that the wives are really more than angry shrews, they are really affected by the deception, and have their own reactions. The cast is doing a phenomenal job, Akshay as the cunning guy that gets moved by these cheated wives, the three friends trying to save the appearances by using stupid lies that put them in miserable situations, and the wives having very realistic emotions for the situation.\r\nYes, even \"playgirl\" Rimi Sen (never forgotten for her sexy role in Dhoom 1) is really great at acting her part. Stunning Celina is the sad friend that can get wild when necessary, and Sonam is the shy gentle girl that gets devastated by what happens.\r\nVery enjoyable movie.","id":"5a8d582c0e0a267c74006eef","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a8d582c0e0a267c74006eef","movie_id":61400}

Sure it\u2019s not a really bad movie but, personally, I found it only moderately good. I\u2019m not sure whether the movie was intended to be scary or funny or both. It wasn\u2019t very funny though and only moderately scary.\n\nIt has been presented as a not-your-usual-teenage-slasher-horror movie. Well, it sure has an interesting twist but\u2026it is still a teenage slasher horror movie. The twist could really have lifted the movie but unfortunately this good idea is pretty much wasted in a poor implementation.\n\nInstead of holding on to the surprise it\u2019s spoiled right away with that eagle flying in to the force field (since when did we learn to build force fields by the way?). Another thing that really drags down the film are these utter morons in the control room. If this was really a matter of survival of mankind then you would have thought that it would have been left to professional people and not these jerks.\n\nThe movie isn\u2019t all bad though. With the exception of these major flaws it does pass as a decent slasher\/horror movie and makes for a reasonably entertaining hour and a half of not too intelligent movie watching. The part nearing the end where all the monsters goes on a rampage is rather fun to watch. I was not very impressed by the end itself though.

{"author":"CRCulver","content":"Joshua Marston, best known as the director of drug mule story MARIA FULL OF GRACE, gives us here a poignant depiction of blood feuds in northern Albania. The script was cowritten by Andamion Murataj, the film was shot on location, and the actors are all Albanians, some of them amateurs, speaking the authentic Gheg dialect of their region.\r\n\r\nNik (Tristan Halilaj) is in his last year of high school and dreams of opening an internet\/computer game caf\u00e9 in his small town. His sister Rudina (Sindi Lacej) hopes to go on to university. Their dreams are dashed, however, when their father (Refet Abazi) kills a neighbour in a dispute over land. To avoid revenge attacks from the dead man's family, the males of the family are forced to stay inside their home at all times, a situation that could last for years while the community mediates the feud. With the father out of work, Rudina is forced to drop out of school, deliver a bread route, and buy contraband cigarettes to sell at a profit.\r\n\r\nMarston and his cowriter are clearly interested in depicting the intersection of two worlds in Albania: mobile phones and cheap motorbikes alongside ancient laws that hold a man's honour sacred. What weakens the film, however, is that nowhere is it made clear that blood feuds are not a typical feature of contemporary Albanian life: while they briefly erupted in the early 1990s after the fall of Communism, and some families still live under them, it is very unusual for one to start today. Without mentioning that things have changed, this film misrepresents Albania and misleads Western viewers towards a Boratish caricature.\r\n\r\nNote how other reviews here and elsewhere tend to commend the film more for \"teaching them something about Albania\" than for cinematography or acting. The camerawork is completely unimaginative, lacking any carefully composed tracking shots and depending far too often on a seasick shaky handheld camera following a walking actor. While the acting isn't outright bad, the deficiencies in the script only make their amateur effort stand out. While life for the men in the family is tedious as they can't step out of the house, this point is already sufficiently made by halfway through the film, and yet the script goes on and on without anything more to say. The ending seems ad hoc and doesn't really follow from the body of the film.","id":"5b8ac03e0e0a261d6e01c9fd","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b8ac03e0e0a261d6e01c9fd","movie_id":82624}

Ok! so it's conventional in formula, but the intrigue is there, Richard Gere and Topher Grace in the lead roles have our attention, and a turn of events at the 30 minute mark has us firmly in the story's grip. Sadly it never materialises into the top line suspense thriller the makers clearly were aiming for.\r\n\r\nAs the narrative spins into a muddled mess, Brandt is forced to rely on a couple of livewire sequences to save the day; cue interrogation machismo and some car crash chaseville, but it's never enough to save the day.

{"author":"neeshaan","content":"Award winning director Dr.Biju\u2019s Veettilakkulla Vazhi (The way home) handles a simple but impressive idea and in the process of narrating it, takes you across several parts of India. Though this one is a slickly packaged movie that is unlike most of its genre, it also ends up a superficial attempt which never really gets deep enough into your heart.\r\n\r\nPrithviraj plays a doctor, who has lost his wife and kid in a bomb blast in Delhi. While working in a prison hospital, a woman suicide bomber requests the doctor to find her son in a remote village in Kerala and hand him over to his father, a dreaded terrorist named Abdul Zuban Tariq. She dies soon after and quite curiously, Tariq is regarded as the mastermind behind the Delhi bomb blasts which killed the doctor\u2019s family.\r\n\r\nNow the doctor finds the kid and the film is about their journey to find the terrorist. They go to Pushkar, Jaisalmer and Ladakh. The journey is a tedious one and the doctor is viewed with suspicion not just by the police, but also by the members of the terrorist outfit. But his intention is noble, which is to find the boy\u2019s father and hand over his son to him.\r\n\r\nThe doctor\u2019s travels, his interactions with several people including a young terrorist named Razzak (Indrajith) are shown in detail. The story is progressing in a rather predictable format, without many surprises and that too, in a leisured way. And it leaves behind several doubts in the minds of the viewer. Like for instance, what if the suicide bomber died during the blasts? She didn\u2019t care about her child until the moment when she found the doctor, just by chance?\r\n\r\nWriter-director Dr.Biju has modeled his film mostly in the conventional offbeat format and though it is developing in several significant places in north India, there is no real effort to give an essence of the places to the viewers. Still, it is quite an achievement that the director has tried to think beyond the boundaries of the state, which is in fact the relevance of the film as well. M J Radhakrishnan\u2019s visuals and Ramesh Narayan\u2019s music are really good.\r\n\r\nPrithviraj has to look serious and he comes up with a nice show. But his vibes with the young boy (Master Govardhan) lacks the fizz, which is quite surprising as it could perhaps have been more enjoyable if it was there. The rest of the cast that includes Indrajith, Dhanya Mary, Irshad, Lakshmipriya and Kiran Raj have done their brief roles pretty well.\r\n\r\nVeettilekkulla Vazhi has its moments but you may need some real patience on your part to find them in between. There is an attempt to take you along to various cultures across India, but it is generally not really effective mainly due to its unconvincing storyline. But still, there is a certain amount of sincerity that has gone into its making which needs to be appreciated","id":"5475888ec3a3687fd90009c2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5475888ec3a3687fd90009c2","movie_id":214582}

{"author":"Kenneth Axel Carlsson","content":"This movie is about the life and death of the poet, Hart Crane (James Franco). It details his life, working for his father, trying to find time for his poetry, but also about his love life as a gay man.\r\n\r\nIt is actually a very straightfoward movie, shot chronological, but does have some elements of poetry in the images as well (especially in the beginning of the movie), although not as much as I would have loved. The images themselves are mostly black and white, made with a handheld camera that makes the images very lively and nervous. These are good choices for a movie of this character. It has the feel of a documentary, although it clearly is not. Another trick that the movie uses, is to divide the movie into chapters, or as they call them, _Voyages_. Each voyage also has a subtitle or description that lets us know what to expect. It ties in well with the literary tradition.\r\n\r\nJames Franco clearly have a lot of admiration and love for Hart Crane, which makes him very believable in the role. Hart Crane is a fragile man, who only wants to write poems and be alive. He has no great expectations of life, but doesn't feel like the world understands nor accepts him. In another (minor) role as Hart's lover, we see one of my favorite actors, Michael Shannon. I like it when big actors take on minor roles like this, it shows that they aren't just in this game for the money, but to tell important stories.\r\n\r\nThis would most likely be considered to be a B-movie, whatever that actually means, but when you look closer, it actually makes a very believable setting and the actors are great in their roles. All the choices concerning the colours, the nervousness of the handheld camera and the messy editing, those are, I think, on purpose. The emphasize the feel of Hart Crane, as they make sure we get right under his skin.\r\n\r\n_Last words... a bold movie that dares be different, much like Hart Crane himself. It is not a huge movie by any means, and yet, it is a very personal and emotional movie if you dare get involved in the Voyages of Hart Crane. For whatever it's worth... this movie gave me a reason to look up the name Hart Crane and, perhaps, emerge myself in his poems. At least, a book now resides on the shelves... with the name Hart Crane._","id":"54a669979251417fcb00175e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/54a669979251417fcb00175e","movie_id":83728}
{"author":"tmdb40011370","content":"The inevitable film spin-off from the hit TV show, starring all four of our lovable, roguish bordering on delinquent young men.\r\n\r\nThey have now left high school for good and about to enjoy a summer holiday before starting university. They decide on a Greek island resort known for its wild nightlife, clubs, drink, sea, sand and of course lots of young women \"who are gagging for it!\" according to Jay - one of the four, who quite often tells lots of white lies regarding his sexual prowess with women!\r\n\r\nThere is not much of a story to be honest, although Simon still yearns over his on\/off girlfriend Carli, who by coincidence is also holidaying at the same resort. And Will is still trying to lose his virginity while still coming across as a cynical public schoolboy with morals.\r\n\r\nAnd that's essentially it. There's plenty of jokes and pratfalls to be had, as you might expect with 4 lads getting drunk in a Greek resort; but I didn't find it as funny or the writing as good as the TV series. For one thing their respective parents only had a couple of minutes screen-time here, and I think without them as an extra foil to the angst-ridden teenagers the film just didn't quite work, and felt rather stretched and repetitive as it just focuses on the four and how they interact with the locals and other holidaymakers.\r\n\r\nWorth a watch if you're a fan.","id":"5de767b57646fd0011984300","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5de767b57646fd0011984300","movie_id":69798}

{"author":"CRCulver","content":"Terrence Malick's <i>The Tree of Life<\/i> is an attempt to inject some cosmic wonder into the most mundane American story.\r\n\r\nIn the 1950s, two parents bring up three boys in an American white middle-class, small-town existence. The mother (Jessica Chastain) radiates love and warmth, while the father (Brad Pitt) feels the obligation to be cold and distant in order to prepare his sons for the cruel world that awaits them. As we are informed at the beginning of the film, sometime during this mid-century upbringing, one of the boys would eventually die. We are also shown flashfowards to the present day, when the eldest son Jack, now a successful architect working in New York City, reflects on the death of his brother decades ago. There is very little conventional spoken dialogue in this family drama. The story is told through voiceovers on top of a rich series of images, these monologues representing the inner thoughts, doubts and fears of the characters.\r\n\r\nBut Malick adds something on top of this, one of the most controversial turns in Hollywood filmmaking in recent years. Early on we are treated to a depiction of the creation of the universe and of life on Earth, from the initial clouds of gas right after the Big Bang to small nebulae, then big galaxies like our own Milky Way, the Earth as an inchoate ball of lava, life arising in tidepools, and then into the era of the dinosaurs. These special effects were created by Douglas Trumbull, best known for the cosmic visuals of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey<\/i>. The titles of the film quote from the Book of Job: \"Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth, when the morning stars sang together?\"\r\n\r\nI get what Malick is trying to do here, that is, to show that the trials and tribulations of an individual human life are part of some vast unknown plan. Nonetheless, while I can understand this on an intellectual level, the film does not seem to reconcile the two layers into a single coherent plot. The film is indeed a visual feast on a first viewing (a high-definition release watched on a projector is nearly as stunning as <i>2001<\/i>), but the <i>The Tree of Life<\/i> is much harder to sit through on a repeat viewing when one knows that it doesn't quite hang together. Furthermore, as thought-provoking as the story of the boys' 1950s upbringing is, the last part with its scenes of petty delinquency goes on forever and should have been cut. Finally, the ending which I won't spoil here is a total trope, not at all a fresh take on the meaning of life.\r\n\r\nAt a time when Hollywood is widely regarded as stagnant, I can appreciate a director like Malick who seeks to do something unexpected, but I find <i>The Tree of Life<\/i> to be rather a noble failure.","id":"5b8ad8f90e0a261d77020b1d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b8ad8f90e0a261d77020b1d","movie_id":8967}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**When the electric mist from the sky struck down.**\r\n\r\nThis film came five years ago, but I watched it now. A US-Russian collaboration product that's entirely takes place in Moscow. This is an alien invasion theme, but slightly different than those similar films. It never gives the reason, just the destructions like apocalypse on its way. That means it is about the survival. A group of Americans who are in the Moscow for different reasons joins the hands after people started to turn into ashes with the contact of the strange electric mist that came from the sky. So what's their plan now and whether they get out of it safely or not focused on the remaining film.\r\n\r\nSurely some people would enjoy it. It's not all bad if you are not expecting a masterpiece. I should have seen it in digital 3D for a better experience, even the normal watch is not that bad. The turns in the story were unpredictable, particularly the film characters, but the twist wasn't.

{"author":"CRCulver","content":"In 2011 B\u00e9la Tarr, a Hungarian director who had drawn acclaim for his distinctive style of long takes \u00e0 la Andrei Tarkovsky and a bleak and sardonic view of human existence, released what he stated would be his last film: THE TURIN HORSE. The film's genesis is rooted in a conversation between Tarr and the Hungarian novelist Laszlo Krasznahorkai some years before: Krasznahorkai recounted the story Friedrich Nietzsche's famous breakdown in the streets of Turin after watching a cabman cruelly beat his horse. We know, Krasznahorkai noted, that Nietzsche lived on for another decade, mute and demented, in the care of his family, but what happened to the horse? Thus the two decided to make a film, but it would not be a historical film about late 19th-century Turin. Rather, the Nietzsche story only served as an initial inspiration for a more universal drama.\r\n\r\nAfter an introduction spoken by a narrator that briefly tells the Nietzsche story, we are introduced to a horse and his cabman, Ohlsdorfer (J\u00e1nos Derzsi). With much effort -- the opening take of the horse pulling the cart on the road is several minutes long -- Ohlsdorfer reaches a house and a barn in the minute of a nondescript wilderness, where a savage wind blows nonstop. His daughter (Erika B\u00f3k) appears, and the two struggle to unharness the horse and lead it into the barn as the wind howls. Immediately we see that they lived alone and in poverty. The film is divided into a series of episodes, \"The First Day\", \"The Second Day\" etc. where Ohlsdorfer and his daughter repeat the same routine: she helps Ohlsdorfer dress or undress (he is partly lame), she boils potatoes that she and Ohlsdorfer eat, piping hot, with their fingers. Yet in spite of this grinding routine, each day shows the action from a slightly different angle, and we become aware that the world in which they live is breaking down. Everything happens with a minimum of dialogue, except for two appearances by visitors to their homestead that are grim portents. The horse itself gets comparatively little screen time, but is such a potent symbol that it does feel like, as Tarr calls it in the film's credits, the \"main role\".\r\n\r\nTHE TURIN HORSE is shot in only 30 takes by cinematographer Fred Kelemen; considering the film is 2 hours 35 minutes long, that means an average shot length of 5 minutes. Tarr's visual aesthetic of very long takes is not for everyone, but if you surrender to its hypnotic effect, it can be very powerful. The slow pace puts the viewer into a hyper-aware state where you are familiarized with the most minute details of the set, some of which will later prove important in the action, while others are simply distinct and memorable quirks. It is this elevating of the stage set to nearly a character in itself that is one of Tarr's major innovations. The bleakness of Tarr and Krasznahorkai's vision is not completely oppressive. You might find some humour here, even if it is the blackest humour imaginable. THE TURIN HORSE can be readily compared to the more austere plays of Samuel Beckett which reveal human existence to be absurd, but lampoon attempts at philosophy or personal foibles in ways that can make one grimly chuckle.\r\n\r\nThis sort of film isn't for everyone. Needless to say, if you like movies as simple entertainment and don't go for \"arthouse\" efforts, then you should steer clear of this. For more open-minded cinephiles, I'd recommend seeing the work of Andrei Tarkovsky first before you decide to go on to the even more extreme aesthetic of Tarr. But I personally found this (like a few of Tarr's prior efforts) to be a very moving experience, one that I am sure I will repeat from time to time over the years. The visual poetry of THE TURIN HORSE is incredible.","id":"5a890d3bc3a3686339062e71","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a890d3bc3a3686339062e71","movie_id":81401}

The film tells the story of a group of young teenagers in Lillian, Ohio, 1979, who are filming their own Super 8 zombie movie when a train derails and crashes, releasing an unknown being into their midst. As the town is threatened and mysteries start to mount up, the youngsters must come to terms with not only that, but also growing up mentally and physically.\r\n\r\nIt's feels nigh on impossible to come across a review for Super 8 that doesn't contain the name Spielberg. With the film overtly Spiebergian in themes and production, and the bearded maestro of the film geek masses on producer duties here, his name hangs over Abrams' movie like a watchful father figure. If that bothers Abrams, or indeed if it detracts from the quality of his movie? Then that's up for debate by those not enamoured with Spielberg's movies of the late 70s and early 80s. But to my mind it's a blessing, a triumph of sorts to be mentioned in the same breath as the beard and those wonderful movies of his. Part homage, part nostalgia harking, Super 8 is still one great, sweet and affecting J.J. Abrams movie.\r\n\r\nAbrams himself is on record as saying that Super 8 is born out of two movie ideas he had, this while also being drawn from his own recollections in childhood, and the two movie idea shows. It's very much a two part picture in structure, part Stand by Me coming of ager, part Goonie like monster hunt. Nothing wrong with that, mind. However, with that comes some form of irritation to those who venture in expecting a big ole alien attack movie. Oh for sure he exists, and he is big and mean, although he has just cause, but the creature is not the centre piece of the movie. It's the human characters that form the basis of Super 8, be it the kids adjusting to their changing emotions and hormones, or the single parent fathers coming to terms with absence of love and grief, Super 8 is brimming with human heart. Yet never is it schmaltzy.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION VALUE!\r\n\r\nAided by Fong's warm metallic hued photography and Giacchino's beautiful heart tugging score (both energised in Blu-ray), Super 8 always carries a magical mysticism to it. The warm glow of nostalgia cloaks the proceedings, never cloying, always smile inducing, offering comfort as the narrative deals out observations about the need to let go while playing out as a deft, if unsubtle, meditation on grief and growing pains. The cast do wonders for their director, Fanning and Courtney are exemplary, so much raw emotion and energy, it's unfussy and believable acting. Griffith's, too, is wonderful as the booming voiced wannabe director, a tender nod of the head to the many young amateur directors out there; of which Abrams was once one himself. While Eldard and Chandler as the two fathers are most affecting, the pangs of juggling single parenting with loss are deeply portrayed.\r\n\r\nOf the director himself? He crafts it with care and precision, a knowing of the pulse beat of the thematics to drive it forward. His attention to period details are admirable, from the dialogue sparks involving Walkman's and Soviet paranoia, to the items located within the bedrooms and houses of our young protagonists, he is a man who knows his late 70s and early 80s onions. Spielberg was far from finished as a film maker of note at the time of Super 8's release, but it did feel then that the torch was deftly being passed sideways. After the excellence of Star Trek he followed up with this most delightful of movies, where Abrams showed in his work a love of cinema that's wholly infectious. 9\/10","id":"5d66627b58361b0011221400","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d66627b58361b0011221400","movie_id":37686}

Sucker Punch, as reviews etc attest, is not for everyone, it has been called any number of things in derogative fashion, which since I enjoyed the film a lot means I'm a misogynist fetishist gamer, which to the best of my knowledge is not true. Lest I'm in the closet and now in middle age about to unleash traits and feelings previously untapped. Which if the latter is true you would have to say well done Zack Snyder, for that's serious film making...\r\n\r\nSucker Punch is loud, full of visual orgasms, musically adroit, exciting, clever and very sexy. Snyder has made no secret of his fetish leanings when making this piece, but it hardy constitutes a dark seedy mind at work. It can easily be argued that the film is very much pro women, the story itself - in amongst the explosive thunder of the fantastical action - is tender and beautiful, complete with emotional kickers. Perhaps it's in the eye of the beholder? But I see a strong female led action movie, with shifting fantasy realms, and cunningly it calls for deeper ponder come the finale.\r\n\r\nLove it or hate it, Snyder has pushed buttons with this exercise. Better that than another cash cow sequel or another remake, re-imaging or rebirth. 7\/10","id":"5a01f6479251415718024511","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a01f6479251415718024511","movie_id":23629}

{"author":"LastCaress1972","content":"I picked this up in my local supermarket for a fiver, and really glad I did. A ninety-minute HBO documentary, it's a light yet loving look at a whole bunch of people across America who have chosen to spend their spare time patrolling the streets as \"real-life superheroes\". Try to think Defendor, Super or Kick-Ass, if they were real. Gently piss-taking - it's hard not to in fairness when some of these heroes are running into traffic or conducting interviews on random people's gardens (\"Get the **** off of my property!\") - but generally with a caring eye for these strange social outcasts who nevertheless undoubtedly mean well, the documentary mostly follows the fortunes of Mr. Xtreme in California (whilst watching Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers in his absolute tip of an apartment - the XtremeCave, he calls it - he proclaims: \"Yeah! They're gonna MORPH now!\" with the enthusiasm of a five year-old) as he tries to recruit new members into the XJL (the Xtreme Justice League, of course), and Master Legend in Florida, the leader of Team Justice (himself, Symbiote, Super Hero and a female who's name escapes me now; there are loads of these oddballs in this film) with a eye for the ladies and a stomach for a cold beer or three whilst on patrol (\"I always keep beer for the night ahead in my van...Never drink to drunkenness though (gulp, gulp)... Now, if you don't mind, I need to quench my thirst in this bar...\"). It intersperses the fun and games with numerous police\/legal experts' concerns about what use if any these vigilantes are, and what probable dangers they're either walking into or inadvertantly causing themselves. The whole thing seems ripe for a Louis Theroux-style cautionary, told-you-so tragedy to occur, and indeed a quartet of Supers (The New York Initiative, featuring an openly gay hero) take to the street openly committing the act of entrapment (trying to entice potential gay-bashers). Fortunately it doesn't come to that (\"Well, it's started to rain, so we're going home now\") and the documentary retains its light heart throughout. 9.5\/10, thoroughly recommended. It's a fiver well spent, I promise.","id":"5207b202760ee36302239985","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5207b202760ee36302239985","movie_id":71905}
{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"Wow\u2026 Here I was, thinking I was going to get to see an awesome comic- like film about a group of girls kickin' a whole lotta butt surrounded by mind-bending fantasy scenery.\r\n\r\nTechnically, I was right\u2026 But only technically. Sucker Punch is like Chinese food. You can eat three plates and it will still leave you feeling hungry. It's a great deal of empty calories, is basically what I'm saying. Substance? Nah.\r\n\r\nLet me just get right into it. What's wrong with Sucker Punch is the screenplay. Not the actors, not the director, just the story. This story revolves around a group of five girls in an institution for the mentally insane, in a fantastical, steampunk-wannabe 1940's (my best guess) setting. They are treated horribly and their lives are miserable, and to cope with it all, the main protagonist Babydoll, escapes into her fantasies and in this trance-like state, devises a plan for them all to escape. \r\n\r\nThe concept is not bad. It might have even been really exciting, had it not been executed so laughably unrealistic. And by 'unrealistic', I don't mean the fantasies themselves. I'm referring to the fact that these fantasies were so obviously not dreamed up by an actual teenage girl, but rather they look like the perfect fulfillment of the wet wishes of a horny teenage boy. It is very likely that a teenage girl WOULD dream of being able to wield a samurai sword and beat up every monster, dragon and every other kind of bastard who crosses her path. She WOULD dream of coming out of every battle completely unscathed and with every hair on her pretty head still perfectly in place. She would NOT, however, be doing all of this scantily clad in sexy lingerie wearing fishnet stockings and high heels\u2026 I am a girl, with very vivid imagination. Trust me on this one. It was, in one word, ridiculous.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that really bothered me was the way these characters were worked out. As obviously miserable as their personal predicaments were, I could not relate to a single one of them. They were all completely 2- dimensional and just flat-out uninteresting. I didn't care about what happened to a single one of them. I don't believe all of the blame for this falls on the actresses (although theirs weren't exactly Oscar winning performances...), again, I chalk it up to poor screen writing. The only one who was able to make her character slightly more than moderately interesting, was not even one of 'the girls', it was Dr. Vera Gorski, played by Carla Gugino. At least she was interesting to watch, and she was even somewhat of a scene-stealer, taking much thunder away from the girls simply because she (both the actress and the character) had the biggest personality. All the others, I felt were mostly just going through the motions, because they had zero character development and no interesting dialogue to work with. And that's bad when you're talking about the characters that are supposed to carry the story. A pleasant (and much needed surprise) came in the form of Scott Glenn, who only appears in the fantasy segments as several different versions of a wise man. That was a nice touch. \r\n\r\nHowever, the one thing that really stood out for me as the true axis of failure that sums up Sucker Punch, was the feeling of total confusion that was present from the beginning and never cleared up. I'm not saying I didn't 'get it', I'm saying it was a hot, incoherent mess. And I usually don't mind being thrown back and forth and to and fro throughout a film, I don't mind playing guessing games and wondering what it will all lead to. I DO mind when the roller-coaster ride is over and all I feel is queasy. Some people have suggested that this is a really deep and complex film, but honestly, I think they're just reading too much into it. The stupid thing is, for the most part it was completely predictable, and STILL it lacked structure and decent storytelling. That may seem like a paradox, but there's an easy way to explain it. In the words of the great Roger Ebert: \"Now that's bad filmmaking.\" \r\n\r\nThe only element in Sucker Punch that was somewhat redeeming, were the visual effects. I must say, it was all very gorgeous and eye-pleasing. Also, the soundtrack was excellent, filled with very well performed covers of well-known songs and some perfectly chosen originals. Emily Browning, who plays Babydoll (and also sings a few songs on the soundtrack), was a good choice for the lead role, but I must say, in all honesty, that was mostly because she was visually very appealing as the main protagonist. More simply put \u2013 she was very pretty. Still, I'm not sure that's enough to carry a film. \r\n\r\nAll in all, I'm left feeling \u2013 Zack Snyder\u2026 Dude. What were you thinking. You can do so much better than this. I guess I just finally have to come to terms with the fact that everybody's human and is bound to make one big mistake at least once in their lives. Zack\u2026 this is yours.\r\n\r\nSucker Punch sucks.\r\n_(November 2013)_","id":"58ac4f5dc3a36849cc0135d2","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ac4f5dc3a36849cc0135d2","movie_id":23629}
{"author":"narrator56","content":"Sometimes I feel like my interests and taste really follow the road less traveled. This is to say that Super 8 surprised me by becoming one of my Favorite.Movies.Ever. There I said it.\r\n\r\nIt seems to merge genres slightly: science fiction, of course, a bit of coming of age, a slice of movie-within-a-movie - is that all?  \r\n \r\nI think I have watched this movie three times, and probably will again. It reminds me of Monsters, another low key sci-fi\/monster movie I really like. The train scene about twenty minutes into Super 8 is a blockbuster scene, so much so that I believe most movies wouldn't be able to keep the rest of the film from being anti-climactic. Usually a tremendous scene like that is saved for the end of a movie, but the plot required to be right where it was. But although the action and suspense ramps down a bit following it, the movie goes to work on building up the rest of the plot and growing the characters.\r\n\r\nThe young actors starring in this movie are terrific, in my opinion, which may place me in an unfortunate minority. But judge for yourself, and try not to set the bar of excellence higher than we do for adult actors. They are smart and witty at times, but are clearly kids with kid behavior at other times, rather than miniature adults with adult lines. \r\n\r\nSo you notice I used the words 'favorite movie,' not best.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"View it as a spin off and it's a rollicking treasure seeking adventure.\r\n\r\nOk lets have it out front right away, this particular writer loved the first film (Curse of the Black Pearl), was disappointed with the second (Dead Man's Chest) and positively found the third (At World's End) to be an incomprehensible bore. Part 4: On Stranger Tides is a shift in another direction, where a group of piratical characters, some we know well, others new to the fold, embark on missions to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. So think \"Indiana Jones\", \"National Treasures\" like adventures (hell even \"It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World\") and you get the drift here. Expectation of this franchise getting back to the heady days of that first film will be crushed pretty early on.\r\n\r\nThere's a little too much going on here for it to be safe children's fare, but the adults, especially those who remember the serial silliness of adventure films of yore, will have a good time. The action set-pieces are superb, enter high speed carriage chase through London, some spiffing sword play deep in the brewery, Blackbeard (Ian McShane) using his black magic whiles to incarcerate mutineers in a whirl of maniacal ropes, and a mermaid attack that quite frankly rocks - as do the mermaids themselves the sexy vicious teasers they are.\r\n\r\nProduction is as expected top notch, and the cast, in spite of having to battle for screen time in a cast of thousands, are doing fine work (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz a welcome heaving bosom of spunkiness). For sure our main man Captain Jack Sparrow, with Depp just about keeping the characters charm on tap, isn't as dominating a force as we would like, but he leaves his trusty fun mark and the others (Barbosa is back drinking rum out of his newly acquired peg leg) pick up the slack. It's unlikely to get better on revisits, so if you be hardcore POTC from earlier adventures, there's no point going back to se tis one.

They serve as constant reminders that no matter the seriousness, toil and drama poured into cinema, there\u2019s always room for levity.\r\n\r\nThat said, Argentinian writer-director Diego Rougier\u2019s \u201cSal\u201d hit me just the right way with its mix of Western iconography, gorgeous photography and limitless sardonicism.\r\n\r\nTo simply make the comparison between this darkly comic Western thriller and \u201cNo Country for Old Men\u201d seems insufficient, even though the Best Picture winner immediately springs to mind while watching \u201cSal.\u201d The influence of the Coen Bros. is steeped throughout this film, right from the opening caveat (a la \u201cFargo\u201d) that the story is based on true events \u2014 a claim that seems dubious but in good fun.\r\n\r\nFele Mart\u00ednez (best known from Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar\u2019s \u201cAbre Los Ojos\u201d and Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s \u201cBad Education\u201d) leads viewers between the world of aspiring screenwriter Sergio and the rough-and-tumble arena of revenge faced by Diego, a man for whom Sergio is mistaken after traveling to northern Chile to research his troubled script, a Western titled \u201cSal.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe fabled Diego left some scores unsettled with the local jefe, Victor (Patricio Contreras), and his wife, Maria (Javiera Contadar, who also serves as producer), all of them Sergio must answer for, a mistaken identity case that reminds me of the fun and twisted \u201cThe Big Lebowski\u201d at times.\r\n\r\nAiding Sergio in his quest to find a tantilizing story for his script (not to mention survive the torment of Victor and his gang) is the old man Vizcacha (Sergio Hern\u00e1ndez), who himself has revenge on his mind vis a vis Victor.\r\nWhile somewhat heavy-handed in its transitions between the supposed reality of Sergio\u2019s script trip and the boots-and-belts drama of Diego, \u201cSal\u201d never suffers for lack of humor, especially from Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s mentor-hermit character and the comically irascible henchman Pascual (Luis Dubbo).\r\n\r\nEqually compelling is the rich cinematography of David Bravo, whose camera movements and respect for natural light across scorched desert days and fire-lit nights help ground the main narrative while indulging in color and saturation tricks for dream sequences and cutaways to the plot of Sergio\u2019s film-within-a-film.\r\n\r\nWhile some viewers may find the transitions grating and tiresome, the humor, performances and overall production quality in \u201cSal\u201d keep you invested and entertained.","id":"508ab876760ee3714900071a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/508ab876760ee3714900071a","movie_id":139932}
{"author":"CRCulver","content":"In 1993, filmmakers Ron Fricke and Mark Magidson presented a deeply moving portrait of features universal to all human societies, warned of ecological collapse, and depicted how technology was changing our lives in <i>Baraka<\/i>. Shot on 70mm film in 30-odd countries, this was one of the most visually impressive films ever made, and its lack of any dialogue or narration allowed viewers to engage in their own individual reflections about the panorama on the screen. Two decades later, the team returned with <i>Samsara<\/i>, a sequel that wasn't really necessary.\r\n\r\nOne reason that <i>Samsara<\/i> is not very good is that it often seems a shot-for-shot repeat of <i>Baraka<\/i>. The filmmakers revisit many of the same locations (such as Thai prostitutes, a chicken-processing plant, home appliance factories, landfill gleaners). Again Buddhism, the Ka'aba and high church Christianity are depicted, but because the film does not go on to any other religions than what was on <i>Baraka<\/i>, these rituals feel this time like cheap exoticism instead of unquenchable anthropological curiosity. SAMSARA also lacks the dramatic arc of <i>Baraka<\/i>, coming across as a random succession of images instead of the journey from sacredness to horror and back that we found in its predecessor.\r\n\r\nThat is not to say that <i>Samsara<\/i> is completely without interest. There is an astonishing clip of performance artist Olivier de&nbsp;Sagaza, and the freakish Dubai landscape is depicting in a detail that few (even those who have been there) have seen. <i>Samsara<\/i> is all in all a darker film, and while depictions of the wreckage of Katrina, a Wyoming family that are proud to own an arsenal of guns, and a wounded veteran may fail to really shock viewers in the West who have already been exposed to such images for years, scenes of garish funerals in Nigeria and Indonesian men making the rounds in a sulphur mine (even though they know it is killing them) are stirring and memorable. Of course the visuals are rich, and in Bluray format on my HD projector the film is just as stunningly detailed as its predecessor.\r\n\r\nHowever, <i>Samsara<\/i> lacks enough new things to say, it surprisingly doesn't offer continual rewards on rewatching, and just by the fact that it exists out there it potentially dilutes the impact of <i>Baraka<\/i>, once a singular film. I was entertained enough to give this a 3-star rating, but I would still recommend <i>Baraka<\/i>, and even for those who have seen and loved <i>Baraka<\/i>, I would not recommend moving on to this film.","id":"5b96543f0e0a261978033a47","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b96543f0e0a261978033a47","movie_id":89708}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"A film just in my style. It\u2019s a future\/alternate reality kind of apocalyptic action\/horror movie. Fairly simple and straightforward plot where the good guys stays pretty much stays as the good guys throughout the move and the hero is really someone that kicks ass throughout the movie. No bloody fussing around with making the hero \u201chuman\u201d or some crap like that.\n\nThe special effects and the apocalyptic sceneries where well done. In general the film was a solid piece of work. The transfer to Blu-ray equally well done. Picture quality was as to be expected and the DTS Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack well balanced with just enough surround effects and LFE to make it very enjoyable.\n\nThe film get a 5.7 rating at IMDB which in my mind is a bit on the low side but then, it\u2019s not really a film for everyone. The so called \u201ccritics\u201d at Rotten Tomatoes gave it 17% which is just pure bullshit but then I have given up on those idiots a long time ago. Most of those \u201ccritics\u201d must come from the American bible belt or something \ud83d\ude26","id":"5aa3b0bfc3a3687bff00a0fa","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5aa3b0bfc3a3687bff00a0fa","movie_id":38321}
{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"Young Adult tells the story of 37-year-old Mavis Gary \u2013 a pathologically unhappy, immature, egotistical girl in a grown woman's body. Upon hearing of her ex-boyfriend's new born baby, she decides that they are still meant for each other, and the fact that he is now happily married to The Perfect Woman is but a minor detail on their road to eternal bliss. More simply put\u2026 Mavis is bat s*** crazy.\r\n\r\nGoing into this movie, I thought it was going to be a hilarious comedy, full of LOL moments. Actually it is nothing of the sort. Thinking about it, seeing the way this \"adult\" woman lives out her life (sleeping till noon, living in a pigsty, forgetting to take care of her dog and playing children's video games), is really incredibly sad. No, it's pathetic. She is the author of 'young adult' books, which in any other case is a perfectly fine job, except in hers it basically means she vicariously lives the life of her main character \u2013 a high school girl. This is the emotional level Mavis is stuck in.\r\n\r\nHearing about her ex-boyfriend's baby stirs an awkward obsession in Mavis. She packs her bags and returns to her small hometown in Minnesota \u2013 completely convinced that she and her ex Buddy are destined to be together. Back home, it's obvious the people she left behind know her a little better than she knows herself. Basically, everybody knows her\u2026 and everybody hates her. And who can blame them\u2026 Mavis is quite simply the most childish, entitled, RIDICULOUSLY selfish woman there ever was. Thankfully there's at least one old acquaintance from her past who's willing to look beyond all that. His name is Matt, he walks with a crutch because he once was the victim of a horrible hate crime, and he is the only one who listens to her.\r\n\r\nWhat I love about this story is the fact that, although it starts out as a comedy, it gradually flows and meanders into a beautifully crafted, delicate character drama. Mavis, at first sight, is a hysterical character, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that this woman has some deep seeded issues, no matter how hard she tries to cover up for it. Mavis is played wonderfully by Charlize Theron, who delivers one of her most hilarious, yet at the same time, understated performances to date. She could have easily gone overboard with this character, but somehow manages to humanize this completely unlikable woman. In fact, I'm willing to state that about 80% of Young Adult 'works' because of her. She displays some of her best work in two very intense scenes, where Mavis' sky high ego comes crashing down, leaving her remarkably exposed and vulnerable. That right there was some truly wonderful acting on her part.\r\n\r\nMatt is played very amiably by Patton Oswalt, who seems to be the only character in town with any emotional intelligence. Although this character may be a bit of a clich\u00e9 (the wise, sympathetic loser with a physical disability and a traumatizing past), that's OK because it works. Oswalt's acting clearly takes a shot at versatility and he passed with flying colours, as far as I'm concerned.\r\n\r\nI love the script. Penned by Diablo Cody (writer of Juno), it's full of sharp, sassy character traits and dialogue, while remaining very subtle and human. As a story, it doesn't honestly have that much to offer but it's a joy to watch for the high quality of 'human relatableness', I guess I could call it. Actually, I can't really think of any major flaws. It has an awesome soundtrack, all the actors are very well cast and the direction was placed perfectly in the very capable hands of Jason Reitman.\r\n\r\nThis is a small film, about basic, non-glamorous human behavior and a big girl who might find happiness yet, if only she wants it badly enough. Highly recommended.\r\n_(January 2015)_","id":"58a9b11e92514173f600949b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58a9b11e92514173f600949b","movie_id":57157}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"You're Next is directed by Adam Wingard and written by Simon Barrett. It stars Sharni Vinson, Nicholas Tucci, Wendy Glenn, A.J. Bowen and Joe Swanberg. Music is by Mads Heldtberg and cinematography by Andrew Palermo.\r\nBloody and bloody good fun!\r\n\r\nThe Davison family and partners meet up for a family reunion at a remote holiday home and quickly find that their inner issues are the least of their worries.\r\n\r\nThe splinter of horror that encompasses home invasion, that most terrifying of subject matters, has had enough filmic entries to actually fill a house! So when another one comes along with good hype and a promise of reinvigorating the formula, it's cause for horror film fans to start salivating.\r\n\r\nYou're Next doesn't reinvent anything, but it consistently and confidently keeps the formula well oiled and proves to be one of the better films of its type. The set up is standard, a big old country house in the woods, a whole bunch of likable and dislikable people, and of course some outside assailants about to unleash hell on everyone in the house. Refreshingly this is not a roll call of pretty teenagers being stalked and slashed, this is an assorted bunch, young and old, all shapes and sizes, and the family bickering that precedes the carnage is a smart move, because once family members start getting killed there's a genuine sense of grief and regret coursing through those yet to be sliced and diced.\r\n\r\nIt's nice to find that Wingard has great respect for his target audience, he's made a film for fans of the sub-genre and inserted a darkly comic streak that pays off royally. It's often very nudge nudge and wink winkery, but always in the right places. The director also proves to have a devilish eye for a murder scene, with some of the killings here high grade in blood, physicality and originality. Elsewhere the makers give us a great heroine, a truly resourceful gal that fights back with a ferocity that's both sexy and frightening, and while the revelation of why these events are happening is hardly original -\u0096 or that the back story given for our heroine's skills is just silly -\u0096 Wingard plonks it all together with such bloody verve it hardly matters.\r\n\r\nSome less than good acting from a couple of the cast, and the overuse of shaky-cam stops it from going through the roof out into the genius stratosphere, but this is a cracker of a home invasion horror and well worth a night in with the lights off and the volume tuned up loud. 8\/10","id":"5bd50ab6925141039b0212a0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5bd50ab6925141039b0212a0","movie_id":83899}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**A messed up family, cleaned up by an outsider!**\r\n\r\nThis kind of films is usually low rated by me. It's very rare that I find one good film and that happened to be this one. I was braced for another disappointment, then I totally got surprised when it reached half way mark. Good twist too. In fact, there are many twists in the final quarters. Not like breathtaking, but very acceptable with kind of story and characters it had.\r\n\r\nAnother home invasion film. A family reunites for the parent's wedding anniversary at their rural vacation house. Slowly all the children arrive with their life partners, and then suddenly while dining, the attack takes place. Creates full of chaos, the family does not know what to do. But one of the members' retaliation makes thing complication for the attackers. What follows after that, and how it all ends are the rest of the story.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this is not a horror film as labelled. It is a terror. We don't have a such genre, so it comes under horror. But the best way to call it a thriller. Sharni Vinson was very good. It's because of how her role was designed. Best film so far by this filmmaker, until his upcoming big titles. A one-night-event film, and of course a limited cast. They make sequels for crap films, but this one definitely deserves one. So I'm expecting one. Thos who love this genre must see it.\r\n\r\n_8\/10_","id":"5a76facb92514105a904298c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a76facb92514105a904298c","movie_id":83899}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"It\u2019s raining Gollums!\r\n\r\nAttack the Block is written and directed by Joe Cornish. It stars Jodie Whittaker, John Boyega, Alex Esmail, Jumayn Hunter, Luke Treadaway and Nick Frost. Music is by Basement Jaxx and Steven Price and cinematography by Tom Townend.\r\n\r\nWhen a South London tower block comes under attack from aliens, a young gang of lads and the nurse they just mugged have to band together to fight back.\r\nIn Britain we was wondering just when Joe Cornish was going to turn his hand to directing a feature film, here for his debut he tackled a sci-fiction action comedy with a wry bit of social commentary thrown in for good measure \u2013 it was worth the wait.\r\n\r\nWith one Edgar Wright hovering about in the producers lounge and Nick Frost on hand as a reassuringly adult comedic presence, it could be argued that Attack the Block has joined the Wright\/Pegg production line. Yet when you break it down this does in fact homage a myriad of siege invasion films, but still it becomes very much its own animal.\r\n\r\nCornish dangerously structures his film by introducing us to a young gang of kids who think nothing of mugging a single defenceless woman \u2013 with a knife. With the group spouting their turf speak (some none British views may struggle initially with the dialogue), they are not a bunch of youngsters one can easily get on side with. In fact to dislike them in an instant is wholly justifiable and understandable, so much so that once the aliens arrive it\u2019s a human reaction to root for them to rid us of these troublesome youths. So yes, dangerous by Cornish, yet astute as it happens.\r\n\r\nAs the pic progresses and we spend time with the gang, we start to understand their way of life, their part in a tough society. It\u2019s during this key phase that Cornish brings in another structure, that of the victim and the perpetrators having to band together to fight an enemy, surely he isn\u2019t going to make heroes out of this gang of youthful miscreants? So once this scene is set, and the aliens start to unleash toothsome hell on this part of South London, it\u2019s battle royale time. The blood and jokes seamlessly flow together, the score booms and other characters are introduced, some either for a lighter angle \u2013 others to annoy us and maybe be set up for alien gnasher fodder?\r\n\r\nThe aliens themselves are a splendid creation, a new addition to an overstocked market. One of the youngsters calls them gorilla wolf things, that\u2019s about right, they be jet black with spiky hair and bio luminescent jaws and claws, they move on all fours. And then it\u2019s the last part of Cornish\u2019s clever structure plan, for as we are given a reason why the aliens are after this particular group, so does characters transformations offer a prudent point. There is hope unbound, not just for people in movie, but for societies fractured by the way of the life afforded them. While the lesson here of people taking responsibility for their actions, to right their wrongs, is written loud and proud.\r\n\r\nSmart and fresh performances  across the board, led by the wonderful Whittaker and a star making turn from Boyega, close out the deal. Attack the Block is a genre spilcer of a picture that brings something new to the table it sits at.

This narrative thread is run concurrently with the Voldermort movements, where he now has in his possession The Elder Wand (the wand to rule them all) and has gathered a vast army to descend upon Hogwarts and achieve his ultimate goal of killing Harry.

Smartly the pic has been kept to a 2 hour and 10 minute run time, and thankfully it flows nicely and the pace never stalls. Being one of those who has never read the books I can't say what has been left out or if anything has been tampered with for dramatic licence? What I know for sure is that the emotional investment garnered from being with this story for so long, to be part of these characters lives, watching them grow, ensures that this closure piece pounds the senses. Sitting down to watch it you realise that we are going to lose people we care for, and Hogwarts, the wonderful place we fist glimpsed across the night time water, is going to be attacked and reduced to a battle scarred place of war.\r\n\r\nAs the effects work dazzles and the one time child actors come shining through as mature actors who have casted off previous wooden traits, the story filling strands show just what wonderful work Rowling achieved on the page. Some of the characters never stood a chance in life, some carried deep emotional scars, and others  held secrets so crucial to the whole Potter universe. For a series of such fantastical genre sparkle, the Harry Potter world eventually reveals itself to be a deep and fortified humanist drama, and engaging it most certainly is. That this is achieved as battlefield carnage is raised, with wand wars booming up on the screen, it means credit is due to all involved the making of such a cherished and intensely followed Octalogy.\r\n\r\nIs it the earth shattering finale one hoped for? Well not quite. Story wise for sure that is the case, but with the whole story driving towards the final battle between Harry and Voldermort, it's disappointing to find it's rather brief and in truth anti climatic. Harry the boy now burgeoning into a man versus the snake faced despot surely should have been a crowning glory, but sadly not so. To compound this irritating disappointment, we then get the epilogue that is bogged down by aging make-up design that is almost laughable. But these are just annoyances, not film killers, for this has been a magical ride for 10 years. Fans will feel a gap in the heart now it's over, maybe even shed a Snape like tear as well? Yet ultimately it has been a triumph and the rewatchable factor for the whole series will always remain high. 8\/10","id":"5d72222477c01f621d5b89e0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d72222477c01f621d5b89e0","movie_id":12445}

It stars Saoirse Ronan, Eric Banna, Tom Hollander, Olivia Williams, Jason Flemyng and Cate Blanchett. Music is by The Chemical Brothers and cinematography by Alwin H. Kuchler.\r\n\r\nHanna Heller (Ronan) is a 16 year old highly trained assassin on the run from the CIA...\r\n\r\nHeralded by some British critics as original and thrilling, Joe Wright's Hanna is neither. It's a gimmick movie dressed up as cool for the kids fodder that is both boring and cheesy. Taking the gimmick aside, that of a 16 year old crack assassin girl slotting all who come in her way, it starts off promisingly enough as we meet Hanna and her father Erik (Banna) out in the wilderness. There's training, a believable bond (both Ronan and Banna don't disgrace themselves) and the wintry landscape bites hard as we wonder what is in store.\r\n\r\nThen the film shifts to Hanna being on the run, where the back story guff is just, well, guff, and the pace crawls to a standstill. Blanchett's (badly miscast) CIA operative is in pursuit, with that back story guff tattooed on her forehead, and it tries to gain momentum for the inevitable showdown between the big bad bitch and the little china doll killer. The Chemical Brothers drip their brand of techno beats over it, which is OK if you like that sort of thing. How cool?!\r\n\r\nIn the middle passages Hanna rides along with a Hippy family, with Flemyng also badly miscast, and there's some cack-handed attempt at humanising poor Hanna as she comes alive in the big old world. It's derivative in premise, boring in execution and designed to make teenagers think they are watching a masterpiece for their generation.\r\n\r\nThe amusement park finale is well staged, location photography is pleasing enough in that hip-euro way, and Banna and Ronan work hard to keep it from total damnation. But for much of the near two hour run time it's a butt numbing bore that has ideas far above its station.

What I know for sure is that the emotional investment garnered from being with this story for so long, to be part of these characters lives, watching them grow, ensures that this closure piece pounds the senses. Sitting down to watch it you realise that we are going to lose people we care for, and Hogwarts, the wonderful place we fist glimpsed across the night time water, is going to be attacked and reduced to a battle scarred place of war.\r\n\r\nAs the effects work dazzles and the one time child actors come shining through as mature actors who have casted off previous wooden traits, the story filling strands show just what wonderful work Rowling achieved on the page. Some of the characters never stood a chance in life, some carried deep emotional scars, and others held secrets so crucial to the whole Potter universe. For a series of such fantastical genre sparkle, the Harry Potter world eventually reveals itself to be a deep and fortified humanist drama, and engaging it most certainly is. That this is achieved as battlefield carnage is raised, with wand wars booming up on the screen, it means credit is due to all involved in the making of such a cherished and intensely followed Octalogy.\r\n\r\nIs it the earth shattering finale one hoped for? Well not quite. Story wise for sure that is the case, but with the whole story driving towards the final battle between Harry and Voldermort, it's disappointing to find it's rather brief and in truth anti climatic. Harry the boy now burgeoning into a man versus the snake faced despot surely should have been a crowning glory, but sadly not so. To compound this irritating disappointment, we then get the epilogue that is bogged down by aging make-up design that is almost laughable. But these are just annoyances, not film killers, for this has been a magical ride for 10 years. Fans will feel a gap in the heart now it's over, maybe even shed a Snape like tear as well? Yet ultimately it has been a triumph and the rewatchable factor for the whole series will always remain high. 8\/10","id":"5d74d60fc6006d0012485dbb","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5d74d60fc6006d0012485dbb","movie_id":12445}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Unfortunately this movie is the case of the trailer being a lot better than the movie. I was hoping for some nice revenge-movie with a kick-ass female agent. Unfortunately this movie does not really deliver on that. It is quite slow for starters. Sure, at times Mallory does kick some ass but a lot of the time is spent on flashbacks and much of these are really really slow.\r\n\r\nThe plot is a very standard and unoriginal one about agent getting double-crossed and subsequently deals out some pay-back. I have no problem with that. It is a valid setting for some nice action. The problem lies in the implementation.\r\n\r\nThe acting is never anything to write home about. You get the feeling all the characters are just reading of the script in order to get the scenes done and over with. As a consequence you never really get any attachment to neither the heroine nor the bad guys. Most of the movie I just sat and waited for the next action scene to begin. There are quite a few good names in this movie but, sadly, none of them are really allowed to \u201ctake the stage\u201d and give any real performance.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is a very mediocre and sometimes downright boring movie.","id":"5b0ec916c3a368717d00007d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b0ec916c3a368717d00007d","movie_id":70435}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"William Friedkin serves up Trailer Trash Neo-Noir with a side order of Fried Chicken. \r\n\r\nKiller Joe is directed by William Friedkin and adapted to screenplay by Tracy Letts from his own play of the same name. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Emile Hirsch, Juno Temple, Thomas Haden Church and Gina Gershon. Music is scored by Tyler Bates and cinematography by Caleb Deschanel. Plot finds Hirsch as Chris Smith, who because he is in severe debt to local thugs, hatches a plan to bump off his waster of a mother and claim the life insurance. Roping in the rest of his trailer dwelling family, he hires Killer Joe (McConaughey), a cop with a sideline in murder, but the Smith's have no idea just what price they will have to pay for his services.\r\n\r\nSo pulpy, so amusingly dark, Killer Joe is one of those films that will sit at the top of many film fan's best of lists for 2012. Yet if someone came up to me and declared it one of the worst then I certainly will understand. Undeniably it has no widespread appeal, you either get it or you don't, you will either laugh along with Friedkin and his dark observations or you will feel the whole thing is just too ugly to be entertainment. Man it's good to have Friedkin back pushing peoples buttons!\r\n\r\nFilmed in Texas in under three weeks, Killer Joe is a film that walks the fine line of misogyny and perversity for perversity's sake. But it never falls over that mark, even though these are scummy characters living in a scummy world, where there's sex and violence, and violent simulated sex and nudity; all of which is cloaked by a sweaty crime gone wrong caper. Much of the film is dialogue driven, rest assured this is very talky, but the director wrings out much tension and salaciousness from every character interaction, the slow-burn approach only heightening the sense of dread. When the finale comes, and it's a cracker-jack ending, there's an almost merciful release that it's all over. These are people you wouldn't want to hang out with ever, only there's Friedkin chuckling away to himself having made us spend an hour and forty minutes with this grime laden crew. If you feel like you need a bath afterwards, that's perfectly natural.\r\n\r\nFriedkin has garnered terrific performances from a top line cast. Hirsch (powder-keg), Church (naievity extraordinaire), Temple (virginal piggy in the middle) and Gershon (bold and suspicious), are all giving disturbing credibility to the material, but as good as they are they are trumped considerably by McConaughey. One of the most frustrating actors working today, much like Cage, a ream of poor movies adorn his CV, but once in a while he throws in a performance of such genuine quality that it begs to be acknowledged by his peers. Here as Killer Joe he lays on a Faust like menace, delivering his lines with clinically calm precision, yet still there's a glint in his eye, we know a black heart beats there but he can charm a snake out of its basket, a girl out of her underwear...\r\n\r\nUnflinching direction, bravura performances and neo-noir at its near best, one of the best films of 2012 so far. Well, to some of us at least.... 9\/10","id":"5c5baee49251413381b968a9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c5baee49251413381b968a9","movie_id":73567}
{"author":"Kenneth Axel Carlsson","content":"This is the story of the irishman, Danny Greene (Ray Stevenson), a corrupt union man, who ended up as sort of a Robin Hood figure of Cleveland. This is the story of how he rose in the ranks, making countless of enemies along the way. This is also the story of how they tried to kill him, but failed.\r\n\r\nI've never heard of Danny Greene, but the movie paints a nice realistic picture of the 1970s. This is not a pleasant world, but one where everyone is trying to get their piece of the cake. Danny himself is a hard one to figure out, is he good, is he bad? The one moment he helps out a friend in need, the next... he is killing people. I kinda like the fact that he is a person with both sides to him, allowing us to make up our own mind about him. Life is never as simple as most movies would like us to think it is.\r\n\r\nThe movie itself is a little messy, and I had expected a bit more from the cast, but of course, this is a movie based on actual events and characters, and of course that means that they can't change too much. In minor roles we find Val Kilmer and Christopher Walken, both excellent actors that tend to make quirky and interesting characters, but not so much here.\r\n\r\nLast words... a solid movie that gives us some insight into a man who really lived and breathed. It has some heart, for sure, but ain't all that interesting when it comes down to it. I probably won't ever see it a second time, but I definitely survived seeing it once.","id":"549f5ce9925141236b00047b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/549f5ce9925141236b00047b","movie_id":51209}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Sometimes God's love can be hard to swallow.\r\n\r\nA super slice of sub-urban horror crafted by Ben Wheatley, Kill List blends a number of classic British films but still remains very much its own beast. And what a beast it is. Part hit-man thriller and part Wicker Man pagan horror, plot spins hit-man for hire Jay (Neil Maskell) out of his troubled domestic funk, into a world of pain and misery. Taking on a job, he, along with his partner Gal (Michael Smiley), is given a list of names for them to track and terminate. The people and the places they confront are the darkest kind, which brings out Jay's black heart as well. All this while lurking around the edges of the frame is something mysterious, something that will bring Jay to his destiny.\r\n\r\nThere is a rawness to Kill List that strikes hard, a sort of real life documentary feel that marries up with the black material to chill the bones. It's proud of its grimness, even what humour exists within just feels like damaged goods. The sound and camera work gleefully add to the unsettling atmosphere, tactics which help alleviate the feeling that we are once again watching a formulaic British thriller with ideas above its station. But then the curve ball arrives and hits you on the head, bringing dizzy spells and some delirium. Which builds to a finale that will either leave you breathless or angry, but either way Kill List will not be ignored. \r\n\r\nImpressively performed by the cast, mounted with skill by Wheatley, this is a dark hearted British treasure that hopefully in time will be afforded the praise it deserves. 8\/10","id":"5637c17bc3a3681b5201d4a4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5637c17bc3a3681b5201d4a4","movie_id":74725}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Joyous Outrageous Trash.\r\n\r\nHobo with a Shotgun is directed by Jason Eisener and written by John Davies. It stars Rutger Hauer, Brian Downey, Gregory Smith, Molly Dunsworth, Robb Wells and Nick Bateman. Music is by Alexander Rosborough and cinematography by Karim Hussain.\r\n\r\nA homeless hobo (Hauer) hitches a freight train lift into Hope Town and finds a city imploding with corruption, violence, drugs and sexual deviance. Initially trying to keep out of the way and get on with his meagre existence, the hobo finally cracks and decides he can no longer sit back and watch such lawlessness. Helping himself to a shotgun from the local pawn shop, hobo goes on a one man killing crusade.\r\n\r\nBorn out of a trailer that accompanied the original full release of Rodriguez\/Tarrantino's Grindhouse venture, Hobo with a Shotgun is horror exploitation made with abundant glee. Blending Death Wish like vigilantism with 70s and 80s styled schlock, Jason Eisener has crafted an utterly tasteless, yet wonderfully entertaining piece of cinema. Violence is broad and completely bloody, as heads are exploded, bodies punctured and characters killed in a series of increasingly strange ways, while the characters that inhabit Hope Town are downright nasty and equally as weird. From bully boy Tom Cruise homage brother bastards Ivan & Slick, to a paedophile Santa Claus, and on to The Plague -two metal suited fetish killers sent to take out the hobo - it's welcome to bizarreville for sure.\r\n\r\nIt's all driven by a great turn from Hauer, who manages to play it with raw and subtle emotion, even as the rage takes control of him and he deals death as surely as he delivers a memorable line. Around him are a bunch of no mark actors, but this works in the films' favour, the material doesn't need star wattage to drive the motors, besides which, you will undoubtedly come out of the film remembering the characters these actors have played rather than the actors in the garbs. \r\n\r\nShot in suitably lurid Technicolor by Hussain and featuring an on the money score by Rosborough, all the elements for a Grindhouse feature fall into place. This basically does what the title suggests it will, yes it may at times veer towards crassness, and what social comment depth intended gets lost as Eisener gets carried away with the carnage. But under examination this is a whole bunch of fun that's made for adults who remember the movies from a past decade that this homages and parodies with devilish aplomb. 8\/10","id":"5c4ca3c80e0a260419d12088","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c4ca3c80e0a260419d12088","movie_id":49010}

The blurb about the film talks about \u201ctrue story\u201d but as usual it is more \u201cbased on\u201d stuff. \r\n\r\nThey apparently did not have much of a budget when doing this movie and I am fairly surprised that Sean Bean is in it. It is a quite simple and straightforward movie and could easily have been a TV-movie rather than a theatre feature. I probably would have been more harsh in my review if I would have made the effort to go to a theatre to watch it.\r\n\r\nIt is however, a fairly okay movie. It wont win any prizes for special effects but it has decent acting and a story that is not too bad. Sean Bean is good as usual but I do not think he gets the chance to shine like he does in some movies.\r\n\r\nThe ending feels a bit rushed though. Like we-ran-out-of-money-lets-wrap-it-up.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Operation Grendel\r\n\r\nAge of Heroes is directed by Adrian Vitoria and Vitoria also co- writes the screenplay with Ed Scates. It stars Sean Bean, Danny Dyer, Aksel Hennie, Izabella Miko, James D'Arcy, William Houston, John Dagleish and Stephen Walters. Music is by Michael Richard Plowman and cinematography by Mark Hamilton.\r\n\r\nPic is based on the real life exploits of James Bond creator Ian Fleming. This telling sees a unit of Commandos sent on a mission to the mountains of Norway to knock out an important German communication tower whilst purloining information to aid the war effort. \r\n\r\nIn truth it doesn't add a great deal to an already over stocked \"men on a mission\" sub-genre of war films, but there's enough excitement, explosions, potent character dynamics and military shenanigans, to keep things at the better end of a viewing experience. Cast are fine, all portraying familiar types seen in countless films of this ilk, the snowy Norwegian locations are a sight for sore eyes, and Vitoria does a nice job of giving his film an old fashioned feel - complete with the obligatory Nazi atrocity to add some venomous oomph to the plotting.\r\n\r\nThe inclusion of Izabella Miko on the mission sadly comes off as a token female shoehorn job, and I agree with what other reviewers have said as regards the finale, it does feel a bit rushed as this pic definitely could have done with another 15 minutes or so.

{"author":"The Movie Diorama","content":"Kung Fu Panda 2 excitedly kicks, punches and belly flops its way through overused visual humour. \u201cEverybody was kung fu fighting!\u201d much more so in this sequel when compared to its predecessor. The Furious Five were slapping Shen\u2019s army of diabolical wolves left, right and centre. Master Shifu prodding his stick conveniently during the climactic battle. And a plethora of other anthropomorphic beasts harnessing the power of said martial art. This very much felt like an animated martial arts feature, one aspect the original was sorely missing. However, despite DreamWorks\u2019 best efforts in continuing Po\u2019s search in becoming the Dragon Warrior, its quality offers no improvements. Unable to surpass the boundaries of family-friendly humour that reduces the visual splendour and narrative heft to progress the story onto the next level.\r\n\r\nPo, having realised who his parents truly are (not a goose...), must save China with the Furious Five from the malicious peacock Shen and his fascination with metallic weapons. DreamWorks constantly pump out family orientated animations with powerful morals every year. This sequel illustrating the ability to manipulate our past childhoods to shape the person we want to be. For Po, this meant ignoring the familial scars that Shen caused, producing his prepubescent abandonment. A notable moral that many should abide by, but unfortunately is weighed down by excessive comedy that diminished a vast amount of beautiful moments. Aside from the tantalising scene when Po finally discovered what happened to his parents, conveyed through mesmerising hand-drawn animated flashbacks, all other heartfelt examples were brutalised by Po\u2019s apparent requirement to exercise his bumbling personality. Black\u2019s prolific voice doesn\u2019t help matters, with a lack of sincerity to his vocal performance, but the frantic pacing and rushed sequences made for a frustrating central narrative.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say this sequel is poor, in fact it\u2019s just as consistent as its predecessor. Rather infuriating is all given the tender bamboo seeds that were lovingly planted, unable to grow into ferocious stalks. The humour, as overwhelming as it is, does provide characterisation to these animals. Po in particular. Making it hugely accessible for all members of all families to watch and enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe action sequences were splendid and vibrantly colourful, with some ingenious editing that made one chase scene resemble \u2018Pac-Man\u2019. The oriental aesthetics and environments built a beautifully inclusive world for the characters to roam in. The antagonist, Shen, was far more memorable and sinister in comparison to...ummm...I forgot his name. The snow leopard? We\u2019ll go with that. Mostly due to Oldman\u2019s vocal work that has a larger range than the entirety of his filmography (and that\u2019s saying something!). The red and black lighting was, at times, excessive in depicting \u201cevil\u201d and surprisingly dark. No, not thematically. It was literally difficult to see anything!\r\n\r\nAside from that, Kung Fu Panda 2 slaps. And punches. And kicks. But also tumbles repetitively due to Po\u2019s constant buffoonery. It does however set the third film up nicely, so guess I\u2019ll have to give that a go...","id":"5e2067c6f04d0100150fc51d","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2067c6f04d0100150fc51d","movie_id":49444}

{"author":"wilburKlick","content":"When it comes to violent film - I'm divided.  \r\nI don't go out of my way to watch movies about actual, historical battles, because I know that real people died (or were physically or mentally crippled); sons and daughters, sisters and brothers, mothers and fathers . . . even children.  The prospect of of reliving those tragic (even if heroic) deaths is too painful for me.  \r\n\r\nAnd yet, give me an alien invasion and I'm \"all up in that\".  \r\nI find the fantasy of war exciting, and yet I have to be aware of how such films glorify violence; glorify war.  I'm conflicted, enjoying this guilty pleasure.   \r\n\r\nI'm a little surprised by the low rating.  \r\nHave there been too many movies of this sort? a burnout by the viewing public?  A burnout - when it comes to war?  Another sign that we might be a war-weary nation \/ world?\r\n\r\nAs for me, I don't watch a lot of flicks, so I'm not \"burnt out\" when it comes to military action films.  So, this was not \"same-o, same-o\" for me.  \r\n\r\nI thought the script was impressively tight.  That applies to character development as well; quick snap-shot profiles; a glance, a nod and you had pretty much all you needed to know about this or that character.  \r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of the \"shaky-cam\", but I thought it was well employed in some of the battle scenes.  I've never been in such a situation, but I think the camera gave us that sense of heart-pounding, out of control terror that being shot at and bombed can produce; often no knowing even where the fire is coming from as you hunker down and question your very soul.  \r\n\r\nYes, this is a familiar theme - seasoned tough old lifer in charge of a bunch of kids - typical of many such films (Heartbreak Ridge comes to mind; many more).  \r\n\r\nI wonder, also, if there is more of a connection with military vets; something the civilian population can never really get (no offense; just fact; I served but never got shot at)? \r\nFrom my experience, I thought the military portrayal was pretty spot on (military gear, tactics, fallibility, rank, age differences, rancor, \"I got your 6\", sense of duty and dedication to mission; never give up, never surrender).  \r\n\r\nPredictable formula script?  sure, in some ways, but I found plenty of surprises as well.  \r\nMaybe if I watched this sort of film all the time, I'd be as cynical as many here.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed this film (gave it 8\/10; probably would have given it 7 1\/2, but it deserves better than what I see others giving it).  \r\n\r\nRecent revelations from sources such Bigelow and Elizondo, have all but confirmed that we are being visited by aliens.  And, who knows, maybe they will decide to harvest our water before we contaminate it any further, as we creep and crawl closer and closer to our own nuclear annihilation.","id":"5a4815220e0a26488c00775e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a4815220e0a26488c00775e","movie_id":44943}

{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"Flypaper is an unconventional 'whodunit' in the form of a screwball comedy. It starts off with a guy named Tripp (played by Patrick Dempsey) who walks into a bank to get some change and ends up in the middle of two simultaneous bank robberies, executed by two different gangs, one of whom highly professional, the other one very much the opposite. What follows is an idiotic muddle of story lines and plot twists, which overall is pretty funny and at times even hilarious. \r\n\r\nFlypaper's biggest asset is its wild array of stereotype characters, which certainly doesn't always work out, but in this case does so very well, mostly because of the clever writing. The dialogue is sharp and witty, and the way the characters are played out against one another is really the stuff of great comedies. One of the best characters is one called Peanut Butter, played by the great Tim Blake Nelson, who, together with his buddy Jelly forms a duo of laughably amateurish hillbilly bank robbers. The other team of (professional) bank robbers is set together of another great group of stereotypes, namely The Black Guy, The Jewish Guy and The British Guy (not their actual character names, just pointing it out), which in itself sounds like a \"three guys walk into a bar\" joke, and it actually works out funnier than you might expect. And then there's the group of hostages (all bank employees), all with their own crazy little character traits, paranoia and strange ulterior motives, more afraid of each other than of the people robbing their bank.\r\n\r\nI must admit, I didn't have great expectations for Patrick Dempsey, but he pleasantly surprised me with his knack for timing and delivery. His character is a completely hyper-active genius, brilliant with numbers and facts, dead-set on solving the strange mysteries that keep piling up in the bank as the robberies go on, and Mr Dempsey plays his role convincingly. Who knew McDreamy had a serious sense of humour. Ashley Judd is a reliable actress, and she can really deliver some good comedy too. But I have to mention one thing: it's really such a shame that all these actresses (who were never bad looking to begin with) have succumbed to the pressures of botox and fillers. She has a really pretty face, but now that she's obviously had some work done, her eyes look puffy and something overall just doesn't look right. The reason I say this is because it gets in the way of her acting, making her expressions a little screwy a times, and this somewhat ruins the experience when she's trying to deliver a certain emotion. And even in a light-hearted comedy, this can work against the quality of someone's performance. It's too bad, but fortunately Ms Judd still has plenty of talent to make up for it. Actually, all the actors are really good in their roles, they're none of them really big names, but obviously, that's not saying anything. There's only one case of miscasting, and that's Mekhi Phifer. He's a very fine actor, but obviously more suited for serious roles. He took his role way too seriously, maintaining a poker face even when everybody around him was acting like a bunch of goofs. And even when he was seemingly trying to be funny, he didn't really deliver. So, no more comedies for you, Mekhi.\r\n\r\nStory wise, Flypaper basically unfolds as an increasingly intricate game of \"Clue\", at one point even bearing some resemblance to a funny version of The Usual Suspects. The plot starts out pretty much literally thin as flypaper, but thickens throughout, without getting ridiculously over thought. The story has some inconsistencies throughout, but they're hardly any bother. And the ending is kind of a clich\u00e9, but let's face it, have you ever played \"Clue\" without saying 'I knew it all along!' at the end? Right. There's nothing that actually spoils the fun at any point. This is a semi-dark, adult comedy, with a healthy dose of profanity and crude humour, though innocent like a baby compared to Tarantino or Ritchie. Speaking of which, I sometimes got the feeling that director Rob Minkoff watched these two very closely and took notes, considering some camera techniques and directorial gimmicks he threw in here and there, which is OK up to some level, but not when your film starts to look like a silly rip-off (Snatch comes to mind...). Fortunately, Flypaper manages to keep true to a style of its own, simply 'borrowing' some inspiration from other great crime comedies. And there's nothing wrong with that.\r\n\r\nOverall, Flypaper is an entertaining Sunday evening-filler, somewhere in between indie and low-budget Hollywood. It may be somewhat forgettable but it's surely good enough to keep you in your seat from start to finish, and I would certainly recommend it for an evening of good fun.\r\n_(February 2012)_","id":"58ac44e8c3a36849cc01304c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ac44e8c3a36849cc01304c","movie_id":62046}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Junkhearts - Tortured Souls - Bad Seeds.\r\n\r\nJunkhearts is directed by Tinge Krishnan and written by Simon Frank. It stars Eddie Marsan, Candese Reid, Tom Sturridge and Romola Garai. Story has Marsan as Frank, an alcoholic ex-soldier suffering nightmares over an incident that saw him shoot a young mother. Frank strikes up an unlikely friendship with Lynette (Reid), a homeless girl sleeping rough on the streets. Once barriers are broken down, Frank takes Lynette into his home to stay, but it's not long before Lynette's drug dealing boyfriend comes a calling...\r\n\r\nFor the most part Junkhearts is a very gritty slice of British miserablism. The pic is populated by addicts and wannabe gangsters, in a part of London built of dingy concrete council abodes, and where single promiscuous moms struggle to keep a grip on their lives.\r\n\r\nDirector Krishnan suffered herself from PTSD, so she was on hand to ensure the great Marsan could do the role justice, while there's a refreshing street believability about young Reid's performance. The camera work is intense and deliberately intruding, with the sound work being hypnotic to add bleaker tones to the characterisations. \r\n\r\nThe harshness and hurts of addiction rings true here, as does the key betrayal plot line and the breakdown of Frank. Unfortunately the parallel plot line featuring Romola Garai undermines the grit and grime surrounding Frank and Lynette's world, and it sadly serves only to give the pic a somewhat disappointing ending. Whilst the introduction of gun and knife crime appraisals don't strike the requisite powerful chords.\r\n\r\nYet even with its flaws this is still an intense film, with Marsan on top form and some other technical smarts on show, it's well worth a look by anyone interested in a slice of some moody British underbelly. 7\/10","id":"56a59039c3a368389b009301","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/56a59039c3a368389b009301","movie_id":85529}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Hoping for a better job and pay, instead she discovered herself.**\r\n\r\nI think it was a much better film. I just wanted a good entertainment and I got that. Though the story is not fresh enough. In fact, it is comparable to the recent sports-biopic, I mean that came much later to this, 'Eddie the Eagle'. Looks even the filmed location was same. Quite similar theme when it comes to the sporting events, but there's a wide gap on how it was played and by whom.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'All about Steve'. Firstly, it was a sport film and then romance attached to it in the required opening slot. So pretty inspiring to focus on something in our life to reach the heights. There's no shortcuts, it's always a hard work. In the film, that concept was funnily told. Encountering a new world, and discovering new things. It includes friendship, love and dedication in what one believes in.\r\n\r\nGreat cast, except the love interest of Felicity Jones. He wasn't bad, but the chemistry did not work, even in the short span of their romance in the tale. Anyway, the romance parts were too clich\u00e9, but neglectable as it has little value. Because there are other reasons to like the film. The stunts are not extraordinary, just simple and realistic. The film will work for most of the people if they're not expecting too much. This is not some chick flick, a better film than that.\r\n\r\n_6.5\/10_","id":"58c1e827c3a36838310001b1","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c1e827c3a36838310001b1","movie_id":58232}

{"author":"Wuchak","content":"Looks great, nice action, but needed more depth\r\n\r\nAlthough the set-up of \u201cConan the Barbarian\u201d (2011) is the same as the 1982 version (raiders destroy Conan's village in Cimmeria and thus the barbarian seeks revenge) the story is otherwise completely different. The villains here are Khalar Zym and his witchy daughter, Marique, who seek to resurrect Zym's sorcerous wife, but they need to acquire the pure blood necessary for their Acheron magic.\r\n\r\nWHAT WORKS:\r\n\r\n\u2022Jason Momoa, as Conan, is excellent; far better than Arnie. It's hard to conceive of a better Conan. \r\n\r\n\u2022The Bulgarian locations are outstanding. \r\n\r\n\u2022The Costuming is more convincing than the '82 version. Conan's apparel, for instance, is more faithful to REH than Arnie's fur loincloth. \r\n\r\n\u2022Better acting than the '82 version, excluding James Earl Jones, of course.\r\n\r\n\u2022Brutal, thrilling action throughout with convincing swordplay (unlike the contrived \u201982 version). \r\n\r\n\u2022Corsairs, highlighted by Conan's comrade Artus, effectively played by likable Nonso Anozie. \r\n\r\n\u2022Excellent sets\/props; it definitely looks like the Hyborian Age. \r\n\r\n\u2022Good serious vibe, despite the cartoony, over-the-top last act. \r\n\r\n\u2022Rose McGowan as the witchy daughter is ee-vil and creepy. \r\n\r\n\u2022Ron Perlman as Conan's father. \r\n\r\n\u2022The whole opening sequence. \r\n\r\n\u2022I liked how the film stressed the closeness and love of Conan and his father. There's a correlation between true greatness and a close relationship with a strong father-figure and his example of excellence. \r\n\r\n\u2022You have to give credit to the filmmakers for effectively illustrating Conan's youthful days and life in a Cimmerian village in general, something Conan's creator never delved into in any detail.\r\n\r\nWHAT DOESN'T WORK:\r\n\r\n\u2022The film deviates from Robert E. Howard, albeit not as much as the '82 version. Regardless, it certainly adhered to REH's overall pulp vibe. I'd prefer to see one of REH's originals put to film, like \"A Witch Shall Be Born\" or \"Beyond the Black River.\" \r\n\r\n\u2022Stephan Lang as Zym makes a worthy enough villain for Conan, but he comes off too clich\u00e9d and cartoony, especially in the final act. James Earl Jones' Thulsa Doom worked better, likely because he was so unique. \r\n\r\n\u2022Rachel Nichols' Tamara is solid as the female protagonist, but she doesn't hold a candle to Sandahl Bergman's Valeria. \r\n\r\n\u2022The score is serviceable but pales in comparison with Basil Poledouris' score from the '82 version and \"Conan The Destroyer\" (1984). This score definitely won't be celebrated 30 years later like Basil's. Why didn't they just update Polerdouris' piece? \r\n\r\n\u2022There\u2019s too much \"Modern Blockbuster Syndrome\" that appeals to those with ADHD. \r\n\r\n\u2022Especially the over-the-top final act, which is way too comic booky. It's cartoony overkill, pure and simple. But, then again, it did bring to mind REH's \"Jewels of Gwahlur,\" so maybe it's not so far off the mark. \r\n\r\n\u2022The biggest flaw was that there wasn't enough depth. The film needed more 'downtime' to contrast the wall-to-wall action, like campfire scenes (which would better indicate distances), more camaraderie on the ship, more development of Conan & Tamara's relationship, etc. Although it had some of this, it wasn't enough. Action sequences naturally hold more weight when the audience cares about the characters. As it is, it's clear that the filmmakers wanted to make an action flick above all else and this weakens the film. \r\n\r\n\u2022Along with lack of depth was the lack of epic-ness or moving moments. The '82 film deviated from REH but at least it made up for it with depth and a sense of epic-ness. For instance, when Conan & Subotai make their stand against the riders of doom or Conan's moving victory salute, not to mention the potent love & death\/funeral scenes, etc. This 2011 version had glimpses of this, like when Conan is birthed on the battlefield then raised to the sky and when Conan's father expresses his love with his final act, but, again, it needed more.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: The filmmakers got a lot of things right, like Momoa as Conan and the authentic look\/feel of the Hyborian Age. The film's not bad at all and pulsates with energy, but it needed more depth, epic-ness and uniqueness to pull it out of its \"blockbuster\" mediocrity. It's a case of violence for the sake of violence, which gets dull by the 90-minute mark, plus the last act is just comic booky overload. The focus on wall-to-wall action limits the film's effectiveness. It lacks the confidence to chill and allow the characters to breathe. Still, it's a somewhat worthy Conan movie. It's serious and brutal; and, thankfully, lacks \"cute\" characters. It\u2019s arguably on par with \"Conan the Destroyer\" and superior in ways, not to mention leagues better than \"Red Sonja\" (1985) and \"Kull the Conqueror.\"\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 53 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-\/C+","id":"5b80ce3cc3a368656000549f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b80ce3cc3a368656000549f","movie_id":37430}

{"author":"CRCulver","content":"In the 2011 production LE HAVRE, the Finnish auteur Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki steps away from his usual Helsinki setting for the first in what will be a trilogy of films in Western European port cities. Always rooting for the underdogs, Kaurism\u00e4ki this time concentrates not just on the disenfranchised urban lower class, but on a socioeconomic strata arguably lower than them: illegal immigrants. Middle-aged shoeshiner Marcel (Andr\u00e9 Wilms), who lives in a run-down neighbourhood with loving wife Arletty (Kati Outinen) meets Idrissa (Blondin Miguel), a child who has found his way from Gabon to France inside a shipping container. Marcel decides to shelter the boy and see him on to England, his intended destination, but detective Monet (Jean-Pierre Darroussin) is on their heels.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the French setting, this remains a very Finnish film in its sparse dialogue and deadpan humour. Kaurism\u00e4ki yet again uses a very drab colour scheme and sets the film ostensibly in the present, but with cars, radios and rock music dating from the 1950s. Like nearly every film he has made, there is a musical performance by an oldies rock 'n' roll band, complete with pompadours and leather jackets. This is getting appallingly repetitive. Basically, if you've seen any two previous Kaurism\u00e4ki films, then you'll find almost nothing new in the aesthetic and even the plot.\r\n\r\nThat said, this is a more life-affirming film than his last, the absolutely bleak L\u00c4HIKAUPINGIN VALOT of 2006. Kaurism\u00e4ki is clearly concerned with the plight of those who would escape sub-Saharan Africa by any means necessary, and this leads the viewer to reflection, but his expos\u00e9 of detention centres and police harrassment becomes heavy-handed at times.","id":"5b8ac0a4c3a368520c01c75b","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b8ac0a4c3a368520c01c75b","movie_id":73532}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"**This is a long form review initially published in 2011:**\r\n\r\nThough it ran at over two hours, I did feel that it had plenty of room to go further than it did. I honestly felt like Red Skull could have had a film all to himself, and actually kind of suffered for making him as intriguing as he was.\r\n\r\nChris Evans was an interesting choice as the titular role of Captain America, given that he's already played American sweetheart Marvel Super Hero \"The Human Torch\" in _Fantastic 4_ and _Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer_. He didn't Oh-My-Gosh blow me away type-thing or what have you, but he was pretty great.\r\n\r\nSo far in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I'd slot Captain America clean in the middle. I liked _Iron Man_ and _Thor_ more, but _Iron Man 2_ and _The Incredible Hulk_ less. Marvel Studios stated that the movie they wanted to make was set in the 40's, even though the rest of Marvel Cinematic is modern-day. This was 100% the right move to make, why? Not because of the setting, aesthetics or direction, but because it's fuckin' smart. How do you have the world appreciate an Uncle-Sam loving upper-middle class white male military blindly-loyal patriot? You make him fight the God damn Nazis, that's how.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange, but I actually enjoyed the opening of _Captain America_ the most, which he spends a a meek, asthmatic Steve Rogers, yet to undergo the Deus Ex Machina Super Serum. It really showed the best of Evans acting ability, as well as the writing of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely whom together wrote _You Kill Me_ and The _The Chronicles of Narnia_ Trilogy.\r\n\r\nI watched it in 3D, which was more bearable than usual. As the films of MCU progress, each of them becomes more and more a prequel to _The Avengers_, _Captain America_ being the most to date. Despite its almost-entire lack of _Avenger_ cameos, this more than previous films felt like a prequel for what's to come, which is not strictly speaking a good thing.\r\n\r\nI had plenty of minor issues with _Captain America_, and though their was quite a number of them, all were minor, and ultimately, the only part of me that regrets watching it was the part that keeps thinking \"My fucking God, I have to wait a YEAR before _Avengers_ comes out?!\"\r\n\r\n79%\r\n\r\n-Gimly","id":"5b151dcc0e0a262df1008f28","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5b151dcc0e0a262df1008f28","movie_id":1771}
{"author":"PolyWogg","content":"PLOT\r\n\r\nSteve Rogers, a scrawny young man, wants to enlist in the US Army and go overseas to fight in WWII. But his size and health means his attempts at enlistment always end the same way -- a 4F rating. Until a scientist sees him and recruits him to try out for a special training program to create a super soldier.\r\n\r\nWHAT I LIKED\r\n\r\nThe Marvel universe sticks pretty close to classic script with him being given a serum that jacks his body into super muscle mode. He's already brave and smart, so it would seem like a no-brainer to send him overseas? But the guy in charge of his training doesn't want him, he's just one man, so Rogers ends up doing public relations back home. And he is quite shocked that the men overseas don't react as positively when they see him as the crowds back home. I really enjoyed the way they handle the first battle scene for him, basically him figuring things out as he goes, a far cry from his battle-hardened approaches later.\r\n\r\nI even liked his interactions with Agent Carter. I had thought it would be more subtle than it was, and I hoped we'd see a bit more of her operating on her own (after all, they gave her character a whole series on TV!), but she was second fiddle to the hero.\r\n\r\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE\r\n\r\nThe challenge with a lot of American movies of the war is that it is as if they are the only actors in the war, no allies, just them, and that level of nationalistic narrowmindedness is a bit grating. That may be a small gripe when the show is called CAPTAIN AMERICA, not CAPTAIN OF WORKING WITH ALLIES, but still, it's annoying. I also was disappointed there wasn't a lot more on Red Skull. His history, his abilities, other pursuits, all of it was left basically unreferenced. Sure, some of it shows up elsewhere in the Marvel universe, but a bit more crosswalk would have been nice. I felt he really wasn't that well-fleshed out as the uber villain he could have been.\r\n\r\nTHE BOTTOM LINE \/ TWEET\r\n\r\nAs an origin story, it lacks pizazz","id":"5c493dfa92514154484fc958","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c493dfa92514154484fc958","movie_id":1771}

{"author":"LastCaress1972","content":"Ambitious (maybe overambitious) Canadian zombie pic, set in Tennessee a few years after the end of the American civil war. The tale is told through the pages of the illustrated journal of our hero, Edward, as he returns home from the war to find a zombie outbreak taking hold, killing his wife and son, and following a brief flirtation with the concept of suicide, his continued attempts to carry on in a zombie (or \"Dead-Awake\", as he calls them) world. Along the way he meets and helps another guy who wants to rescue his sister from the clutches of a small but maniacal group of soldiers who have been experimenting on the living and the dead alike in search of a cure, and later they come across an old woman with a dark secret (that our protagonist doesn't stove this woman's head in when he learns her secret was in my opinion a flaw in the movie, but there you go).\r\n\r\nThe \"illustrated journal\" nature of the storytelling means a couple of things: Firstly, the film is heavily narrated. The narration is very good, done as it is by Brian \"Original Hannibal Lecter\" Cox, but there's a hell of a lot of it; so much early on in fact that I started to wonder if the film was going to be entirely dialogue-free, and that kept me \"out of\" the film, at least until it settled down a bit. And although I like a horror to take itself seriously, the narration went beyond serious into a layer of almost romantic yearning, like some of the po-faced introduction narrations that you get in videogames like Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion or similar. Secondly, many of what I guess would be the more grandiose set-pieces in the movie are animated, made to look like the sketches in his journal come to life. These animations are gorgeous, BUT they're clearly there because they're cheaper than staging whatever scene they're depicting, so instead of serving purely as the interesting narrative device that they're presented as (although they DO do that), they also serve as a reminder that this is a pretty low-budget film. Nowt wrong with that of course, but if the budget won't stretch, wouldn't it be better maybe to reign in the scope?\r\n\r\nDespite these (fairly big) drawbacks, the film should be applauded for trying - and largely succeeeding - to do something fresh with two genres at once. It's well worth a look.","id":"5207b338760ee3630e23ab94","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5207b338760ee3630e23ab94","movie_id":86305}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"If you start to watch this film expecting it to be another zombie flick you are going to be disappointed. You are more than likely going to find the movie boring and the special effects very poor.\n\nIt is however far from being yet another cheap zombie movie with a poor script and poor implementation. As a movie it is actually a reasonably well done one. It is, however, more a movie about one mans journey, both physically and psychologically, through a zombie outbreak which kills his wife and son.\n\nThe movie is certainly a low budget one. The zombies are actors with some grey and white make-up with some added tomato ketchup for effect. There\u2019s actually quite few persons in the entire movie and it all takes place in a small outdoor setting. I\u2019m tempted to say that the movie is a project of a reasonably talented motion arts student.\n\nThe movie is far from a bad one. It\u2019s not really what I expected though and I have to admit that I did find it to be a bit on the boring side at times.

The only viable link is that both children are writing a story...\r\n\r\nA joint Spanish\/English language production, Intruders is the sort of frustrating picture that has big and bold ideas on the page, but sadly on the screen in unfolds laboriously as it bites off more than it can chew. It came as no surprise to myself to find that upon opening internet sites frequented by horror fans, Intruders has greatly disappointed them. It's rarely frightening, sags desperately in the middle section, the pay off is weak, and ultimately it only skirts the boundaries of being a \"horror\" film.\r\n\r\nSo, the lack of shocks and suspense in bona fide horror terms needs to be tempered with genre expectation levels, this is more a family drama with fantastical horror elements lurking around the edges of the frame. This of course doesn't help anyone, like myself, who has bought into plot synopsis and the marketing strategy that accompanied the picture, but if able to see past the faceless demon that appears occasionally and promises something else? There's a decent and honest adult film pulsing away here.\r\n\r\nClive Owen plays the troubled father of the piece and he once again, as he did in Trust, shows that given this type of material he can deliver a performance of emotional substance. He's backed up by a very strong turn from young Ella Purnell as his daughter, and with the tech credits high - most notably Roque Ba\u00f1os' superb musical score - there is much to enjoy here.

{"author":"carcamuna","content":"I wrote the music for \"El Detective Cojines\" but I was also a film critic for many years. I have noticed there are no other reviews for this movie so I have decided to write my own in order to generate some interest in this great, little-known Puerto Rican comedy. The plot summary is provided elsewhere on this page so I'll just say that \"El Detective Cojines\" delivers on its promise to be funny. Writer-Director Radam\u00e9s S\u00e1nchez has taken elements of the private eye novels by Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett plus the Spanish classic \"Don Quixote\" and added ample doses of raunchy Caribbean style humor to the proceedings, concocting an irresistible laugh-fest that only prudish squares will not enjoy. Jaime Hamilton (star of the Puerto Rican cult classic, \"Celestino y el vampiro\") is perfect in the title role of the dedicated but hopelessly incompetent private eye, and receives great support from the late, great Argentinian actor Axel Anderson as an old codger trying to find his missing inamorata, Ivonne Caro as a mystery woman with one specific sexual hang-up and Ren\u00e9 Monclova as a feisty real estate agent who becomes a sort of \"Sancho Panza\" for the title character.

{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"'Rango' is typically one of those movies that can't quite be categorized into this or that little genre of comedy. Obviously, it's an animated film. Is it a kiddie movie? Well\u2026 kind of. Allow me to elaborate. The film starts off absolutely hilariously, with an accident, half a road kill and a journey through the desert turned into a maniacal chase as soon as a hungry hawk gets wind of Rango's presence. After meeting a lovely lizard named Beans, he ends up in the small town of Dirt. Where, after a good deal of bluff and dumb luck, he is appointed sheriff. So far, no harm, no foul, just good comedy. In fact, nearly-wetting-my-pants-laughing-out-loud-comedy.\r\n\r\nHowever, at this point is where it all turns just a little bit haywire. No real damage done, just a small sense of cluelessness as we go along. The story continues as though Gore Verbinski and John Logan were just trying to think of as many weird situations as they possibly could whilst forcibly trying to mash it up into one, cohesive storyline. Truth be told, seems like they were trying just a little bit too hard. It actually gets even a little bit boring here and there, where the pacing kind of sinks in up to the point where it all comes together and starts to make sense again. (Mind you \u2013 this could also be due to the fact that I was watching the extended version, not the theatrical one, but still.) But fear not, no real quality is lost, as 'Rango' provides some of the most excellent and funny characters I've ever seen in an animated movie. They also rounded up a perfect voice-cast, with Johnny Depp who doesn't sound anything like Jack Sparrow, but still adds the same kind of awkward quirkiness to his character. Alfred Molina's part is small but vital, and I'll bet you've never heard an armadillo with a perfect Mexican twang before\u2026 Bill Nighy is awesome as Rattlesnake Jake, and you can even hear a little bit of Davy Jones coming through sometimes. One of the best parts however, is done by Ray Winstone as Bad Bill. Who would expect some Wild West bad guy to have a cockney accent? Brilliant.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I must mention is the superb animation. Without a doubt the best I've ever seen from a non-Pixar production. Heck, even if it was Pixar it would have been their absolute best so far, and that's saying something. The animation parallels \u2013 or, dare I say, even surpasses \u2013 Finding Nemo. That's right; I said it, so sue me. Yep, Industrial Lights & Magic made a fan out of me.\r\n\r\nNow, back to the original question \u2013 is it a kiddie movie? Yes and no. Some parts are totally hilarious and will have your youngsters rolling over the floor with laughter. Other parts will sail right over their little heads as they are very much grown-up humour with references to classic films and jokes they simply won't get. (Is it just me or did I catch a tiny reference to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in the beginning?) Another factor is that some of the humour is a little grim and quite mature for small children, with some of the creatures smoking, swearing and even getting shot and\/or killed. Now, personally I don't know any children who would be upset by any of this, they see things that are much worse on a daily basis on the Disney channel. But then again, I'm not American, and it is my understanding that some American parents are hugely bothered by some of the elements in this movie. So I would recommend that you simply watch it first and then decide if you would like your children to see it. But honestly, I would try not to be too sensitive about it, it doesn't get scary anywhere and none of language or behaviour is really that bad. \r\n\r\nAll in all, 'Rango' is definitely a fun ride, and one of the few animated movies that will entertain as many adults as it will children.\r\n_(July 2011)_","id":"58ac4dbb92514158f6012dc8","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ac4dbb92514158f6012dc8","movie_id":44896}

{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"Rampart invokes a question which, in itself, is never a good sign when it comes to filmmaking. What went wrong when the end result is much lesser than the sum of its parts? \r\n\r\nHere we have the multi-talented Woody Harrelson, in the role of a psycho LA cop, flanked by great names such as Sigourney Weaver, Steve Buscemi, Ned Beatty and Robin Wright, in a film that, for all intents and purposes, offers great material and a thrilling story. Now, subtract from this sum the fact that most of these talents are shamefully underused, and then the factors of bad writing, bad direction, complete lack of build-up and the weakest ending in the history of weak endings... and what do you get? Proof that you need a lot more than a can full of great actors to make a great film, that's what.\r\n\r\nThis story is set in the late 90s. Harrelson plays Dave Brown, a Los Angeles police officer with 24 years of experience under his belt. He is a racist, misogynistic, violent brute and absolutely unashamed of it. He shares his house (and his bed) with two sisters, both of whom mothered his two daughters. At work, he will literally beat a confession out of any poor bastard under his interrogation. And when push comes to shove, he might just shove you into an early grave. Needless to say, this guy is not big on ethics. Until he himself is placed under interrogation by his superiors after he is caught using excessive force on a man who accidentally rammed his patrol car. This incident also sheds new light on a decade-old case of Dave killing an alleged rapist. All of this builds up to Dave's pending lawsuit.\r\n\r\nSo that's the basic story. Although \u2013 and this is a good thing \u2013 it's all pretty much a backdrop to a portrait of one seriously messed-up individual, and the people that get messed up by default.\r\n\r\nWriting this review, I find it hard to answer the original question. Because this is usually the part where I point out all the good things about the film, but I'm actually having trouble finding any good things to say about Rampart. Well, there's one (very!) good thing and that's Woody Harrelson. Matter of fact, he's the only reason I even finished watching. He's one of my favourite actors, so it's hard not to sound biased, but the versatility he brings to every project he's involved in, is quite astounding. And should he ever win an Oscar in the future, it will be long overdue. His portrayal of this character is absolutely convincing, but it's a shame that his performance here is almost completely wasted in this would-be art house drivel. Had this been a better film, the Academy might just have noticed him.\r\n\r\nInstead, what we're presented here is really nothing more than a lame excuse for an artistically made film. Technically, the only things that even remotely make it work are the good camera work and photography. The lighting techniques are very well applied and the image colouring and camera angles make the whole aesthetically well-made, and create an appropriate and heavy atmosphere. But that's pretty much it. Great actors completely fall by the wayside in small, uninteresting roles that could have been played by anybody. Sigourney Weaver plays a local DA which is a role that only shows her sitting behind a desk for about five minutes. Steve Buscemi plays the smallest and most insignificant role of his career as I-don't-even-know-who, and has no more than maybe six lines of dialogue. I don't know why he even bothered to show up. Robin Wright plays an attorney, whose relevance to the story becomes more and more puzzling throughout the film. And Ned Beatty? Oh yeah, he's in there somewhere too...\r\n\r\nI should point out that the bad quality of this film is to no account of the actors, they are all very good in their roles. The fault here lies almost entirely with the bad screenplay. There is simply no proper start, zero build-up and the ending is so painstakingly unsatisfactory that it feels like a bad hangover. The structure of story-telling seems completely arbitrary and fragmented, like they just threw a whole bunch of random scenes together and decided to call it a film. Director Oren Moverman has made a few critically acclaimed films, most notably his Bob Dylan pic 'I'm Not There', but Rampart is one film I wouldn't want on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\r\n\r\nWhat's probably the biggest let-down is the lack of shock value. The premise of Rampart is that it's about the incredibly violent nature of this one \"all-American\" police officer. And it's true, the things he says and does are pretty brutal, heartless and offensive. But all in all, it's actually not as bad as I thought it would be. I'm saying this not from a realistic point of view, because I think anyone who behaves like this should be behind bars, but as a film, it's just not interesting enough. The scenes depicting violence are few and far in between, and aside from the fact that he obviously uses women as a personal commodity, Dave Brown's character never really rises above your basic a**hole standard. There are \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 many more guys like this walking around, and I'm even sure there are cops worse than this one.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the film drags, the pacing is awful and in the end, it leaves you feeling utterly hollow and unsatisfied. Some people might appreciate Rampart as a vague kind of indie effort, but I'm usually one of those people. I 'get' vague. I 'get' artsy. I don't 'get' Rampart.\r\n\r\nIt's an utter waste of great talent and opportunity, and I would wish for all actors involved that this had been a better film, because they deserve it, but this film is a blemish on anyone's track record.\r\n_(October 2012)_","id":"58ac4ce0c3a36849f6011c7c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58ac4ce0c3a36849f6011c7c","movie_id":75622}
{"author":"Reno","content":"> Life as a farmer in the global warming era.\r\n\r\nThis is a Canadian French language film written and directed by a newcomer. I have seen lots of films about the farmers and it is not just one of them to get over with after a watch. It was thoroughly analysed and presented to us. I mean the urban people, we cause all kinds of pollutions and it is affecting the natural world thousands of miles away. I know industries are the main source of the pollutions, but they're operating because of our demand. The film was about a family, but the storyline had a slight influence on these topics.\r\n\r\nThe film sets in somewhere in the remote place of the Quebec province. Centres on a dairy farm couple and their teen son during one summer season. It was not like the previous year, severe drought already claimed one of the members of a family in the village and now this little family is about to go bankrupt. With the troubles ahead, how they're going to manage, especially after an unexpected accident that shattered their peaceful life.\r\n\r\nThe main focus was on the mother and her son. Those two actors played their characters wonderfully. But I thought they were real farmers, because there is a scene involving a cow giving birth to a calf and I was totally stunned for it. That looked so real to me, but there might be some tricks like CGI. Considering it a low cost film, that idea can be ruled out. Anyway, it was not all about the farm, most of the film was about their personal life. As a family working together to keep the dairy farm get going and individually theirs different interests.\r\n\r\n\"Farming wasn't the life I wanted.\"\r\n\r\nThis is widely unnoticed great drama and the reason is it is a small budget film, involving not so famous actors, the theme and of course the unknown director. But it has everything and even more than that, what a rural based subject should focus. Especially in the current world status as the global warming is a big concern, it committed to reveals why the agriculture is shrinking, and how those who are depending on them are directly affected was boldly told.\r\n\r\nYou know, like the title says, how precious the wetlands are for the dairy farm animals. It was not intended as a message film, but quite understandable if we use our common sense. Those people work hard, but sometimes theirs hard effort goes unpaid. Besides struggling to make a living, they too have a life and desires to fulfill.\r\n\r\nRegarding the narration, the introduction was very casual and had no end twist. But simply displayed the film characters as what the real rural people do when they're in such situation. Especially those mourning parts were well detailed, and as there's no other way, they fight to recover from the tragedy. Besides, a few other stuffs like finding sexuality, affair, drinking, smoking are all covered in it.\r\n\r\nThe film had almost the two hour run, but well developed and filled with quite unpredictable scenes. Film length is always a concern when it is a pure drama, because drama elements won't bring excitements, so one must have patience to watch them. But for this, I think everything worked out so well. I didn't find any boring parts, there's always something developed in the gaps to keep the viewers alive. The screenwriter must me praised for that. This film is worth a watch, but that does not mean a must see. Whatever, surely it needs the audience to spread the words around, how good it is.\r\n\r\n8\/10","id":"57c8b7cdc3a3685be9000d5c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57c8b7cdc3a3685be9000d5c","movie_id":86916}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**How do you define a parenting failure!**\r\n\r\nThe film was based on the book of the same name, directed by a Scottish director. A psychological thriller, one of those what some people feel uncomfortable watching it. The film holds a suspense from the past event, it is not going to be revealed until the final quarter. Till then makes us to keep guessing it. Followed by the pieces of flashback, the story of a mother who struggled to raise his first born, a boy named Kevin was told.\r\n\r\nIt takes us to show how happy she was before. Once she got pregnant, everything changed in her life forever. She failed to understand her son. Ever since he was a baby, he had given her a lot of trouble. When he reaches his teenage, it becomes even more complication to her to handle him and events around him. But a big blow is what shocks the entire neighbourhood and her life turns a hell.\r\n\r\nShot within a month. Tilda Swinton's one of the best, maybe the best of all the bests. She should have been nominated for the Oscars. I think that's one of the greatest snub ever. The supporting cast was amazing too, including John C. Reilly in a small part and particularly those Kevins from different ages. The overall tone was great, the atmosphere was created perfectly to the kind of story it dealt.\r\n\r\nI should have watched it earlier, but you know the type of film we look for and moods, all some times influence to miss a film narrowly. Anyway, it was on my watch list and I am finally going to scratch that off. It was a good film, but there's nothing special. The theme was strong, and seems like straight out of a real event, particularly these things are common in the United States. So if you are an American or familiar with the American culture, it will interest you.\r\n\r\nThis is not as inspiring film, but kind of factual film like parenting failure. The end was disturbing, yet there's nothing bold revelation in the narration. Definitely an interesting take, though blaming parents, especially the mother was kind of disappointing, as well as depressing. That's why the tale was commenced since pregnant till the final twist. Actually, it was the editing tricks that make the film to have a twist. Otherwise, it is a straightforward story. Not bad for viewing once. It was slow and too long, if you think you can manage that, then you could try it.\r\n\r\n_6\/10_","id":"5844682fc3a368472200c46c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5844682fc3a368472200c46c","movie_id":71859}

The Tyrannosaurus Rex was supposedly both apex predator and pure scavenger, a creature with vastly powerful jaws that vanquished the innocence of flora and fauna. Considine\u2019s directorial debut depicts the uncompromising wake of destructive behaviour. The hollow remains of melancholic shells, optimistic perspectives absorbed by choleric tendencies of begrudged souls. The bitterness of tainted realities corrupting the individuals who follow faith. Samaritans. The helpful aiding the helpless. A religious follower, Hannah, working at a charity shop, offering solace to a detestable man, Joseph.\r\n\r\nA racist. An antisocial behaviourist. A wounded individual, dejected from life, extending revulsion upon the masses. Drunkenly murdering his pooch. Whilst the early demise of his wife acts as a catalyst for his abhorrent tolerance, Considine delicately infers various strands that trigger his enragement. Bipolar disorder. Schizophrenia. Other psychological diagnostics as a result of his vehement solidarity. Never addressing these, only inferring, the visual snaps within Mullan\u2019s guttural performance provide hints to his character\u2019s psychosis.\r\n\r\nThis is a man who has nothing left to live for. A disorderly soul who numbingly drowns his sorrows with booze. Resented by family and society. So when Hannah graciously opens her arms to his wounded personality, his temperament is momentarily suspended. The warm embrace of a higher being. The touch of God. Whilst not viscerally displaying signs of tranquility, verbally slating faith and stating \u201cGod Still thinks he\u2019s God\u201d, his first encounter of benevolence alters his behaviour. He repeatedly returns to the charity shop that she works at. A chance for redemption. But Joseph isn\u2019t the only injured soul.\r\n\r\nHannah resides in an abusive relationship. Slapped. Punched. Urinated on. Sexually assaulted. Her voice suppressed by the overwhelming power of man, only relying on religion to guide her morality. Colman may play the victim role in this unflinching drama, but her character comparatively challenged Joseph\u2019s personality. See, they both are the same. Like the eponymous extinct creature, they destroy. Both the surrounding metaphysical environment, and themselves. Testing the boundaries of their capabilities and thresholds for personal resentment. \u201cAn animal can only take so much punishment and humiliation before it snaps\u201d. A resonant line that boisterously sums up the entirety of living nature itself.\r\n\r\nConsidine, for the hour and a half runtime, produces an unrelenting drama that will drain your emotionality. When the credits roll, you will feel nothing. And that\u2019s the point. Through all the anger-induced destruction and tonal annihilation, the only remnants that remain are nothing. Just the void of two similar individuals seeking redemption from their wounded realities. Colman electrifies with her balance of fragility and yearn for happiness. The instant switch from tranquil to tempered was unparalleled. Pain and fear hiding beneath her false exterior. It was sensational. Mullan complementing her physical instability by giving a resounding central performance. Terrifyingly exceptional. Marsan also, as the abusive husband, horrifying audiences with an incredibly realistic portrayal.\r\n\r\nIrrefutably, without a doubt, one of the most difficult watches of the decade. And whilst certain elements could\u2019ve been removed or refined, the soundtrack failed to enhance the drama and the conclusion needed more time to simmer, Considine has undoubtedly crafted an encapsulating drama riddled in brutality and self-destruction. There is no message. No theme. Just the portrayal of hurt. Hatred incarnate. Two opposing personalities, tainting each other to produce an equilibrium of natural predatory nihilism.","id":"5e2072bc0102c900113c2c16","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5e2072bc0102c900113c2c16","movie_id":76543}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"This place is nothing but chaos. Your God doesn\u2019t even come here.\r\n\r\nTexas Killing Fields is directed by Ami Canaan Mann and written by Don Ferrarone. It stars Sam Worthington, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Jessica Chastain, Chloe Grace Moretz, Jason Clarke, Annabeth Gish and Stephen Graham. Music is by Dickon Hinchliffe and cinematography by Stuart Dryburgh. Film is based around real events involving the many murders of women whose bodies have been found in a desolate area of road and wasteland between Houston and Galveston.\r\n\r\nAmi Canaan Mann is the daughter of Michael Mann, one of the masters of modern day crime story movies, so it\u2019s not very surprising to see Ami, for her sophomore production, venture into murky waters. Texas Killing Fields is a bayou noir, where although the title hints at human devastation unbound, it\u2019s actually a slow burning skin itcher more concerned with the people investigating crime than that of the perpetrators. How the sorry events affect all who come in to contact with the crimes at the film\u2019s core, is what drives Texas Killing Fields on. Sadly the screenplay takes on board too much and nearly derails an otherwise very good movie.\r\n\r\nIf it comes down to atmosphere and technical smarts in achieving such? Then this is one of the finest of recent times. There\u2019s a constant sense of broody foreboding throughout, the haunting landscapes are all gnarly and spectre like, the whole area literally stinks of death and misery. Even when the story is away from the fields of the title, there\u2019s a mood of despair filtering out from Mann and Dryburgh\u2019s lenses, the hot Texas weather draining every ounce of sweat from the emotionally troubled detectives. All of the atmosphere is helped considerably by Hinchliffe\u2019s music, which piggybacks the misery with ominous bluesy tones.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately all this deft atmospheric craft can\u2019t stop the screenplay from being annoying. A sub-plot involving Worthington and Chastain as ex husband and wife is as pointless as it gets, which simultaneously wastes Chastain in the process. The makers have chosen to actually have suspects front and centre for the crimes on screen (unlike the real life cases, most of which remain unsolved), well they intend to keep it mysterious, but anyone paying attention will catch on quickly enough. There\u2019s also problems with the sound mix, which at times is appalling, rendering some crucial dialogue exchanges as inaudible.\r\n\r\nCast are good, especially Morgan and Moretz, and Mann shows a good hand at action sequences to compliment her astute mood setting skills. But this still feels like a misfire, and subsequent critical appraisals and internet rating systems have it as just above average. That\u2019s a little unfair, there\u2019s much for the neo-noir\/crime movie crowd to get enthralled by here, but Mann may need to sharpen up her story telling whiles to fully bloom her undoubted potential. 6.5\/10","id":"5377cd34c3a368551e002279","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5377cd34c3a368551e002279","movie_id":72477}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Caged animals? Unleash the narrative beast please!\r\n\r\nIf ever there was a wasted opportunity to add another Great British prison movie to the roster headed by Alan Clarke\u2019s incendiary Scum, then Screwed is it. The credentials were promising. Based on the real life memoirs of Ronnie Thompson, an ex squaddie who post a tough tour of duty joined the prison service and apparently found another kind of war on the inside, and the adaptation to screen is headed by Brit thespian bad boys Noel Clarke, Frankie Harper and James D\u2019Arcy. Yet what unfolds for the duration of the pic is the standard raft of clich\u00e9s we movie fans have seen time and time again.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s some early promise that maybe this will have something to say as regards a returning war veteran, hints that the screenplay will have caustic asides on the British penal system \u2013 and the problems inherent within our prisons, but it never delivers, instead choosing to macho everything up in such a fanciful fashion you have to wonder exactly what is actually based on facts? There\u2019s also the small matter of the fact the whole picture plays as very similar to Phil Davis\u2019 excellent 1995 football hooligan movie, i.d. Only  there it was an undercover policeman getting in feral with his work, here it\u2019s a prison officer doing likewise. There\u2019s even a sex scene that is lifted straight from Davis\u2019 movie.\r\n\r\nHaving not read Thompson\u2019s book, \u201cScrewed: The Truth About Life As A Prison officer\u201d, something which I intend to correct in the immediate future, I can\u2019t vouch for the veracity of this adaptation to screen. However, the film feels empty, like it\u2019s following a guide book written by the British press on how they \u201cthink\u201d our prisons operate, fuelling the horror fire of what filmic adaptations over the decades have led us to believe are regular occurrences. Only Thompson knows the truth, both of his experiences and of how his book has been translated on screen, but all things considered it\u2019s a lazy same old same old film. 5\/10","id":"539e630cc3a368724f00059f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/539e630cc3a368724f00059f","movie_id":75657}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Pulpy Neo-Noir in the Australian Outback.\r\n\r\nSwerve is written and directed by Craig Lahiff. It stars Emma Booth, Jason Clarke, David Lyons, Vince Colosimo and Travis MacMahon. Music is by Paul Grabowsky and cinematography by David Foreman.\r\n\r\nIt was done absolutely no favours by the marketing department, the studio executives clearly not having a clue what sort of film they had on their hands. Even the home format releases are adorned with enticing slogans such as \u201cThe New Mad Max\u201d and etc, which is utter tosh and only of use to dupe high energy action film fans into buying the product.\r\n\r\nSwerve is a clinical piece of neo-noir, it stabs its tongue into its bloody cheek whilst adhering with great success to the conventional rules of film noir. The characterisations, the triple pronged narrative front and visual ticks are all here, with a healthy slice of sly humour sprinkled over the top of things.\r\n\r\nStory will be familiar to purveyors of noir and its devilish off-shoots. Man comes across the remnants of an auto-mobile crash, bringing him into contact with a gorgeous lady and her less than stable husband. Oh and there\u2019s a suitcase full of cash as well. From there it\u2019s welcome to noirville \u2013 Oz style, as characters battle hard to keep out of the sticky cobweb woven by Lahiff.\r\n\r\nViolence and action marries up with the cunning machinations of the characters, where of course nothing is ever as it seems, the means and motivations shady at best. Grabowsky serves up a quirky music score that probably shouldn\u2019t fit an Australian neo-noir, but it really does, especially upon reflection of the story at pic\u2019s culmination. \r\n\r\nLahiff and Foreman offer up some super cinematography. The Australian vistas are sumptuous, the sun drenched back drops perfect for a sweaty tale of dupe, divide and domination. Classical noir visuals are used with great effect, as shadows and rippled reflections drive home the psychological discord pulsing away in the plot.\r\n\r\nBooth (The Boys Are Back), Clarke (Texas Killing Fields\/Lawless) and Lyons (Save Your Legs!) turn in crackling performances for their director, with Booth standing out as she sizzles and sauces the femme fatale role that shows an acting talent few give her credit for.\r\n\r\nProblems exist with a couple of the action sequences, Lahiff not a dab hand at constructing with conviction. Elsewhere the comparisons with films of a similar ilk, better ones, serve a familiarity factor that some may find hard to forgive (Lahiff practically remaking his own Fever from 1989). Yet this deserves better than its current low ranking on internet sites. A victim of poor marketing as votes from those not expecting a neo-noir have been held against it. Neo buffs should check it out. 7.5\/10","id":"53e5526c0e0a2628d50001b0","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/53e5526c0e0a2628d50001b0","movie_id":99758}
{"author":"tom_tagliente19","content":"**The Space Shuttle** is an extraordinary film that tells the story of the incredible courage, character, and dedication of the men and women who served as its author for thirty years. Narrated by film and television icon William Shatner, _**The Space Shuttle**_ is a detailed and fascinating look at what went into this complex vehicle's creation, flight, and eventual retirement. The shuttle program, which ran from 1981 to 2011, is the focus of this documentary.\r\n\r\nThis film also employs some of the most uplifting music ever scored for television and motion pictures. Emmy Award winner, Bear McCreary (_Battlestar Galactica_, _The Walking Dead_, and _Da Vinci's Demons_) and Hans Zimmer (_The Dark Knight_) and others, were looked upon favorably enough to have their music featured in this NASA produced documentary that begins with the start of the space program, ends with the final launch and landing of the space shuttle, and everything else in between, including the tragedies of Challenger and Columbia. It is too bad the producers failed to include their names as well as those of the other composers in the closing credits.\r\n\r\nRunning 80 minutes, this feature-length film is not just a great piece of motion picture watching for historians and fans of the United States Space Program alike, it is also a great story for children and adults of all ages. It covers a wide spectrum of the human condition and highlights beautifully the heritage we as a nation have endeavored to share in since the early 1960's.\r\n\r\nWilliam Shatner, the actor who played the heroic and charismatic captain of the U.S.S. Enterprise on the hit science fiction series, _Star Trek_, is your guide on this journey to the final frontier. His background in film and television is as storied as the history of the space program. And, he pulls off the narration with the wit and energy that he brings to all of his performances. The hiring of William Shatner as the narrator for this film was a winning choice by NASA.\r\n\r\nThis story is a factual, direct, and precise accounting of the every man's journey into the self, through the looking glass of the windows to space and beyond. **The Space Shuttle** gets 5 our of 5 stars from me. It is worth watching one time, or one thousand times. It is just that good!\r\n\r\nIf you want to meet the men and women who lived their lives on the wings of a dream as old as man himself, then you owe it to yourself to watch this film. It will move you and make you feel a part of this triumphant era in manned space exploration and discovery all over again, or for the very first time.","id":"523e1673760ee372465f9cea","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/523e1673760ee372465f9cea","movie_id":102538}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"It's not what a lawyer tells me I must do, but it's what humanity, reason, and justice tell me I ought to do.\r\n\r\nAfter his wife (January Jones) is brutally raped, New Orleans teacher Will Gerard (Nic Cage) gets involved with a shadowy vigilante group run by a man called Simon (Guy Pearce). A favour for a favour to get justice seems viable, but all is not as it seems...\r\n\r\nTo be frank it's just another in a long line of vigilante thrillers that get trundled out every other year. Rarely does one, certainly in the more modern era of film making, have something viable to say, to challenge the thought process of the viewers. Justice (AKA: Seeking Justice) starts off very promising, grabbing the attention whilst having an atmospheric texture about it. Sadly come the mid-point things just get daft (yet Cage stays ultra serious throughout) and in spite of the makers trying to add in some twisty thriller conventions, all the potential (and promise) for thought provoking depth has long since gone.\r\n\r\nThat said, as an intrigue based drama it's a decent enough watch, with director Roger Donaldson (No Way Out\/Thirteen Days) adept in the staging of suspenseful sequences. Yet the lack of kinetic action is sorely felt, the over all feeling being one that Donaldson and crew were not quite sure which way to take the picture. Should we keep things shadowy and suggestive? Or should we have live wire chases and dastardly peril? Justice only winds up as an uneven blend of ideas. While wasting Xander Berkeley and the New Orleans locations is a crime in itself.\r\n\r\nNot bad exactly, above average in fact, but just forgettable and another wasted opportunity to add meat to a hot topic in film form. 6\/10","id":"5557d6cbc3a3687782007750","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5557d6cbc3a3687782007750","movie_id":74998}

Stephen Campbell Moore (Debelzaq), Stephen Graham (Hagamar) and Robert Sheehan (Kay) accompany the Knights.\r\n\r\nThis is basically the American version of \"Black Death,\" a European film released around the same time. Both movies are dark, gritty and brutal in their depictions of Medieval Europe, but \"Season of the Witch\" is more of a stereotypical blockbuster with modish protagonists, amusing one-liners and CGI-laden climax. \"Black Death\" is deeper, more thought-provoking and realistic, which is why I give it the edge in overall value (see my review).\r\n\r\n\"Season\" is the more conventionally entertaining movie and anyone who appreciates Dark Ages-based flicks are highly encouraged to check it out. Films which come to mind include \"In the Name of the Rose\" (1986), \"Kingdom of Heaven\" (2005), \"Robin Hood\" (2010), \"Ironclad\" (2011), \"King Arthur\" (2004), \"Dragonslayer\" (1981), \"Red Riding Hood\" (2011), \"Tristan + Isolde\" (2006) and \"Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves\" (1991). It's as good, or better, than any of these.\r\n\r\nThe colorful Medieval cinematography (castles, dungeons, villages, dark forests and breathtaking mountains) is mind-blowing and the two protagonists are great with their amusing rapport. Furthermore, Foy is easy-on-the-eyes. Look out for a thrilling rope-bridge crossing \u00e0 la \"Sorcerer\" (1977). Although the climax is over-the-top cartoony, the tone up to that point is quasi-realistic, similar to \"Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves.\u201d\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 35 minutes and was shot in Austria, Hungary and Croatia with reshoots done in Louisiana.

No expectation levels are set other than to not be insulted, so by and large this does a job. This falls more in line with a comic book adaptation that has no desire to set up a broody and conflicted hero, no hidden agendas or metaphors in the villain ranks, so yes! It's got a little campy flavouring to it. Which is fine if that is what you ordered.\r\n\r\nThe effects work is very effective, though the sequences involving one of the villains, Parallax, are hindered by it being quite simply a very silly looking being. The story has some credible complexities about it, but the writers strain to keep it simple enough for a younger audience - which is both a blessing and a curse since it becomes uneven and corny whilst still retaining a watchable fun factor. The acting is only fine, but again this is because the script is never sure when to give emotional heft to the characters, or when to add some dramatic vulnerability.\r\n\r\nIt's a safe superhero film, a creamy desert to satisfy the sweet palate, maybe one that is flavoured with Chartreuse?

Great Wall My Love can be enjoyed simply as a road movie-cum-odd couple romance, with two highly engaging performances from its leads (China's TONG Dawei \u4f5f\u5927\u70ba and Taiwan-born Cherrie YING \u61c9\u91c7\u5152) and bright, positive photography by ace Taiwan d.p. Jong LIN \u6797\u826f\u5fe0 (Eat Drink Man Woman \u98f2\u98df\u7537\u5973 (1994)) of locations in Shanxi, Gansu, Ningxia and Inner Mongolia. An actor who hasn't always justified his star status in movies, Tong (I Love You \u6211\u611b\u4f60 (2001), Lost in Beijing \u82f9\u679c (2007), The Flowers of War \u91d1\u9675\u5341\u4e09\u91f5 (2011)) here exudes a genuine charm as a young private detective who finds himself falling for his quirky client. But it's Ying, whose career started promisingly in Hong Kong (Visible Secret II \u5e7d\u9748\u4eba\u9593\u2161\u3000\u9b3c\u5473\u4eba\u9593 (2002), Throw Down \u67d4\u9053\u9f8d\u864e\u699c (2004)) a decade ago but lost traction during the mid-noughties, who dominates the movie in perhaps the best performance of her career. Animated and sexy, and a natural comedienne, Ying makes the role of the mercurial Chun-chun far fresher and more substantial than it seems on paper \u2014 and likable rather than annoying. Her chemistry with Tong is what drives the movie and prevents it from becoming just a glorified travelogue.\r\n\r\nThere's not a mention of politics in the entire film. Instead, Great Wall is more about trust: on the surface, Chun-chun's trust in men in general, though by extension Taiwanese trust in mainland China. To the credit of director Liu and star Ying the tone is kept light while still managing emotional undertow, and even the supporting performances are deftly drawn in limited screen time (Kelly KO \u67ef\u7d20\u96f2's mother, DONG Xuan \u8463\u7487's jealous work colleague). A champion of then-unfashionable mainstream film-making (Kangaroo Man  \u888b\u9f20\u7537\u4eba (1994)) at a time when Taiwan cinema was trapped in an arty, festival ghetto of its own making, Liu, based in Beijing for several years, shows no signs of her 10-year lay-off since her last movie, Woman Soup \u5973\u6e6f (1999). At a technical level it's very smooth, and slides along effortlessly, even when not much is happening apart from the characters riffing off each other in beautiful locations.\r\n\r\nLess use of manga-like animated inserts (which mark the film as rather chick-flicky Taiwanese), and B&W flashbacks to the father's Mainland youth, would have been better \u2014 and allowed the film to work itself out just in contemporary terms between the two leads. But at the end of the day Great Wall still packs an emotional clout thanks to its simple, unaffected charm and quiet humour. The Chinese title means Chasing Love.","id":"5367c62f0e0a2647db005df4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5367c62f0e0a2647db005df4","movie_id":268288}
{"author":"GDawson2","content":"No Strings Attached is romantic comedy starring Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher. Now, I'm not a prolific watcher of the rom-com genre and honestly I've probably only seen a few of them throughout my entire life to this point. I bring this up because it seems like most of the criticisms people have of this film deal with the idea that it's not all that original and the only thing it did differently was add in foul language. I, on the other hand, really enjoyed this film for what it is. I think this is primarily because I'm still pretty inexperienced with the rom-com genre, but I also think it's because there's nothing really \"wrong\" with this film. Does it lean more on romance than comedy? Sure, but I actually appreciated that choice. Is the story about as surface level as it gets? Yes, but I also think that the chemistry between Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher largely makes up for that flaw. I knew, along with everyone else who has seen this film, how it was going to end the entire time, but I was still interested in how it would get to that point, and I can't say that I was dissatisfied when the credits rolled. \r\n\r\nIn the end, No Strings Attached is a perfectly fine romantic comedy.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Three Billy Goats Gruff.\r\n\r\nWritten and directed by Mike Flanagan, Absentia finds Tricia (Courtney Bell) and Callie (Katie Parker) as two sisters who come to believe that the underpass nearby could be linked to the many disappearances in the area.\r\n\r\nA slow burn indie horror is not everybody's idea of a good time, but Flanagan has crafted a smart atmospheric chiller, one with a nifty fairy tale fantasy bubbling away under the surface. Narratively it's low-key, though the air of grief and terror is palpable. The setting is a low rent area of Los Angeles, a place where the girls are told to always keep the doors locked, with the ominous underpass haunting the edges of every other frame.\r\n\r\nFlanagan filters his story through the urban locale while populating it with characters who are haunted by something unseen, or by others who are troubled by personal issues (Tricia's husband disappeared 7 years ago and Callie is fighting a needle habit). The formula scares are kept to a minimum, Flanagan choosing to imbue the story with a sense of dread, toying with the sisters and us the viewers that there just may be something truly awful lurking just out of the eye line.\r\n\r\nThis is not a creature feature, like The Relic or Mimic, this is a different horror film to those. The horrors are born out of what you don't see, or what you barely glimpse, just like the classic horrors of yesteryear, with Flanagan cheekily dangling ambiguity into the bargain. It's unnerving and sad, creepy yet cunning, and a refreshing experience for those tired of big effects driven horror movies. If you like the slow burn less is more approach, with well written human drama in the bargain? Then give this a chance. 8\/10","id":"5623acbec3a3680e1600d23e","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5623acbec3a3680e1600d23e","movie_id":74777}
{"author":"Reno","content":"**Finders keepers! Is that so!!**\r\n\r\nThe modern black and white film. Probably first for me from the Japanese film. As usual I wondered why they chose it that way to make, then once watched it, actually while watching it, I realised it was so perfect tone for such narration. Because this is a teen film, but not the common one with commercial value. That does not mean it is so boring. It's still very much gives a normal cinematic experience like watching of the old film. The characters, events, all were developed constantly. So even though it ran close to two hours, thoroughly engaged that anybody can hook up with it undisturbed till the end.\r\n\r\nFirstly the cast. Like usual, I know no one. But they all were great. Especially the lead girl. The film took time in the initial stage to give the impression what kind she's, when it comes to society. She's not a self type, but always makes the decision carefully after investigating the matter. On one such situation where this tale takes place. That one day she finds a wallet on the street with big amount in it. So like a good citizen, she decides to return, but it takes a twist, then the sum ends with someone who needed it the most.\r\n\r\nThe real twist follows after that when her other two friends come to know about it. Putting her in a tight rope walk position. After all, she decides to cope and then the tale taking many unexpected paths, till coming back to where it all had started. By that time it has been a hell of a ride for her in the past few weeks. Still, she looks to make things right, and so the narration reaches its finale by revealing the remaining thing that what has to be told.\r\n\r\n> -xX] Dirty money getting dirtier. [Xx-\r\n\r\nApart from the actors, the writing and direction are the next best. I totally did not expect such story. It was youthful, as well as realistic. Kind of inspires, but only to see in this film. Because of the Japanese cultural difference from the rest of the world. For their kind of mindset, when one finds a wallet full of money, their average thinking what to do with it was completely different than most of the remaining world. So such tale possible only here. Could be I'm being a Japanophile, I might find every bit related to Japan is charming. Hence saying all these.\r\n\r\nFor such a wonderful title name, the film being a black and white is a shame. Especially in the end scene. At least that part should have been colour. You would know what it is and why I said that when you watch the film. That was not the best part of the film, yet would have been a much awesomer. Coming back to the story, not completely the best script. There were too much happened in the middle sect. Even the twist was not that surprising. As well as the sentiments.\r\n\r\nI expected the end to be as much as possible a tearjerker. But it was too realistic, and when under-developed character, plot makes into the mainstream narrative, such thing happens. I mean compromising, to end like nothing had happened. So if a few those who saw it was not satisfied, then that could be because of the way it had concluded. Not that the overall film was bad. Even though the film was long, it lacked depth on the other side.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the film was focused from one character, so they had to keep the rest of the film same way. In a way, that's how the real life happens. So, this is a good film. I did not immediately liked it either. I think it is worth a watch, but only some people would realise that. If you are a fan of drama films, then you could be one those who might enjoy it.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"5a771f3c9251410594045e7a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a771f3c9251410594045e7a","movie_id":84167}
{"author":"John Chard","content":"Tough to recommend, but very much a quality piece of work.\r\n\r\nThe subject of paedophilia is naturally never going to be a topic that has people rushing out to theatres. It is what it is and it rightly induces horror and repulsion in straight thinking adults. Yet to simply stick our heads in the sand and ignore the issue is never the way to go, thankfully some directors are prepared to take up the hot baton and produce pictures to trouble and provoke thought in equal measure. Austrian film maker Markus Schleinzer has produced one such film, which is incredibly bold for his debut feature.\r\n\r\nStory explores the relationship between a middle aged paedophile played by Michael Fuith and the young boy he keeps locked in a secret basement room at his home, the youngster played by David Rauchenberger. The youngster is not held in some dark and damp room with no light, he is not chained up, Michael has in his own mind provided a loving and healthy home for his captive. He clearly loves the boy, watches TV with him, cooks him meals that they then eat together as if a \"normal\" couple. It's this banality that is so chilling, where coupled with how we see Michael functioning as a normal hard working man by day, really gnaws away at the senses.\r\n\r\nThankfully, and rightly, the sexual abuse side of things is not shown, nobody wants to see that. The horror comes in the implications, or the aftermath and preludes to what our mind's eye is being prompted to create. There are extended periods of silence throughout the picture, often dialogue is clipped and kept to minimum to urge the viewers to piece together what is going through Michael's mind. This is the strength of Schleinzer's movie, he's not judging or sermonising, he's presenting a scenario that on the surface to the people outside of Michael's basement secret, is normality, and it's that that is harrowing. Monsters live and move amongst us, fact! But how come we never notice them? It's this that Schleinzer so subtlety has his film prod us with.\r\n\r\nA bunk bed construction scene has never been so chilling as it is here, and you may - like me - never be able to listen to Boney M again without your mind wandering elsewhere. It's a tough film, it has to be, but it's expertly crafted without exploitation tendencies by the director and performed with skill by the two principles. To simply call it sick and disgusting is a cop out, the makers deserve a bit more credit than that. It's intelligent and balanced and does a fine job of provoking reaction from the audience. 8\/10","id":"5464c5db0e0a262942001e3f","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5464c5db0e0a262942001e3f","movie_id":78604}

They even finally figured out that women can be used for more than just a damsel-in-distress, throwaway-set-piece or eye-candy.

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Ain't no grave hold my body down.\r\n\r\nBlackthorn is directed by Mateo Gil and written by Miguel Barros. It stars Sam Shepard, Eduardo Noriega, Stephen Rea, Magaly Solier, Nikolaj Costsr-Waldau, Padraic Delaney and Dominique McElligott. Music is by Lucio Godoy and cinematography by Juan Ruiz Anchia.\r\n\r\nIt was believed that Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid both perished at the hands of the Bolivian army in 1908. Not so, for here is Butch Cassidy 20 years after the supposed event, alive and well and living in a secluded Bolivian village under the name James Blackthorn\u2026\r\n\r\nWhat a lovely idea, that of one of history's most famous outlaws actually living longer than history led us to believe. OK, it's a scratchy premise but it allows for a quite elegiac film as we follow an older and grizzled Cassidy on another adventure. That adventure sees him team up with mischievous Spaniard Eduardo Apodaca, the latter of which tries to rob Blackthorn\/Cassidy and then offers to repay the old outlaw with the proceeds from some hidden loot stashed away from a robbery. They set off and sure enough there is a posse on their tail, meaning the pair have to stay one step ahead of their pursuers, something which puts the twinkle back in Cassidy's eyes. But not all is as it seems and with flash backs showing Butch and Sundance in their prime (Waldau as the young Cassidy is an inspired choice as per likeness to Shepard), aided by the feisty Etta Place, this is a fully rounded tale.\r\n\r\nThe film quite simply is unhurried and respectful to the art of story telling and is rich with a lead characterisation of considerable substance (Shepard is wonderful, really gets to the soul of the character). Oh it is punctured by the odd action scene, even some humour is in the mix, there's even time for machismo and romantic threads of worth, but this beats a melancholy heart and is All the better for it. It also happens to be one of the most gorgeously photographed Westerns of the modern era. Filmed primarily on location in Bolivia, the landscapes \u2013 be it the mountainous ranges or pin sharp salt flats \u2013 are sublime, God's wonderful Earth in all its glory expertly realised by Anchia, marking this out as an absolute Blu-ray essential for Western fans big into location photography. While Godoy's musical score is pitch perfect for the tonal flows in the narrative.\r\n\r\nThere's the odd clich\u00e9, Rea is a touch wasted and some may decry the simplicity of plot, but this is thoughtful and awash with the love of the Western genre. If only for Shepard and the photography then this is worth it for Western fans, as it is it also calls out to those who like some emotional reflection in their Oaters. 8\/10","id":"535c92050e0a264fde0042c9","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/535c92050e0a264fde0042c9","movie_id":68818}

{"author":"John Chard","content":"Fate? Unknown... \r\n\r\nDrive is directed by Nicolas Winding Refn and adapted to screenplay by Hossein Amini from the novel of the same name written by James Sallis. It stars Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Christina Hendricks and Ron Perlman. Music is by Cliff Martinez and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel.\r\n\r\nDriver (Gosling) has a day job, he's a Hollywood stunt man, but by night he makes the serious cash as a getaway driver for the criminal fraternity. Into his life comes married next door neighbour Irene (Mulligan) and her little boy Benicio (Kaden Leos), pitching him right into the middle of two wars; one is for his emotional worth, the other with the criminal underworld.\r\n\r\nReal human being, and a real hero.\r\n\r\nThey cheered at Cannes, it has garnered instant cult classic status as well as gushing critical praise, Drive is arguably the biggest surprise of 2011. Some would debate that it arrived in a year that was dominated by blockbuster brain drains and pretentious parables, meaning it wouldn't take much for something like Drive to find a favourable audience. Yet Drive is a special movie, the surprise being that it delivers a different film to what the plot synopsis suggests. There would have been many disappointed that it didn't turn out to be something akin to The Fast & The Furious 19, but as its reputation grows, one likes to think that many also had their senses tingled unexpectedly by Refn's western done out in 1980s neo noir attire.\r\n\r\nYes, at first glance it looks like a simple story given over to style over substance leanings, where the fact that our laconic protagonist is not prone to dialogue expansion, could lend argumentative weight to those potential dissenters only skimming the surface of the picture. But the material is in excellent hands, with Refn, Sigel, Gosling and co, calmly unravelling Amini's stripped down screenplay to reveal a gritty urban fable that's laced with ethereal overtones. A picture where a look means more than any words can express, a subtle holding of hands reveals many layers peeling, and then the serene state of play often gets punctured by bouts of shocking violence, yet always it remains a picture big on intelligence, beating a mighty heart in the process.\r\n\r\nPropelling the picture forward is the complexity of Gosling's driver character. He has no back story for us to work from, and he gives nothing away outside of the tender bond formed with Irene and child. He is actually one of many purposeful grey areas (or should that be gris areas?) within the plot structure. We learn just enough to be on his side, a noble but flawed hero battling against fate as he fights for the innocent, he be Shane for a modern pot boiling Los Angeles. Helps, too, that he's so cool behind the wheel, where he mines Steve McQueen's effortless charisma. Refn delivers magic moments of car play, from the near ten minute opening getaway extended sequence, to a high speed kill or be killed pursuit, when the action flows it really pumps the adrenalin.\r\n\r\nGosling is amazing, instantly iconic, soft voice matching his soft blue eyes, toothpick perched between teeth, it's a testament to his acting ability that the requisite homages to iconic characters of movies past never veers into parody territory. It's with the calm moments that he triumphs most, be it watching TV with the boy Benicio or just gazing intensely into Irene's eyes, Gosling has a magnetic quality of some significance. Mulligan, too, is wonderful, deftly underplaying Irene to work off of Gosling to create heart aching tenderness, their chemistry superb. Isaac does fine work with the ex-con\/husband character that is thankfully not stereotypical, Brooks is Colm Meaney like, thriving on simmering badness, while Cranston puts real heart into the role of Driver's garage boss, the closest thing the Driver has to a pal. The only one dimensional character lands in Perlman's court, but Perlman is such an ebullient and watchable life force the film survives the character's oafness.\r\n\r\nFrom the opening pink neon credits, accompanied by the synth plink of a retro 80s soundtrack (a soundtrack so memorable it lands in the ears and stays there for days), it's evident that Refn is a man who takes his style serious. Drive is full of classy (yes arty) passages, fluid camera movements, single takes, non central framing of characters, slow motion unfurls and eye dazzling chopper shots of a neon lighted L.A., the director has an eye for the quality required to cloak his story. He of course is aided considerably by his editor Matthew Newman, and Sigel's photography. The former is dealing in seamless precision, the latter a master of shades (a lift sequence is to, ahem, die for) and colour toning delights. Marking this out as a Blu-ray essential.\r\n\r\nYou can name about ten films that Drive has been either likened too or put forward as an influence, and Refn's work here has been touted as an offspring created by Michael Mann, Walter Hill, William Friedkin and Sergio Leone (all viable and all actually high praise indeed). But rest assured, Drive is still fresh and exciting, the perfect movie package. Refn's masterpiece and one of the best films of 2011. 10\/10","id":"5c5bb116925141337cb95e9a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c5bb116925141337cb95e9a","movie_id":64690}

My only contribution to any conversation about the sport is that I support The Cleveland Indians because of the film Major League, a film that continues to make me laugh to this day.\r\n\r\nI was intrigued by Moneyball, synopsis tantalisingly offering up a sports success story based on an improbable blend of maths (something I hate with a passion), guile and perceived misfits as a team. Sure enough, after viewing Moneyball it has landed joyously onto a personal favourites list.\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, when digging into the actual facts of the Oakland Athletics 2002 season at the core of the story, I found truths stretched, some character portrayals toyed with, and omissions to round out a better story. But crucially, the key element here is the moulding of a team for what in Baseball parlance is financial peanuts. This makes their 20 game wining run as being an outstanding achievement.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical aspects of the story are easily explained via the interactions of General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and his economics right hand man Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). Baseball operations behind the scenes are given fascinating clarity via the tremendous screenplay (Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin). And ultimately the blend of on field action, family relationships and team assembling flows beautifully as one.\r\n\r\nIn turn punch the air brilliant with heart tugging worth, and brainy into the bargain, Moneyball most certainly a film non Baseball fans can watch and maybe love for bringing something new to the sports movie table. 9\/10","id":"5c04fe230e0a26486607d175","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5c04fe230e0a26486607d175","movie_id":60308}

{"author":"Gimly","content":"I'm always on the lookout for the Slasher of the New Age. Don't get me wrong, I love Jason Voorhees and his ilk, but I'm keen to give others a chance to try and join those ranks with an original character. Unfortunately it never quite seems to work out. _Madison County_'s Damion Yule doesn\u2019t buck that trend.\r\n\r\nThere's some decent individual moments, and I appreciate that the movie took its time to develop, but the quality was too low and the story too unexplored to merit a recommendation.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._","id":"57df91f99251416c1f00571a","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/57df91f99251416c1f00571a","movie_id":77785}
{"author":"DoryDarko","content":"Bernie is a really fun and enjoyable dark comedy, starring Jack Black and Shirley MacLaine. This is actually the true story of what happened between a purely good man and a purely evil woman.\r\n\r\nJack Black plays Bernie Tiede, an assistant undertaker in the small town of Carthage, Texas. He is loved by everybody for his pure-hearted character, his sympathy for every person he comes across and his willingness to help everyone who needs it in any way, shape or form. He's just such a good guy, you almost wouldn't believe it if not for the fact that this character is based on an actual person.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's Marjorie Nugent, played by Shirley MacLaine. She is his polar opposite, as hated as Bernie is loved. She is the widow of some rich oil baron, and she is just the most mean and spiteful woman you could ever fear to meet. Everyone in town absolutely hates her guts, and there's no one who would be sorry to see her go...\r\n\r\nThen comes the day when these two people meet and \u2013 all due to Bernie's good nature \u2013 form an unlikely friendship. Until about two years later when Marjorie's true personality rears its ugly head and even Bernie can't stand her abuse any longer, when he is reduced to her personal slave and whipping boy. And what no one believed possible, happens... He kills her. (don't worry, that's not a spoiler, that's the story line.) What follows is the strange lengths Bernie attempts to go to, in order to cover up his crime.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this film work so well is mostly the subtle humour of it. Director Richard Linklater thankfully didn't choose to make this into the hysterical, caricature of a comedy it easily could have been. Something that really adds to the authenticity of the film is the use of actual Carthage townsfolk, providing commentary on the events in documentary-like interview scenes. This really is a perfect move on the director's part, because it makes the 'acting' completely real and spontaneous.\r\n\r\nI really like Jack Black, but in this case, I'm somewhat glad he left his crazy mannerisms and facial expressions at the door, in order to just play this character true-to-form. He actually acts, rather than just playing another silly, typical \"Jack Black character\".\r\n\r\nI always love watching Shirley MacLaine in a mean and vile role such as this one, and in 'Bernie', she plays it to a T once again. Imagine her character in 'Steel Magnolia's' and then multiply it by ten. That's what you get here and it's an absolute joy to watch.\r\n\r\nMatthew McConaughey plays the county sheriff, dead-set on burning Bernie for his crime. I'm usually not too fond of him, but his role in 'Bernie' is pretty funny and he plays it well. He seems to be the only person in town who thinks it's bad what happened to Marjorie. That's another really funny aspect to this story \u2013 the fact that everybody involved just loves Bernie so much and really hates Marjorie to the bone, that they all seem to take his side in the matter. You might feel like I'm just throwing spoilers at you here, but pretty much the whole story is told in hindsight and flashbacks, so there are no real secretes or mysteries unveiled. Then what's the point of watching, you might ask, if I already know everything that's going to happen from the get-go? The point is the enjoyment you'll get from watching these events unfold.\r\n\r\nThe actors are all really well cast, and they play their roles with a certain flair that makes them instantly likable. The dialogue is clever and witty, and like I mentioned earlier, the combination of event re-enactment and documentary-like interviews, is a winning ticket and 'Bernie's' major selling point. The story is well constructed, as is the chronology of how it unfolds. Basically, it's just very well-made, and it definitely would have deserved a little more credit. But then again, this film also kind of has a \"small budget\/small audience\" feel to it, so that might explain why it practically went unnoticed at the box office. It's just a shame that charming little comedies like 'Bernie' always get overlooked when stuff like 'The Hangover' and the like get multi-million dollar appraisal. All I can hope for is that 'Bernie' gathers its own DVD-fan base, because it's certainly worth it.\r\n\r\nWatch this film if you're in the mood a darkly hilarious comedy that has its heart in the right place. Oh, and stick around for the credits, where you can see pictures of the actual Bernie and Marjorie, and footage of Bernie and Jack Black talking, which is a fun addition.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a highly recommended film!\r\n_(October 2012)_","id":"58a9b7fc92514173f2009365","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58a9b7fc92514173f2009365","movie_id":92591}

{"author":"EmkEyen","content":"While not very original and quite predictable and having a very high contrast not only in post processing but also in characters, the narrative is still quite convincing and the acting is passable too. Possibly as a budget restraint, the lack of cinematic mattes and ambitious sets add to the realistic feel. The use of overexposed lights as blacked out darkness is a clever move. Overall it is a good post apocalyptic movie experience if you keep yourself from analyzing as it goes along.","id":"5a6911109251414a1f006ac4","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a6911109251414a1f006ac4","movie_id":73262}

{"author":"Reno","content":"**Nabbing a few bad fellows along while saying goodbye to the world.**\r\n\r\nWell, I did not expect it to be this good, even after knowing it was praised by many. From the writer, director of 'World's Greatest Dad'. Another black comedy and this even better. About an ordinary middle aged divorc\u00e9e who hates everything around him, but could not do anything about it. One day when he got fired from his job, followed by discovering he has a tumor, he thinks to put an end his life right away. But then decides to do cleanup the society before his time comes up. Hence begins the path of violence, later a young woman joins him and how long it all goes was briefed.\r\n\r\nSeems very familiar, but still worked so good. It's not your 'Bonnie and Clyde' or 'Pretty Poison'. In fact, you can drag as many titles as you can, but still it is quite simple and entertaining. Obviously predictable, including the main twist and several scenes, but the rhythm of the narration was great, keeps us hooked to it for the way it was filmed. It's not about the moral science. It is pretty much a confused or misunderstood situation based theme, especially the conclusion clears out that. So if you don't care anything about those things, particularly in a film, then it is for you.\r\n\r\nUnfamiliar faces, but they both in the lead were excellent. The same film with some popular stars would have made a better headline and collection. Not seen quite a nice B film like this in the recent time. I got what I wanted from a film. Especially for a small film like this its exemption in a few areas due to the tight budget, but this film did not have any trouble, just amazing. Yeah, a well made film, from writing to direction, performances, this is a decent hidden gem of its kind.\r\n\r\n_7\/10_","id":"58c1e8e09251417ada00023c","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/58c1e8e09251417ada00023c","movie_id":74306}

Nicholas Cage is going a very , very bad road, his lasts movies , ''season of the witch'' and ''drive angry'' were as thin and dreadful as this one. The action in this movie was unjustified and plain crazy bad, the way ''Blaze'' was written, the laughable dialogues and dumb facial expression of Cage didn't helped at all. The 3D effect on this movie is overrated, everything is too much and fake. Idris Elba was probably the only reason why i went to watch this but even then his role was thin and futile, On the whole, it's messy , funny and plain bad, i pray to god there is not a third one","id":"5805ccbd9251415a54001a42","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5805ccbd9251415a54001a42","movie_id":71676}
{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","content":"Christ what kind of bum did they get to write and\/or produce this one.\r\n\r\nI really, really liked the first Ghost Rider movie. This one is nowhere near that one. Sure, Nicolas Cage is doing Johnny Blaze again and they even got Christopher Lambert to play an old priest but the movie is just poorly implemented. The Ghost Rider is actually not really appearing that much and when he does, the special effects look cheap and not at all as cool as in the first movie.\r\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t help that, when he first appears in the movie, he gets shot down by a simple \u201chuman\u201d gun and ends up in hospital. This nonsense about, first trying to hide out in some obscure place a \u2019la The Hulk (been there done that), and then trying to get rid of his powers and afterwards taking on Satan without them is just ruining the fun. The film totally lacks the spirit of the first one.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I\u2019m rather disappointed. It\u2019s really a shame that they screwed this one so badly because now we probably won\u2019t get another one even though they made a lame attempt at the end of the film to leave a door open for that.","id":"5a7dcbf8c3a36817b5000b79","url":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/review\/5a7dcbf8c3a36817b5000b79","movie_id":71676}
